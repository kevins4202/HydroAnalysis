21360,the paper evaluates the response of an aluminium stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft under bow flare slamming loads by using three finite element methods 1 a linear static analysis to calculate the structural elastic deformation and stress under the design load 2 an independent analysis of the slamming load and the elastic structural response a decoupled method 3 a method that couples their interaction a fully coupled method these methods are compared to analyse the hydroelastic effect when predicting the structural loading and response similar results are obtained by the three methods and the linear static analysis based on design load evaluates with accuracy the local structural deformation and stress the primary objective of the present work is to investigate the strength and safety of bow flared structures when designing high speed and fast displacement aluminium crafts subjected to slamming pressure loads the influence of spray rail on the bow flared slamming pressures and the effect of boundary conditions on the elastic structural responses are discussed keywords bow flare slamming hydroelastic analysis stiffened panel aluminium alloy high speed craft fast displacement craft 1 introduction when a ship sails under severe sea conditions the response of the structure to slamming is significant due to the large vertical relative motions between the ship and the water surface the slamming phenomenon is also observed in small and medium sized high speed and fast displacement crafts these crafts are likely to suffer large elastic deformations and stresses since they are built in lightweight materials as aluminium high forward speed of vessels and rough sea states usually lead to severe water impacts at the bow region in conventional numerical methods the wave induced loads and the respective structural response are analysed separately for example guedes soares 1989 estimated the wave induced forces on ship hulls by the rate of change in momentum of the fluid and analysed the associated transient responses nowadays the analysis of transient structural responses is done by the finite element method fem and the analysis of wave induced loads is often performed by two dimensional 2d rigid sections impacting with water for example wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 and wang et al 2014 predicted the slam induced loads on 2d wedges and bow flared sections by using an explicit finite element method based on the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale solver this method can be also extended to predict the slamming pressures on three dimensional 3d rigid structures entering into the water luo et al 2012 wang and guedes soares 2014b the influence of the shape of the bow flare on the vertical response of ships has been addressed by rajendran et al 2016 several other approaches have been adopted in the past as described in luo and guedes soares 2012 and wang and guedes soares 2017b recently xie et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 studied experimentally the water entry of bow flare models assessing the slamming pressures and xie et al 2019 analysed the hydroelastic impact of one segment of a hull structure entering into water using an uncoupled cfd fem solution cfd is computational fluid dynamics the hydroelastic behaviour of a ship was evaluated by takami et al 2018 where the pressure values on the rigid hull derived from cfd were directly applied to the fe model tuitman et al 2013 studied the short term distribution of the stresses on a ship using bem fem method bem is boundary element method where the slamming pressures computed using the 2d sections were projected onto the sections of the 3d ship structure dhavalikar et al 2018 presented an empirical formulation for slamming loads with due consideration by the geometry of the vessel seakeeping characteristics and probability of slamming for various types of displacement vessels wang and guedes soares 2016a 2016b investigated the slamming induced loads and occurrences on the bow and stern of a chemical tanker advancing in irregular waves by using a partially nonlinear strip theory for seakeeping calculations and an ale solver for predicting the 2d ship section slamming pressures generally the assumption of 2d or 3d rigid body neglects the effect of elastic vibrations on the hydrodynamic pressure and the derived slamming loads are applied to analyse the transient structural responses omitting the effect of water on the structural vibration period the hydrodynamic impact and elastic response problems can be coupled to better analyse the ship hull loads and responses due to slamming this is because the elastic structural response interacts with the slamming pressure on the structure affecting the elastic stress distribution on the structure the local hydroelastic effect on slamming problems has been under considerable attention since 1990s due to the development of high speed vessels therefore kvalsvold and faltinsen 1995 and faltinsen 1997 used numerical experimental and theoretical methods to analyse the hydroelastic slamming of steel and aluminium plates a considerable amount of work on the slamming problem has been performed using various numerical approaches for example lu et al 2000 conducted a fully coupled analysis of the elastic wedges impacting with water the fluid flow was solved by the boundary element method bem together with the fully nonlinear free surface condition while the structural response was analysed based on linear elastic theory using the fem another application of a coupled bem fem method was presented by datta and guedes soares 2020 using a 3d transient green s function formulation luo et al 2010 wang and guedes soares 2014a and wang et al 2016 studied fully coupled simulations of 3d elastic structures entering into water by using an explicit finite element method where a fully coupled ale fem method was used to simulate the fluid structure coupling problem the deformation of the plate and the water was coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure of the water on the plate and it was found that the local dynamic hydroelastic effects are significant when the angle between the water and structural surfaces is small and the impact velocity is high the hydroelastic effect has been investigated in the slamming problems of high speed crafts for example stenius et al 2011 zamanirad et al 2016 mesa 2018 sun and wang 2018 sun et al 2019 and yu et al 2019 in these investigations the ship cross sections were simplified as wedge shapes and the hydroelastic analyses were performed on the water impacts of elastic wedges with stiffened panels and it was found that the structural responses are affected by the fluid structure interaction and the oscillatory response after flow separation the mesh size of the structure and the fluids in impact domain is of most significance the fine mesh e g 5 mm can be selected to analyse the scaled model impacting with water which structural dimension is in the order of 0 5 m however the coarse mesh e g 50 mm has to be selected for analysing the full scale ship structures 5 m due to the computation time needed for hydroelastic analyses moreover the extent of the fe model is to be limited in order to control the number of elements the present simplification modelling only the structures between web frames maximises the effect of boundary conditions on the elastic response slamming impact problems are relevant for high speed and fast displacement aluminium vessels although the impact characteristics of unwelded aluminium alloy materials are similar to the ones of steel materials the yield stress and the ultimate tensile strength of welded aluminium alloy materials decrease because of the effect of the heated affected zone haz paik et al 2006 liu et al 2014 2015 2020 the material degradation affects considerably the ship structural strength both locally and globally especially under the slamming induced hydrodynamic impact loads khedmati and pedram 2014 cerik 2017 liu et al 2019 the present paper investigates the response of an aluminium stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft length 80 m operating in the displacement mode under bow flare slamming loading the study is done by means of three finite element methods 1 a linear static analysis to calculate the structural elastic deformation and stress under the prescriptive design load 2 a hydrodynamic analysis to calculate the slamming loads on a rigid bow flared section of the craft and an elastic dynamic analysis to calculate the elastic deformation and stress of the stiffened panel under the previously computed slamming loads a decoupled method 3 a hydroelastic analysis to calculate the slamming loads elastic deformation and stress using the fully coupled ale fem method for reference the ale method is summarised in section 2 the results of the three methods are compared to evaluate the hydroelastic effect when predicting the structural loading and response of bow flared sections the spray rail is often designed to provide protection from water spray this design induces larger upward vertical force when the ship bow moves downwards due to slamming providing better sailing attitude while the spray sail brings advantages attention is to be paid on the local slamming load and response and the structural details the main objective of the paper is to provide insights to evaluate the elastic deformation and stress of aluminium stiffened plates under bow flare slamming loadings with a design assessment application of high speed and fast displacement aluminium crafts where a craft has pronounced flare or rake of bow the structure in the forward region will be subjected to special considerations and the scantlings and arrangements may require additional strengthening against bow flare slamming for determination of hull girder loads of crafts under 90 m the bow flare area is considered in the bow region of the hull forward of 0 8l from the aft perpendicular and from the design draught waterline up to a waterline 0 5 0 0412 l 4 above the design waterline this concept is illustrated in fig 1 and is used here for the analysis of the present 80 m fast displacement craft also here a strip between two web frames denoted as bow flared section at approximately 0 9 l is used for the calculations analyses the discussion is concentrated on the effect of the spray rail as well as the influence of the end restraints of the longitudinals 2 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale algorithm in ale formulation a reference coordinate is induced which is neither the lagrangian coordinate nor the eulerian coordinate the differential quotient for the material with respect to the reference coordinate is described as 1 f x t t f x t t w f x t x where x is the lagrangian coordinate x is the eulerian coordinate and w is the relative velocity between the particle velocity v and the velocity of the reference coordinate u the ale formulation can be derived from the relation between the time derivative of material and that of the reference geometry configuration the fluid domain is represented by ω f r 3 and ω f represents the fluid boundary the equation of mass momentum and energy conservation for a newtonian fluid in the ale formulation of the reference domain are given by 2 ρ t ρ d i v w w g r a d ρ 3 σ v t d i v σ f ρ w g r a d v 4 ρ e t σ g r a d v f v ρ w g r a d e where ρ is the fluid density and f is the body force the total cauchy stress σ is of the form 5 σ p i d u g r a d v g r a d v t where p is the pressure and u is the dynamic viscosity the part of the boundary at which the velocity is assumed to be specified is denoted by ω 1 f and in the inflow boundary condition is given by 6 v g t on ω 1 f the lagrange euler coupling algorithm adopted in the numerical solution uses a penalty based formulation which can generate high frequency oscillations due to the nearly incompressible nature of the fluid this is an explicit finite element method and is unconditionally stable to ensure the computational stability and accuracy it is required a careful selection of the related numerical parameters 3 description of the stiffened plate in the bow flare area the stiffened plate is selected from the bow flare area of a fast displacement aluminium craft of 80 m length the craft principal dimensions are listed in table 1 and a sketch of the craft profile and the bow flare cross section at 10 m from the forward perpendicular is given in fig 2 the length of the stiffened plate is 1200 mm frame spacing and it is restrained at the main deck and at the lower deck the plate thickness is 8 0 mm and the stiffeners are flat bars 120 10 mm the thickness of the spray rail is 12 0 mm the slamming analysis is limited to the stiffened plate level i e it has been considered that the primary supporting members do not suffer deformation this assumption agrees with the sequence of deformation of grillages under impulsive pressures i e first the plating and then the stiffened plate deforms between the web frames and stringers and eventually these primary members might undertake bending deformation note that for short impulsively loadings the primary members are not expected to deform spray rails are commonly fitted on fast displacement crafts since they provide additional lift in the forward part of the hull improve the resistance above certain speeds and decrease the wetted surface area of the hull by breaking the spray sheet of the bow wave apart from those hydrodynamic advantages from a practical point of view spray rails keep the deck dryer and avoid spray to sweep over the deck in beam winds for the slamming analysis the spray rail plays a key role since the impact load is concentrated on the stiffened plate below the spray rail implying that the spray rail breaks the impact and consequently is subjected to a high pressure the effect of spray rail will be discussed in section 8 4 linear static analysis the design pressure is estimated using the lloyd s register rules and regulations for the classification of special service craft lr 2019a the plating design pressure at the scantling draft is estimated at 140 kn m2 the msc nastran finite element solver is used to evaluate the linear static strength of the stiffened plate the four edges of the plate and the ends of the stiffeners are fully restrained as it has been considered that the primary supporting members do not suffer bending deformations the plate surface is loaded by the static pressure of 140 kn m2 the mesh size of the shell elements is about 50 mm six elements between the longitudinals the mechanical properties of the aluminium are mass density 2700 kg m3 young s modulus 72 000 mpa and poisson s ratio 0 33 5 dynamic analysis decoupled approach the decoupled method evaluates separately the slamming load and the structural response 1 the slamming pressures are first estimated using the ale algorithm which is based on the rigid body assumption and 2 the structural response is computed separately using the fem for both cases the computation are carried out using the explicit finite element package ls dyna version 971 hallquist 2006 5 1 slamming loads hydrodynamic analysis the hydrodynamic analysis of slamming induced loads uses the approach based on the ale algorithm reported by wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 to estimate the water impact loads on 2d rigid sections the definitions adopted here are briefly explained next the finite element modelling of the symmetric water entry of a 2d bow flared section is shown in fig 3 only half of the system is modelled defining symmetrical constraints the cross section drops vertically into the calm water with a constant velocity of 9 5 m s the slamming velocity v s is estimated using eq 7 obtained from the rules and regulations for the classification of naval ships naval ship rules where the bottom impact pressure ip i is considered as the design pressure 140 kn m2 and the deadrise angle β p is approximated at 45 7 i p i 0 5 π tan β p v s 2 kn m 2 the relative vertical impact velocity of the craft water entry is assumed as constant instead of defining an initial vertical impact velocity to present a conservative approach for ship structures under impact pressure loads the size of the water domain is limited to a width of 19 m and a height of 32 m while the air domain is 19 m width and 9 5 m height the size of the water domain is five times the size of the bow flare section the x axis is located at the calm water surface and the y axis is placed at the vertical line which coincides with the centre line of the bow flare section the z axis is along the length and thus represents the 3d direction of the model since only the 2d water impact is investigated the length of the model in z axis is set as one element of length 50 mm the displacement in the z direction of all nodes is fixed the boundaries of the fluids are defined as non reflecting which are used on the exterior boundaries of an analysis model of an infinite domain such as a half space to prevent artificial stress wave reflections generated at the model boundaries part of the mesh is shown in fig 4 to illustrate the meshing around the impact domain the impact domain is uniformly meshed and then the meshing is moderately expanded towards the boundaries the mesh size at the uniform domain area and at the bow flare section is 50 mm the numerical model consists of 167 924 nodes and 83 570 elements the fluids water and air are modelled with solid elements section solid ale and are defined as void materials mat null i e they do not have yield strength and behave as a fluid like manner the void material allows the equations of state to be considered without computing deviatoric stresses the gruneisen equation of state is used for the water domain and the linear polynomial equation of state is applied for the air domain the main parameters used in the equations of states are listed in table 2 wang et al 2014 the bow flared section is modelled using shell elements section shell defining a rigid material mat rigid 5 2 structural response under the slamming loads the elastic structural response decouples from the hydrodynamic analysis of the slamming load for the analysis the same model shown in fig 2c is used the slamming pressure time data obtained from the hydrodynamic analysis section 5 1 is the loading input the dynamic pressure time curves is applied at the spray rail and the stiffened plate below and distributed uniformly along the length defined by the frame spacing 1 2 m the elastic structural deformation and stress are then analysed although the slamming response is a dynamic phenomenon the material strain rate sensitivity is not considered in the elastic response analysis the material strain rate effect only presents higher yield and flow stresses of the material not changing young s modulus and poisson s ratio jones 1989 liu and guedes soares 2019 note that it has been demonstrated that the strain rate effect of the aluminium alloy under low velocity impact is negligible jones 1989 if the elasto plastic response is analysed under extreme slamming loads the material strain rate effect might be considered for example yang and wang 2018 6 hydroelastic analysis coupled approach the hydroelastic analysis reflects the coupling effect between the fluid and the structure 1 the influence of structural deformation on the flow field and 2 the influence of added mass and damp of the flow field on the structural response yu et al 2019 here hydroelastic slamming impact is simulated using the explicit finite element package ls dyna version 971 with a double precision solver the fully coupled analysis method has been validated by the analytical and numerical analyses of the slamming responses of plates as reported in wang et al 2016 and wang and guedes soares 2017a in the coupled analysis the deformations of the stiffened plate and of the water are coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure exerted by water on the hull and the velocity of particles on the wetted surface affecting deformations of the water the continuity of surface tractions and the inter penetrability of water into the hull are satisfied by using a penalty method which was explained by aquelet et al 2006 a 3d numerical model is used to evaluate the fluid structure interaction considering hydroelasticity effect see fig 5 a this model is expanded from the 2d numerical model described in section 5 1 and has an extension of 1 3 m in z axis direction with a mesh size of 50 50 mm the numerical model consists of 2 267 595 nodes and 2 173 418 elements in the 3d model most of the numerical definitions are the same as the ones in the 2d model such as the geometries in the xy plane the meshing the symmetrical constraint at the vertical centreline of the body etc the displacements in the z axis direction of all nodes of the cross sections at both ends are fixed thus the fluids are possible to flow between the two end sections the slamming problem is idealised as a deformable stiffened panel within a 3d structural model see fig 5b since a local slamming impact of the stiffened plate is evaluated the deformable stiffened plate is embedded in the rigid 3d bow flared structure with an extension of 1 3 m 1 2 m 2 50 mm in z axis direction the embedded stiffened panel 1 2 m has the same geometrical and material definitions with the elastic model described in section 5 2 see fig 2b the one element extensions 50 mm are created at both ends with a rigid material also the remaining structures including the side structure below the lower deck and the main deck structure are modelled with a rigid material these rigid structures provide the fully clamped conditions for the deformable stiffened plate for the rigid structures only a translational movement along the y axis direction is released and a constant dropping velocity of 9 5 m s is defined it should be mentioned that the constant dropping velocity is not defined to the deformable stiffened panel so that the panel can deform freely when impacting with the water only an initial velocity of 9 5 m s is defined to the deformable panel in order to avoid an unacceptable acceleration at the beginning of the simulation the bow flared 3d structure is modelled using shell elements section shell with rigid mat rigid and elastic mat elastic materials the rigid elastic structural model is generated satisfying both the geometrical description of bow flared section and the scantling definition of stiffened panel structure in the finite element simulations described in sections 4 to 6 the convergence study on the mesh density is not discussed taking the computational time into consideration for the slamming analysis of actual ships it is very time consuming to perform the hydroelastic analysis using one span finite element model although the mesh size of 50 mm is still relatively coarse this mesh cannot be refined due to practicalities computing power time in the hydroelastic analysis of rectangular plates subjected to slamming loads the fe model using the mesh of 50 mm predicts lower slamming pressures about 15 than that using the mesh of 5 mm wang and guedes soares 2017a this discrepancy shows the degree of accuracy in the present study for comparative study the simulations described in sections 5 and 6 select the same mesh size 50 mm for the finite element models 7 results the three sets of finite element results linear static dynamic and hydroelastic analysis are presented herein to evaluate the hydrodynamic impact response and the structural response of the stiffened plate the results are compared in table 3 and particular details are given next 7 1 slamming pressure the design pressure of 140 kn m2 should be considered as the baseline to compare the pressures obtained from the decoupled and the coupled method the maximum slamming pressures from the decoupled approach are presented in fig 6 the maximum instantaneous pressure occurs at the surrounding of the spray rail at the time of 0 34 s the maximum pressures around the spray rail can be seen in fig 6a and the corresponding pressure contour is plotted together with the free surface elevations in fig 6b the pressure histories of two points at the intersection of the spray rail and the lower stiffened plate are plotted in fig 6c the slamming pressure increases rapidly when the water impacts on the spray rail the maximum instantaneous pressure reaches 220 kn m2 which is about 1 6 times the design pressure of 140 kn m2 afterwards the impulsive pressure decreases gradually when the spray rail is immersed totally in the water because the water separates from the body the peak pressure on p4 is higher than the one on p2 because the plate is relatively flat on the location of p4 this is consistent with our previous studies which have indicated that the slamming pressure is higher when the deadrise angle is smaller in fig 6b an air pocket is formed at the lower part of the section due to the curvature on the body and the air compressibility in the ale solver the similar air pocket was also predicted in wang and guedes soares 2013 for the water entry of a bow flared section at a relatively high speed a comparison of the pressure distribution at the spray rail for the 3d hydroelastic model and the 2d model is presented in fig 7 note that for the hydroelastic model the plate deforms during the water impact the maximum pressure increases in hydroelastic model when compared with the rigid one due to that local deformation of the plate as seen in fig 7 the local deadrise angle increases due to the deformation leading to the increase on the pressure the pressure distribution is similar for both the decoupled and coupled approaches since the spray rail is relatively thick 12 0 mm when compared with its width higher plate thickness shows lower hydroelasticity effect 7 2 elastic stress the yield stresses 0 2 proof stress of unwelded and welded 5083 h116 aluminium alloy materials are 215 mpa and 125 mpa respectively see table 4 for structural design the properties of the welded material are used the nominal limiting stress requirements for plating and primary and secondary stiffening members subjected to local loading conditions are given in terms of limiting stress coefficients lr 2019a these coefficients are expressed as a portion of the 0 2 proof stress of the material for the bottom and side shell plating in the slamming zone the coefficient for bending is 0 85 limiting stress 106 mpa for the secondary stiffening in the slamming zone the coefficient for bending is 0 75 limiting stress 94 mpa for all components in the slamming zone the coefficient for shear is 0 75 limiting stress 54 mpa the elastic stresses computed by the three finite element methods are smaller than the limiting stress see table 3 the maximum bending stresses calculated by the dynamic analysis section 5 2 is slightly smaller than that of the linear static analysis but it shows larger maximum shear stress the hydroelastic analysis sections 6 presents both larger maximum bending and shear stresses than the ones from linear static analysis the plots of maximum bending and shear stresses are presented in fig 8 the maximum stresses occur at 0 41s and 0 34 s for the dynamic and the hydroelastic analysis respectively the maximum bending and shear stresses at the longitudinals ends are given in fig 9 time duration from 0 20 s to 0 45 s the first peak stress at 0 34 s corresponds to the maximum slamming pressures while the second peak stress at 0 41 s is due to the continuous loadings on the stiffened plate for all three finite element calculations the maximum stresses occur at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners see fig 8 areas which are prone to be affected by the heat affected zone and consequently those areas require further analysis see section 8 2 7 3 structural deformation the results of the structural deformation maximum deflections are presented in table 3 and fig 10 the maximum deflection occurs at the plating element between longitudinals at the mid span of the stiffened plate below the spray rail at the time 0 41 s the maximum deflection is delayed by some amount of time depending on the duration of the slamming loads the coupling effect between the fluid and the structure induces larger structural deformation and stresses during the water impact the dynamic and the hydroelastic analyses give the smallest and the largest deformations respectively hydroelastic static dynamic analysis however the results are relatively close demonstrating that the linear static analysis based on design load can well evaluate the local structural deformation of the ship under slamming loads 7 4 comments on comparison of results three sets of finite element analyses have been compared comprehensively using slamming load structural stress and deformation similar results are obtained by these methods and the linear static analysis based on design loads can evaluate approximately the local structural deformation and stress however some results are underestimated see table 3 this indicates that the slamming impact pressure analysed by eq 7 should be carefully used in the design of bow flared structures with the spray rail accounting for the structural safety margin an underestimated slamming pressure might lead to damage of the structures under a harsh cyclic operational conditions 8 discussion for the present slamming phenomenon the influence of the spray rail and the ends of the longitudinals will be discussed herein 8 1 influence of the spray rail on the slamming pressures while spray rails are commonly fitted for improving hydrodynamics of fast displacement crafts the analysis here is done from a strength point of view only since the slamming pressures can be strongly affected by the angle size of the spray rail here the spray rail has been considered as horizontal and the resulting slamming pressures are presented in fig 11 it is observed that the horizontal spray rail results in smaller slamming pressures during the water impact in particular at the spray rail itself fig 11b since the flow of the water is not trapped as occurred in the sloped spray rail the effect on the lower stiffened plate is considered to be minimum fig 11a one of the clear advantages of the spray rail is that decreases the wetted surface area of the hull by breaking the spray sheet of the bow wave thus the area of the hull subjected to the slamming pressure increases if the spray rail is not fitted the effect of the omission of the spray rail is shown in fig 12 it is observed that the slamming pressure is considerably smaller when the spray rail is not fitted one of the reasons is that the local deadrise angle becomes larger for the fitted spray rail it is also seen that the bow flare slamming pressure signal is of longer duration these two curves are typically two component domination cases in slamming pressures as indicated in wang and guedes soares 2016a the total slamming load was a sum of an impulsive component characterised by a large peak with a small duration and a second component given by the rate of change of the hydrodynamic momentum for the original spay rail the slamming pressure is dominated by the first component due to the flat geometry while for the fitted one the result is dominated by the hydrodynamic momentum due to the big flare the spray rail is designed with thicker plate than the adjacent shell plating 12 0 mm versus 8 0 mm and this strengthening eliminates the stress concentration at the spray rail it is demonstrated numerically comparing with one more simulation using the same thickness 8 0 mm the plate thickness affects significantly the elastic deformation and stress in the structure its influence on slamming load however is relatively small due to the small magnitude of the elastic deformation 8 2 influence of boundary conditions due to the limitation of computing capability it is unpractical to use finite element models representing a large part of the craft for the hydroelastic analysis here the influence of the boundary conditions is evaluated by the dynamic analysis only see section 5 2 a three span structural model is modelled including the web frames as shown in fig 13 the response of stiffened plate between the web frames is compared with that of the one span structural model the maximum stresses are also found at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners connection with the web frames the comparison of the stress response is given in fig 14 locations 1 and 2 are the same used in fig 9 the results are quite similar transmitting that the web frames are strong enough to represent the fully clamped conditions and thus the one span panel model can be used to analyse the local structural responses under slamming loads it should be mentioned that in the present case the flat bars are welded at both sides to the web frames and for that reason they satisfy the fully fixed condition however commonly only one side of the secondary members is welded since they cross the webs through cut outs and in that case the end fixity is considered to be partial it should be also mentioned that lug connections are required at the cut outs for the passage of secondary members through the webs of primary members in areas subjected to impact pressures if the area of the weld is less than shear area 9 conclusions the response of an aluminium alloy stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft due to bow flare slamming has been assessed by three finite element methods investigating the slamming pressures structural stresses and deformations it is found that the maximum stresses occur at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners passing through the web frames an area commonly affected by the welding of thin aluminium structures haz in aluminium welds and thus attention should be paid to the fatigue assessment of such hotspots and to the local plastic failure under extreme slamming loads through the comparison of three numerical analyses it is found that the ship design based on prescriptive rules manages to evaluate with accuracy the slamming responses of bow flared structures the comparisons present that the safety margin is not large for the bow flared structures the design of the spray rail causes that the vessel suffers much larger slamming pressures during water impact in the slamming analyses the transit slamming pressures are much larger than the design loads although it does not overestimate the local stresses and deformations the slamming problems are still critical for the

21360,the paper evaluates the response of an aluminium stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft under bow flare slamming loads by using three finite element methods 1 a linear static analysis to calculate the structural elastic deformation and stress under the design load 2 an independent analysis of the slamming load and the elastic structural response a decoupled method 3 a method that couples their interaction a fully coupled method these methods are compared to analyse the hydroelastic effect when predicting the structural loading and response similar results are obtained by the three methods and the linear static analysis based on design load evaluates with accuracy the local structural deformation and stress the primary objective of the present work is to investigate the strength and safety of bow flared structures when designing high speed and fast displacement aluminium crafts subjected to slamming pressure loads the influence of spray rail on the bow flared slamming pressures and the effect of boundary conditions on the elastic structural responses are discussed keywords bow flare slamming hydroelastic analysis stiffened panel aluminium alloy high speed craft fast displacement craft 1 introduction when a ship sails under severe sea conditions the response of the structure to slamming is significant due to the large vertical relative motions between the ship and the water surface the slamming phenomenon is also observed in small and medium sized high speed and fast displacement crafts these crafts are likely to suffer large elastic deformations and stresses since they are built in lightweight materials as aluminium high forward speed of vessels and rough sea states usually lead to severe water impacts at the bow region in conventional numerical methods the wave induced loads and the respective structural response are analysed separately for example guedes soares 1989 estimated the wave induced forces on ship hulls by the rate of change in momentum of the fluid and analysed the associated transient responses nowadays the analysis of transient structural responses is done by the finite element method fem and the analysis of wave induced loads is often performed by two dimensional 2d rigid sections impacting with water for example wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 and wang et al 2014 predicted the slam induced loads on 2d wedges and bow flared sections by using an explicit finite element method based on the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale solver this method can be also extended to predict the slamming pressures on three dimensional 3d rigid structures entering into the water luo et al 2012 wang and guedes soares 2014b the influence of the shape of the bow flare on the vertical response of ships has been addressed by rajendran et al 2016 several other approaches have been adopted in the past as described in luo and guedes soares 2012 and wang and guedes soares 2017b recently xie et al 2018 and wang et al 2020 studied experimentally the water entry of bow flare models assessing the slamming pressures and xie et al 2019 analysed the hydroelastic impact of one segment of a hull structure entering into water using an uncoupled cfd fem solution cfd is computational fluid dynamics the hydroelastic behaviour of a ship was evaluated by takami et al 2018 where the pressure values on the rigid hull derived from cfd were directly applied to the fe model tuitman et al 2013 studied the short term distribution of the stresses on a ship using bem fem method bem is boundary element method where the slamming pressures computed using the 2d sections were projected onto the sections of the 3d ship structure dhavalikar et al 2018 presented an empirical formulation for slamming loads with due consideration by the geometry of the vessel seakeeping characteristics and probability of slamming for various types of displacement vessels wang and guedes soares 2016a 2016b investigated the slamming induced loads and occurrences on the bow and stern of a chemical tanker advancing in irregular waves by using a partially nonlinear strip theory for seakeeping calculations and an ale solver for predicting the 2d ship section slamming pressures generally the assumption of 2d or 3d rigid body neglects the effect of elastic vibrations on the hydrodynamic pressure and the derived slamming loads are applied to analyse the transient structural responses omitting the effect of water on the structural vibration period the hydrodynamic impact and elastic response problems can be coupled to better analyse the ship hull loads and responses due to slamming this is because the elastic structural response interacts with the slamming pressure on the structure affecting the elastic stress distribution on the structure the local hydroelastic effect on slamming problems has been under considerable attention since 1990s due to the development of high speed vessels therefore kvalsvold and faltinsen 1995 and faltinsen 1997 used numerical experimental and theoretical methods to analyse the hydroelastic slamming of steel and aluminium plates a considerable amount of work on the slamming problem has been performed using various numerical approaches for example lu et al 2000 conducted a fully coupled analysis of the elastic wedges impacting with water the fluid flow was solved by the boundary element method bem together with the fully nonlinear free surface condition while the structural response was analysed based on linear elastic theory using the fem another application of a coupled bem fem method was presented by datta and guedes soares 2020 using a 3d transient green s function formulation luo et al 2010 wang and guedes soares 2014a and wang et al 2016 studied fully coupled simulations of 3d elastic structures entering into water by using an explicit finite element method where a fully coupled ale fem method was used to simulate the fluid structure coupling problem the deformation of the plate and the water was coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure of the water on the plate and it was found that the local dynamic hydroelastic effects are significant when the angle between the water and structural surfaces is small and the impact velocity is high the hydroelastic effect has been investigated in the slamming problems of high speed crafts for example stenius et al 2011 zamanirad et al 2016 mesa 2018 sun and wang 2018 sun et al 2019 and yu et al 2019 in these investigations the ship cross sections were simplified as wedge shapes and the hydroelastic analyses were performed on the water impacts of elastic wedges with stiffened panels and it was found that the structural responses are affected by the fluid structure interaction and the oscillatory response after flow separation the mesh size of the structure and the fluids in impact domain is of most significance the fine mesh e g 5 mm can be selected to analyse the scaled model impacting with water which structural dimension is in the order of 0 5 m however the coarse mesh e g 50 mm has to be selected for analysing the full scale ship structures 5 m due to the computation time needed for hydroelastic analyses moreover the extent of the fe model is to be limited in order to control the number of elements the present simplification modelling only the structures between web frames maximises the effect of boundary conditions on the elastic response slamming impact problems are relevant for high speed and fast displacement aluminium vessels although the impact characteristics of unwelded aluminium alloy materials are similar to the ones of steel materials the yield stress and the ultimate tensile strength of welded aluminium alloy materials decrease because of the effect of the heated affected zone haz paik et al 2006 liu et al 2014 2015 2020 the material degradation affects considerably the ship structural strength both locally and globally especially under the slamming induced hydrodynamic impact loads khedmati and pedram 2014 cerik 2017 liu et al 2019 the present paper investigates the response of an aluminium stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft length 80 m operating in the displacement mode under bow flare slamming loading the study is done by means of three finite element methods 1 a linear static analysis to calculate the structural elastic deformation and stress under the prescriptive design load 2 a hydrodynamic analysis to calculate the slamming loads on a rigid bow flared section of the craft and an elastic dynamic analysis to calculate the elastic deformation and stress of the stiffened panel under the previously computed slamming loads a decoupled method 3 a hydroelastic analysis to calculate the slamming loads elastic deformation and stress using the fully coupled ale fem method for reference the ale method is summarised in section 2 the results of the three methods are compared to evaluate the hydroelastic effect when predicting the structural loading and response of bow flared sections the spray rail is often designed to provide protection from water spray this design induces larger upward vertical force when the ship bow moves downwards due to slamming providing better sailing attitude while the spray sail brings advantages attention is to be paid on the local slamming load and response and the structural details the main objective of the paper is to provide insights to evaluate the elastic deformation and stress of aluminium stiffened plates under bow flare slamming loadings with a design assessment application of high speed and fast displacement aluminium crafts where a craft has pronounced flare or rake of bow the structure in the forward region will be subjected to special considerations and the scantlings and arrangements may require additional strengthening against bow flare slamming for determination of hull girder loads of crafts under 90 m the bow flare area is considered in the bow region of the hull forward of 0 8l from the aft perpendicular and from the design draught waterline up to a waterline 0 5 0 0412 l 4 above the design waterline this concept is illustrated in fig 1 and is used here for the analysis of the present 80 m fast displacement craft also here a strip between two web frames denoted as bow flared section at approximately 0 9 l is used for the calculations analyses the discussion is concentrated on the effect of the spray rail as well as the influence of the end restraints of the longitudinals 2 arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale algorithm in ale formulation a reference coordinate is induced which is neither the lagrangian coordinate nor the eulerian coordinate the differential quotient for the material with respect to the reference coordinate is described as 1 f x t t f x t t w f x t x where x is the lagrangian coordinate x is the eulerian coordinate and w is the relative velocity between the particle velocity v and the velocity of the reference coordinate u the ale formulation can be derived from the relation between the time derivative of material and that of the reference geometry configuration the fluid domain is represented by ω f r 3 and ω f represents the fluid boundary the equation of mass momentum and energy conservation for a newtonian fluid in the ale formulation of the reference domain are given by 2 ρ t ρ d i v w w g r a d ρ 3 σ v t d i v σ f ρ w g r a d v 4 ρ e t σ g r a d v f v ρ w g r a d e where ρ is the fluid density and f is the body force the total cauchy stress σ is of the form 5 σ p i d u g r a d v g r a d v t where p is the pressure and u is the dynamic viscosity the part of the boundary at which the velocity is assumed to be specified is denoted by ω 1 f and in the inflow boundary condition is given by 6 v g t on ω 1 f the lagrange euler coupling algorithm adopted in the numerical solution uses a penalty based formulation which can generate high frequency oscillations due to the nearly incompressible nature of the fluid this is an explicit finite element method and is unconditionally stable to ensure the computational stability and accuracy it is required a careful selection of the related numerical parameters 3 description of the stiffened plate in the bow flare area the stiffened plate is selected from the bow flare area of a fast displacement aluminium craft of 80 m length the craft principal dimensions are listed in table 1 and a sketch of the craft profile and the bow flare cross section at 10 m from the forward perpendicular is given in fig 2 the length of the stiffened plate is 1200 mm frame spacing and it is restrained at the main deck and at the lower deck the plate thickness is 8 0 mm and the stiffeners are flat bars 120 10 mm the thickness of the spray rail is 12 0 mm the slamming analysis is limited to the stiffened plate level i e it has been considered that the primary supporting members do not suffer deformation this assumption agrees with the sequence of deformation of grillages under impulsive pressures i e first the plating and then the stiffened plate deforms between the web frames and stringers and eventually these primary members might undertake bending deformation note that for short impulsively loadings the primary members are not expected to deform spray rails are commonly fitted on fast displacement crafts since they provide additional lift in the forward part of the hull improve the resistance above certain speeds and decrease the wetted surface area of the hull by breaking the spray sheet of the bow wave apart from those hydrodynamic advantages from a practical point of view spray rails keep the deck dryer and avoid spray to sweep over the deck in beam winds for the slamming analysis the spray rail plays a key role since the impact load is concentrated on the stiffened plate below the spray rail implying that the spray rail breaks the impact and consequently is subjected to a high pressure the effect of spray rail will be discussed in section 8 4 linear static analysis the design pressure is estimated using the lloyd s register rules and regulations for the classification of special service craft lr 2019a the plating design pressure at the scantling draft is estimated at 140 kn m2 the msc nastran finite element solver is used to evaluate the linear static strength of the stiffened plate the four edges of the plate and the ends of the stiffeners are fully restrained as it has been considered that the primary supporting members do not suffer bending deformations the plate surface is loaded by the static pressure of 140 kn m2 the mesh size of the shell elements is about 50 mm six elements between the longitudinals the mechanical properties of the aluminium are mass density 2700 kg m3 young s modulus 72 000 mpa and poisson s ratio 0 33 5 dynamic analysis decoupled approach the decoupled method evaluates separately the slamming load and the structural response 1 the slamming pressures are first estimated using the ale algorithm which is based on the rigid body assumption and 2 the structural response is computed separately using the fem for both cases the computation are carried out using the explicit finite element package ls dyna version 971 hallquist 2006 5 1 slamming loads hydrodynamic analysis the hydrodynamic analysis of slamming induced loads uses the approach based on the ale algorithm reported by wang and guedes soares 2012 2013 to estimate the water impact loads on 2d rigid sections the definitions adopted here are briefly explained next the finite element modelling of the symmetric water entry of a 2d bow flared section is shown in fig 3 only half of the system is modelled defining symmetrical constraints the cross section drops vertically into the calm water with a constant velocity of 9 5 m s the slamming velocity v s is estimated using eq 7 obtained from the rules and regulations for the classification of naval ships naval ship rules where the bottom impact pressure ip i is considered as the design pressure 140 kn m2 and the deadrise angle β p is approximated at 45 7 i p i 0 5 π tan β p v s 2 kn m 2 the relative vertical impact velocity of the craft water entry is assumed as constant instead of defining an initial vertical impact velocity to present a conservative approach for ship structures under impact pressure loads the size of the water domain is limited to a width of 19 m and a height of 32 m while the air domain is 19 m width and 9 5 m height the size of the water domain is five times the size of the bow flare section the x axis is located at the calm water surface and the y axis is placed at the vertical line which coincides with the centre line of the bow flare section the z axis is along the length and thus represents the 3d direction of the model since only the 2d water impact is investigated the length of the model in z axis is set as one element of length 50 mm the displacement in the z direction of all nodes is fixed the boundaries of the fluids are defined as non reflecting which are used on the exterior boundaries of an analysis model of an infinite domain such as a half space to prevent artificial stress wave reflections generated at the model boundaries part of the mesh is shown in fig 4 to illustrate the meshing around the impact domain the impact domain is uniformly meshed and then the meshing is moderately expanded towards the boundaries the mesh size at the uniform domain area and at the bow flare section is 50 mm the numerical model consists of 167 924 nodes and 83 570 elements the fluids water and air are modelled with solid elements section solid ale and are defined as void materials mat null i e they do not have yield strength and behave as a fluid like manner the void material allows the equations of state to be considered without computing deviatoric stresses the gruneisen equation of state is used for the water domain and the linear polynomial equation of state is applied for the air domain the main parameters used in the equations of states are listed in table 2 wang et al 2014 the bow flared section is modelled using shell elements section shell defining a rigid material mat rigid 5 2 structural response under the slamming loads the elastic structural response decouples from the hydrodynamic analysis of the slamming load for the analysis the same model shown in fig 2c is used the slamming pressure time data obtained from the hydrodynamic analysis section 5 1 is the loading input the dynamic pressure time curves is applied at the spray rail and the stiffened plate below and distributed uniformly along the length defined by the frame spacing 1 2 m the elastic structural deformation and stress are then analysed although the slamming response is a dynamic phenomenon the material strain rate sensitivity is not considered in the elastic response analysis the material strain rate effect only presents higher yield and flow stresses of the material not changing young s modulus and poisson s ratio jones 1989 liu and guedes soares 2019 note that it has been demonstrated that the strain rate effect of the aluminium alloy under low velocity impact is negligible jones 1989 if the elasto plastic response is analysed under extreme slamming loads the material strain rate effect might be considered for example yang and wang 2018 6 hydroelastic analysis coupled approach the hydroelastic analysis reflects the coupling effect between the fluid and the structure 1 the influence of structural deformation on the flow field and 2 the influence of added mass and damp of the flow field on the structural response yu et al 2019 here hydroelastic slamming impact is simulated using the explicit finite element package ls dyna version 971 with a double precision solver the fully coupled analysis method has been validated by the analytical and numerical analyses of the slamming responses of plates as reported in wang et al 2016 and wang and guedes soares 2017a in the coupled analysis the deformations of the stiffened plate and of the water are coupled through the hydrodynamic pressure exerted by water on the hull and the velocity of particles on the wetted surface affecting deformations of the water the continuity of surface tractions and the inter penetrability of water into the hull are satisfied by using a penalty method which was explained by aquelet et al 2006 a 3d numerical model is used to evaluate the fluid structure interaction considering hydroelasticity effect see fig 5 a this model is expanded from the 2d numerical model described in section 5 1 and has an extension of 1 3 m in z axis direction with a mesh size of 50 50 mm the numerical model consists of 2 267 595 nodes and 2 173 418 elements in the 3d model most of the numerical definitions are the same as the ones in the 2d model such as the geometries in the xy plane the meshing the symmetrical constraint at the vertical centreline of the body etc the displacements in the z axis direction of all nodes of the cross sections at both ends are fixed thus the fluids are possible to flow between the two end sections the slamming problem is idealised as a deformable stiffened panel within a 3d structural model see fig 5b since a local slamming impact of the stiffened plate is evaluated the deformable stiffened plate is embedded in the rigid 3d bow flared structure with an extension of 1 3 m 1 2 m 2 50 mm in z axis direction the embedded stiffened panel 1 2 m has the same geometrical and material definitions with the elastic model described in section 5 2 see fig 2b the one element extensions 50 mm are created at both ends with a rigid material also the remaining structures including the side structure below the lower deck and the main deck structure are modelled with a rigid material these rigid structures provide the fully clamped conditions for the deformable stiffened plate for the rigid structures only a translational movement along the y axis direction is released and a constant dropping velocity of 9 5 m s is defined it should be mentioned that the constant dropping velocity is not defined to the deformable stiffened panel so that the panel can deform freely when impacting with the water only an initial velocity of 9 5 m s is defined to the deformable panel in order to avoid an unacceptable acceleration at the beginning of the simulation the bow flared 3d structure is modelled using shell elements section shell with rigid mat rigid and elastic mat elastic materials the rigid elastic structural model is generated satisfying both the geometrical description of bow flared section and the scantling definition of stiffened panel structure in the finite element simulations described in sections 4 to 6 the convergence study on the mesh density is not discussed taking the computational time into consideration for the slamming analysis of actual ships it is very time consuming to perform the hydroelastic analysis using one span finite element model although the mesh size of 50 mm is still relatively coarse this mesh cannot be refined due to practicalities computing power time in the hydroelastic analysis of rectangular plates subjected to slamming loads the fe model using the mesh of 50 mm predicts lower slamming pressures about 15 than that using the mesh of 5 mm wang and guedes soares 2017a this discrepancy shows the degree of accuracy in the present study for comparative study the simulations described in sections 5 and 6 select the same mesh size 50 mm for the finite element models 7 results the three sets of finite element results linear static dynamic and hydroelastic analysis are presented herein to evaluate the hydrodynamic impact response and the structural response of the stiffened plate the results are compared in table 3 and particular details are given next 7 1 slamming pressure the design pressure of 140 kn m2 should be considered as the baseline to compare the pressures obtained from the decoupled and the coupled method the maximum slamming pressures from the decoupled approach are presented in fig 6 the maximum instantaneous pressure occurs at the surrounding of the spray rail at the time of 0 34 s the maximum pressures around the spray rail can be seen in fig 6a and the corresponding pressure contour is plotted together with the free surface elevations in fig 6b the pressure histories of two points at the intersection of the spray rail and the lower stiffened plate are plotted in fig 6c the slamming pressure increases rapidly when the water impacts on the spray rail the maximum instantaneous pressure reaches 220 kn m2 which is about 1 6 times the design pressure of 140 kn m2 afterwards the impulsive pressure decreases gradually when the spray rail is immersed totally in the water because the water separates from the body the peak pressure on p4 is higher than the one on p2 because the plate is relatively flat on the location of p4 this is consistent with our previous studies which have indicated that the slamming pressure is higher when the deadrise angle is smaller in fig 6b an air pocket is formed at the lower part of the section due to the curvature on the body and the air compressibility in the ale solver the similar air pocket was also predicted in wang and guedes soares 2013 for the water entry of a bow flared section at a relatively high speed a comparison of the pressure distribution at the spray rail for the 3d hydroelastic model and the 2d model is presented in fig 7 note that for the hydroelastic model the plate deforms during the water impact the maximum pressure increases in hydroelastic model when compared with the rigid one due to that local deformation of the plate as seen in fig 7 the local deadrise angle increases due to the deformation leading to the increase on the pressure the pressure distribution is similar for both the decoupled and coupled approaches since the spray rail is relatively thick 12 0 mm when compared with its width higher plate thickness shows lower hydroelasticity effect 7 2 elastic stress the yield stresses 0 2 proof stress of unwelded and welded 5083 h116 aluminium alloy materials are 215 mpa and 125 mpa respectively see table 4 for structural design the properties of the welded material are used the nominal limiting stress requirements for plating and primary and secondary stiffening members subjected to local loading conditions are given in terms of limiting stress coefficients lr 2019a these coefficients are expressed as a portion of the 0 2 proof stress of the material for the bottom and side shell plating in the slamming zone the coefficient for bending is 0 85 limiting stress 106 mpa for the secondary stiffening in the slamming zone the coefficient for bending is 0 75 limiting stress 94 mpa for all components in the slamming zone the coefficient for shear is 0 75 limiting stress 54 mpa the elastic stresses computed by the three finite element methods are smaller than the limiting stress see table 3 the maximum bending stresses calculated by the dynamic analysis section 5 2 is slightly smaller than that of the linear static analysis but it shows larger maximum shear stress the hydroelastic analysis sections 6 presents both larger maximum bending and shear stresses than the ones from linear static analysis the plots of maximum bending and shear stresses are presented in fig 8 the maximum stresses occur at 0 41s and 0 34 s for the dynamic and the hydroelastic analysis respectively the maximum bending and shear stresses at the longitudinals ends are given in fig 9 time duration from 0 20 s to 0 45 s the first peak stress at 0 34 s corresponds to the maximum slamming pressures while the second peak stress at 0 41 s is due to the continuous loadings on the stiffened plate for all three finite element calculations the maximum stresses occur at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners see fig 8 areas which are prone to be affected by the heat affected zone and consequently those areas require further analysis see section 8 2 7 3 structural deformation the results of the structural deformation maximum deflections are presented in table 3 and fig 10 the maximum deflection occurs at the plating element between longitudinals at the mid span of the stiffened plate below the spray rail at the time 0 41 s the maximum deflection is delayed by some amount of time depending on the duration of the slamming loads the coupling effect between the fluid and the structure induces larger structural deformation and stresses during the water impact the dynamic and the hydroelastic analyses give the smallest and the largest deformations respectively hydroelastic static dynamic analysis however the results are relatively close demonstrating that the linear static analysis based on design load can well evaluate the local structural deformation of the ship under slamming loads 7 4 comments on comparison of results three sets of finite element analyses have been compared comprehensively using slamming load structural stress and deformation similar results are obtained by these methods and the linear static analysis based on design loads can evaluate approximately the local structural deformation and stress however some results are underestimated see table 3 this indicates that the slamming impact pressure analysed by eq 7 should be carefully used in the design of bow flared structures with the spray rail accounting for the structural safety margin an underestimated slamming pressure might lead to damage of the structures under a harsh cyclic operational conditions 8 discussion for the present slamming phenomenon the influence of the spray rail and the ends of the longitudinals will be discussed herein 8 1 influence of the spray rail on the slamming pressures while spray rails are commonly fitted for improving hydrodynamics of fast displacement crafts the analysis here is done from a strength point of view only since the slamming pressures can be strongly affected by the angle size of the spray rail here the spray rail has been considered as horizontal and the resulting slamming pressures are presented in fig 11 it is observed that the horizontal spray rail results in smaller slamming pressures during the water impact in particular at the spray rail itself fig 11b since the flow of the water is not trapped as occurred in the sloped spray rail the effect on the lower stiffened plate is considered to be minimum fig 11a one of the clear advantages of the spray rail is that decreases the wetted surface area of the hull by breaking the spray sheet of the bow wave thus the area of the hull subjected to the slamming pressure increases if the spray rail is not fitted the effect of the omission of the spray rail is shown in fig 12 it is observed that the slamming pressure is considerably smaller when the spray rail is not fitted one of the reasons is that the local deadrise angle becomes larger for the fitted spray rail it is also seen that the bow flare slamming pressure signal is of longer duration these two curves are typically two component domination cases in slamming pressures as indicated in wang and guedes soares 2016a the total slamming load was a sum of an impulsive component characterised by a large peak with a small duration and a second component given by the rate of change of the hydrodynamic momentum for the original spay rail the slamming pressure is dominated by the first component due to the flat geometry while for the fitted one the result is dominated by the hydrodynamic momentum due to the big flare the spray rail is designed with thicker plate than the adjacent shell plating 12 0 mm versus 8 0 mm and this strengthening eliminates the stress concentration at the spray rail it is demonstrated numerically comparing with one more simulation using the same thickness 8 0 mm the plate thickness affects significantly the elastic deformation and stress in the structure its influence on slamming load however is relatively small due to the small magnitude of the elastic deformation 8 2 influence of boundary conditions due to the limitation of computing capability it is unpractical to use finite element models representing a large part of the craft for the hydroelastic analysis here the influence of the boundary conditions is evaluated by the dynamic analysis only see section 5 2 a three span structural model is modelled including the web frames as shown in fig 13 the response of stiffened plate between the web frames is compared with that of the one span structural model the maximum stresses are also found at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners connection with the web frames the comparison of the stress response is given in fig 14 locations 1 and 2 are the same used in fig 9 the results are quite similar transmitting that the web frames are strong enough to represent the fully clamped conditions and thus the one span panel model can be used to analyse the local structural responses under slamming loads it should be mentioned that in the present case the flat bars are welded at both sides to the web frames and for that reason they satisfy the fully fixed condition however commonly only one side of the secondary members is welded since they cross the webs through cut outs and in that case the end fixity is considered to be partial it should be also mentioned that lug connections are required at the cut outs for the passage of secondary members through the webs of primary members in areas subjected to impact pressures if the area of the weld is less than shear area 9 conclusions the response of an aluminium alloy stiffened panel of a fast displacement craft due to bow flare slamming has been assessed by three finite element methods investigating the slamming pressures structural stresses and deformations it is found that the maximum stresses occur at the ends of longitudinal stiffeners passing through the web frames an area commonly affected by the welding of thin aluminium structures haz in aluminium welds and thus attention should be paid to the fatigue assessment of such hotspots and to the local plastic failure under extreme slamming loads through the comparison of three numerical analyses it is found that the ship design based on prescriptive rules manages to evaluate with accuracy the slamming responses of bow flared structures the comparisons present that the safety margin is not large for the bow flared structures the design of the spray rail causes that the vessel suffers much larger slamming pressures during water impact in the slamming analyses the transit slamming pressures are much larger than the design loads although it does not overestimate the local stresses and deformations the slamming problems are still critical for the

21361,field observations over decades have found that the surface roughness of coral reefs is typically one or two order of magnitude larger than that of sandy beaches to better reproduce the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness a numerical wave tank based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations are solved for two phase incompressible flow with the k ω sst model for the turbulence closure and vof method for tracking the free surface the reef surface with high friction is modeled by coupling a porous media model in the rans equations the model is first validated by our new performed laboratory experiments as well as a laboratory dataset in the literature a fixed set of model parameters is found to be suitable for both experiments subsequently the model is applied to evaluate the impacts of hydrodynamic morphological and roughness element factors on the wave run up on the back reef beach and an empirical formula is proposed to predict the wave run up based on the simulations finally the cross reef variations of flow and vorticity fields under the breaking solitary waves are also examined via the numerical simulations keywords reef roughness navier stokes equations wave runup porous media solitary wave 1 introduction tsunamis are generated by earthquakes volcanic eruptions submarine landslides or meteorological changes coastal tsunami wave run up can damage coastal structures and inundate coastal towns and villages yao et al 2015 thus causing a serious threat to the coastal residents after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami with a record death toll of about 300 000 the positive role of coral reefs in mitigating tsunami hazards has begun to attract the attentions of scholars conducting post disaster field surveys e g liu et al 2005 marris 2005 papadopoulos et al 2006 and many others such protective role provided by reefs has also been witnessed in both the 2009 south pacific tsunami e g gelfenbaum et al 2011 mcadoo et al 2011 and the 2011 east japan tsunami e g ford et al 2014 among various reefs fringing reef that consists of an offshore steep fore reef slope and an inshore horizontal reef flat attached directly to the shoreline gourlay 1996 is the most common type due to the existence of coral communities the roughness of reef surface increases significantly the values of the frictional coefficients over the reef surfaces generally range between 0 01 and 0 1 as reported in existing field e g lowe et al 2005 monismith

sandy beaches this means aside from wave breaking around the reef edge a substantial portion of incident wave energy can be dissipated by bottom friction on the reef flat e g lentz et al 2016 monismith et al 2015 over decades numerical simulation provides a useful way to investigate wave interaction with coral reefs in the literature although special wave profiles such as elongated solitary waves e g charvet et al 2013 sine waves e g bremm et al 2015 and n waves e g qu et al 2017 had been proposed to simulate the tsunamis to partially solve the scale issue the most popular approach to study tsunami wave interaction with coral reefs remains to be the solitary wave which are used to model the leading waves of tsunamis e g quiroga and cheung 2013 yao et al 2018 2019 ning et al 2019 traditionally the depth integrated models have been frequently used to simulate the tsunami wave transformation over reef profiles kunkel et al 2006 is the early work in the literature to utilize a nonlinear shallow water model to assess the impacts of wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness on the wave run up at a field scale and the bottom friction is modeled by a quadratic frictional law in the shallow water equations subsequently roeber and cheung 2012 reproduced the transformation of solitary waves over fringing reef profiles using a boussinesq typed model based on the laboratory experiments of roeber 2010 since the reef profile is relatively smooth bottom friction is described by a manning roughness coefficient in the boussinesq equations more recently yao et al 2018 also adopted a boussinesq model to explore the solitary wave run up over a laboratory fringing reef with varying reef morphologies fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width the bottom roughness for their rough reef surface using cylinder array to model a type of branch coral is addressed by including an additional drag term in the boussinesq equations however there are still several challenges in applying depth integrated models to wave dynamics over reefs due to their violation of the mild slope assumption at steep reefs as well as their incapability of inherently modeling wave breaking on the reefs when modeling wave transformation over steep coral reefs turbulence induced by energetic breaking waves around the reef edge needs to be resolved thus a three dimensional 3d model which is able to solve the rotational flow is more suitable recently the advanced navier stokes equation based approaches such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd models although less computationally efficient have begun to be utilized in exploring the coral reef hydrodynamics in the literature franklin et al 2013 pioneered wave reef interaction simulations using the rans equations the impacts of reef roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were also examined since the laboratory experiments of demirbilek et al 2007 for relatively smooth reef surface had been used for their model validation the roughness effect was only examined by tuning an empirical frictional coefficient in the model of franklin et al 2013 recently osorio cano et al 2018 implemented the large eddy simulation les method to simulate wave energy damping due to reef roughness and wave breaking over a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea as for the tsunamic like solitary wave interaction with the coral reefs we are only aware that yao et al 2019 simulated the solitary wave breaking bore propagation and run up through a les model but their study was limited to reproducing both laboratory experiments of roeber 2010 and yao et al 2018 with smooth reef surfaces i e the reef roughness was not considered as for the seabed boundary treatment in above navier stokes equation based models both franklin et al 2013 and yao et al 2019 simply used a wall function to address the bottom friction for smooth laboratory reef surfaces however the realistic reef roughness is highly inhomogeneous thus it is difficult to determine a characteristic roughness height for the wall function whereas osorio cano et al 2018 projected the field reef colonies into a complex bottom shape and modeled the wave interaction with the shaped bottoms however this kind of treatment is generally restricted to large scale reef roughness elements in that a large number of grids associated with very fine mesh size is generally required to capture the small turbulence structures in the colonies meanwhile an alternative way to efficiently model wave energy attenuation over the rough reef is to use the porous media theory as can found in some analytical models lowe et al 2008 zhu et al 2019 the porous media model is particularly suitable for the rough reef surface where the form drag dominates over skin friction it also outweighs the aforementioned drag friction term only for branch corals because it can describe the reef colonies with various coral species however such idea has not been used in the numerical modeling of coral reef hydrodynamics according to the authors knowledge therefore to remedy the deficiencies of existing numerical models in reproducing the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness a porous media model coupled with the rans equations as proposed by higuera et al 2014a is adopted in this study to reproduce the reef surface with high friction such kind of model configuration has been successfully applied to various coastal processes such as wave interaction with permeable breakwaters e g higuera et al 2014b wu et al 2014 wave attenuation over porous seabeds e g torres freyermuth et al 2017 lara et al 2011 and wave transformation over mangrove forests e g maza et al 2015 the numerical wave tank in this study is developed based on the widely used cfd tool openfoam and the rans equations are solved with the k ω sst model for the turbulence closure and vof method for tracking the free surface new laboratory experiments together with a published laboratory dataset are first used to validate the model in view of wave height variation across the reef as well as wave run up on the back reef slope the physical roughness elements an array of cylinders or cuboid beams used in both laboratory experiments are regular in shape and uniformly arranged thus they are ideal porous media for model validation with constant porosity and element diameter the model is then applied to investigate the effects of hydrodynamic reef morphological and roughness element factors on the wave run up as well as the cross reef variations of the flow and vorticity fields 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the varans volume average reynolds average navier stokes equations as proposed by del jesus et al 2012 and improved by higuera et al 2014a by including a porous media model is used for simulating wave

velocity and t 0 is the period of the oscillation thus k c introduces additional friction if the system has oscillatory nature or unsteadiness according to higuera et al 2014a a constant value of c 0 34 has been recommended in eq 3 the empirical parameters α and β need to be determined by calibrating the model predictions to laboratory or field observations in order to more accurately reproduce the fluid motion with greater turbulence intensity the turbulence closure is addressed by a standard k ω sst model menter 1994 with the porous media theory included the k ω sst turbulence model is a mixture of k ε and k ω models thus its performance is equivalent to the k ω model when modeling boundary layer flow and to the k ε model in the free flow region higuera et al 2014a the governing

numerical wave flume which are not provided by the original version of openfoam two third party modules namely waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 and ih foam higuera et al 2013 are widely used in the literature in current study ih foam is chosen because it provides the active wave absorbing boundary and has no relaxation zone as required by waves2foam it supports the solitary wave theory of lee et

respectively 3 model validation 3 1 experiment setup to validate the numerical model we first conduct a new set of laboratory experiments following the reef configuration of yao et al 2018 which is designed based on the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 20 the experiments are performed in a wave flume 40 m long 0 50 m wide and 0 8 m high at the hydraulic modeling laboratory changsha university of science and technology p r china the physical reef model consists of a 1 6 fore reef slope s a horizontal reef flat with an elevation of 0 35 m as well as a 1 8 back reef beach fig 1 a the cross shore width of reef flat is w r 8 m with its alongshore width matching the flume width the physical reef model is made of polyvinyl chloride pvc plates with 1 cm thickness fig 1b following yao et al 2018 we use a cylinder array to create the reef roughness fig 1c it mimics a popular coral reef community consisting of individual and cylindrical branches wooden cylinders with 1 cm in diameter and 3 5 cm in height are inserted into the pre drilled holes with 1 cm in depth on the plates therefore the physical roughness height on the reef surface is k s 2 5 c m different from yao et al 2018 in which the roughness elements cylinders were only set around the reef edge we pave the roughness elements from fore reef slope toe all the way to the entire reef flat is this way we believe that the potential of adopted numerical model in reproducing wave transformation on the rough reef can be fully tested a tandem arrangement of roughness elements with a spacing of s 2 5 cm between the adjacent elements is examined fig 1d the roughness element density is calculated by the solid volume portion φ of the elements defined as φ v s v with v s being the volume of solid object in the control volume v which is φ 0 13 for the present configuration thus the porosity of the array is n 1 φ 0 87 d 50 as required by the numerical model is obtained by the equivalent sphere diameter of a cylinder which gives d 50 0 016 m for this roughness design during the experiments waves are measured by 18 wave gauges g1 g18 across the reef fig 1a an adv acoustic doppler velocimeter is placed midway v1 between g4 and g5 to record the mid depth solitary wave induced current a high speed ccd camera is located above the back reef beach to record wave run up process on the slope a series of incident waves h 0 ranges from 0 02 m to 0 12 m is tested with a constant offshore water level of h 0 0 4 m corresponding to a reef flat water level of h r 0 05 m each run is repeated three times to ensure the data repeatability we choose a representative wave condition h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m to validate our model coefficients the detailed design for this case is given by table 1 the second laboratory experiments were performed by quiroga and cheung 2013 in a wave flume 104 m long 3 66 m wide and 4 6 m high at the o h hinsdale wave research laboratory oregon state university u s a prefabricated concrete slabs were used in the flume to construct a fore reef slope of s 1 12 a reef flat with an elevation of 2 36 m and a cross shore width of w r 29 3 m as well as a back reef vertical wall fig 2 in their study the reef roughness elements were made using assembled cuboid timber beams 8 cm in cross width at regular intervals across the reef model different arrangements of the roughness elements were tested but we only used their bf2 design with the physical roughness height k s 0 076 m and a spacing between adjacent beams of s 38 cm the corresponding roughness density is φ 0 21 thus the porosity is n 0 79 d 50 is determined by the equivalent sphere diameter of a cuboid beam which gives d 50 0 35 m two setups with the roughness elements installed only on the fore reef slope and on the reef flat respectively are tested with this roughness design 14 wave gauges wg1 to wg14 were employed to record the solitary wave motions in the flume it must be noted that wave run up and flow were not measured in their experiments a series of solitary waves were tested but we only select one incident wave condition h 0 0 5 m and h r 0 1 m combined with the two roughness setups the designs for the two cases are also summarized in table 1 3 2 numerical setup the computational domain is established to reproduce the primary aspects of the laboratory setup fig 3 to reduce computational cost laboratory wave flume is truncated before the most offshore wave gauge for a solitary wave the wave length l can be approximated by a distance that contains 95 of its total mass which can be calculated by l 2 12 h 0 h 0 h 0 it gives l 1 9 m l 11 6 m for case 1 cases 2 3 in table 1 hence we set the numerical wave input at positions 2 m and 12 m from the most offshore wave gauge respectively for case 1 and cases 2 3 wave run up on the back reef slope case 1 or vertical wall cases 2 3 is unable to come out of the domain thus a solid wall boundary is set on the right boundary for other boundaries we set free to the atmosphere for the domain top and empty boundary for the two side faces of the flume meanwhile a no slip boundary condition with a wall function is imposed to the bottom of the flume as well as the reef surface without the roughness elements the porous layer is set to attach to the reef surface with the presence of roughness and both the cross shore extent and the height of the layer k s can be found in table 1 it is noted that the interface between the fluid phase and the fixed porous media is hence implicitly considered within the scope of eqs 2 5 during the model calibration we first adjust the input of h 0 to ensure that the computed wave height from the most offshore wave gauge exactly reproduces the laboratory measurement and then the empirical coefficients α and β associated with the porous media model are obtained by seeking a global best match of the wave records at all wave sampling locations a fix set of α 50 and β 3 are obtained for all the three cases from the two experiments with different wave characteristics as well as reef and roughness configurations these values are consistent with the ranges reported in the literature such as lara et al 2010 for α 10 100 β 0 5 6 0 higuera et al 2014a for α 50 200 and β 1 5 6 0 as well as wu et al 2014 for α 20 100 and β 1 8 it must be noted that these coefficients would require recalibration for other applications including wave interaction with porous bed or porous breakwater see a recent review by losada et al 2016 structured grid is adopted to discretize the entire numerical domain to reduce the total computational cells one layer of mesh with a constant grid size of 4 mm for case 1 and 20 mm for cases 2 3 is set in the spanwise y direction in the streamwise direction the mesh size δ x decreases gradually from 20 mm at the inlet boundary to 8 mm at the fore reef slope toe for case 1 and from 100 mm to 20 mm for cases 2 3 then in the core region from the fore reef slope to the back reef beach it maintains a constant size of δ x 8 mm δ x 20 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 the grid size in the vertical direction in the entire domain is set to be δ z 8 mm δ z 20 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 grid refinement near the free surface is conducted in the streamwise direction by reducing δ x to one half of their original sizes i e δ x 4 mm δ x 10 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 and in the vertical direction by refining the grid size to δ z 4 mm δ z 10 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 the total number of computational cells is 0 51 million 1 02 million for case 1 cases 2 3 the simulation duration is assigned to be 25 s 24 s for case 1 cases 2 3 to guarantee that the reflected waves from the back reef beach or wall can reach the most offshore wave gauge a constant courant number of 0 45 is employed and the time step is automatically adjusted it takes approximately 2 0 h for case 1 as well as 4 1 h for cases 2 3 on a cluster server with 100 cpus intel xeon 8173m 2 0 ghz to test grid size convergence we take the case from our experiments i e case 1 in table 1 as an example because the model scale of our experiments is smaller than that of quiroga and cheung 2013 thus it requires ﬁner grid resolution both grid sizes of δ x and δ z across the reef profile ranging between 2 mm and 8 mm are checked a comparison of free surface elevations and mid depth streamwise velocities associated with the leading solitary waves at the toe of the back reef beach g18 among the test grid sizes are shown in fig 4 less than 5 differences in both waves and ﬂows can be observed when the grid size reduces from 4 mm to 2 mm indicating that our grid resolution of δ x δ z 4 mm on the reef is sufﬁcient for the present simulations 3 3 time series of free surface elevations and current the simulated free surface elevations η at different sampling locations across the reef are compared with their measured counterparts for case 1 from our experiments with roughness existing on the entre reef fig 5 incident solitary wave profile steepens when wave shoals on the fore reef slope g3 g7 wave front becomes almost vertical around the reef edge g8 resulting in a plunging breaker after that the saw like wave profiles at g9 g18 indicate that the breaker forms a turbulent bore propagating on the shallow reef flat in the meantime a cross reef decay in the first peak of η associated with the leading solitary wave can be observed which can be explained by the energy dissipation from both bore evolution and bottom friction there is also a second peak in η on the reef flat which can be explained by wave reflection from the back reef beach the agreements of wave profile between the numerical simulations and the laboratory measurements at all sampling locations are generally good implying the robustness of using the present model to account for solitary wave transformation over the fringing reef with large bottom roughness the simulated timeseries of wave run up r on the back reef slope and the mid depth streamwise velocity u at the flow sampling location v1 are compared with their measurements in figs 6 and 7 respectively the model accurately captures the entire shoreline movement even for the hydraulic jump during the wave rundown process fig 6 v1 is located at the fore reef slope and it is prior to wave breaking for this case the behavior of velocity generally follows that of the shoaling waves and good agreement between the prediction and measurement can also be observed fig 7 we then examine the numerical simulations for cases 2 3 from the experiments of quiroga and cheung 2013 where the reef roughness is located only on the fore reef slope and on the reef flat respectively figs 8 and 9 demonstrate that the model reproduces the wave profile evolution on the fore reef slope wg3 wg9 and on the reef flat wg10 wg14 reasonably well for both reefs with different roughness setups however for both cases wave heights with the leading solitary waves are slightly over predicted after the onset of wave breaking around wg10 leading to phase differences between the simulations and the measurements such phase mismatch accumulates as the turbulence bore propagates inland and it becomes observable at wg14 after the bore travels over a reef flat as wide as about 30 m 3 4 wave heights and currents across the reef and wave run ups on the back reef slope using the calibrated model parameters based on the cases in table 1 comparisons between computed and measured solitary wave heights h i from representative wave gauges across the computational domain i e g1 at offshore g5 on the fore reef slope g8 around the reef edge g12 and g16 on the reef flat as well as g18 at the back reef slope toe and wave runup on the back reef slope for all tested incident waves in our experiments see section 3 1 are made overall the model reproduces the wave heights at all locations fig 10 as well as the wave runup fig 11 very well indicating again that the model parameters as calibrated by case 1 h 0 0 08 m can be used for other waves for a given reef profile the predictions of the mid depth streamwise velocity associated with the leading solitary wave at v1 are less accurate for some incident waves due to the instabilities in the flow measurements not shown but the overall agreement is still satisfactory fig 12 4 model applications 4 1 impacts of hydrodynamic morphological and roughness element factors on the solitary wave run up after model validation we subsequently apply the model to examine the impacts of varying hydrodynamic morphological and roughness element parameters on solitary wave run up over the fringing reef profile based on case 1 in table 1 incident wave height h 0 0 08 m reef flat water level h r 0 05 m cross shore reef flat width w r 8 m fore reef slope tan α 1 6 back reef slope tan β 1 8 roughness element porosity n 0 87 roughness element mean nominal diameter d 50 0 016 m and roughness element height k s 0 025 m we test additional hydrodynamic parameter values of h 0 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 10 m 0 12 m and h r 0 025 m 0 075 m 0 10 m 0 125 m as well as morphological parameter values of w r 4 m 6 m 10 m 12 m tan α 1 1 1 3 1 9 1 12 and tan β 1 1 1 4 1 12 1 16 for the roughness element parameters we reset the tested values of n 0 85 0 88 0 91 0 94 0 97 d 50 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m and k s 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m during simulations each run is implemented by altering only one of the parameters while maintaining other parameters unchanged in general the solitary wave run up on the back reef slope increases almost linearly with the increasing incident wave height fig 13 a which is anticipated since larger wave height means more incident wave energy acts on the reef profile wave run up also increases rapidly with the increasing reef flat water level fig 13b because larger water level means less wave energy dissipation associated with both wave breaking and bottom friction however wave run up declines with the increasing reef flat width fig 13c this is largely due to the enhanced frictional dissipation as waves propagates further away on the reef flat meanwhile wave run up is almost insensitive to the variation of the fore reef slope fig 13d because wave breaking in this case happens near the reef edge hence most breaking wave process and the corresponding energy attenuation is completed on the reef flat whereas wave run up appears to be more dependent on the back reef slope fig 13e it drops as the back reef slope becomes gentler in agreement with the observation for plane beach see e g synolakis 1987 as for the effects of reef surface roughness wave run up increases with the increase of roughness element porosity fig 13f which is apparently due to the less effective wave attenuation with more porous roughness layer in addition wave run up increases with the increase of the mean nominal diameter of the roughness element fig 13g because it reduces the friction term i e eq 3 according to eqs 4 and 5 meanwhile it is anticipated that wave run up will decrease notably with the increase of roughness element height in that the effect of energy dissipation increases with increasing thickness of roughness element fig 13h in summary the above analysis suggests that coastline protected by fringing reef with a smooth narrow reef flat and a steep back reef beach subjected to a large wave coinciding with a high tidal level is especially vulnerable to wave driven inundation during a tsunami event based on our simulations we propose the following empirical formula to predict the solitary wave run up 18 r h 0 c 1 w r d 50 n c 2 k s h r c 3 tan α tan β c 4 h r h 0 c 5 a best fit of eq 18 to the simulated dataset yields c 1 1 04 c 2 0 11 c 3 0 97 c 4 0 13 and c 5 0 57 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 92 fig 14 compares the computed normalized wave run up from the numerical model r n h 0 to the predicted normalized wave run up based on eq 18 r p h 0 good agreement in fig 14 indicates the robustness of using eq 18 to predict solitary wave runup on the back reef beach of fringing reef by taking the examined hydrodynamic reef morphologic and roughness element factors into account 4 2 cross shore variations of flow and vorticity fields associated with breaking solitary wave transformation over smooth and rough reef profiles one of the advantages of the present cfd model over the depth integrated models is that it can resolve the vertical flow field associated with wave prorogation across the reef the computed wave induced current and vortices on the x z plane in different regions along the rough reef profile for case 1 in table 1 are illustrated in fig 15 in which the simulations for the smooth reef profile i e k s 0 are also shown for comparison we start from the region where the incident wave breaking occurs and in each region we show the instant t h 0 g where the leading solitary wave can be clearly identified note that t h 0 g for the rough reef generally falls behind that of the smooth reef due to the fact that waves travel slower over the rough surface for the rough reef profile around the reef edge where wave begins to break onto the horizontal reef flat fig 15a pairs of eddies with counter rotating vorticity appear mainly around the wave crest there is also a uniform velocity distribution underneath which is typical for a shallow water long wave after that stronger vorticities are produced coinciding with the formation of a propagating bore fig 15b and c and they are advected downwards to the seabed as the bore propagates further to the inner reef flat fig 15d g the intensity of vortex generation declines as the cross reef attenuation of both wave and current in the wave run up phase on the back reef beach fig 15h the vortices near the surface drop notably with the decelerated flow on the slope when wave run up reaches its peak fig 15i there is also slight vorticity produced near the bottom due to the absence of reef roughness on the back reef slope during wave rundown phase fig 15j negative counter clockwise vortex motions can be detected we also simulate the smooth reef i e there is no artificial reef roughness on the reef surface subjected to the same wave as case 1 in this way the effect of bottom roughness on solitary wave attenuation across the reef profile can be shown via a compassion of the vorticity field when comparing wave transformation over the rough reef flat fig 15a g to the smooth reef flat fig 15k q it can be found that positive clockwise vortex generation is significantly enhanced around the top of the bottom roughness layer resulting in increased wave energy dissipation in addition to wave breaking the magnitude of such kind of vorticity also decreases with the decay of wave driven current along the reef flat consequently less wave run up could be observed for the rough reef fig 15i than for the smooth reef fig 15s the investigated wave driven current and vortices could serve as a reference to examine more complicated problems such as tsunami induced sediment transport and local scouring around the reef profiles 5 conclusions to remedy the deficiencies of existing numerical models a numerical wave flume based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study to investigate the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness the reef surface with high friction is modeled by a porous media model which is coupled in the rans equations with the k ω sst model for turbulence closure and the vof method for tracking the free surface the numerical model is first validated using our new laboratory experiments as well as a published laboratory dataset in the literature a fixed set of model parameters is found to be sufficient to reproduce both experiments with different wave and reef settings consistent with recommended values in the literature the model is then applied to investigate the impacts of hydrodynamic reef morphological factors and roughness elements on the solitary wave run up on the back reef beach model results shows that wave run up increases with the increase of incident wave height reef flat water level roughness element porosity and roughness element mean nominal diameter while it decreases with both the increase of cross shore reef flat width and roughness element height wave run up is almost insensitive to the variation of fore reef slope but it tends to be less with milder back reef slope an empirical formula is subsequently proposed to predict the wave run up on the back reef beach by taking the examined hydrodynamic reef morphologic and roughness element factors into consideration finally the cross shore variations of flow and vorticity fields under the breaking solitary waves are examined for both smooth and rough reef profiles the porous roughness layer is found to significantly increase the vortex generation near the porous seabed in addition to wave breaking near the wave crest the porous roughness layer significantly increases vortex generation near the

21361,field observations over decades have found that the surface roughness of coral reefs is typically one or two order of magnitude larger than that of sandy beaches to better reproduce the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness a numerical wave tank based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans

volcanic eruptions submarine landslides or meteorological changes coastal tsunami wave run up can damage coastal structures and inundate coastal towns and villages yao et al 2015 thus causing a serious threat to the coastal residents after the 2004 indian ocean tsunami with a record death toll of about 300 000 the positive role of coral reefs in mitigating tsunami hazards has begun to attract the attentions of scholars conducting post disaster field surveys e g liu et al 2005 marris 2005 papadopoulos et al 2006 and many others such protective role provided by reefs has also been

et al 2019 traditionally the depth integrated models have been frequently used to simulate the tsunami wave transformation over reef profiles kunkel et al 2006 is the early work in the literature to utilize a nonlinear shallow water model to assess the impacts of wave height reef flat submergence lagoon width and reef surface roughness on the wave run up at a field scale and the bottom friction is modeled by a quadratic frictional law in the shallow water equations subsequently roeber and cheung 2012 reproduced the transformation of solitary waves over fringing reef profiles using a boussinesq typed model based on the laboratory experiments of roeber 2010 since the reef profile is relatively smooth bottom friction is described by a manning roughness coefficient in the boussinesq equations more recently yao et al 2018 also adopted a boussinesq model to explore the solitary wave run up over a laboratory fringing reef with varying reef morphologies fore reef slope back reef slope reef flat width reef crest width the bottom roughness for their rough reef surface using cylinder array to model a type of branch coral is addressed by including an additional drag term in the boussinesq equations however there are still several challenges in applying depth integrated models to wave dynamics over reefs due to their violation of the mild slope assumption at steep reefs as well as their incapability of inherently modeling wave breaking on the reefs when modeling wave transformation over steep coral reefs turbulence induced by energetic breaking waves around the reef edge needs to be resolved thus a three dimensional 3d model which is able to solve the rotational flow is more suitable recently the advanced navier stokes equation based approaches such as the computational fluid dynamics cfd models although less computationally efficient have begun to be utilized in exploring the coral reef hydrodynamics in the literature franklin et al 2013 pioneered wave reef interaction simulations using the rans equations the impacts of reef roughness on wave height wave setup infragravity waves and mean flows were also examined since the laboratory experiments of demirbilek et al 2007 for relatively smooth reef surface had been used for their model validation the roughness effect was only examined by tuning an empirical frictional coefficient in the model of franklin et al 2013 recently osorio cano et al 2018 implemented the large eddy simulation les method to simulate wave energy damping due to reef roughness and wave breaking over a reef site at tesoro island in the colombian caribbean sea as for the tsunamic like solitary wave interaction with the coral reefs we are only aware that yao et al 2019 simulated the solitary wave breaking bore propagation and run up through a les model but their study was limited to reproducing both laboratory experiments of roeber 2010 and yao et al 2018 with smooth reef surfaces i e the reef roughness was not considered as for the seabed boundary treatment in above navier stokes equation based models both franklin et al 2013 and yao et al 2019 simply used a wall function to address the bottom friction for smooth laboratory reef surfaces however the realistic reef roughness is highly inhomogeneous thus it is difficult to determine a characteristic roughness height for the wall function whereas osorio cano et al 2018 projected the field reef colonies into a complex bottom shape and modeled the wave interaction with the shaped bottoms however this kind of treatment is generally restricted to large scale reef roughness elements in that a large number of grids associated with very fine mesh size is generally required to capture the small turbulence structures in the colonies meanwhile an alternative way to efficiently model wave energy attenuation over the rough reef is to use the porous media theory as can found in some analytical models lowe et al 2008 zhu et al 2019 the porous media model is particularly suitable for the rough reef surface where the form drag dominates over skin friction it also outweighs the aforementioned drag friction term only for branch corals because it can describe the reef colonies with various coral species however such idea has not been used in the numerical modeling of coral reef hydrodynamics according to the authors knowledge therefore to remedy the deficiencies of existing numerical models in reproducing the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness a porous media model coupled with the rans equations as proposed by higuera et al 2014a is adopted in this study to reproduce the reef surface with high friction such kind of model configuration has been successfully applied to various coastal processes such as wave interaction with permeable breakwaters e g higuera et al 2014b wu et al 2014 wave attenuation over porous seabeds e g torres freyermuth et al 2017 lara et al 2011 and wave transformation over mangrove forests e g maza et al 2015 the numerical wave tank in this study is developed based on the widely used cfd tool openfoam and the rans equations are solved with the k ω sst model for the turbulence closure and vof method for tracking the free surface new laboratory experiments together with a published laboratory dataset are first used to validate the model in view of wave height variation across the reef as well as wave run up on the back reef slope the physical roughness elements an array of cylinders or cuboid beams used in both laboratory experiments are regular in shape and uniformly arranged thus they are ideal porous media for model validation with constant porosity and element diameter the model is then applied to investigate the effects of hydrodynamic reef morphological and roughness element factors on the wave run up as well as the cross reef variations of the flow and vorticity fields 2 numerical model 2 1 governing equations the varans volume average reynolds average navier stokes equations as proposed by del jesus et al 2012 and improved by higuera et al 2014a by including a porous media model is used for simulating wave

velocity and t 0 is the period of the oscillation thus k c introduces additional friction if the system has oscillatory nature or unsteadiness according to higuera et al 2014a a constant value of c 0 34 has been recommended in eq 3 the empirical parameters α and β need to be determined by calibrating the model predictions to laboratory or field observations in order to more accurately reproduce the fluid motion with greater turbulence intensity the turbulence closure is addressed by a standard k ω sst model menter 1994 with the porous media theory included the k ω sst turbulence model is a mixture of k ε and k ω models thus its performance is equivalent to the k ω model when modeling boundary layer flow and to the k ε model in the free flow region higuera et al 2014a the governing

numerical wave flume which are not provided by the original version of openfoam two third party modules namely waves2foam jacobsen et al 2012 and ih foam higuera et al 2013 are widely used in the literature in current study ih foam is chosen because it provides the active wave absorbing boundary and has no relaxation zone as required by waves2foam it supports the solitary wave theory of lee et

respectively 3 model validation 3 1 experiment setup to validate the numerical model we first conduct a new set of laboratory experiments following the reef configuration of yao et al 2018 which is designed based on the froude similarity law with a geometric scale factor of 1 20 the experiments are performed in a wave flume 40 m long 0 50 m wide and 0 8 m high at the hydraulic modeling laboratory changsha university of science and technology p r china the physical reef model consists of a 1 6 fore reef slope s a horizontal reef flat with an elevation of 0 35 m as well as a 1 8 back reef beach fig 1 a the cross shore width of reef flat is w r 8 m with its alongshore width matching the flume width the physical reef model is made of polyvinyl chloride pvc plates with 1 cm thickness fig 1b following yao et al 2018 we use a cylinder array to create the reef roughness fig 1c it mimics a popular coral reef community consisting of individual and cylindrical branches wooden cylinders with 1 cm in diameter and 3 5 cm in height are inserted into the pre drilled holes with 1 cm in depth on the plates therefore the physical roughness height on the reef surface is k s 2 5 c m different from yao et al 2018 in which the roughness elements cylinders were only set around the reef edge we pave the roughness elements from fore reef slope toe all the way to the entire reef flat is this way we believe that the potential of adopted numerical model in reproducing wave transformation on the rough reef can be fully tested a tandem arrangement of roughness elements with a spacing of s 2 5 cm between the adjacent elements is examined fig 1d the roughness element density is calculated by the solid volume portion φ of the elements defined as φ v s v with v s being the volume of solid object in the control volume v which is φ 0 13 for the present configuration thus the porosity of the array is n 1 φ 0 87 d 50 as required by the numerical model is obtained by the equivalent sphere diameter of a cylinder which gives d 50 0 016 m for this roughness design during the experiments waves are measured by 18 wave gauges g1 g18 across the reef fig 1a an adv acoustic doppler velocimeter is placed midway v1 between g4 and g5 to record the mid depth solitary wave induced current a high speed ccd camera is located above the back reef beach to record wave run up process on the slope a series of incident waves h 0 ranges from 0 02 m to 0 12 m is tested with a constant offshore water level of h 0 0 4 m corresponding to a reef flat water level of h r 0 05 m each run is repeated three times to ensure the data repeatability we choose a representative wave condition h 0 0 08 m and h r 0 05 m to validate our model coefficients the detailed design for this case is given by table 1 the second laboratory experiments were performed by quiroga and cheung 2013 in a wave flume 104 m long 3 66 m wide and 4 6 m high at the o h hinsdale wave research laboratory oregon state university u s a prefabricated concrete slabs were used in the flume to construct a fore reef slope of s 1 12 a reef flat with an elevation of 2 36 m and a cross shore width of w r 29 3 m as well as a back reef vertical wall fig 2 in their study the reef roughness elements were made using assembled cuboid timber beams 8 cm in cross width at regular intervals across the reef model different arrangements of the roughness elements were tested but we only used their bf2 design with the physical roughness height k s 0 076 m and a spacing between adjacent beams of s 38 cm the corresponding roughness density is φ 0 21 thus the porosity is n 0 79 d 50 is determined by the equivalent sphere diameter of a cuboid beam which gives d 50 0 35 m two setups with the roughness elements installed only on the fore reef slope and on the reef flat respectively are tested with this roughness design 14 wave gauges wg1 to wg14 were employed to record the solitary wave motions in the flume it must be noted that wave run up and flow were not measured in their experiments a series of solitary waves were tested but we only select one incident wave condition h 0 0 5 m and h r 0 1 m combined with the two roughness setups the designs for the two cases are also summarized in table 1 3 2 numerical setup the computational domain is established to reproduce the primary aspects of the laboratory setup fig 3 to reduce computational cost laboratory wave flume is truncated before the most offshore wave gauge for a solitary wave the wave length l can be approximated by a distance that contains 95 of its total mass which can be calculated by l 2 12 h 0 h 0 h 0 it gives l 1 9 m l 11 6 m for case 1 cases 2 3 in table 1 hence we set the numerical wave input at positions 2 m and 12 m from the most offshore wave gauge respectively for case 1 and cases 2 3 wave run up on the back reef slope case 1 or vertical wall cases 2 3 is unable to come out of the domain thus a solid wall boundary is set on the right boundary for other boundaries we set free to the atmosphere for the domain top and empty boundary for the two side faces of the flume meanwhile a no slip boundary condition with a wall function is imposed to the bottom of the flume as well as the reef surface without the roughness elements the porous layer is set to attach to the reef surface with the presence of roughness and both the cross shore extent and the height of the layer k s can be found in table 1 it is noted that the interface between the fluid phase and the fixed porous media is hence implicitly considered within the scope of eqs 2 5 during the model calibration we first adjust the input of h 0 to ensure that the computed wave height from the most offshore wave gauge exactly reproduces the laboratory measurement and then the empirical coefficients α and β associated with the porous media model are obtained by seeking a global best match of the wave records at all wave sampling locations a fix set of α 50 and β 3 are obtained for all the three cases from the two experiments with different wave characteristics as well as reef and roughness configurations these values are consistent with the ranges reported in the literature such as lara et al 2010 for α 10 100 β 0 5 6 0 higuera et al 2014a for α 50 200 and β 1 5 6 0 as well as wu et al 2014 for α 20 100 and β 1 8 it must be noted that these coefficients would require recalibration for other applications including wave interaction with porous bed or porous breakwater see a recent review by losada et al 2016 structured grid is adopted to discretize the entire numerical domain to reduce the total computational cells one layer of mesh with a constant grid size of 4 mm for case 1 and 20 mm for cases 2 3 is set in the spanwise y direction in the streamwise direction the mesh size δ x decreases gradually from 20 mm at the inlet boundary to 8 mm at the fore reef slope toe for case 1 and from 100 mm to 20 mm for cases 2 3 then in the core region from the fore reef slope to the back reef beach it maintains a constant size of δ x 8 mm δ x 20 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 the grid size in the vertical direction in the entire domain is set to be δ z 8 mm δ z 20 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 grid refinement near the free surface is conducted in the streamwise direction by reducing δ x to one half of their original sizes i e δ x 4 mm δ x 10 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 and in the vertical direction by refining the grid size to δ z 4 mm δ z 10 mm for case 1 cases 2 3 the total number of computational cells is 0 51 million 1 02 million for case 1 cases 2 3 the simulation duration is assigned to be 25 s 24 s for case 1 cases 2 3 to guarantee that the reflected waves from the back reef beach or wall can reach the most offshore wave gauge a constant courant number of 0 45 is employed and the time step is automatically adjusted it takes approximately 2 0 h for case 1 as well as 4 1 h for cases 2 3 on a cluster server with 100 cpus intel xeon 8173m 2 0 ghz to test grid size convergence we take the case from our experiments i e case 1 in table 1 as an example because the model scale of our experiments is smaller than that of quiroga and cheung 2013 thus it requires ﬁner grid resolution both grid sizes of δ x and δ z across the reef profile ranging between 2 mm and 8 mm are checked a comparison of free surface elevations and mid depth streamwise velocities associated with the leading solitary waves at the toe of the back reef beach g18 among the test grid sizes are shown in fig 4 less than 5 differences in both waves and ﬂows can be observed when the grid size reduces from 4 mm to 2 mm indicating that our grid resolution of δ x δ z 4 mm on the reef is sufﬁcient for the present simulations 3 3 time series of free surface elevations and current the simulated free surface elevations η at different sampling locations across the reef are compared with their measured counterparts for case 1 from our experiments with roughness existing on the entre reef fig 5 incident solitary wave profile steepens when wave shoals on the fore reef slope g3 g7 wave front becomes almost vertical around the reef edge g8 resulting in a plunging breaker after that the saw like wave profiles at g9 g18 indicate that the breaker forms a turbulent bore propagating on the shallow reef flat in the meantime a cross reef decay in the first peak of η associated with the leading solitary wave can be observed which can be explained by the energy dissipation from both bore evolution and bottom friction there is also a second peak in η on the reef flat which can be explained by wave reflection from the back reef beach the agreements of wave profile between the numerical simulations and the laboratory measurements at all sampling locations are generally good implying the robustness of using the present model to account for solitary wave transformation over the fringing reef with large bottom roughness the simulated timeseries of wave run up r on the back reef slope and the mid depth streamwise velocity u at the flow sampling location v1 are compared with their measurements in figs 6 and 7 respectively the model accurately captures the entire shoreline movement even for the hydraulic jump during the wave rundown process fig 6 v1 is located at the fore reef slope and it is prior to wave breaking for this case the behavior of velocity generally follows that of the shoaling waves and good agreement between the prediction and measurement can also be observed fig 7 we then examine the numerical simulations for cases 2 3 from the experiments of quiroga and cheung 2013 where the reef roughness is located only on the fore reef slope and on the reef flat respectively figs 8 and 9 demonstrate that the model reproduces the wave profile evolution on the fore reef slope wg3 wg9 and on the reef flat wg10 wg14 reasonably well for both reefs with different roughness setups however for both cases wave heights with the leading solitary waves are slightly over predicted after the onset of wave breaking around wg10 leading to phase differences between the simulations and the measurements such phase mismatch accumulates as the turbulence bore propagates inland and it becomes observable at wg14 after the bore travels over a reef flat as wide as about 30 m 3 4 wave heights and currents across the reef and wave run ups on the back reef slope using the calibrated model parameters based on the cases in table 1 comparisons between computed and measured solitary wave heights h i from representative wave gauges across the computational domain i e g1 at offshore g5 on the fore reef slope g8 around the reef edge g12 and g16 on the reef flat as well as g18 at the back reef slope toe and wave runup on the back reef slope for all tested incident waves in our experiments see section 3 1 are made overall the model reproduces the wave heights at all locations fig 10 as well as the wave runup fig 11 very well indicating again that the model parameters as calibrated by case 1 h 0 0 08 m can be used for other waves for a given reef profile the predictions of the mid depth streamwise velocity associated with the leading solitary wave at v1 are less accurate for some incident waves due to the instabilities in the flow measurements not shown but the overall agreement is still satisfactory fig 12 4 model applications 4 1 impacts of hydrodynamic morphological and roughness element factors on the solitary wave run up after model validation we subsequently apply the model to examine the impacts of varying hydrodynamic morphological and roughness element parameters on solitary wave run up over the fringing reef profile based on case 1 in table 1 incident wave height h 0 0 08 m reef flat water level h r 0 05 m cross shore reef flat width w r 8 m fore reef slope tan α 1 6 back reef slope tan β 1 8 roughness element porosity n 0 87 roughness element mean nominal diameter d 50 0 016 m and roughness element height k s 0 025 m we test additional hydrodynamic parameter values of h 0 0 04 m 0 06 m 0 10 m 0 12 m and h r 0 025 m 0 075 m 0 10 m 0 125 m as well as morphological parameter values of w r 4 m 6 m 10 m 12 m tan α 1 1 1 3 1 9 1 12 and tan β 1 1 1 4 1 12 1 16 for the roughness element parameters we reset the tested values of n 0 85 0 88 0 91 0 94 0 97 d 50 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m and k s 0 01 m 0 02 m 0 03 m 0 04 m 0 05 m during simulations each run is implemented by altering only one of the parameters while maintaining other parameters unchanged in general the solitary wave run up on the back reef slope increases almost linearly with the increasing incident wave height fig 13 a which is anticipated since larger wave height means more incident wave energy acts on the reef profile wave run up also increases rapidly with the increasing reef flat water level fig 13b because larger water level means less wave energy dissipation associated with both wave breaking and bottom friction however wave run up declines with the increasing reef flat width fig 13c this is largely due to the enhanced frictional dissipation as waves propagates further away on the reef flat meanwhile wave run up is almost insensitive to the variation of the fore reef slope fig 13d because wave breaking in this case happens near the reef edge hence most breaking wave process and the corresponding energy attenuation is completed on the reef flat whereas wave run up appears to be more dependent on the back reef slope fig 13e it drops as the back reef slope becomes gentler in agreement with the observation for plane beach see e g synolakis 1987 as for the effects of reef surface roughness wave run up increases with the increase of roughness element porosity fig 13f which is apparently due to the less effective wave attenuation with more porous roughness layer in addition wave run up increases with the increase of the mean nominal diameter of the roughness element fig 13g because it reduces the friction term i e eq 3 according to eqs 4 and 5 meanwhile it is anticipated that wave run up will decrease notably with the increase of roughness element height in that the effect of energy dissipation increases with increasing thickness of roughness element fig 13h in summary the above analysis suggests that coastline protected by fringing reef with a smooth narrow reef flat and a steep back reef beach subjected to a large wave coinciding with a high tidal level is especially vulnerable to wave driven inundation during a tsunami event based on our simulations we propose the following empirical formula to predict the solitary wave run up 18 r h 0 c 1 w r d 50 n c 2 k s h r c 3 tan α tan β c 4 h r h 0 c 5 a best fit of eq 18 to the simulated dataset yields c 1 1 04 c 2 0 11 c 3 0 97 c 4 0 13 and c 5 0 57 with the coefficient of determination r 2 0 92 fig 14 compares the computed normalized wave run up from the numerical model r n h 0 to the predicted normalized wave run up based on eq 18 r p h 0 good agreement in fig 14 indicates the robustness of using eq 18 to predict solitary wave runup on the back reef beach of fringing reef by taking the examined hydrodynamic reef morphologic and roughness element factors into account 4 2 cross shore variations of flow and vorticity fields associated with breaking solitary wave transformation over smooth and rough reef profiles one of the advantages of the present cfd model over the depth integrated models is that it can resolve the vertical flow field associated with wave prorogation across the reef the computed wave induced current and vortices on the x z plane in different regions along the rough reef profile for case 1 in table 1 are illustrated in fig 15 in which the simulations for the smooth reef profile i e k s 0 are also shown for comparison we start from the region where the incident wave breaking occurs and in each region we show the instant t h 0 g where the leading solitary wave can be clearly identified note that t h 0 g for the rough reef generally falls behind that of the smooth reef due to the fact that waves travel slower over the rough surface for the rough reef profile around the reef edge where wave begins to break onto the horizontal reef flat fig 15a pairs of eddies with counter rotating vorticity appear mainly around the wave crest there is also a uniform velocity distribution underneath which is typical for a shallow water long wave after that stronger vorticities are produced coinciding with the formation of a propagating bore fig 15b and c and they are advected downwards to the seabed as the bore propagates further to the inner reef flat fig 15d g the intensity of vortex generation declines as the cross reef attenuation of both wave and current in the wave run up phase on the back reef beach fig 15h the vortices near the surface drop notably with the decelerated flow on the slope when wave run up reaches its peak fig 15i there is also slight vorticity produced near the bottom due to the absence of reef roughness on the back reef slope during wave rundown phase fig 15j negative counter clockwise vortex motions can be detected we also simulate the smooth reef i e there is no artificial reef roughness on the reef surface subjected to the same wave as case 1 in this way the effect of bottom roughness on solitary wave attenuation across the reef profile can be shown via a compassion of the vorticity field when comparing wave transformation over the rough reef flat fig 15a g to the smooth reef flat fig 15k q it can be found that positive clockwise vortex generation is significantly enhanced around the top of the bottom roughness layer resulting in increased wave energy dissipation in addition to wave breaking the magnitude of such kind of vorticity also decreases with the decay of wave driven current along the reef flat consequently less wave run up could be observed for the rough reef fig 15i than for the smooth reef fig 15s the investigated wave driven current and vortices could serve as a reference to examine more complicated problems such as tsunami induced sediment transport and local scouring around the reef profiles 5 conclusions to remedy the deficiencies of existing numerical models a numerical wave flume based on the cfd tool openfoam is developed in this study to investigate the solitary wave transformation and run up over fringing reefs with large bottom roughness the reef surface with high friction is modeled by a porous media model which is coupled in the rans equations with the k ω sst model for turbulence closure and the vof method for tracking the free surface the numerical model is first validated using our new laboratory experiments as well as a published laboratory dataset in the literature a fixed set of model parameters is found to be sufficient to reproduce both experiments with different wave and reef settings consistent with recommended values in the literature the model is then applied to investigate the impacts of hydrodynamic reef morphological factors and roughness elements on the solitary wave run up on the back reef beach model results shows that wave run up increases with the increase of incident wave height reef flat water level roughness element porosity and roughness element mean nominal diameter while it decreases with both the increase of cross shore reef flat width and roughness element height wave run up is almost insensitive to the variation of fore reef slope but it tends to be less with milder back reef slope an empirical formula is subsequently proposed to predict the wave run up on the back reef beach by taking the examined hydrodynamic reef morphologic and roughness element factors into consideration finally the cross shore variations of flow and vorticity fields under the breaking solitary waves are examined for both smooth and rough reef profiles the porous roughness layer is found to significantly increase the vortex generation near the porous seabed in addition to wave breaking near the wave crest the porous roughness layer significantly increases vortex generation near the

21362,the hydrodynamic characteristics of a novel twin protuberance hydrofoil design mimicking the two prominent tubercles present on a humpback whale flipper are investigated the foil has naca 634 021 section with a span chord ratio of 2 having twin leading edge protuberances each of amplitude 10 of the chord length a characteristic feature of this foil is its capability to restrict the separation zone between the chordwise vortices shed from the two humps at high angles of attack 20 deg a detailed comparison study based on experiments and cfd investigations using a transition model is presented for the twin protuberance hydrofoil with a naca 634 021 base foil and a foil with one protuberance of similar configuration the general observation is a reduced pre stall lift coefficient and maximum lift for the modified foils along with a higher post stall lift coefficient compared to the base foil the influence of reynolds number and protuberance amplitude and spacing on the

as lift enhancement devices helping in flow attachment up to a large angles of attack thus increasing the stall angle fish et al 2011 miklosovic et al 2004 depending on the foil characteristics and flow such modifications typically result in a higher post stall lift and in some cases may decrease the drag morphologically the whale flippers have high aspect ratio resembling a wing fin with a naca 634 021 airfoil section of around 21 thickness fish and battle 1995 based on observations presented in fish and kocak 2011 the largest tubercles are the first and fourth ones on the flipper from the shoulder of the whale a considerable volume of research work had been dedicated towards investigating the influence of leading edge protuberances on full span airfoils experimental results presented in johari et al 2007 at re 1 83 105 demonstrated the disadvantages for naca 634 021 airfoils with tubercles in pre stall compared to an unmodified airfoil similarly experimental zverkov et al 2008 kozlov et al 2007 and numerical aftab and ahmad 2014 results show that the wavy wing outperforms the classical wing in the post stall region numerical calculations presented in feng et al 2012 showed that the modified foil delays the stall by around 3 compared to a normal foil the flow patterns governing these outcomes were studied using dye visualization experiments custodio 2007 which indicated that pairs of counter rotating streamwise vortices were generated in the troughs between tubercles at re 1 8 105 resulting in flow attachment behind the tubercle crests in post stall hansen et al 2011a found similar effects of leading edge protuberances on naca 0021 and naca 65 021 foils at re 1 2 105 using wind tunnel experiments the generated vortices increase the effective span akram and baig 2013 by reducing spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex similarly bolzon et al 2016 suggested that after 6 angle of attack protuberances reduced the strength of the wingtip vortex the stream wise vortices also lead to reduction in pressure noise as suggested by charalambous and eames 2017 particle image velocimetry piv results presented in chen and wang 2014 show that a delta wing with sinusoidal leading edge tubercles delays the stall compared to the baseline delta wing smoke wire visualizations by hasheminejad et al 2014 over a flat plate with leading edge periodic patterns show the presence of counter rotating vortices in the downstream area of each trough rostamzadeh et al 2014 found that a skew induced flow mechanism accounts for the formation of streamwise vortices the design of the protuberances is generally expressed using two parameters the height of the hump i e amplitude a and the extent of each hump along the span i e wavelength λ these parameters along with the general wing profile have been found to play a vital role in flow modifications in custodio et al 2018 2015 the influence of sinusoidal tubercles of different amplitude and wavelength on naca 634 021 hydrofoil in the increase of stall angle and post stall lift coefficient is studied bai et al 2015 found that the thrust of a modified vertical axis wind turbine vawt blade with naca0015 airfoil section is lower than the straight blade and its value decreases with increase in amplitude and decrease in wavelengths corsini et al 2013 showed that a symmetric foil with leading edge tubercles recover lift in the post stall region whereas similar modifications over a cambered foil may give a higher maximum lift coefficient natarajan et al 2014 presented an experimental study using piv at reynolds number of re 1 2 105 where the length and height of the laminar separation bubble at pre stall angles is reduced in the airfoil with tubercles compared to baseline naca 4415 airfoil lin et al 2013 suggested through a numerical study that foils having sinusoidal waviness in both leading and trailing edges as well as on the upper and lower surface have better lift coefficient after stall than the baseline foil naca0012 flow investigations on hydrofoils using piv and particle streak visualizations revealed that the flow separation control depends on the tubercle amplitude wavelength ratio and for larger ratios flow separation control is better wei et al 2015 piv stanway and techet 2006 and particle streak photography experiments new et al 2014 indicated that the flow separation bubble size is smaller along the peak and larger along the trough of a leading edge tubercle compared to the mid span of an unmodified foil the influence of tubercle amplitude and wavelength on foil performance at low reynolds number can be found in hansen et al 2010 it was observed in zhang et al 2014 2013 that the flow at the foil leading edge at high angles of attack separates from the trough of the protuberances while being still attached to the crest sections also in some recent experimental cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and numerical cai et al 2015 malipeddi et al 2012 investigations it was reported that the flow passing through the leading edge protuberances are asymmetric and aperiodic in nature these contours have been explained by the formation of low pressure pockets between the troughs in pre stall which evolve in a complicated pattern in the post stall regime dropkin et al 2012 skillen et al 2015 based on the observed performance benefits protuberances have found diverse engineering applications inclusion of protuberances over the leading edge of compressor turbine blade dewar et al 2013 can help in reducing the noise and increment of power and efficiency in a certain range watt and fish watts and fish 2006 patented a wing with smoothly varying tubercles with alternately forward and aft sweep having deployable or retractable capability which could also be used for housing instruments zibkoff 2009 added tubercles over the leading edge of the spoke of a bicycle wheel to generate vortex structures and reduce the aerodynamic drag of the wheel most of the published research works on leading edge protuberances have considered infinite span foils the relatively limited literature available on low aspect ratio foils with leading edge protuberances e guerreiro and m sousa 2012 johari et al 2007 miklosovic et al 2004 2007 pedro and kobayashi 2008 watts and fish 2001 weber et al 2010 wei et al 2019 is summarized in table 1 considering the case of a foils with finite aspect ratio there is a strong 3 d effect resulting in induced velocity and downwash causing significant reduction of the lift coefficient this has been reported by hansen et al 2011b for foils with both unmodified and modified leading edges experiments conducted by miklosovic et al 2007 indicate a reduced loss in pre stall lift and a higher gain in post stall lift for a semi span foil with sinusoidal leading edge compared to a similarly modified full span foil 1 2 why two protuberances considering the available literature on leading edge modified foils presented till now the modifications were restricted to uniformly distributed humps protuberances over the span of the foil however some efforts have been made towards investigating the effects of a more tailored modification which deviates from the uniform design a numerical study performed by arai et al 2010 on a naca0018 airfoil having protuberances on the leading edge separated at distances which was found to work more effectively compared to that of the continuous protuberance numerical study presented in gawad 2013 for a naca0012 airfoil having spherical tubercles separated by 20 of chord also help in delaying the stall numerical and experimental investigations were presented in cai et al 2018 on a foil having a single protuberance on the leading edge which was able to generate asymmetric flow patterns and streamwise vortices as of continuous protuberances the lifting characteristics of a marine rudder presented in srinivas et al 2018 with leading edge tubercle distribution similar to that observed in a humpback whale the separation zone at high angles of attack was found to be restricted by the large tubercles which led to better post stall lift characteristics compared to a rudder with uniform leading edge tubercles now a humpback whale flipper consists of many tubercles out of which two are most prominent in terms of amplitude the first and the fourth tubercles it would be of interest therefore to simplify the leading edge design by just adding twin protuberances to obtain superior post stall lift this may also aid the practical implementation due to less complications of reproducing the design compared to a fully wavy leading edge design in the twin protuberance hydrofoil design the two protuberances are of similar geometry located asymmetrically about the mid span one at a distance 18 of span and the other at 40 of span from the respective nearest ends of the span their locations are compared to the bio mimicked configurations adopted by srinivas et al 2018 and fish et al 2011 in fig 1 2 hydrofoil geometry the base hydrofoil has a symmetric naca 634 021 section having span s 200 mm and chord length c 100 mm as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system is defined such that the span is in the z direction and the chord along the x direction two modified designs are created from the base foil fb a foil with a single leading edge protuberance at mid span ft1 and the design foil with two protuberances over the leading edge ft2 as shown in fig 3 the sectional details of the modified foil ft2 are shown in fig 4 the intermediate section in fig 4 is taken at a distance λ 6 from the trough just to show the change in sectional geometry of the foil from trough to crest the leading edge protuberances of the modified hydrofoil ft2 are defined geometrically using equation 1 1 δ c a sin 2 π z z i λ z i z z f ᾱ and λ are the amplitude wavelength of the protuberances z i and z f are the initial and final z coordinates of the protuberances over the leading edge the choice of wavelength and amplitude value is based on previous works on bio inspired rudders srinivas et al 2018 and foils with single tubercle configuration cai et al 2018 a study of lift and drag dependence on the amplitude variation is presented in section 4 4 the details of amplitude and wavelength for all foils are listed in table 2 3 methodology a detailed comparative study of the lift drag characteristics for the three foils is performed using both numerical and experimental methods numerical investigations of flow patterns at different angles of attack as well as the reynolds number influence on foil performance are also presented 3 1 numerical investigations using cfd 3 1 1 implementation of transition model the numerical investigations are performed using the rans solver of the commercial software star ccm the γ reθ transition model is used in conjunction with the k ω sst turbulence model which is a prerequisite for the γ reθ transition model for the numerical analyses the detailed implementation of the γ reθ in starccm has been described in malan et al 2009 the governing equations used are the modified form of the k ω sst turbulence model with the γ reθ transition model which consists of the mass conservation and two transport equations as follows 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ d k d t x j μ σ k μ t k x j γ e f f μ t s 2 ρ k u j x j min max γ e f f 0 1 1 ρ β ω k 4 ρ d ω d t x j μ σ ω μ t ω x j α μ t s 2 ρ k u j x j ρ β ω 2 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω δ k δ x j δ ω δ x j in the above equations u i represents the flow velocity in i direction ρ the density k turbulence kinetic energy ω the specific turbulence dissipation rate s is the strain rate tensor modulus γeff the effective intermittency y normal distance from the nearest wall and μt is the turbulent eddy viscosity of the fluid the γ reθ transition model consist of two transport equations for γ the intermittency and reθt the transported transition momentum thickness reynolds number as follows 5 ρ d γ d t x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j f l e n g t h c a 1 ρ s γ f o n s e t 0 5 1 c e 1 γ c a 2 ρ ω γ f t u r b 1 c e 2 γ 6 ρ d r e θ t d t x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j c θ t ρ u 2 500 μ re θ t r e θ t 1 f θ t where u is the local velocity magnitude and ω the vorticity tensor modulus in order to control the onset and length of transition flength and fonset are used for detecting and controlling the boundary layer fturb and fθt are used the transition model used here is a correlation based model in which the value of intermittency γ depends on the transition momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t through a correlation defined in the free stream the variable reθt is defined by a value of wall distance which is used to transport the free stream value to the boundary layer the free stream value is defined using a field function which specifies the location of freestream in terms of iso surface the iso value is defined based on the distance from the cell centroid to the nearest wall as described in malan et al 2009 the effect of ti turbulence intensity and tvr turbulence viscosity ratio on the drag coefficient for a flat plate and a foil section were described in bhattacharyya et al 2015 the turbulence viscosity ratio plays a vital role in the transition model study a smaller value leads to higher turbulence decay while a higher value of it causes excessive diffusion it is observed that the inlet turbulence intensity reduces to 50 when it reaches the leading edge of the foil to avoid this a turbulent kinetic energy source has been used as mentioned in bhattacharyya et al 2015 the turbulence kinetic energy source term is specified as in equation 7 7 k s o u r c e 3 2 t i r e q u i r e d 2 t i e x i s t i n g 2 u 2 here ksource is the turbulence source strength u is the flow velocity at the inlet tirequired is the turbulence intensity required and tiexisting is the turbulence existing in the domain the introduction of source term maintains the turbulence intensity in the domain of interest and it is terminated by a switch function in front of the foil to avoid building up of additional turbulence in the boundary layer the kinetic energy sources are distributed from the inlet to a distance 0 5c ahead of foil leading edge fig 5 3 1 2 computational domain and mesh the cfd solver is based on the finite volume method in which the convective and viscous terms are discretized by a second order upwind scheme and a second order central difference scheme respectively the simple semi implicit method algorithm is used to enforce pressure velocity coupling and the first order implicit scheme was applied for transient formulation a cylindrical computational flow domain is used around the hydrofoil as shown in fig 6 the outer boundary radius is set as 5c whereas the inlet and outlet are at distances of 5c and 13c from leading and trailing edges respectively the computational domain size is chosen based on published works for example arai et al 2010 and the outlet is positioned to avoid potential interference with the boundaries and also for the wake effects to stabilize see for example dropkin et al 2012 and rostamzadeh et al 2017 the total grid size of the computational domain is around 2 million where the domain is discretized using polyhedral cells with prism layers in the boundary layer for better resolution of velocity gradients and flow separations two volumetric cylinders for local mesh refinement are placed at the leading edge and trailing edge of the hydrofoil to capture the high velocity gradient in those regions the domain boundaries and mesh are shown in figs 6 and 7 the mesh size of the leading edge curve is set as 2 of base size base size is 30 of chord length the height of the first mesh cell from the surface must have a suitable size to ensure a reasonably accurate simulation of the flow field a non dimensional wall distance for wall bounded flow is defined by equation 8 8 y u y v ρ y μ τ w a l l ρ y ρ μ u y y 0 here y is the distance to the nearest wall u is the frictional velocity at the nearest wall v is the kinematic viscosity is the density of water μ is the dynamic viscosity and τwall is the wall shear stress y is specified as 2 of base size on the foil surface the growth rate of the prism layer is 1 3 the wall y value less than 1 is maintained near the foil boundary the free stream edge definition for the γ reθ transition model is defined as 1 mm i e 1 of chord length from the foil surface malan et al 2009 and accordingly the low y wall treatment is used for good resolution of the boundary layer velocities and transition patterns 3 1 3 grid uncertainty study a grid dependency study is performed for fb and ft2 at 15 deg angle of attack as shown in fig 8 where reasonable convergence of cl and cd are obtained after domain resolution of 2 million cells grid uncertainty is estimated by three symmetrical refined grids fine medium and coarse with refinement ratio of 2 the computed force coefficient at 22 5 deg angle of attack is shown in table 3 a convergence ratio rg is estimated for the lift coefficient as follows r g m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 0 33 hence rg 1 for lift coefficient which shows mesh convergence in the fluid domain error of the fine grid δ reg 1 and order of accuracy p g is computed using generalized richardson extrapolation xing and stern 2010 cg is the correction factor and pgest pth 2 is used in the below equation δ r e g 1 m 2 m 1 r g p g 1 5 10 4 0 084 of m 1 p g ln m 3 m 2 m 2 m 1 ln r g 3 17 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 1 99 since cg 1 99 is considered as not close to the asymptotic range the grid uncertainty ug estimated error of the fine grid δg and the corrected solution sc are then evaluated as follows u g 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 49 10 3 0 25 of m 1 δ g c g δ r e g 1 9 95 10 4 0 167 of m 1 s c s g δ g 0 592 in the similar way the convergence ratio rg of drag coefficient r g m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 0 8 the above verification shows that the grid convergence is good enough to capture lift and drag coefficients in addition the uncertainty of the lift coefficient for medium grid is also estimated since sc 0 592 the generalized richardson extrapolation can again be used to estimate the error of the medium grid to be 1 10 3 using the same method stated above the uncertainty for the medium grid is estimated as 0 5 of m2 the uncertainty of the medium grid is larger than the fine grid however the computational time for fine mesh is very high since the medium grid results are also in the acceptable range the medium grid is used for the entire numerical study also reasonable comparisons of lift and drag coefficients at different angles of attack are obtained with the medium grid when compared with the experimental results 3 2 experimental investigation 3 2 1 methodology the experiments were conducted in the towing tank fig 9 in the department of ocean engineering and naval architecture at iit kharagpur the tank dimensions are 150 m length 4 m breadth 2 5 m depth the tank is equipped with a towing carriage to which the foil is connected using a structural mount a stepper motor is used to rotate the foil and it is attached to a 3600 pulse per revolution encoder which gives feedback for the actual rotational displacement lift and drag forces are measured using a multi axis load cell with a corresponding measurement range of 50 n 2 5nm the load cell has a hysteresis of 0 5 of rated load and non linearity of 0 5 of rated load different foils models are alternately mounted and connected to a multi axis load cell using a connecting rod fig 10 the force measurements for the hydrofoils are corrected for the rod drag force measurements averaged over 20 s are collected via national instruments usb 9188 data acquisition system a uniform flow velocity of 2 m s is obtained by moving the carriage on rails installed along the length of the tank to avoid free surface effect on the foil models the foil top faces are kept at 1 5c from the free surface fig 11 the blockage ratio is comparatively very small and therefore neglected in the calculation the forces are obtained in the form of voltage from load cell measurements next these values are substituted in the calibration equation to get lift and drag forces 3 2 2 uncertainty analysis to understand the repeatability of the experimental results an estimation of precision uncertainty is performed by taking five repeated measurements for lift and drag coefficient at α 15 for ft2 the calculated uncertainties at 95 confidence interval are typically less than 2 for lift and drag coefficients the bias error as outlined in coleman et al 1999 may arise in the force coefficients due to the intrinsic uncertainty of the load cell and carriage velocity measurements as well as uncertainty in foil dimensions the uncertainty for load cell forces can be calculated using the maximum and minimum values of unprocessed data with its averaged value over 1000 samples the resulting uncertainty for the lift force at u 2 m s and α 15 is 0 4 n the carriage velocity has an uncertainty of 0 05 m s and the uncertainty in the span and chord lengths measured at several spanwise locations is less than 1 mm the total 95 confidence uncertainty including bias and precision errors for drag and lift coefficients is calculated to be less than 5 2 4 results and discussions the numerical set up is first validated with experimental results for the base foil having the naca 634 021 section thereafter the lift and drag characteristics of the three hydrofoils are investigated using both cfd and experimental approaches detailed performance comparisons and flow analyses at different angles of attack for the twin protuberance foil ft2 are made with the base foil fb and the single protuberance design ft1 4 1 validation study for the validation study the lift and drag coefficients of the base foil naca 634 021 computed using cfd are compared with experimental results in fig 12 in general a good agreement of lift and drag coefficients is observed between the numerical and experimental results the error bars shown for drag and lift coefficients for numerical and experimental results are based on the uncertainty analyses presented in section 3 1 3 and 3 2 2 respectively 4 2 comparison of twin protuberance ft2 single protuberance ft1 and base hydrofoil fb cases the lift and drag coefficients and lift drag ratio of ft2 ft1 and fb at different angles of attack for reynolds number of 2 105 are shown in fig 13 the baseline hydrofoil has a higher lift coefficient in the pre stall region which shows a sharp decline after stall due to the presence of tubercles the stall occurs gradually for ft2 and ft1 as reported for a single tubercle foil in cai et al 2015 the lift coefficients for ft2 and ft1 in the post stall region at α 22 5 are 15 and 13 higher than fb respectively the differences are magnified at α 25 the drag coefficient for all three hydrofoils is almost similar for the entire range of α from the cl cd curve it can be seen that baseline foil has better performance in the pre stall region than ft2 and ft1 due to the high lift coefficient among the modified designs ft2 has marginally superior post stall performance the experimental results for the three selected foils at different angles of attack are shown in fig 14 indicating a similar pattern as of the numerical results additionally the cl and cd for the modified foils obtained from experiments are compared with cfd results in figure 15 and 16 in general a good agreement is observed for the entire range of α the increase in the post stall lift coefficient for ft1 and ft2 is also clearly visible from the experimental results the lift force for a 3d foil depends on the flow pattern over the pressure and suction sides and tips which result in a pressure difference depending on the alignment to the incoming flow the suction side flow separation at high angles of attack is linked to stall characteristics associated with a drop in the lift coefficient in order to study the flow characteristics for the three foils the pressure coefficient cp over the suction surface are plotted in fig 17 at five angles of attack 5 α 25 the pressure coefficient is given as c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 here cp is the pressure coefficient p is the static pressure on the hydrofoil p is the static pressure in the freestream ρ is the fluid density and u is the uniform inlet velocity at α 15 the flow remains attached to the foils fb ft1 and ft2 from the leading edge to the trailing edge since the pressure coefficient increases smoothly towards the trailing edge for fb at α 15 and 20 the flow separation is indicated by a constant cp after 15 25 of chord length from the leading edge for the modified foils cp is constant from the leading edge along the crest of protuberance which leads to larger flow separation as compared to fb however along the trough cp increases smoothly which makes the flow to remain attached at α 20 deg large flow separation can be seen over the entire suction surface of fb as cp is uniform over the suction surface but for the modified foil ft2 the low pressure zones are formed from both ends of span to the trough of the protuberances which makes the flow to be attached in that region these pressure contours over the suction surface show similar patterns to those presented in dropkin et al 2012 the flow separation patterns over the three foils are investigated by plotting the reversed velocity contours in fig 18 for the base foil the domain of separation increases rapidly at higher α and extends up to the leading edge at α 22 5 the modified foils however can restrict the separation zone due to the streamwise vortices generated from the protuberances especially for ft2 the chordwise vortices from the twin protuberances interact strongly at α 22 5 which results in a greater control of the post stall separation domain as shown in fig 19 this is a characteristic feature for the twin protuberance foil which can be utilized for flow control to provide effective post stall performance the difference in cl between the three foils is prominent in the post stall region hence to understand the streamwise vortex structures shed from the protuberances vorticity magnitudes over the foils are plotted in fig 19 for α 25 for the base foil vortices are formed at the two ends of the span only for the two modified foils chordwise vortices are generated from the protuberances and they roll up extending beyond the trailing edge the chordwise pressure distributions over the crest and trough of the modified foils are compared with the base foil for α 15 and 25 in figs 20 and 21 respectively here x c 0 5 denotes the leading edge and x c 0 5 denotes the trailing edge of the foils at α 15 the pressure over suction surface accelerates sharply and after reaching the peak it decelerates causing an adverse pressure gradient for the modified foils ft2 and ft1 the boundary layer remains attached up to x c 0 40 just behind the crest thereafter the boundary layer separates from the upper surface of the foil due to which the length of the separation zone extends to the trailing edge along the trough of ft2 a higher suction pressure coefficient amplitude is observed similar to baseline foil but the peak amplitude is less for ft1 and the flow separates at x c 0 4 fig 21 shows the pressure distribution comparision at α 25 due to a high angle of attack the flow for fb starts to separate from the leading edge the suction pressure for ft2 and ft1 along the crest show similar distribution as of the baseline foil however the peak suction pressure amplitude is increased considerably for modified foils along the trough the boundary layer remains attached till x c 0 04 and 0 01 for ft2 and ft1 respectively after which the flow is fully separated the lengths of the separation along the trough for ft2 and ft1 are 0 56c and 0 59c respectively the differences in pressure coefficient over the suction surface for the modified foils explain the increase in lift coefficient in the post stall region the flow distribution and pressure coefficient plots indicate that the separation over the modified foils is a three dimensional phenomenon depending on the aspect ratio and leading edge configuration the investigations are presented at re 2 105 where the flow around the hydrofoil changes from laminar to turbulent in most cases to understand the transition nature of flow the distribution of intermittency γ which varies from 0 fully laminar to 1 fully turbulent over the hydrofoil is shown in figs 22 24 at different angles of attack 5 15 and 25 deg the flow on the upper surface is laminar and gradually transitions to a turbulent flow a variable a x y is used to show the length of turbulent boundary layer in different sections along the chord for the three hydrofoils here x 0 1 and 2 represents the foils fb ft1 and ft2 respectively while y 1 2 and 3 defines the three different sections i ii iii along the chord fig 22 shows that a x y for fb is similar in all three sections as expected however for ft1 and ft2 the transition zone varies over the three sections due to strong influence of the chordwise vortices from the protuberances at α 15 the transition length differs for ft1 and ft2 along the three sections depending on the location i e crest or trough of protuberance along the section along the crest the flow is in transition for lesser length compared to the trough section due to the formation of the vortex by the protuberances for the base foil it is somewhat constant in all three sections in the post stall case at α 25 the flow around the three foils is mostly turbulent adverse pressure gradients in lower troughs of ft2 due to vortices shed from the two protuberances cause the flow to remain in transition for larger length compared to the other foils from the transition plots of twin protuberances at α 15 and 25 deg figs 23 and 24 it can be seen that the flow is in a longer transition state at outer trough sec iii compared to the crest sec ii and the inner trough sec i to understand this phenomena it is important to study the corresponding vorticity development over the sections and this is shown using plots of vorticity magnitudes at five representative sections of the foil ft2 in fig 25 at α 15 deg the end section a shows strong vorticity magnitude over the chord due to the tip vortices fig 25 among the other sections the leading edge vortex is much stronger at the trough c and moves towards the crest as it travels along the chord at α 25 deg the location of higher vorticity over the crests b and d shifts towards the leading edge it is well established that tubercles trigger a turbulent boundary layer hansen et al 2011b interestingly the turbulence extents are different behind the crest and trough of the protuberances due to the pattern of vortices mentioned above similar observations are reported in johari et al 2007 where the flow over the peaks of protuberances remain attached at angles of attack greater than 20 deg however the vortex patterns over the two troughs c and e in fig 25 are quite different as the foil ft2 has discrete protuberances which are located asymmetrically over the span 4 3 reynolds number influence on foil performance the intermittency for ft2 at higher reynolds number 6 105 and 9 105 at α 15 is shown in fig 26 it can be seen that γ values is 1 over a large part of the domain indicating the flow around the foil at higher re to be mostly turbulent therefore for investigation at higher re k ω sst model without transition is used the comparison of lift and drag coefficients at three different reynolds numbers 2 105 6 105 and 9 105 for ft2 is shown in fig 27 the lift coefficient is found to increase significantly for α 10 especially at re 9 105 the stall characteristics are however very much similar for all the reynolds numbers the drag coefficient does not change much in the range of reynolds numbers investigated a comparison of the lift coefficient of ft2 relative to the base foil fb for three different reynolds numbers is presented in fig 28 the ratio of lift coefficients greater than 1 indicates that the modified foil produces higher lift compared to the base foil and vice versa the main observation from fig 28 is a higher cl in pre stall conditions for the base foil and in post stall conditions for ft2 also the comparative performance of the twin protuberance foil improves considerably at re 9 105 4 4 influence of protuberance amplitude for ft2 in this section the performance of the twin protuberance foil ft2 is investigated with two amplitude variations 0 1c and 0 15c of the protuberances the results at two reynolds numbers 2 105 and 9 105 are presented in fig 29 at the lower value of re the foil having smaller amplitude protuberance 0 1c has a higher lift coefficient in the pre stall region while the foil having higher amplitude 0 15c protuberances has higher lift for α 22 5 at the higher re value the foil ft2 with smaller amplitude protuberance 0 1c generates higher lift over almost the entire range of angle of attacks α 10 the lift is lower for ft2 a 0 15c than ft2 a 0 10c in the pre stall region which indicates having protuberance of larger amplitude reduces the lift characteristics the difference in pre stall is mostly noticeable at α 10 and 12 5 to understand the effect of protuberance amplitude a vorticity magnitude and pressure coefficient over suction surface are shown for the two foils at re 2 105 for α 12 5 in figs 30 and 31 fig 30 shows that the foil with lower amplitude protuberances has higher value of vorticity over larger area on the suction surface which cause higher momentum transfer to the boundary layer leading to greater lift force this can also be visualized from the pressure coefficient plots in fig 31 which show that the low pressure regions reside between the two protuberances and the zone downstream of the leading edge of both the foils the pressure coefficient over ft2 a 0 10c is lower due to higher vorticity magnitude resulting in a greater pressure difference and lift coefficient 4 5 influence of protuberance spacing for ft2 to understand the influence of protuberance spacing two additional variants of the twin protuberance foil are generated ft2 s1 having spacing 20 of span and ft2 s2 having spacing 60 of span unlike the foil ft2 the arrangement of protuberances over the leading edge of the two new variants are kept symmetrical about mid span hence ft2 s1 has a lower protuberance spacing and ft2 s2 has a higher protuberance spacing as compared to ft2 the amplitude of both the protuberances is kept constant 0 1c for all the cases the cl and cl cd comparisons for four cases fb ft2 s1 ft2 and ft2 s2 at re 2 105 are shown in fig 32 it is observed that the foil ft2 s2 with largely spaced protuberances behaves very similar to the base foil with significantly higher maximum lift and inferior post stall performance the foil ft2 s1 with the least spacing between the protuberances has the best post stall performance α 22 5 however the cl cd ratio for both ft2 s1 and ft2 s2 are comparatively lower for α 10 the lift and drag characteristics for foils with leading edge modifications are strongly related to the chordwise vortices shed from the protuberances as the difference in cl between the three modified designs is maximum at α 25 the corresponding vorticity plots are shown in fig 33 to understand the effect of spacing both ft2 s1 and ft2 show strong vorticity generated from the protuberances the magnitude over the leading edge increasing with a reduction in spacing for ft2 s1 the effect is visible in increased post stall lift shown in fig 32 as the spacing is increased for ft2 s2 the domain of higher vorticity is mostly restricted towards the ends of the span leading to lower post stall lift coefficients similar to the base foil without protuberances it can hence be concluded that the twin protuberance configuration provides sufficient scope for modification of the foil performance by tuning the two parameters amplitude and spacing of the leading edge protuberances 5 conclusions the lift drag and flow characteristics of a finite span hydrofoil of naca 634 021 section with twin protuberances over the leading edge are investigated using experiments as well as a transition sensitive cfd model the results are presented in the light of comparison with a naca 634 021 base foil and a foil with single leading edge protuberance while the base foil has a prominent advantage in terms of the pre stall lift the post stall lifting performance is higher for the modified foils the use of two protuberances over the leading edge gives an enhanced post stall lift due to a reduced separation zone caused by the interaction of the two chordwise vortices over the suction side the leading edge vortex and its evolution along the chord of trough and crest sections of the protuberances is instrumental in flow attachment and turbulization at high angles of attack the lift characteristics depend on the amplitude of the protuberances the higher post stall lift coefficient is consistent in the range of reynolds numbers from 2 105 to 9 105 for the hydrofoil with two protuberances the amplitude and spacing of the two protuberances have a prominent effect on the lifting characteristics at both pre stall and post stall angles of attack the special feature of the twin protuberance foil design is that depending on the operation regime its performance can be substantially varied by tailoring the leading edge geometry especially the positioning of the two protuberances the bio mimicked foil designed by mimicking the two prominent protuberances of the humpback whale can hence be used effectively for control of flow and separation providing good lifting performance at high angles of attack author contributions r kant methodology

21362,the hydrodynamic characteristics of a novel twin protuberance hydrofoil design mimicking the two prominent tubercles present on a humpback whale flipper are investigated the foil has naca 634 021 section with a span chord ratio of 2 having twin leading edge protuberances each of amplitude 10 of the chord length a characteristic feature of this foil is its capability to restrict the separation zone between the chordwise vortices shed from the two humps at high angles of attack 20 deg a detailed comparison study based on experiments and cfd investigations using a transition model is presented for the twin protuberance hydrofoil with a naca 634 021 base foil and a foil with one protuberance of similar configuration the general observation is a reduced pre stall lift coefficient and maximum lift for the modified foils along with a higher post stall lift coefficient compared to the base foil the influence of reynolds number and protuberance amplitude and spacing on the hydrodynamic performance is also investigated the results indicate that such modifications can be used effectively for flow control at high angles of attack and suitably optimized for specific marine

modifications on hydrofoils inspired from protuberances present on the flippers of humpback whales have been widely investigated due to their ability to provide enhanced lift at high angles of attack 1 1 literature review humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae are exceptionally manoeuvrable as compared to other whale species which is attributed to the presence of specific protuberance or hump like structures called tubercles over the leading edge of their flippers bushnell and moore 1991 fish and battle 1995 this has sparked considerable interest among researchers and designers to use these modifications for achieving passive flow control over foils bushnell and moore 1991 fish 1999 fish and battle 1995 fish and lauder 2006 it has been established that leading edge protuberances function as lift enhancement devices helping in flow attachment up to a large angles of attack thus increasing the stall angle fish et al 2011 miklosovic et al 2004 depending on the foil characteristics and flow such modifications typically result in a higher post stall lift and in some cases may decrease the drag morphologically the whale flippers have high aspect ratio resembling a wing fin with a naca 634 021 airfoil section of around 21 thickness fish and battle 1995 based on observations presented in fish and kocak 2011 the largest tubercles are the first and fourth ones on the flipper from the shoulder of the whale a considerable volume of research work had been dedicated towards investigating the influence of leading edge protuberances on full span airfoils experimental results presented in johari et al 2007 at re 1 83 105 demonstrated the disadvantages for naca 634 021 airfoils with tubercles in pre stall compared to an unmodified airfoil similarly experimental zverkov et al 2008 kozlov et al 2007 and numerical aftab and ahmad 2014 results show that the wavy wing outperforms the classical wing in the post stall region numerical calculations presented in feng et al 2012 showed that the modified foil delays the stall by around 3 compared to a normal foil the flow patterns governing these outcomes were studied using dye visualization experiments custodio 2007 which indicated that pairs of counter rotating streamwise vortices were generated in the troughs between tubercles at re 1 8 105 resulting in flow attachment behind the tubercle crests in post stall hansen et al 2011a found similar effects of leading edge protuberances on naca 0021 and naca 65 021 foils at re 1 2 105 using wind tunnel experiments the generated vortices increase the effective span akram and baig 2013 by reducing spanwise flow and strength of the tip vortex similarly bolzon et al 2016 suggested that after 6 angle of attack protuberances reduced the strength of the wingtip vortex the stream wise vortices also lead to reduction in pressure noise as suggested by charalambous and eames 2017 particle image velocimetry piv results presented in chen and wang 2014 show that a delta wing with sinusoidal leading edge tubercles delays the stall compared to the baseline delta wing smoke wire visualizations by hasheminejad et al 2014 over a flat plate with leading edge periodic patterns show the presence of counter rotating vortices in the downstream area of each trough rostamzadeh et al 2014 found that a skew induced flow mechanism accounts for the formation of streamwise vortices the design of the protuberances is generally expressed using two parameters the height of the hump i e amplitude a and the extent of each hump along the span i e wavelength λ these parameters along with the general wing profile have been found to play a vital role in flow modifications in custodio et al 2018 2015 the influence of sinusoidal tubercles of different amplitude and wavelength on naca 634 021 hydrofoil in the increase of stall angle and post stall lift coefficient is studied bai et al 2015 found that the thrust of a modified vertical axis wind turbine vawt blade with naca0015 airfoil section is lower than the straight blade and its value decreases with increase in amplitude and decrease in wavelengths corsini et al 2013 showed that a symmetric foil with leading edge tubercles recover lift in the post stall region whereas similar modifications over a cambered foil may give a higher maximum lift coefficient natarajan et al 2014 presented an experimental study using piv at reynolds number of re 1 2 105 where the length and height of the laminar separation bubble at pre stall angles is reduced in the airfoil with tubercles compared to baseline naca 4415 airfoil lin et al 2013 suggested through a numerical study that foils having sinusoidal waviness in both leading and trailing edges as well as on the upper and lower surface have better lift coefficient after stall than the baseline foil naca0012 flow investigations on hydrofoils using piv and particle streak visualizations revealed that the flow separation control depends on the tubercle amplitude wavelength ratio and for larger ratios flow separation control is better wei et al 2015 piv stanway and techet 2006 and particle streak photography experiments new et al 2014 indicated that the flow separation bubble size is smaller along the peak and larger along the trough of a leading edge tubercle compared to the mid span of an unmodified foil the influence of tubercle amplitude and wavelength on foil performance at low reynolds number can be found in hansen et al 2010 it was observed in zhang et al 2014 2013 that the flow at the foil leading edge at high angles of attack separates from the trough of the protuberances while being still attached to the crest sections also in some recent experimental cai et al 2018 zhang et al 2014 and numerical cai et al 2015 malipeddi et al 2012 investigations it was reported that the flow passing through the leading edge protuberances are asymmetric and aperiodic in nature these contours have been explained by the formation of low pressure pockets between the troughs in pre stall which evolve in a complicated pattern in the post stall regime dropkin et al 2012 skillen et al 2015 based on the observed performance benefits protuberances have found diverse engineering applications inclusion of protuberances over the leading edge of compressor turbine blade dewar et al 2013 can help in reducing the noise and increment of power and efficiency in a certain range watt and fish watts and fish 2006 patented a wing with smoothly varying tubercles with alternately forward and aft sweep having deployable or retractable capability which could also be used for housing instruments zibkoff 2009 added tubercles over the leading edge of the spoke of a bicycle wheel to generate vortex structures and reduce the aerodynamic drag of the wheel most of the published research works on leading edge protuberances have considered infinite span foils the relatively limited literature available on low aspect ratio foils with leading edge protuberances e guerreiro and m sousa 2012 johari et al 2007 miklosovic et al 2004 2007 pedro and kobayashi 2008 watts and fish 2001 weber et al 2010 wei et al 2019 is summarized in table 1 considering the case of a foils with finite aspect ratio there is a strong 3 d effect resulting in induced velocity and downwash causing significant reduction of the lift coefficient this has been reported by hansen et al 2011b for foils with both unmodified and modified leading edges experiments conducted by miklosovic et al 2007 indicate a reduced loss in pre stall lift and a higher gain in post stall lift for a semi span foil with sinusoidal leading edge compared to a similarly modified full span foil 1 2 why two protuberances considering the available literature on leading edge modified foils presented till now the modifications were restricted to uniformly distributed humps protuberances over the span of the foil however some efforts have been made towards investigating the effects of a more tailored modification which deviates from the uniform design a numerical study performed by arai et al 2010 on a naca0018 airfoil having protuberances on the leading edge separated at distances which was found to work more effectively compared to that of the continuous protuberance numerical study presented in gawad 2013 for a naca0012 airfoil having spherical tubercles separated by 20 of chord also help in delaying the stall numerical and experimental investigations were presented in cai et al 2018 on a foil having a single protuberance on the leading edge which was able to generate asymmetric flow patterns and streamwise vortices as of continuous protuberances the lifting characteristics of a marine rudder presented in srinivas et al 2018 with leading edge tubercle distribution similar to that observed in a humpback whale the separation zone at high angles of attack was found to be restricted by the large tubercles which led to better post stall lift characteristics compared to a rudder with uniform leading edge tubercles now a humpback whale flipper consists of many tubercles out of which two are most prominent in terms of amplitude the first and the fourth tubercles it would be of interest therefore to simplify the leading edge design by just adding twin protuberances to obtain superior post stall lift this may also aid the practical implementation due to less complications of reproducing the design compared to a fully wavy leading edge design in the twin protuberance hydrofoil design the two protuberances are of similar geometry located asymmetrically about the mid span one at a distance 18 of span and the other at 40 of span from the respective nearest ends of the span their locations are compared to the bio mimicked configurations adopted by srinivas et al 2018 and fish et al 2011 in fig 1 2 hydrofoil geometry the base hydrofoil has a symmetric naca 634 021 section having span s 200 mm and chord length c 100 mm as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system is defined such that the span is in the z direction and the chord along the x direction two modified designs are created from the base foil fb a foil with a single leading edge protuberance at mid span ft1 and the design foil with two protuberances over the leading edge ft2 as shown in fig 3 the sectional details of the modified foil ft2 are shown in fig 4 the intermediate section in fig 4 is taken at a distance λ 6 from the trough just to show the change in sectional geometry of the foil from trough to crest the leading edge protuberances of the modified hydrofoil ft2 are defined geometrically using equation 1 1 δ c a sin 2 π z z i λ z i z z f ᾱ and λ are the amplitude wavelength of the protuberances z i and z f are the initial and final z coordinates of the protuberances over the leading edge the choice of wavelength and amplitude value is based on previous works on bio inspired rudders srinivas et al 2018 and foils with single tubercle configuration cai et al 2018 a study of lift and drag dependence on the amplitude variation is presented in section 4 4 the details of amplitude and wavelength for all foils are listed in table 2 3 methodology a detailed comparative study of the lift drag characteristics for the three foils is performed using both numerical and experimental methods numerical investigations of flow patterns at different angles of attack as well as the reynolds number influence on foil performance are also presented 3 1 numerical investigations using cfd 3 1 1 implementation of transition model the numerical investigations are performed using the rans solver of the commercial software star ccm the γ reθ transition model is used in conjunction with the k ω sst turbulence model which is a prerequisite for the γ reθ transition model for the numerical analyses the detailed implementation of the γ reθ in starccm has been described in malan et al 2009 the governing equations used are the modified form of the k ω sst turbulence model with the γ reθ transition model which consists of the mass conservation and two transport equations as follows 2 u i x i 0 3 ρ d k d t x j μ σ k μ t k x j γ e f f μ t s 2 ρ k u j x j min max γ e f f 0 1 1 ρ β ω k 4 ρ d ω d t x j μ σ ω μ t ω x j α μ t s 2 ρ k u j x j ρ β ω 2 2 ρ 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω δ k δ x j δ ω δ x j in the above equations u i represents the flow velocity in i direction ρ the density k turbulence kinetic energy ω the specific turbulence dissipation rate s is the strain rate tensor modulus γeff the effective intermittency y normal distance from the nearest wall and μt is the turbulent eddy viscosity of the fluid the γ reθ transition model consist of two transport equations for γ the intermittency and reθt the transported transition momentum thickness reynolds number as follows 5 ρ d γ d t x j μ μ t σ γ γ x j f l e n g t h c a 1 ρ s γ f o n s e t 0 5 1 c e 1 γ c a 2 ρ ω γ f t u r b 1 c e 2 γ 6 ρ d r e θ t d t x j σ θ t μ μ t r e θ t x j c θ t ρ u 2 500 μ re θ t r e θ t 1 f θ t where u is the local velocity magnitude and ω the vorticity tensor modulus in order to control the onset and length of transition flength and fonset are used for detecting and controlling the boundary layer fturb and fθt are used the transition model used here is a correlation based model in which the value of intermittency γ depends on the transition momentum thickness reynolds number r e θ t through a correlation defined in the free stream the variable reθt is defined by a value of wall distance which is used to transport the free stream value to the boundary layer the free stream value is defined using a field function which specifies the location of freestream in terms of iso surface the iso value is defined based on the distance from the cell centroid to the nearest wall as described in malan et al 2009 the effect of ti turbulence intensity and tvr turbulence viscosity ratio on the drag coefficient for a flat plate and a foil section were described in bhattacharyya et al 2015 the turbulence viscosity ratio plays a vital role in the transition model study a smaller value leads to higher turbulence decay while a higher value of it causes excessive diffusion it is observed that the inlet turbulence intensity reduces to 50 when it reaches the leading edge of the foil to avoid this a turbulent kinetic energy source has been used as mentioned in bhattacharyya et al 2015 the turbulence kinetic energy source term is specified as in equation 7 7 k s o u r c e 3 2 t i r e q u i r e d 2 t i e x i s t i n g 2 u 2 here ksource is the turbulence source strength u is the flow velocity at the inlet tirequired is the turbulence intensity required and tiexisting is the turbulence existing in the domain the introduction of source term maintains the turbulence intensity in the domain of interest and it is terminated by a switch function in front of the foil to avoid building up of additional turbulence in the boundary layer the kinetic energy sources are distributed from the inlet to a distance 0 5c ahead of foil leading edge fig 5 3 1 2 computational domain and mesh the cfd solver is based on the finite volume method in which the convective and viscous terms are discretized by a second order upwind scheme and a second order central difference scheme respectively the simple semi implicit method algorithm is used to enforce pressure velocity coupling and the first order implicit scheme was applied for transient formulation a cylindrical computational flow domain is used around the hydrofoil as shown in fig 6 the outer boundary radius is set as 5c whereas the inlet and outlet are at distances of 5c and 13c from leading and trailing edges respectively the computational domain size is chosen based on published works for example arai et al 2010 and the outlet is positioned to avoid potential interference with the boundaries and also for the wake effects to stabilize see for example dropkin et al 2012 and rostamzadeh et al 2017 the total grid size of the computational domain is around 2 million where the domain is discretized using polyhedral cells with prism layers in the boundary layer for better resolution of velocity gradients and flow separations two volumetric cylinders for local mesh refinement are placed at the leading edge and trailing edge of the hydrofoil to capture the high velocity gradient in those regions the domain boundaries and mesh are shown in figs 6 and 7 the mesh size of the leading edge curve is set as 2 of base size base size is 30 of chord length the height of the first mesh cell from the surface must have a suitable size to ensure a reasonably accurate simulation of the flow field a non dimensional wall distance for wall bounded flow is defined by equation 8 8 y u y v ρ y μ τ w a l l ρ y ρ μ u y y 0 here y is the distance to the nearest wall u is the frictional velocity at the nearest wall v is the kinematic viscosity is the density of water μ is the dynamic viscosity and τwall is the wall shear stress y is specified as 2 of base size on the foil surface the growth rate of the prism layer is 1 3 the wall y value less than 1 is maintained near the foil boundary the free stream edge definition for the γ reθ transition model is defined as 1 mm i e 1 of chord length from the foil surface malan et al 2009 and accordingly the low y wall treatment is used for good resolution of the boundary layer velocities and transition patterns 3 1 3 grid uncertainty study a grid dependency study is performed for fb and ft2 at 15 deg angle of attack as shown in fig 8 where reasonable convergence of cl and cd are obtained after domain resolution of 2 million cells grid uncertainty is estimated by three symmetrical refined grids fine medium and coarse with refinement ratio of 2 the computed force coefficient at 22 5 deg angle of attack is shown in table 3 a convergence ratio rg is estimated for the lift coefficient as follows r g m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 0 33 hence rg 1 for lift coefficient which shows mesh convergence in the fluid domain error of the fine grid δ reg 1 and order of accuracy p g is computed using generalized richardson extrapolation xing and stern 2010 cg is the correction factor and pgest pth 2 is used in the below equation δ r e g 1 m 2 m 1 r g p g 1 5 10 4 0 084 of m 1 p g ln m 3 m 2 m 2 m 1 ln r g 3 17 c g r g p g 1 r g p g e s t 1 1 99 since cg 1 99 is considered as not close to the asymptotic range the grid uncertainty ug estimated error of the fine grid δg and the corrected solution sc are then evaluated as follows u g 2 1 c g 1 δ r e g 1 1 49 10 3 0 25 of m 1 δ g c g δ r e g 1 9 95 10 4 0 167 of m 1 s c s g δ g 0 592 in the similar way the convergence ratio rg of drag coefficient r g m 2 m 1 m 3 m 2 0 8 the above verification shows that the grid convergence is good enough to capture lift and drag coefficients in addition the uncertainty of the lift coefficient for medium grid is also estimated since sc 0 592 the generalized richardson extrapolation can again be used to estimate the error of the medium grid to be 1 10 3 using the same method stated above the uncertainty for the medium grid is estimated as 0 5 of m2 the uncertainty of the medium grid is larger than the fine grid however the computational time for fine mesh is very high since the medium grid results are also in the acceptable range the medium grid is used for the entire numerical study also reasonable comparisons of lift and drag coefficients at different angles of attack are obtained with the medium grid when compared with the experimental results 3 2 experimental investigation 3 2 1 methodology the experiments were conducted in the towing tank fig 9 in the department of ocean engineering and naval architecture at iit kharagpur the tank dimensions are 150 m length 4 m breadth 2 5 m depth the tank is equipped with a towing carriage to which the foil is connected using a structural mount a stepper motor is used to rotate the foil and it is attached to a 3600 pulse per revolution encoder which gives feedback for the actual rotational displacement lift and drag forces are measured using a multi axis load cell with a corresponding measurement range of 50 n 2 5nm the load cell has a hysteresis of 0 5 of rated load and non linearity of 0 5 of rated load different foils models are alternately mounted and connected to a multi axis load cell using a connecting rod fig 10 the force measurements for the hydrofoils are corrected for the rod drag force measurements averaged over 20 s are collected via national instruments usb 9188 data acquisition system a uniform flow velocity of 2 m s is obtained by moving the carriage on rails installed along the length of the tank to avoid free surface effect on the foil models the foil top faces are kept at 1 5c from the free surface fig 11 the blockage ratio is comparatively very small and therefore neglected in the calculation the forces are obtained in the form of voltage from load cell measurements next these values are substituted in the calibration equation to get lift and drag forces 3 2 2 uncertainty analysis to understand the repeatability of the experimental results an estimation of precision uncertainty is performed by taking five repeated measurements for lift and drag coefficient at α 15 for ft2 the calculated uncertainties at 95 confidence interval are typically less than 2 for lift and drag coefficients the bias error as outlined in coleman et al 1999 may arise in the force coefficients due to the intrinsic uncertainty of the load cell and carriage velocity measurements as well as uncertainty in foil dimensions the uncertainty for load cell forces can be calculated using the maximum and minimum values of unprocessed data with its averaged value over 1000 samples the resulting uncertainty for the lift force at u 2 m s and α 15 is 0 4 n the carriage velocity has an uncertainty of 0 05 m s and the uncertainty in the span and chord lengths measured at several spanwise locations is less than 1 mm the total 95 confidence uncertainty including bias and precision errors for drag and lift coefficients is calculated to be less than 5 2 4 results and discussions the numerical set up is first validated with experimental results for the base foil having the naca 634 021 section thereafter the lift and drag characteristics of the three hydrofoils are investigated using both cfd and experimental approaches detailed performance comparisons and flow analyses at different angles of attack for the twin protuberance foil ft2 are made with the base foil fb and the single protuberance design ft1 4 1 validation study for the validation study the lift and drag coefficients of the base foil naca 634 021 computed using cfd are compared with experimental results in fig 12 in general a good agreement of lift and drag coefficients is observed between the numerical and experimental results the error bars shown for drag and lift coefficients for numerical and experimental results are based on the uncertainty analyses presented in section 3 1 3 and 3 2 2 respectively 4 2 comparison of twin protuberance ft2 single protuberance ft1 and base hydrofoil fb cases the lift and drag coefficients and lift drag ratio of ft2 ft1 and fb at different angles of attack for reynolds number of 2 105 are shown in fig 13 the baseline hydrofoil has a higher lift coefficient in the pre stall region which shows a sharp decline after stall due to the presence of tubercles the stall occurs gradually for ft2 and ft1 as reported for a single tubercle foil in cai et al 2015 the lift coefficients for ft2 and ft1 in the post stall region at α 22 5 are 15 and 13 higher than fb respectively the differences are magnified at α 25 the drag coefficient for all three hydrofoils is almost similar for the entire range of α from the cl cd curve it can be seen that baseline foil has better performance in the pre stall region than ft2 and ft1 due to the high lift coefficient among the modified designs ft2 has marginally superior post stall performance the experimental results for the three selected foils at different angles of attack are shown in fig 14 indicating a similar pattern as of the numerical results additionally the cl and cd for the modified foils obtained from experiments are compared with cfd results in figure 15 and 16 in general a good agreement is observed for the entire range of α the increase in the post stall lift coefficient for ft1 and ft2 is also clearly visible from the experimental results the lift force for a 3d foil depends on the flow pattern over the pressure and suction sides and tips which result in a pressure difference depending on the alignment to the incoming flow the suction side flow separation at high angles of attack is linked to stall characteristics associated with a drop in the lift coefficient in order to study the flow characteristics for the three foils the pressure coefficient cp over the suction surface are plotted in fig 17 at five angles of attack 5 α 25 the pressure coefficient is given as c p p p 0 5 ρ u 2 here cp is the pressure coefficient p is the static pressure on the hydrofoil p is the static pressure in the freestream ρ is the fluid density and u is the uniform inlet velocity at α 15 the flow remains attached to the foils fb ft1 and ft2 from the leading edge to the trailing edge since the pressure coefficient increases smoothly towards the trailing edge for fb at α 15 and 20 the flow separation is indicated by a constant cp after 15 25 of chord length from the leading edge for the modified foils cp is constant from the leading edge along the crest of protuberance which leads to larger flow separation as compared to fb however along the trough cp increases smoothly which makes the flow to remain attached at α 20 deg large flow separation can be seen over the entire suction surface of fb as cp is uniform over the suction surface but for the modified foil ft2 the low pressure zones are formed from both ends of span to the trough of the protuberances which makes the flow to be attached in that region these pressure contours over the suction surface show similar patterns to those presented in dropkin et al 2012 the flow separation patterns over the three foils are investigated by plotting the reversed velocity contours in fig 18 for the base foil the domain of separation increases rapidly at higher α and extends up to the leading edge at α 22 5 the modified foils however can restrict the separation zone due to the streamwise vortices generated from the protuberances especially for ft2 the chordwise vortices from the twin protuberances interact strongly at α 22 5 which results in a greater control of the post stall separation domain as shown in fig 19 this is a characteristic feature for the twin protuberance foil which can be utilized for flow control to provide effective post stall performance the difference in cl between the three foils is prominent in the post stall region hence to understand the streamwise vortex structures shed from the protuberances vorticity magnitudes over the foils are plotted in fig 19 for α 25 for the base foil vortices are formed at the two ends of the span only for the two modified foils chordwise vortices are generated from the protuberances and they roll up extending beyond the trailing edge the chordwise pressure distributions over the crest and trough of the modified foils are compared with the base foil for α 15 and 25 in figs 20 and 21 respectively here x c 0 5 denotes the leading edge and x c 0 5 denotes the trailing edge of the foils at α 15 the pressure over suction surface accelerates sharply and after reaching the peak it decelerates causing an adverse pressure gradient for the modified foils ft2 and ft1 the boundary layer remains attached up to x c 0 40 just behind the crest thereafter the boundary layer separates from the upper surface of the foil due to which the length of the separation zone extends to the trailing edge along the trough of ft2 a higher suction pressure coefficient amplitude is observed similar to baseline foil but the peak amplitude is less for ft1 and the flow separates at x c 0 4 fig 21 shows the pressure distribution comparision at α 25 due to a high angle of attack the flow for fb starts to separate from the leading edge the suction pressure for ft2 and ft1 along the crest show similar distribution as of the baseline foil however the peak suction pressure amplitude is increased considerably for modified foils along the trough the boundary layer remains attached till x c 0 04 and 0 01 for ft2 and ft1 respectively after which the flow is fully separated the lengths of the separation along the trough for ft2 and ft1 are 0 56c and 0 59c respectively the differences in pressure coefficient over the suction surface for the modified foils explain the increase in lift coefficient in the post stall region the flow distribution and pressure coefficient plots indicate that the separation over the modified foils is a three dimensional phenomenon depending on the aspect ratio and leading edge configuration the investigations are presented at re 2 105 where the flow around the hydrofoil changes from laminar to turbulent in most cases to understand the transition nature of flow the distribution of intermittency γ which varies from 0 fully laminar to 1 fully turbulent over the hydrofoil is shown in figs 22 24 at different angles of attack 5 15 and 25 deg the flow on the upper surface is laminar and gradually transitions to a turbulent flow a variable a x y is used to show the length of turbulent boundary layer in different sections along the chord for the three hydrofoils here x 0 1 and 2 represents the foils fb ft1 and ft2 respectively while y 1 2 and 3 defines the three different sections i ii iii along the chord fig 22 shows that a x y for fb is similar in all three sections as expected however for ft1 and ft2 the transition zone varies over the three sections due to strong influence of the chordwise vortices from the protuberances at α 15 the transition length differs for ft1 and ft2 along the three sections depending on the location i e crest or trough of protuberance along the section along the crest the flow is in transition for lesser length compared to the trough section due to the formation of the vortex by the protuberances for the base foil it is somewhat constant in all three sections in the post stall case at α 25 the flow around the three foils is mostly turbulent adverse pressure gradients in lower troughs of ft2 due to vortices shed from the two protuberances cause the flow to remain in transition for larger length compared to the other foils from the transition plots of twin protuberances at α 15 and 25 deg figs 23 and 24 it can be seen that the flow is in a longer transition state at outer trough sec iii compared to the crest sec ii and the inner trough sec i to understand this phenomena it is important to study the corresponding vorticity development over the sections and this is shown using plots of vorticity magnitudes at five representative sections of the foil ft2 in fig 25 at α 15 deg the end section a shows strong vorticity magnitude over the chord due to the tip vortices fig 25 among the other sections the leading edge vortex is much stronger at the trough c and moves towards the crest as it travels along the chord at α 25 deg the location of higher vorticity over the crests b and d shifts towards the leading edge it is well established that tubercles trigger a turbulent boundary layer hansen et al 2011b interestingly the turbulence extents are different behind the crest and trough of the protuberances due to the pattern of vortices mentioned above similar observations are reported in johari et al 2007 where the flow over the peaks of protuberances remain attached at angles of attack greater than 20 deg however the vortex patterns over the two troughs c and e in fig 25 are quite different as the foil ft2 has discrete protuberances which are located asymmetrically over the span 4 3 reynolds number influence on foil performance the intermittency for ft2 at higher reynolds number 6 105 and 9 105 at α 15 is shown in fig 26 it can be seen that γ values is 1 over a large part of the domain indicating the flow around the foil at higher re to be mostly turbulent therefore for investigation at higher re k ω sst model without transition is used the comparison of lift and drag coefficients at three different reynolds numbers 2 105 6 105 and 9 105 for ft2 is shown in fig 27 the lift coefficient is found to increase significantly for α 10 especially at re 9 105 the stall characteristics are however very much similar for all the reynolds numbers the drag coefficient does not change much in the range of reynolds numbers investigated a comparison of the lift coefficient of ft2 relative to the base foil fb for three different reynolds numbers is presented in fig 28 the ratio of lift coefficients greater than 1 indicates that the modified foil produces higher lift compared to the base foil and vice versa the main observation from fig 28 is a higher cl in pre stall conditions for the base foil and in post stall conditions for ft2 also the comparative performance of the twin protuberance foil improves considerably at re 9 105 4 4 influence of protuberance amplitude for ft2 in this section the performance of the twin protuberance foil ft2 is investigated with two amplitude variations 0 1c and 0 15c of the protuberances the results at two reynolds numbers 2 105 and 9 105 are presented in fig 29 at the lower value of re the foil having smaller amplitude protuberance 0 1c has a higher lift coefficient in the pre stall region while the foil having higher amplitude 0 15c protuberances has higher lift for α 22 5 at the higher re value the foil ft2 with smaller amplitude protuberance 0 1c generates higher lift over almost the entire range of angle of attacks α 10 the lift is lower for ft2 a 0 15c than ft2 a 0 10c in the pre stall region which indicates having protuberance of larger amplitude reduces the lift characteristics the difference in pre stall is mostly noticeable at α 10 and 12 5 to understand the effect of protuberance amplitude a vorticity magnitude and pressure coefficient over suction surface are shown for the two foils at re 2 105 for α 12 5 in figs 30 and 31 fig 30 shows that the foil with lower amplitude protuberances has higher value of vorticity over larger area on the suction surface which cause higher momentum transfer to the boundary layer leading to greater lift force this can also be visualized from the pressure coefficient plots in fig 31 which show that the low pressure regions reside between the two protuberances and the zone downstream of the leading edge of both the foils the pressure coefficient over ft2 a 0 10c is lower due to higher vorticity magnitude resulting in a greater pressure difference and lift coefficient 4 5 influence of protuberance spacing for ft2 to understand the influence of protuberance spacing two additional variants of the twin protuberance foil are generated ft2 s1 having spacing 20 of span and ft2 s2 having spacing 60 of span unlike the foil ft2 the arrangement of protuberances over the leading edge of the two new variants are kept symmetrical about mid span hence ft2 s1 has a lower protuberance spacing and ft2 s2 has a higher protuberance spacing as compared to ft2 the amplitude of both the protuberances is kept constant 0 1c for all the cases the cl and cl cd comparisons for four cases fb ft2 s1 ft2 and ft2 s2 at re 2 105 are shown in fig 32 it is observed that the foil ft2 s2 with largely spaced protuberances behaves very similar to the base foil with significantly higher maximum lift and inferior post stall performance the foil ft2 s1 with the least spacing between the protuberances has the best post stall performance α 22 5 however the cl cd ratio for both ft2 s1 and ft2 s2 are comparatively lower for α 10 the lift and drag characteristics for foils with leading edge modifications are strongly related to the chordwise vortices shed from the protuberances as the difference in cl between the three modified designs is maximum at α 25 the corresponding vorticity plots are shown in fig 33 to understand the effect of spacing both ft2 s1 and ft2 show strong vorticity generated from the protuberances the magnitude over the leading edge increasing with a reduction in spacing for ft2 s1 the effect is visible in increased post stall lift shown in fig 32 as the spacing is increased for ft2 s2 the domain of higher vorticity is mostly restricted towards the ends of the span leading to lower post stall lift coefficients similar to the base foil without protuberances it can hence be concluded that the twin protuberance configuration provides sufficient scope for modification of the foil performance by tuning the two parameters amplitude and spacing of the leading edge protuberances 5 conclusions the lift drag and flow characteristics of a finite span hydrofoil of naca 634 021 section with twin protuberances over the leading edge are investigated using experiments as well as a transition sensitive cfd model the results are presented in the light of comparison with a naca 634 021 base foil and a foil with single leading edge protuberance while the base foil has a prominent advantage in terms of the pre stall lift the post stall lifting performance is higher for the modified foils the use of two protuberances over the leading edge gives an enhanced post stall lift due to a reduced separation zone caused by the interaction of the two chordwise vortices over the suction side the leading edge vortex and its evolution along the chord of trough and crest sections of the protuberances is instrumental in flow attachment and turbulization at high angles of attack the lift characteristics depend on the amplitude of the protuberances the higher post stall lift coefficient is consistent in the range of reynolds numbers from 2 105 to 9 105 for the hydrofoil with two protuberances the amplitude and spacing of the two protuberances have a prominent effect on the lifting characteristics at both pre stall and post stall angles of attack the special feature of the twin protuberance foil design is that depending on the operation regime its performance can be substantially varied by tailoring the leading edge geometry especially the positioning of the two protuberances the bio mimicked foil designed by mimicking the two prominent protuberances of the humpback whale can hence be used effectively for control of flow and separation providing good lifting performance at high angles of attack author contributions r kant methodology

21363,the light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla is a plate shaped anchor for securing offshore floating structures which is dynamically installed with the aid of a booster therefore it

in deep and ultra deep waters has placed increasing reliance on floating facilities which are secured in position with mooring systems and anchors the gravity installed anchor gia is paid more and more attention recently due to its self installed behaviour which provides a time efficient and cost effective solution for deepwater floating systems the gia is released from a predetermined height above the seabed allowing it to fall freely in water and penetrate into the seabed through its gravitational energy two types of gias torpedo shaped anchor including torpedo anchor and deep penetrating anchor dpa and plate shaped anchor i e omni max anchor have been applied to practical engineering brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 lieng et al 2010 the former type of gia is beneficial in achieving a deeper penetration depth within the seabed attributed to the simple geometry while the latter one exhibits relatively high capacity to weight ratio as the soil resistance acting on the anchor is dominated by normal resistance han and liu 2020 by combining the advantages of both torpedo anchor and omni max anchor tong et al 2020 proposed a light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla as shown in fig 1 the l gipla is primarily comprised of two pieces of flukes to bear soil resistance and a v contoured shank to accommodate the padeye as the dry weight of the l gipla is relatively low a booster is adopted to aid the anchor installation the entire installation process of the l gipla with a booster is depicted in fig 1 the booster is attached to the tail of the l gipla by a shear pin the l gipla with a booster is termed as hybrid anchor in the present study first the hybrid anchor falls freely in the water column before impacting the seabed then the booster is pulled out of the seabed after dynamic installation which causes the separation between booster and l gipla finally the l gipla is keyed to a new orientation that is more perpendicular to the direction of the uplift load thus the flukes are mainly subject to soil normal resistance and exhibits a relatively high capacity to weight ratio moreover the l gipla can dive deeper into stronger soils to gain higher capacity under certain conditions which is similar to the diving property of drag anchors during dragging installation overall the l gipla aims to be designed with light weight reduce cost deep penetration depth increase holding capacity and high capacity to weight ratio keying and diving which can be applied to secure offshore floating structures such as oil and gas platforms wind turbines net cages and wave and tidal energy converters compared with the installation procedures of existing gias an additional procedure for retrieving the booster i e stage 3 in fig 1 would increase the installation time of the l gipla and concomitantly increase the installation cost to some extent however the booster is an efficient installation tool with the ability of substantially increasing the gravitational energy of the hybrid anchor which encourages the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance to penetrate deeper into the seabed moreover the directional stability of the l gipla is improved attributed to the fins attached to the rear of the booster for instance numerical simulation results based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach indicate by connecting a booster with appropriate fin size the directional stability of the omni max anchor converts from unstable to stable state during free fall in water liu et al 2019 in addition the booster is also helpful in reducing the effect of anchor tilt from the vertical direction on the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed han et al 2019 preliminary studies by model tests and plasticity analyses indicate the l gipla mobilises deep penetration depth attributed to the booster and behaves diving properties during the keying process tong et al 2020 which examine the anchor performance within the seabed however the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hybrid anchor during free fall in water are still unclear the fall velocity and verticality are two key factors dominating the dynamic installation of gias hence it is paramount to illustrate the hydrodynamic characteristics especially the drag coefficient and directional stability of the hybrid anchor 1 2 scope of the present study the main issues motivating the present study which are associated with the hydrodynamic characteristics of the l gipla are summarised as follows 1 the drag coefficient of the l gipla is investigated by model tests 2 the geometry of the l gipla is optimised with tapered fluke and round grinded edge in order to reduce the drag coefficient and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the advanced l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor are investigated 3 the advanced l gipla is further optimised with folding shank to further improve the directional stability and reduce the drag force the unfolding process of the shank from the fluke is examined by model tests then the hydrodynamic characteristics of the advanced l gipla with folding shank are investigated 4 the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is investigated which has not been addressed previously 5 effective measurements are proposed to calibrate the tilt of gias during free fall in water 2 model tests details the model tests were conducted in a cylindrical plexiglass tank which is 8 m in height and 0 78 m in diameter as shown in fig 2 the diameter ratio from the circumscribed circle of the model l gipla to the water tank is about 1 8 thus the water tank is large enough to avoid boundary effects two measurement techniques the high speed camera and the motion tracking device mtd were adopted to measure the motion history of the anchor the former measurement technique was used to measure the fall velocity of the anchor in order to determine the drag coefficient and the latter one was used to monitor the anchor accelerations and angular velocities in three dimensional 3 d space aiming for estimating the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the reliability of the aforementioned measurement techniques has been verified by previous model tests in liu et al 2018 the drag force f d on the anchor can be described as eqn 1 1 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of water a f is the frontal area of the anchor in the plane perpendicular to the central line of the anchor and v is the fall velocity of the anchor the anchor accelerates during free fall in water until the velocity reaches the terminal velocity v t once the anchor reaches terminal velocity the drag force calculated by eqn 1 is equal to the submerged weight of the anchor hence the drag coefficient can be calculated by eqn 2 2 c d 2 w s ρ a f v t 2 where w s is the submerged weight of the anchor it should be noted that in principle the terminal velocity is reached only when the fall distance of the anchor approaches infinity in practice 99 v t is considered to be enough to represent the terminal velocity a high speed camera eosens cube7 was set near the bottom of the water tank 0 9 m above the tank bottom see fig 2 thus the model anchor adopted in the present study had approximately achieved the terminal velocity as it passed through the field of view of the high speed camera this will be shown in fig 4 b in the following section a guiding wire 0 8 mm in diameter was used in model tests to confine the verticality of the anchor during free fall in water thus the frontal area a f is a constant the anchor was released from the water surface by burning out the fishing line connected at the anchor tail during which the high speed camera captured the anchor motion history with a frequency of 670 hz the directional stability of the hybrid anchor depends on the position of the hydrodynamic centre hc relative to the gravity centre gc if hc is above gc the hybrid anchor is stable during free fall in water once the anchor is tilt the transversal force acting on the anchor generates a moment about gc which forces the anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction for a given vertical fall displacement a less tilt angle of the anchor represents more favourable directional stability and vice versa to examine the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the guiding wire was removed and the hybrid anchor was allowed to fall freely in the water tank the anchor acceleration and angular velocity in 3 d space were measured by a mtd based on the micro electromechanical systems mems technique the mtd is integrated with a 3 axis mems accelerometer 16g and 3 axis mems gyroscope 2000 dps icm 20602 a microcontroller a memory card and a battery as shown in fig 3 c attributed to the mini size 42 mm 20 mm 3 mm the mtd can be sealed in the chamber towards the rear of the booster the interpretation of mtd measurements has been detailed introduced by blake et al 2016 and liu et al 2018 and is not repeated herein in model tests the sampling frequency of the mtd was set as 1000 hz 3 drag coefficient of original and advanced l giplas in this section the drag coefficient of the l gipla is first investigated then the geometry of the l gipla is modified to further reduce the drag coefficient and increase the terminal velocity which is beneficial in increasing the kinetic energy of the anchor subsequently the advanced improvement of the modified l gipla is verified by model tests 3 1 drag coefficient of original l gipla the l gipla in tong et al 2020 is termed as the original l gipla for the convenience of contrasting with the advanced modified l gipla in the following section the original l gipla is designed with two types of flukes triangular shaped type fig 3 a and peltate shaped type fig 3 b with triangular shaped flukes the l gipla is prone to penetrate into seabed with high shear strength such as stiff clay silt and sand while the l gipla with peltate shaped flukes enlarges the contact area between anchor and soil which is beneficial in improving the holding capacity the primary dimensions of the original triangular shaped simplified as ot and peltate shaped simplified as op l giplas are listed in table 1 the scale factor of the model anchor is λ 41 and the corresponding prototype length of ot or op is 5 m the included angle between two pieces of flukes θ f is less than 180 to balance the offset of shank ensuring the gravity centre is located at the centre of the intersection line of flukes a set of photographs is shown in fig 4 a to represent the free fall process of the anchor vertically along the guiding wire for given time interval and distance the average velocity of the anchor is estimated the relationship between the vertical velocity v z and the vertical displacement s z the fall distance of the anchor in the vertical direction after release of l giplas is plotted in fig 4 b it can be seen that the fall velocities of ot and op are constant indicating both ot and op have approximately reached the terminal velocity with a vertical displacement of 6 m the terminal velocities of ot and op are 2 74 m s and 2 88 m s respectively the drag force on a projectile can be divided into two parts the pressure drag and the frictional drag the former one depends on the shape of the projectile while the latter one depends on the reynolds number re for projectiles with non streamlined profile the total drag is dominated by the pressure drag with the reynolds number exceeding a critical value landau and lifshitz 1987 liu et al 2018 the drag coefficients calculated by eqn 2 are shown in fig 5 and table 2 which are 0 80 and 1 02 for ot and op respectively the discrepancy of the drag coefficient is primarily resulted from the anchor shape for a cone the drag coefficient increases from 0 30 to 0 80 with the cone angle increasing from 10 to 60 young et al 2010 indicating a blunt tip corresponds to a higher drag coefficient since the tip of op is blunter the corresponding drag coefficient is higher compared with that of ot the drag coefficients of torpedo anchors and omni max anchors are also plotted in fig 5 for comparison for the plate shaped omni max anchor the drag coefficient is in the range of 0 80 1 02 cenac 2011 liu et al 2018 while for the torpedo anchor the drag coefficient ranges 0 63 0 70 which is relatively lower due to the simple shape for the plate shaped ot and op the corresponding drag coefficients are closer to that of the omni max anchor richardson 2008 conducted cfd analyses to investigate the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of non fin torpedo anchors for a torpedo anchor with cone tip the drag coefficient is not decreased and maintains 0 22 with the reynolds number re exceeding 105 the cfd results in liu et al 2019 also indicated that the drag coefficient of the omni max anchor maintains 0 87 with re 105 the reynolds number is expressed as 3 re ρ v l η where l is the characteristic length of the projectile and η is the dynamic viscosity for the gia the anchor length can be selected as the characteristic length in eq 3 it can be deduced that for gias with non streamlined shapes the frictional drag has little effect on the total drag with re 105 in the present model tests it is easy for the fluid around the model anchor to reach re 105 i e v 0 8 m s given that the drag coefficient determined from model tests is equal to that in prototype the scale ratio of anchor velocity from prototype to model scale is λ 0 5 the terminal velocities of ot and op in prototype are 17 54 m s and 18 44 m s respectively 3 2 drag coefficient of advanced l gipla for a gia with certain frontal area and weight a lower drag coefficient means higher impact velocity hence it is valuable to modify the geometry of l gipla to reduce the drag coefficient the original l gipla is modified with 1 tapered fluke and round grinded edge to reduce drag coefficient and 2 thinner shank to reduce frontal area as shown in fig 6 a with round grinded edge the fluid can smoothly flow through the fluke tip and the water vortex at the tail of the fluke is reduced therefore the drag coefficient of the advanced l gipla should be reduced which will be verified later the advanced modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are simplified as at and ap whose dimensions are plotted in fig 6 b and listed in table 3 note for at and ap the gravity centre is still located at the centre of the intersection line of two flukes as plotted in fig 4 b the terminal velocities of at and ap are 3 78 m s and 4 17 m s respectively which are substantially higher than that of the original l giplas the drag coefficients of at and ap are 0 51 and 0 55 which are lower than that of original ones fig 5 for a gia with certain weight and frontal area a low drag coefficient will result in a high terminal velocity which is beneficial in increasing the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed generally the modified l gipla owns advanced hydrodynamic characteristics in contrast to the original anchor therefore in the following section i e section 4 associated with the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the l gipla refers to the advanced anchor while the original anchor is not considered 4 directional stability of hybrid anchors the hybrid anchor is termed as h xx yy nf where h represents hybrid anchor xx represents the type of the l gipla yy refers to the type of shank and n is a number denoting the ratio w b w f w b is the width of rear fins of the booster and w f is the width of the fluke of the l gipla for instance h at vs 2 0f refers to the hybrid anchor which is comprised of the advanced triangular shaped l gipla at with v contoured shank and the booster whose fin width is about 2 0 times the width of the l giplaʹs fluke note the shank geometry is involved in the description of the hybrid anchor in order to distinguish the v contoured shank from the folding shank which will be introduced in later sections in this section the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f is adopted as a special case to investigate its hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water the primary dimensions of the matching booster are listed in table 2 the total mass of the booster including the rear fins is 509 8 g which is about 1 88 times the mass of at in the following the parameters of the hybrid anchor are not introduced in the text and the reader can refer to table a1 in the appendix the motion history of the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f measured by the mtd is plotted in fig 7 the variation of acceleration against time is depicted in fig 7 a at the moment of t 0 the fishing line connected at the tail of the hybrid anchor is burning off as the fishing line is braided by 6 strands of threads the burning process lasts approximately 0 06 s then the hybrid anchor falls freely in the water column during which the acceleration gradually decreases resulted from the increase of the drag force acting on the anchor by integrating the vertical acceleration the vertical velocity and vertical fall displacement are obtained as also shown in fig 7 a a local fixed reference coordinate system with three orthogonal axes is defined on the hybrid anchor where the y axis is parallel to the symmetry plane of the shank and the z axis is parallel to the central line of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 7 b the tilt angle δ t of the hybrid anchor is the included angle from the central line of the hybrid anchor to the vertical direction if the hybrid anchor is hanging vertically its central line is parallel to the vertical direction as shown in fig 7 b the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x is negative and the absolute value of ϕ x increases gradually with the increase in the dimensionless vertical fall displacement s z h a h a is the length of the l gipla the negative value of ϕ x indicates the anchor tip rotates towards the shank which may be resulted from the drag force on the shank and will be discussed later the rotation angle θ y about the y axis should be zero as the y axis is parallel to the symmetry plane of the hybrid anchor the anchor rotation about the y axis may be resulted from errors in model tests with a tilt angle of δ t 3 which is a critical tilt angle in the present study the corresponding dimensionless vertical displacement is s z h a 21 7 as depicted in fig 7 c the tilt angle increases gradually with the increase in the vertical velocity for δ t 3 the corresponding vertical velocity is v z 4 27 m s and has not reached the terminal velocity to minimise the hybrid anchor from inclining during free fall in water it is valuable to 1 decrease the anchor fall distance in water and 2 further optimise the geometry of the l gipla the former one is unfavourable for the anchor fall velocity which is a vital factor affecting the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor within the seabed therefore optimising the geometry of the l gipla is a positive alternative to minimise the hybrid anchor from inclining during free fall in water though the hybrid anchor has not reached the terminal velocity in the model test as shown in fig 7 d the velocity 4 27 m s with δ t 3 is higher than the terminal velocity of at 3 78 m s shown in fig 4 b therefore the kinetic energy of the hybrid anchor is improved as both the fall velocity and total weight of the hybrid anchor are higher compared with that of a sole l gipla the equation of motion governing the free fall process of the hybrid anchor can be expressed as 4 m m a w s f d where m and w s are mass and submerged weight of the hybrid anchor m is the added mass and a is the acceleration the added mass term for the gia is limited and usually can be ignored shelton et al 2011 oʹbeirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for instance the added mass coefficient is only 0 02 for the omni max anchor during accelerating in water which is estimated from model tests fig 10 a in liu et al 2018 numerical simulation results indicate the drag coefficient of the omni max anchor exhibits a minor increase from 0 80 to 0 82 with the tilt angle increasing from 0 to 5 liu et al 2019 therefore it is concluded that the effect of the anchor tilt within 5 on the drag coefficient can be ignored given the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor is a constant it can be derived as 0 60 based on eq 4 and the parameters shown in the appendix as the hybrid anchor gradually tilts during free fall in water the dimensionless horizontal displacement s h h a s h is the horizontal displacement of the anchor after release experiences an increase with increasing dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a as shown in fig 7 e the drag forces on the fluke f d f and shank f d s of the advanced l gipla is shown in fig 8 a the gc of the l gipla is in line with the central line of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 8 b the drag force on the fluke will generate a clockwise positive moment m x f relative to gc while the drag force on the shank will generate a counter clockwise negative moment m x s relative to gc it is clearly that m x s overweighs m x f hence hc is away from gc towards the shank direction given the drag coefficient of the shank is equal to that of the fluke the offset δs depicted in fig 8 b of hc from gc is about the average thickness of the fluke therefore the total moment on the hybrid anchor is counter clockwise which forces the hybrid anchor to rotate about the negative x axis direction in the following the v contoured shank is removed from the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f to investigate the effect of the v contoured shank on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the hybrid anchor without shank is termed as h at ns 2 0f in which ns denotes no shank from fig 9 a it can be seen that the angle ϕ x is positive indicating the hybrid anchor rotates about the positive x axis therefore it is proved that the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is greatly affected by the v contoured shank moreover with δ t 3 the dimensionless vertical fall displacement is s z h a 24 2 for the hybrid anchor h at ns 2 0f without shank which is higher than 21 7 for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f with a v contoured shank this indicates the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is improved by removing the shank as shown in fig 9 b by removing the shank the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor increases from 4 37 m s to 4 68 m s therefore it is necessary to modify the shank of the advanced l gipla in order to further 1 improve the directional stability and 2 increase the fall velocity 5 further advanced l gipla with folding shank to reduce the moment m x s relative to gc generated by the drag force acting on the shank f d s the advanced l gipla is further modified with a folding shank as shown in fig 10 a during free fall in water the shank is folded hence the moment m x s is relatively low during the keying process i e stage 4 in fig 1 the shank is unfolded as shown in fig 10 b the included angle between the folding shank and fluke is termed as the unfolding angle α i the unfolding process of the shank within the seabed causes the departure of the shank from the fluke therefore the uplift load at the padeye will generate a counter clockwise moment relative to gc which forces the anchor to rotate in the seabed when the shank is fully unfolded the padeye coincides with the padeye located on the v contoured shank as shown in fig 10 c the shank and fluke are connected with a hinge see fig 10 a and a one way bearing is sealed in the hinge the one way bearing allows the shank to just rotate outwards from the fluke hence the unfolding angle only can increase until to the fully unfolding angle showing in fig 10 c another alternative to improve the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is to reduce the included angle θ f between two flukes with the flukes departing further from the shank the moment m x f generated by the drag force acting on the fluke f d f will increase to balance m x s however the projected area of fluke in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the uplift force at the padeye decreases with the decrease of θ f which is unfavourable for the holding capacity of the l gipla the further modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped giplas with folding shanks are termed as ft and fp respectively for model ft and fp the width w s and thickness w e of the support which is used to accommodate the folding shank are 10 9 mm and 12 1 mm the frontal areas of ft and fp are 568 0 mm2 and 572 0 mm2 and the masses of ft and fp are 277 4 g and 383 1 g respectively 5 1 verification of the unfolding process of shank in seabed a model test was designed to examine the unfolding process of the shank for the further advanced peltate shaped l gipla in the homogeneous clayey soil the model fp was thrusted to the soil with an initial embedment depth of 2 2 times the anchor length two mems accelerometers adxl335 3g analog devices were sealed in the folding shank and fluke to measure the rotation angles of shank and fluke respectively the rotation angle of the shank α s refers to the included angle from the central line of shank to the vertical direction and the rotation angle of the fluke α f is the included angle from the central line of fluke to the vertical direction as shown in fig 11 a the maximum value of the unfolding angle α i is 90 under which condition the padeye offset angle θ p is 30 the padeye offset angle θ p fig 10 c is defined as θ p tan 1 e s e n where e s is the padeye offset denoting the distance from padeye to gc parallel to the central line of flukes e n is the padeye eccentricity defined as the distance from padeye to the central line of flukes in the model test the mooring line was pulled with a constant rate of 1 mm s and the uplift angle from the horizontal at the mudline i e θ 0 depicted in fig 1 maintained zero the rotation angles of the fluke and shank which were measured by mems accelerometers are plotted in fig 11 a the model test was paused several times for probing the anchor embedment depth in each loading step the pull distance of the mooring line s pull was restricted in the range of 20 30 mm s pull h a 0 16 0 24 at the end of each loading step the embedment depth of the anchor top to the soil surface was measured by a steel ruler hence the position of the anchor in the soil can be estimated it can be seen from fig 11 a that the anchor is stable within the soil with the normalised pull displacement s pull h a 0 5 during which the mooring line gradually cuts through the soil the shank starts to unfold with the normalised pull displacement s pull h a 0 5 while the fluke maintains stable within the seabed as the rotation angle of α f is zero the normalised vertical displacement of gc δz h a δz is the displacement of gc in the vertical direction is also zero as shown in fig 11 b verifying the fluke is stable with s pull h a 0 9 both the rotation angle α f and normalised vertical displacement δz h a experience an increase with increasing s pull h a indicating the fluke is rotated and pulled upwards at the same time with s pull h a continuously increasing to 1 39 the upwards displacement δz h a reaches the peak value the maximum upward displacement of gc is termed as the loss of embedment which is about 0 11h a in the present study the loss of embedment during the keying process primarily depends on the padeye offset angle and the uplift angle at the mudline tian et al 2015 liu et al 2017 with the same padeye offset angle of θ p 30 the loss of embedment for op is about 0 22h a derived from plasticity analyses tong et al 2020 the discrepancy is primarily resulted from the difference in the uplift angle at the mudline the uplift angle at the mudline is θ 0 20 in the plasticity analyses which will result in a higher loss of embedment with s pull h a 1 39 the anchor dives deeper into the soil and the unfolding angle α i reaches the maximum value of 90 generally the shank can be unfolded during the keying process 5 2 drag coefficient of the further modified l gipla with folding shank it is shown in fig 4 b that the terminal velocities of ft and fp are 4 03 m s and 4 48 m s the frontal area of the folding shank is lower compared with that of the v contoured shank hence the terminal velocities of ft and fp are higher than that of at and ap the drag coefficients are plotted in fig 5 which are 0 51 and 0 57 for ft and fp respectively the drag coefficient of ft with folding shank is similar to that of at with v contoured shank a higher velocity means higher kinetic energy which encourages the anchor to gain a deeper penetration depth within the seabed moreover during dynamic penetration process within the seabed the soil resistance on the folding shank is lower than that on the v contoured shank which is also beneficial in increasing the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed 5 3 effect of folding shank on directional stability of hybrid anchor by conducting free fall tests in water the effect of the folding shank on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor h ft fs 2 0f is examined as shown in fig 12 it is seen from fig 12 a that compared with the v contoured shank the folding shank is positive to reduce the rotation angle about the x axis during the entire free fall process in water the tilt angle of the hybrid anchor h ft fs 2 0f does not reach the critical angle of 3 for instance with δ t 1 the corresponding dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a increases from 9 17 to 18 49 by replacing the v contoured shank with the folding shank this indicates the folding shank is efficient in reducing the moment m x s relative to gc the vertical velocity plotted in fig 12 b indicates with the same dimensionless vertical displacement the velocity of the hybrid anchor with a folding shank is higher than that with a v contoured shank therefore it is concluded that the folding shank is beneficial both in improving the directional stability and vertical fall velocity of the hybrid anchor to summarise the l gipla has experienced two steps of optimisation the first is to modify the fluke with tapered thickness and round grinded edge and the second is to replace the v contoured shank with folding shank the optimised l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor exhibit improved hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water the effect of fin width w b on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is also investigated and the results are plotted in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a with the ratio w b w f increasing from 1 5 to 2 0 the rotation angle about the x axis exhibits a minor decrease indicating enlarging the fin width is helpful in improving the directional stability of the hybrid anchor with a higher fin aspect ratio which is defined as the ratio of fin width to fin length the hc tends to move towards the rear of the hybrid anchor and hence the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is improved triantafyllou and hover 2003 however the frontal area of the hybrid anchor is also increased with the increase in the fin width which will reversely reduce the fall velocity as plotted in fig 13 b the vertical velocity at the final stage of the free fall test decreases from 4 89 m s to 4 64 m s with the ratio w b w f increasing from 1 5 to 2 0 hence it is necessary to optimise the fin width with the aim of ensuring the directional stability but without affecting the fall velocity of the hybrid anchor in model tests it is very difficult to determine the position of hc which obscures the estimation of the directional stability of the hybrid anchor therefore further numerical simulations should be carried out to optimise the fin size 6 effect of mooring line on directional stability of hybrid anchor before releasing the hybrid anchor the mooring line connected at the padeye is usually pre released to the seabed as sketched in fig 14 a de araujo et al 2004 two types of mooring lines synthetic rope and steel chain are usually used in practical engineering the density of the synthetic rope is closer to that of water hence the synthetic rope is pulled by the advanced anchor for link to link chains with complex geometry a segment of chain is dragged to move together with the anchor during free fall in water the model tests result in liu et al 2018 indicated that the length of chain that moves together with the omni max anchor increases with the vertical fall distance of the anchor therefore the fall velocity of the gia is reduced by the mooring line connected to the padeye moreover a moment m mr relative to gc of the anchor is generated by the moving mooring line which results in the further tilt of the anchor tip towards the shank see fig 14 a it can be concluded that the moment m mr on the hybrid anchor with a v contoured shank is higher than that with a folding shank due to the discrepancy of the distance from padeye to the central line of the hybrid anchor previous studies have investigated the drag efficient of the mooring line and the effect of the mooring line on the fall velocity of gias oʹbeirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of gias is not clearly stated until now to present the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor more significantly the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a v contoured type was selected a polyester rope 3 mm in diameter was used to simulate the mooring line in model tests it is shown in fig 15 a that with the dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a 7 the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x for the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line is considerably consistent with that for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f without mooring line however the angle ϕ x for h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line increases drastically with s z h a 7 which is resulted from the increase of the moment m mr the moment m mr generated by the mooring line depends on the anchor velocity and the length of mooring line that moves together with the anchor therefore the tilt of the hybrid anchor with a mooring line is further exacerbated with increasing dimensionless vertical displacement fig 15 b indicates the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line reaches a maximum value of 3 57 m s with the dimensionless vertical displacement of s z h a 15 0 which is lower than 4 01 m s for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f without mooring line with the same vertical displacement as indicated in liu et al 2018 the length of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor increases with the increase of the vertical fall displacement hence the anchor velocity reversely decreases after reaching the maximum value as shown in fig 15 b therefore an optimised vertical fall distance should be pre estimated to ensure the anchor to gain an impact velocity as high as possible to summarise the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is deteriorated by the mooring line and effective measurements should be put forward to avoid mitigate the hybrid anchor from tilting caused by the mooring line 7 methods for mitigating tilt of gias a simple method to rectify the tilt of the hybrid anchor caused by the mooring line is to set an arched fin at the direction opposite the shank as shown in fig 14 b the drag force on the arched fin will generate a clockwise moment m af relative to gc of the hybrid anchor which can be used to balance the moment m mr caused by the mooring line to some extent model tests were conducted to investigate the effects of the arched fin and mooring line on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hybrid anchor and the results are depicted in fig 16 the model hybrid anchor is h fp fs 1 7f and the radius and radian of the arched fin are r af 0 8w f and 2π 3 from fig 16 a it is seen that by connecting the arched fin the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x of the hybrid anchor is converted from negative to positive this indicates that the moment m af overweighs m x s if the mooring line is taken into consideration the angle ϕ x for the hybrid anchor h fp fs 1 7f 0 8af af refers to the arched fin and 0 8 is the ratio of the radius of the arched fin r af to the width of the fluke experiences a transition from positive to negative during the free fall process in water as the hybrid anchor initially falls freely in water the drag force on the mooring line is relatively low hence the moment m mr is less than m af therefore the anchor rotation is dominated by the moment m af which results in the anchor rotation about the positive x axis with the increase of the vertical fall displacement the length of the mooring line that moves together with the hybrid anchor increases hence the moment m mr gradually exceeds m af once m mr m af the rotation angle ϕ x starts to decrease and even to a negative value generally the arched fin is effective in reducing the anchor tilt during free fall in water caused by the mooring line the results shown in fig 16 b indicate the vertical velocity at the final stage of model test for the hybrid anchor h fp fs 1 7f 0 8rf is 4 90 m s which is slightly lower than 5 01 m s for h fp fs 1 7f the arched fin is similar to a thin plate whose drag coefficient is relatively low therefore the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor is not greatly affected by the arched fin moreover the comparison between figs 15 and 16 indicates the directional stabilities of hybrid anchors with triangular shaped l gipla and peltate shaped l gipla are similar but the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor with pletate shaped l gipla is higher attributed to the higher weight of the l gipla and the corresponding booster actually the booster weight can be varied by varying the shaft length or diameter on the basis of practical requirement the effect of the booster weight on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the omni max anchor has been investigated by cfd numerical simulations liu et al 2019 the results indicate the drag coefficient only exhibits a minor increase with increasing booster length and the directional stability of the anchor is greatly unaffected by the booster length therefore by varying the booster weight the l gipla is deployable in the wide range of soil conditions such as soft to stiff clay silt sand and stratified seabed another method for balancing the drag force of the mooring line is to set a small fan shaped plate in the direction opposite the shank as shown in fig 17 a the horizontal distance from the fan shaped plate to the central line of the hybrid anchor can be adjusted based on the material size and shape of the mooring line in model tests two fan shaped plates are designed with different sizes as shown in fig 17 b which are simply termed as smaller plate 6 mm in radius and π 2 in radian and bigger plate 10 mm in radius and π 2 in radian the fan shaped plate was connected at the tail of the booster towards the direction opposite the shank ensuring the distance between the outer edge of the fan shaped plate and the central line of the hybrid anchor maintains 15 mm the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a v contoured shank is adopted to amplify the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 17 b by connecting the smaller plate the tilt of the hybrid anchor caused by the v contoured shank and mooring line is largely mitigated by connecting the bigger plate the rotation angle about the x axis converts from negative to positive it can be assumed that the rotation angle ϕ x maintains zero or approximately zero during the entire free fall process in water if the distance between the outer edge of the fan shaped plate and the central line of the hybrid anchor can be adjusted in real time moreover the verticality of the gia during free fall in water is also affected by other factors such as the ground current the vertex at the anchor tail therefore future studies should be devoted to develop a sophisticated control system using to correct the tilt of gias during free fall in water in real time which is beneficial for the dynamic installation of gias 8 conclusions model tests are conducted in the present study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor the primary findings are summarised as following 1 the drag coefficients of the original triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are 0 80 and 1 02 by modifying the l gipla with tapered fluke and round grinded edge the drag coefficients of the advanced triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are reduced to 0 51 and 0 55 respectively 2 a further modified l gipla with folding shank is proposed to reduce the frontal area of the anchor which is beneficial in increasing the fall velocity during free fall in water and the final penetration depth during dynamic penetration in the seabed the drag coefficients of the further modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas with folding shank are 0 51 and 0 57 both the fall velocity and directional stability of the hybrid anchor with folding shank l gipla are improved 3 the directional stability of the gia is deteriorated by the mooring line which forces the gia tip to rotate towards the shank direction an arched fin or fan shaped plate can be set to the rear of the gia in the direction opposite the shank in order to balance the drag force caused by the mooring line credit authorship contribution statement congcong han writing reviewing and editing

21363,the light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla is a plate shaped anchor for securing offshore floating structures which is dynamically installed with the aid of a booster therefore it

in deep and ultra deep waters has placed increasing reliance on floating facilities which are secured in position with mooring systems and anchors the gravity installed anchor gia is paid more and more attention recently due to its self installed behaviour which provides a time efficient and cost effective solution for deepwater floating systems the gia is released from a predetermined height above the seabed allowing it to fall freely in water and penetrate into the seabed through its gravitational energy two types of gias torpedo shaped anchor including torpedo anchor and deep penetrating anchor dpa and plate shaped anchor i e omni max anchor have been applied to practical engineering brandão et al 2006 zimmerman et al 2009 lieng et al 2010 the former type of gia is beneficial in achieving a deeper penetration depth within the seabed attributed to the simple geometry while the latter one exhibits relatively high capacity to weight ratio as the soil resistance acting on the anchor is dominated by normal resistance han and liu 2020 by combining the advantages of both torpedo anchor and omni max anchor tong et al 2020 proposed a light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla as shown in fig 1 the l gipla is primarily comprised of two pieces of flukes to bear soil resistance and a v contoured shank to accommodate the padeye as the dry weight of the l gipla is relatively low a booster is adopted to aid the anchor installation the entire installation process of the l gipla with a booster is depicted in fig 1 the booster is attached to the tail of the l gipla by a shear pin the l gipla with a booster is termed as hybrid anchor in the present study first the hybrid anchor falls freely in the water column before impacting the seabed then the booster is pulled out of the seabed after dynamic installation which causes the separation between booster and l gipla finally the l gipla is keyed to a new orientation that is more perpendicular to the direction of the uplift load thus the flukes are mainly subject to soil normal resistance and exhibits a relatively high capacity to weight ratio moreover the l gipla can dive deeper into stronger soils to gain higher capacity under certain conditions which is similar to the diving property of drag anchors during dragging installation overall the l gipla aims to be designed with light weight reduce cost deep penetration depth increase holding capacity and high capacity to weight ratio keying and diving which can be applied to secure offshore floating structures such as oil and gas platforms wind turbines net cages and wave and tidal energy converters compared with the installation procedures of existing gias an additional procedure for retrieving the booster i e stage 3 in fig 1 would increase the installation time of the l gipla and concomitantly increase the installation cost to some extent however the booster is an efficient installation tool with the ability of substantially increasing the gravitational energy of the hybrid anchor which encourages the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance to penetrate deeper into the seabed moreover the directional stability of the l gipla is improved attributed to the fins attached to the rear of the booster for instance numerical simulation results based on the computational fluid dynamics cfd approach indicate by connecting a booster with appropriate fin size the directional stability of the omni max anchor converts from unstable to stable state during free fall in water liu et al 2019 in addition the booster is also helpful in reducing the effect of anchor tilt from the vertical direction on the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed han et al 2019 preliminary studies by model tests and plasticity analyses indicate the l gipla mobilises deep penetration depth attributed to the booster and behaves diving properties during the keying process tong et al 2020 which examine the anchor performance within the seabed however the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hybrid anchor during free fall in water are still unclear the fall velocity and verticality are two key factors dominating the dynamic installation of gias hence it is paramount to illustrate the hydrodynamic characteristics especially the drag coefficient and directional stability of the hybrid anchor 1 2 scope of the present study the main issues motivating the present study which are associated with the hydrodynamic characteristics of the l gipla are summarised as follows 1 the drag coefficient of the l gipla is investigated by model tests 2 the geometry of the l gipla is optimised with tapered fluke and round grinded edge in order to reduce the drag coefficient and the hydrodynamic characteristics of the advanced l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor are investigated 3 the advanced l gipla is further optimised with folding shank to further improve the directional stability and reduce the drag force the unfolding process of the shank from the fluke is examined by model tests then the hydrodynamic characteristics of the advanced l gipla with folding shank are investigated 4 the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is investigated which has not been addressed previously 5 effective measurements are proposed to calibrate the tilt of gias during free fall in water 2 model tests details the model tests were conducted in a cylindrical plexiglass tank which is 8 m in height and 0 78 m in diameter as shown in fig 2 the diameter ratio from the circumscribed circle of the model l gipla to the water tank is about 1 8 thus the water tank is large enough to avoid boundary effects two measurement techniques the high speed camera and the motion tracking device mtd were adopted to measure the motion history of the anchor the former measurement technique was used to measure the fall velocity of the anchor in order to determine the drag coefficient and the latter one was used to monitor the anchor accelerations and angular velocities in three dimensional 3 d space aiming for estimating the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the reliability of the aforementioned measurement techniques has been verified by previous model tests in liu et al 2018 the drag force f d on the anchor can be described as eqn 1 1 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of water a f is the frontal area of the anchor in the plane perpendicular to the central line of the anchor and v is the fall velocity of the anchor the anchor accelerates during free fall in water until the velocity reaches the terminal velocity v t once the anchor reaches terminal velocity the drag force calculated by eqn 1 is equal to the submerged weight of the anchor hence the drag coefficient can be calculated by eqn 2 2 c d 2 w s ρ a f v t 2 where w s is the submerged weight of the anchor it should be noted that in principle the terminal velocity is reached only when the fall distance of the anchor approaches infinity in practice 99 v t is considered to be enough to represent the terminal velocity a high speed camera eosens cube7 was set near the bottom of the water tank 0 9 m above the tank bottom see fig 2 thus the model anchor adopted in the present study had approximately achieved the terminal velocity as it passed through the field of view of the high speed camera this will be shown in fig 4 b in the following section a guiding wire 0 8 mm in diameter was used in model tests to confine the verticality of the anchor during free fall in water thus the frontal area a f is a constant the anchor was released from the water surface by burning out the fishing line connected at the anchor tail during which the high speed camera captured the anchor motion history with a frequency of 670 hz the directional stability of the hybrid anchor depends on the position of the hydrodynamic centre hc relative to the gravity centre gc if hc is above gc the hybrid anchor is stable during free fall in water once the anchor is tilt the transversal force acting on the anchor generates a moment about gc which forces the anchor to rotate back towards the vertical direction for a given vertical fall displacement a less tilt angle of the anchor represents more favourable directional stability and vice versa to examine the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the guiding wire was removed and the hybrid anchor was allowed to fall freely in the water tank the anchor acceleration and angular velocity in 3 d space were measured by a mtd based on the micro electromechanical systems mems technique the mtd is integrated with a 3 axis mems accelerometer 16g and 3 axis mems gyroscope 2000 dps icm 20602 a microcontroller a memory card and a battery as shown in fig 3 c attributed to the mini size 42 mm 20 mm 3 mm the mtd can be sealed in the chamber towards the rear of the booster the interpretation of mtd measurements has been detailed introduced by blake et al 2016 and liu et al 2018 and is not repeated herein in model tests the sampling frequency of the mtd was set as 1000 hz 3 drag coefficient of original and advanced l giplas in this section the drag coefficient of the l gipla is first investigated then the geometry of the l gipla is modified to further reduce the drag coefficient and increase the terminal velocity which is beneficial in increasing the kinetic energy of the anchor subsequently the advanced improvement of the modified l gipla is verified by model tests 3 1 drag coefficient of original l gipla the l gipla in tong et al 2020 is termed as the original l gipla for the convenience of contrasting with the advanced modified l gipla in the following section the original l gipla is designed with two types of flukes triangular shaped type fig 3 a and peltate shaped type fig 3 b with triangular shaped flukes the l gipla is prone to penetrate into seabed with high shear strength such as stiff clay silt and sand while the l gipla with peltate shaped flukes enlarges the contact area between anchor and soil which is beneficial in improving the holding capacity the primary dimensions of the original triangular shaped simplified as ot and peltate shaped simplified as op l giplas are listed in table 1 the scale factor of the model anchor is λ 41 and the corresponding prototype length of ot or op is 5 m the included angle between two pieces of flukes θ f is less than 180 to balance the offset of shank ensuring the gravity centre is located at the centre of the intersection line of flukes a set of photographs is shown in fig 4 a to represent the free fall process of the anchor vertically along the guiding wire for given time interval and distance the average velocity of the anchor is estimated the relationship between the vertical velocity v z and the vertical displacement s z the fall distance of the anchor in the vertical direction after release of l giplas is plotted in fig 4 b it can be seen that the fall velocities of ot and op are constant indicating both ot and op have approximately reached the terminal velocity with a vertical displacement of 6 m the terminal velocities of ot and op are 2 74 m s and 2 88 m s respectively the drag force on a projectile can be divided into two parts the pressure drag and the frictional drag the former one depends on the shape of the projectile while the latter one depends on the reynolds number re for projectiles with non streamlined profile the total drag is dominated by the pressure drag with the reynolds number exceeding a critical value landau and lifshitz 1987 liu et al 2018 the drag coefficients calculated by eqn 2 are shown in fig 5 and table 2 which are 0 80 and 1 02 for ot and op respectively the discrepancy of the drag coefficient is primarily resulted from the anchor shape for a cone the drag coefficient increases from 0 30 to 0 80 with the cone angle increasing from 10 to 60 young et al 2010 indicating a blunt tip corresponds to a higher drag coefficient since the tip of op is blunter the corresponding drag coefficient is higher compared with that of ot the drag coefficients of torpedo anchors and omni max anchors are also plotted in fig 5 for comparison for the plate shaped omni max anchor the drag coefficient is in the range of 0 80 1 02 cenac 2011 liu et al 2018 while for the torpedo anchor the drag coefficient ranges 0 63 0 70 which is relatively lower due to the simple shape for the plate shaped ot and op the corresponding drag coefficients are closer to that of the omni max anchor richardson 2008 conducted cfd analyses to investigate the effect of the reynolds number on the drag coefficient of non fin torpedo anchors for a torpedo anchor with cone tip the drag coefficient is not decreased and maintains 0 22 with the reynolds number re exceeding 105 the cfd results in liu et al 2019 also indicated that the drag coefficient of the omni max anchor maintains 0 87 with re 105 the reynolds number is expressed as 3 re ρ v l η where l is the characteristic length of the projectile and η is the dynamic viscosity for the gia the anchor length can be selected as the characteristic length in eq 3 it can be deduced that for gias with non streamlined shapes the frictional drag has little effect on the total drag with re 105 in the present model tests it is easy for the fluid around the model anchor to reach re 105 i e v 0 8 m s given that the drag coefficient determined from model tests is equal to that in prototype the scale ratio of anchor velocity from prototype to model scale is λ 0 5 the terminal velocities of ot and op in prototype are 17 54 m s and 18 44 m s respectively 3 2 drag coefficient of advanced l gipla for a gia with certain frontal area and weight a lower drag coefficient means higher impact velocity hence it is valuable to modify the geometry of l gipla to reduce the drag coefficient the original l gipla is modified with 1 tapered fluke and round grinded edge to reduce drag coefficient and 2 thinner shank to reduce frontal area as shown in fig 6 a with round grinded edge the fluid can smoothly flow through the fluke tip and the water vortex at the tail of the fluke is reduced therefore the drag coefficient of the advanced l gipla should be reduced which will be verified later the advanced modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are simplified as at and ap whose dimensions are plotted in fig 6 b and listed in table 3 note for at and ap the gravity centre is still located at the centre of the intersection line of two flukes as plotted in fig 4 b the terminal velocities of at and ap are 3 78 m s and 4 17 m s respectively which are substantially higher than that of the original l giplas the drag coefficients of at and ap are 0 51 and 0 55 which are lower than that of original ones fig 5 for a gia with certain weight and frontal area a low drag coefficient will result in a high terminal velocity which is beneficial in increasing the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed generally the modified l gipla owns advanced hydrodynamic characteristics in contrast to the original anchor therefore in the following section i e section 4 associated with the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the l gipla refers to the advanced anchor while the original anchor is not considered 4 directional stability of hybrid anchors the hybrid anchor is termed as h xx yy nf where h represents hybrid anchor xx represents the type of the l gipla yy refers to the type of shank and n is a number denoting the ratio w b w f w b is the width of rear fins of the booster and w f is the width of the fluke of the l gipla for instance h at vs 2 0f refers to the hybrid anchor which is comprised of the advanced triangular shaped l gipla at with v contoured shank and the booster whose fin width is about 2 0 times the width of the l giplaʹs fluke note the shank geometry is involved in the description of the hybrid anchor in order to distinguish the v contoured shank from the folding shank which will be introduced in later sections in this section the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f is adopted as a special case to investigate its hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water the primary dimensions of the matching booster are listed in table 2 the total mass of the booster including the rear fins is 509 8 g which is about 1 88 times the mass of at in the following the parameters of the hybrid anchor are not introduced in the text and the reader can refer to table a1 in the appendix the motion history of the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f measured by the mtd is plotted in fig 7 the variation of acceleration against time is depicted in fig 7 a at the moment of t 0 the fishing line connected at the tail of the hybrid anchor is burning off as the fishing line is braided by 6 strands of threads the burning process lasts approximately 0 06 s then the hybrid anchor falls freely in the water column during which the acceleration gradually decreases resulted from the increase of the drag force acting on the anchor by integrating the vertical acceleration the vertical velocity and vertical fall displacement are obtained as also shown in fig 7 a a local fixed reference coordinate system with three orthogonal axes is defined on the hybrid anchor where the y axis is parallel to the symmetry plane of the shank and the z axis is parallel to the central line of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 7 b the tilt angle δ t of the hybrid anchor is the included angle from the central line of the hybrid anchor to the vertical direction if the hybrid anchor is hanging vertically its central line is parallel to the vertical direction as shown in fig 7 b the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x is negative and the absolute value of ϕ x increases gradually with the increase in the dimensionless vertical fall displacement s z h a h a is the length of the l gipla the negative value of ϕ x indicates the anchor tip rotates towards the shank which may be resulted from the drag force on the shank and will be discussed later the rotation angle θ y about the y axis should be zero as the y axis is parallel to the symmetry plane of the hybrid anchor the anchor rotation about the y axis may be resulted from errors in model tests with a tilt angle of δ t 3 which is a critical tilt angle in the present study the corresponding dimensionless vertical displacement is s z h a 21 7 as depicted in fig 7 c the tilt angle increases gradually with the increase in the vertical velocity for δ t 3 the corresponding vertical velocity is v z 4 27 m s and has not reached the terminal velocity to minimise the hybrid anchor from inclining during free fall in water it is valuable to 1 decrease the anchor fall distance in water and 2 further optimise the geometry of the l gipla the former one is unfavourable for the anchor fall velocity which is a vital factor affecting the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor within the seabed therefore optimising the geometry of the l gipla is a positive alternative to minimise the hybrid anchor from inclining during free fall in water though the hybrid anchor has not reached the terminal velocity in the model test as shown in fig 7 d the velocity 4 27 m s with δ t 3 is higher than the terminal velocity of at 3 78 m s shown in fig 4 b therefore the kinetic energy of the hybrid anchor is improved as both the fall velocity and total weight of the hybrid anchor are higher compared with that of a sole l gipla the equation of motion governing the free fall process of the hybrid anchor can be expressed as 4 m m a w s f d where m and w s are mass and submerged weight of the hybrid anchor m is the added mass and a is the acceleration the added mass term for the gia is limited and usually can be ignored shelton et al 2011 oʹbeirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018 for instance the added mass coefficient is only 0 02 for the omni max anchor during accelerating in water which is estimated from model tests fig 10 a in liu et al 2018 numerical simulation results indicate the drag coefficient of the omni max anchor exhibits a minor increase from 0 80 to 0 82 with the tilt angle increasing from 0 to 5 liu et al 2019 therefore it is concluded that the effect of the anchor tilt within 5 on the drag coefficient can be ignored given the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor is a constant it can be derived as 0 60 based on eq 4 and the parameters shown in the appendix as the hybrid anchor gradually tilts during free fall in water the dimensionless horizontal displacement s h h a s h is the horizontal displacement of the anchor after release experiences an increase with increasing dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a as shown in fig 7 e the drag forces on the fluke f d f and shank f d s of the advanced l gipla is shown in fig 8 a the gc of the l gipla is in line with the central line of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 8 b the drag force on the fluke will generate a clockwise positive moment m x f relative to gc while the drag force on the shank will generate a counter clockwise negative moment m x s relative to gc it is clearly that m x s overweighs m x f hence hc is away from gc towards the shank direction given the drag coefficient of the shank is equal to that of the fluke the offset δs depicted in fig 8 b of hc from gc is about the average thickness of the fluke therefore the total moment on the hybrid anchor is counter clockwise which forces the hybrid anchor to rotate about the negative x axis direction in the following the v contoured shank is removed from the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f to investigate the effect of the v contoured shank on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor the hybrid anchor without shank is termed as h at ns 2 0f in which ns denotes no shank from fig 9 a it can be seen that the angle ϕ x is positive indicating the hybrid anchor rotates about the positive x axis therefore it is proved that the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is greatly affected by the v contoured shank moreover with δ t 3 the dimensionless vertical fall displacement is s z h a 24 2 for the hybrid anchor h at ns 2 0f without shank which is higher than 21 7 for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f with a v contoured shank this indicates the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is improved by removing the shank as shown in fig 9 b by removing the shank the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor increases from 4 37 m s to 4 68 m s therefore it is necessary to modify the shank of the advanced l gipla in order to further 1 improve the directional stability and 2 increase the fall velocity 5 further advanced l gipla with folding shank to reduce the moment m x s relative to gc generated by the drag force acting on the shank f d s the advanced l gipla is further modified with a folding shank as shown in fig 10 a during free fall in water the shank is folded hence the moment m x s is relatively low during the keying process i e stage 4 in fig 1 the shank is unfolded as shown in fig 10 b the included angle between the folding shank and fluke is termed as the unfolding angle α i the unfolding process of the shank within the seabed causes the departure of the shank from the fluke therefore the uplift load at the padeye will generate a counter clockwise moment relative to gc which forces the anchor to rotate in the seabed when the shank is fully unfolded the padeye coincides with the padeye located on the v contoured shank as shown in fig 10 c the shank and fluke are connected with a hinge see fig 10 a and a one way bearing is sealed in the hinge the one way bearing allows the shank to just rotate outwards from the fluke hence the unfolding angle only can increase until to the fully unfolding angle showing in fig 10 c another alternative to improve the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is to reduce the included angle θ f between two flukes with the flukes departing further from the shank the moment m x f generated by the drag force acting on the fluke f d f will increase to balance m x s however the projected area of fluke in the plane perpendicular to the direction of the uplift force at the padeye decreases with the decrease of θ f which is unfavourable for the holding capacity of the l gipla the further modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped giplas with folding shanks are termed as ft and fp respectively for model ft and fp the width w s and thickness w e of the support which is used to accommodate the folding shank are 10 9 mm and 12 1 mm the frontal areas of ft and fp are 568 0 mm2 and 572 0 mm2 and the masses of ft and fp are 277 4 g and 383 1 g respectively 5 1 verification of the unfolding process of shank in seabed a model test was designed to examine the unfolding process of the shank for the further advanced peltate shaped l gipla in the homogeneous clayey soil the model fp was thrusted to the soil with an initial embedment depth of 2 2 times the anchor length two mems accelerometers adxl335 3g analog devices were sealed in the folding shank and fluke to measure the rotation angles of shank and fluke respectively the rotation angle of the shank α s refers to the included angle from the central line of shank to the vertical direction and the rotation angle of the fluke α f is the included angle from the central line of fluke to the vertical direction as shown in fig 11 a the maximum value of the unfolding angle α i is 90 under which condition the padeye offset angle θ p is 30 the padeye offset angle θ p fig 10 c is defined as θ p tan 1 e s e n where e s is the padeye offset denoting the distance from padeye to gc parallel to the central line of flukes e n is the padeye eccentricity defined as the distance from padeye to the central line of flukes in the model test the mooring line was pulled with a constant rate of 1 mm s and the uplift angle from the horizontal at the mudline i e θ 0 depicted in fig 1 maintained zero the rotation angles of the fluke and shank which were measured by mems accelerometers are plotted in fig 11 a the model test was paused several times for probing the anchor embedment depth in each loading step the pull distance of the mooring line s pull was restricted in the range of 20 30 mm s pull h a 0 16 0 24 at the end of each loading step the embedment depth of the anchor top to the soil surface was measured by a steel ruler hence the position of the anchor in the soil can be estimated it can be seen from fig 11 a that the anchor is stable within the soil with the normalised pull displacement s pull h a 0 5 during which the mooring line gradually cuts through the soil the shank starts to unfold with the normalised pull displacement s pull h a 0 5 while the fluke maintains stable within the seabed as the rotation angle of α f is zero the normalised vertical displacement of gc δz h a δz is the displacement of gc in the vertical direction is also zero as shown in fig 11 b verifying the fluke is stable with s pull h a 0 9 both the rotation angle α f and normalised vertical displacement δz h a experience an increase with increasing s pull h a indicating the fluke is rotated and pulled upwards at the same time with s pull h a continuously increasing to 1 39 the upwards displacement δz h a reaches the peak value the maximum upward displacement of gc is termed as the loss of embedment which is about 0 11h a in the present study the loss of embedment during the keying process primarily depends on the padeye offset angle and the uplift angle at the mudline tian et al 2015 liu et al 2017 with the same padeye offset angle of θ p 30 the loss of embedment for op is about 0 22h a derived from plasticity analyses tong et al 2020 the discrepancy is primarily resulted from the difference in the uplift angle at the mudline the uplift angle at the mudline is θ 0 20 in the plasticity analyses which will result in a higher loss of embedment with s pull h a 1 39 the anchor dives deeper into the soil and the unfolding angle α i reaches the maximum value of 90 generally the shank can be unfolded during the keying process 5 2 drag coefficient of the further modified l gipla with folding shank it is shown in fig 4 b that the terminal velocities of ft and fp are 4 03 m s and 4 48 m s the frontal area of the folding shank is lower compared with that of the v contoured shank hence the terminal velocities of ft and fp are higher than that of at and ap the drag coefficients are plotted in fig 5 which are 0 51 and 0 57 for ft and fp respectively the drag coefficient of ft with folding shank is similar to that of at with v contoured shank a higher velocity means higher kinetic energy which encourages the anchor to gain a deeper penetration depth within the seabed moreover during dynamic penetration process within the seabed the soil resistance on the folding shank is lower than that on the v contoured shank which is also beneficial in increasing the final penetration depth of the anchor within the seabed 5 3 effect of folding shank on directional stability of hybrid anchor by conducting free fall tests in water the effect of the folding shank on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor h ft fs 2 0f is examined as shown in fig 12 it is seen from fig 12 a that compared with the v contoured shank the folding shank is positive to reduce the rotation angle about the x axis during the entire free fall process in water the tilt angle of the hybrid anchor h ft fs 2 0f does not reach the critical angle of 3 for instance with δ t 1 the corresponding dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a increases from 9 17 to 18 49 by replacing the v contoured shank with the folding shank this indicates the folding shank is efficient in reducing the moment m x s relative to gc the vertical velocity plotted in fig 12 b indicates with the same dimensionless vertical displacement the velocity of the hybrid anchor with a folding shank is higher than that with a v contoured shank therefore it is concluded that the folding shank is beneficial both in improving the directional stability and vertical fall velocity of the hybrid anchor to summarise the l gipla has experienced two steps of optimisation the first is to modify the fluke with tapered thickness and round grinded edge and the second is to replace the v contoured shank with folding shank the optimised l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor exhibit improved hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water the effect of fin width w b on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is also investigated and the results are plotted in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 a with the ratio w b w f increasing from 1 5 to 2 0 the rotation angle about the x axis exhibits a minor decrease indicating enlarging the fin width is helpful in improving the directional stability of the hybrid anchor with a higher fin aspect ratio which is defined as the ratio of fin width to fin length the hc tends to move towards the rear of the hybrid anchor and hence the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is improved triantafyllou and hover 2003 however the frontal area of the hybrid anchor is also increased with the increase in the fin width which will reversely reduce the fall velocity as plotted in fig 13 b the vertical velocity at the final stage of the free fall test decreases from 4 89 m s to 4 64 m s with the ratio w b w f increasing from 1 5 to 2 0 hence it is necessary to optimise the fin width with the aim of ensuring the directional stability but without affecting the fall velocity of the hybrid anchor in model tests it is very difficult to determine the position of hc which obscures the estimation of the directional stability of the hybrid anchor therefore further numerical simulations should be carried out to optimise the fin size 6 effect of mooring line on directional stability of hybrid anchor before releasing the hybrid anchor the mooring line connected at the padeye is usually pre released to the seabed as sketched in fig 14 a de araujo et al 2004 two types of mooring lines synthetic rope and steel chain are usually used in practical engineering the density of the synthetic rope is closer to that of water hence the synthetic rope is pulled by the advanced anchor for link to link chains with complex geometry a segment of chain is dragged to move together with the anchor during free fall in water the model tests result in liu et al 2018 indicated that the length of chain that moves together with the omni max anchor increases with the vertical fall distance of the anchor therefore the fall velocity of the gia is reduced by the mooring line connected to the padeye moreover a moment m mr relative to gc of the anchor is generated by the moving mooring line which results in the further tilt of the anchor tip towards the shank see fig 14 a it can be concluded that the moment m mr on the hybrid anchor with a v contoured shank is higher than that with a folding shank due to the discrepancy of the distance from padeye to the central line of the hybrid anchor previous studies have investigated the drag efficient of the mooring line and the effect of the mooring line on the fall velocity of gias oʹbeirne et al 2017 liu et al 2018 however the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of gias is not clearly stated until now to present the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor more significantly the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a v contoured type was selected a polyester rope 3 mm in diameter was used to simulate the mooring line in model tests it is shown in fig 15 a that with the dimensionless vertical displacement s z h a 7 the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x for the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line is considerably consistent with that for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f without mooring line however the angle ϕ x for h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line increases drastically with s z h a 7 which is resulted from the increase of the moment m mr the moment m mr generated by the mooring line depends on the anchor velocity and the length of mooring line that moves together with the anchor therefore the tilt of the hybrid anchor with a mooring line is further exacerbated with increasing dimensionless vertical displacement fig 15 b indicates the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a mooring line reaches a maximum value of 3 57 m s with the dimensionless vertical displacement of s z h a 15 0 which is lower than 4 01 m s for the hybrid anchor h at vs 2 0f without mooring line with the same vertical displacement as indicated in liu et al 2018 the length of the mooring line that moves together with the anchor increases with the increase of the vertical fall displacement hence the anchor velocity reversely decreases after reaching the maximum value as shown in fig 15 b therefore an optimised vertical fall distance should be pre estimated to ensure the anchor to gain an impact velocity as high as possible to summarise the directional stability of the hybrid anchor is deteriorated by the mooring line and effective measurements should be put forward to avoid mitigate the hybrid anchor from tilting caused by the mooring line 7 methods for mitigating tilt of gias a simple method to rectify the tilt of the hybrid anchor caused by the mooring line is to set an arched fin at the direction opposite the shank as shown in fig 14 b the drag force on the arched fin will generate a clockwise moment m af relative to gc of the hybrid anchor which can be used to balance the moment m mr caused by the mooring line to some extent model tests were conducted to investigate the effects of the arched fin and mooring line on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the hybrid anchor and the results are depicted in fig 16 the model hybrid anchor is h fp fs 1 7f and the radius and radian of the arched fin are r af 0 8w f and 2π 3 from fig 16 a it is seen that by connecting the arched fin the rotation angle about the x axis ϕ x of the hybrid anchor is converted from negative to positive this indicates that the moment m af overweighs m x s if the mooring line is taken into consideration the angle ϕ x for the hybrid anchor h fp fs 1 7f 0 8af af refers to the arched fin and 0 8 is the ratio of the radius of the arched fin r af to the width of the fluke experiences a transition from positive to negative during the free fall process in water as the hybrid anchor initially falls freely in water the drag force on the mooring line is relatively low hence the moment m mr is less than m af therefore the anchor rotation is dominated by the moment m af which results in the anchor rotation about the positive x axis with the increase of the vertical fall displacement the length of the mooring line that moves together with the hybrid anchor increases hence the moment m mr gradually exceeds m af once m mr m af the rotation angle ϕ x starts to decrease and even to a negative value generally the arched fin is effective in reducing the anchor tilt during free fall in water caused by the mooring line the results shown in fig 16 b indicate the vertical velocity at the final stage of model test for the hybrid anchor h fp fs 1 7f 0 8rf is 4 90 m s which is slightly lower than 5 01 m s for h fp fs 1 7f the arched fin is similar to a thin plate whose drag coefficient is relatively low therefore the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor is not greatly affected by the arched fin moreover the comparison between figs 15 and 16 indicates the directional stabilities of hybrid anchors with triangular shaped l gipla and peltate shaped l gipla are similar but the vertical velocity of the hybrid anchor with pletate shaped l gipla is higher attributed to the higher weight of the l gipla and the corresponding booster actually the booster weight can be varied by varying the shaft length or diameter on the basis of practical requirement the effect of the booster weight on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the omni max anchor has been investigated by cfd numerical simulations liu et al 2019 the results indicate the drag coefficient only exhibits a minor increase with increasing booster length and the directional stability of the anchor is greatly unaffected by the booster length therefore by varying the booster weight the l gipla is deployable in the wide range of soil conditions such as soft to stiff clay silt sand and stratified seabed another method for balancing the drag force of the mooring line is to set a small fan shaped plate in the direction opposite the shank as shown in fig 17 a the horizontal distance from the fan shaped plate to the central line of the hybrid anchor can be adjusted based on the material size and shape of the mooring line in model tests two fan shaped plates are designed with different sizes as shown in fig 17 b which are simply termed as smaller plate 6 mm in radius and π 2 in radian and bigger plate 10 mm in radius and π 2 in radian the fan shaped plate was connected at the tail of the booster towards the direction opposite the shank ensuring the distance between the outer edge of the fan shaped plate and the central line of the hybrid anchor maintains 15 mm the hybrid anchor h at vs 1 7f with a v contoured shank is adopted to amplify the effect of the mooring line on the directional stability of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 17 b by connecting the smaller plate the tilt of the hybrid anchor caused by the v contoured shank and mooring line is largely mitigated by connecting the bigger plate the rotation angle about the x axis converts from negative to positive it can be assumed that the rotation angle ϕ x maintains zero or approximately zero during the entire free fall process in water if the distance between the outer edge of the fan shaped plate and the central line of the hybrid anchor can be adjusted in real time moreover the verticality of the gia during free fall in water is also affected by other factors such as the ground current the vertex at the anchor tail therefore future studies should be devoted to develop a sophisticated control system using to correct the tilt of gias during free fall in water in real time which is beneficial for the dynamic installation of gias 8 conclusions model tests are conducted in the present study to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of the l gipla and the corresponding hybrid anchor the primary findings are summarised as following 1 the drag coefficients of the original triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are 0 80 and 1 02 by modifying the l gipla with tapered fluke and round grinded edge the drag coefficients of the advanced triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas are reduced to 0 51 and 0 55 respectively 2 a further modified l gipla with folding shank is proposed to reduce the frontal area of the anchor which is beneficial in increasing the fall velocity during free fall in water and the final penetration depth during dynamic penetration in the seabed the drag coefficients of the further modified triangular shaped and peltate shaped l giplas with folding shank are 0 51 and 0 57 both the fall velocity and directional stability of the hybrid anchor with folding shank l gipla are improved 3 the directional stability of the gia is deteriorated by the mooring line which forces the gia tip to rotate towards the shank direction an arched fin or fan shaped plate can be set to the rear of the gia in the direction opposite the shank in order to balance the drag force caused by the mooring line credit authorship contribution statement congcong han writing reviewing and editing

21364,results of reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations are reported on a towed fully appended notional submarine model computations are validated against data in the literature dealing with both global loads and the vortices originating from the sail the analysis of the flow is focused on the coherent structures shed from the tip and the root of the appendages defining the wake signature of the submarine and affecting the flow field over the propeller plane their positions and intensities are compared across four operative conditions straight ahead drift and both positive and negative pitch computations demonstrate that the condition with negative pitch is the one producing the most complex topology of the flow in the stern region where the vortices from the tip of the sailplanes are able to influence both the fins and the flow at the propeller plane however the widest and most intense vortex is generated in drift from the tip of the sail because of the strong gradient of pressure produced between the two sides of the fore appendages the pattern of the coherent structures produced by the stern appendages is substantially dependent on the maneuvering conditions in both pitch conditions their tip vortices have values of circulation very similar across the four fins this is not the case in drift the one most affected by the wake of the sail is the smallest and weakest the most intense junction vortices from the stern appendages which are able to influence more directly the inflow of the propeller occur instead in drift keywords naval hydrodynamics submarines cfd coherent structures rans equations manouevering 1 introduction submarines in maneuvering conditions shed a wealth of vortical structures from the main body and the appendages such as the casing fins rudders and diving planes typical of this class of vessels renilson 2018 the interaction of these coherent structures with the control surfaces and the propeller at the tail of a submarine is detrimental to its manouevering capabilities and is a source of vibrations and emission of noise having a negative impact on its stealth capabilities in addition mechanical stress and fatigue are produced also due to cavitation phenomena occurring within the core of the vortices in this field a limited number of experimental works is available in the literature some studies were focused on the darpa suboff dsub which is a notional nuclear submarine geometry groves et al 1989 featuring a large length over diameter ratio huang et al 1992 performed experiments with and without appendages dealing with pressure and skin friction coefficients and profiles of first and second order statistics across the hull jiménez et al 2010a b focused their studies on the evolution of the wake of the submarine and the effects on the intermediate wake by its appendages another reference geometry was developed by the defence science and technology organization dsto as reported by joubert 2004 2006 after some modifications aimed at increasing its stability and control it is currently known as the bb2 submarine model it is representative of a diesel submarine with a large casing two fore fins placed on the side of the sail and an x form rudder arrangement overpelt et al 2015 several measurements were conducted at dsto on this model wind tunnel data include particle imaging velocimetry piv and load measurements surface pattern flow visualizations and velocity profiles in straight ahead and in static drift advancement at several reynolds numbers anderson et al 2012 quick et al 2012 quick and woodyatt 2014 fureby et al 2016 and lee et al 2019 free running maneuvering tests were also conducted by overpelt et al 2015 and carrica et al 2016 experimental tests are able to provide in depth information on the flow physics and are still vital for the validation of any cfd simulation but they have also some limitations for instance for captive model tests wind tunnel and towing tank measurements one of the major drawbacks is the need of supports influencing the flow fields moreover as much as for cfd computations also for flow measurements the spatial resolution of instrumentation limits the flow structures that can be captured in addition the access to some regions around the model is often not possible especially for example in presence of a propeller cfd has been proven to be a valid tool for flow field analysis and hydrodynamic performance predictions in naval hydrodynamics avoiding some of the drawbacks of the physical experiments for example the flow field is not influenced by any physical support and additional details of the flow can be revealed nevertheless numerical simulations still have significant limitations and issues originating mainly from their computational cost and the accuracy of turbulence closure models especially when dealing with large separated flows visonneau et al 2018 broglia et al 2019 numerical approaches with different levels of approximation have been utilized for the analysis of the hydrodynamics and maneuvering of submarines high fidelity large eddy simulations les of the flow around a submarine were performed by some authors this class of simulations uses huge computational grids as a very fine spatial resolution is one of the keys to the success of these techniques one of the first computations of this type was reported by posa and balaras 2016 where the towed appended dsub in straight ahead was simulated at a reynolds number based on the length of the submarine and the free stream velocity equal to r e 1 2 10 6 an immersed boundary method was adopted within a cylindrical grid composed of 2 8 billion points a comprehensive analysis of the flow was carried out including cfd validation against efd data from jiménez et al 2010b in a following study posa and balaras 2018 analyzed the flow field and the turbulent wake for the same submarine model in both towed and self propelled conditions in posa and balaras 2020 les computations on the towed appended dsub at r e 1 2 10 7 were reported discussing the reynolds number effect on the boundary layer and the wake of the submarine wang et al 2016 adopted an immersed boundary method based on a moving least squares reconstruction to perform les simulations around the fully appended dsub at a lower reynolds number r e 1 0 10 5 the bare hull was considered by shi et al 2019 where the immersed boundary method was utilized coupled with a new wall model reconstruction to reduce the computational effort at a reynolds number r e 1 2 10 6 the bare hull dsub was also studied by kumar and mahesh 2018 at a reynolds number r e 1 1 10 6 using a body fitted unstructured grid consisting of almost 610 millions volumes however in the above studies the dsub was simulated in the straight ahead configuration producing weak coherent structures this was motivated by the need of limiting the computational burden to make les more affordable especially at high reynolds numbers and in maneuvering conditions wall modeled les wmles or hybrid rans les methodologies such as detached eddy simulation des were also exploited for instance alin et al 2010 bhushan et al 2013 chase and carrica 2013 and chase et al 2013 compared les des and rans predictions for the dsub geometry in particular chase et al 2013 and chase and carrica 2013 investigated the dsub in self propulsion in captive steady turn and horizontal overshoot maneuvers the accuracy of wmles compared against les and rans based simulations was investigated for a series of naval hydrodynamics flows including also the dsto submarine by liefvendahl and fureby 2017 fureby and may 2017 and liefvendahl and johansson 2018 numerical simulations of the dsto submarine using wmles were also performed by anderson et al 2012 fureby et al 2016 norrison et al 2016 and petterson et al 2018 these works analyzed the dsto model in straight ahead and steady drift advancement as well as in self propulsion an in depth analysis was conducted on the flow field pointing to the importance of the coherent structures shed from the submarine appendages which are able to affect both the maneuvering performance of the fins as well as the propeller skin friction and velocity profiles were in fairly good agreement with measurements in addition fureby et al 2016 compared the coherent structures from wmles computations against piv experiments finding a good qualitative agreement although details on the intensity of the vortices were not reported unsteady rans computations were demonstrated to be a valid affordable alternative much less expensive than wmles or des especially for handling high reynolds numbers unsteady maneuvering conditions and for the analysis of a large number of different operative conditions one of the first papers dealing with a notional submarine geometry the onr body 1 in manoeuvring conditions was reported by pankajakshan et al 2002 a rans based approach was exploited to simulate the self propelled performance of the underwater vehicle undergoing a controlled overshoot maneuver self propelled horizontal and vertical maneuvers of the dsub submarine were investigated by martin et al 2015 bettle et al 2009 studied the buoyantly rising maneuver of the drdc str submarine model whereas webster et al 2018 applied both a fully cfd based solver and a steady state approach coupling a rans solver with the force equilibrium equations to calculate the velocity and pitch angle of an underwater vehicle in an unpowered negatively buoyant dive carrica et al 2016 2018 analyzed different free running maneuvers of the bb2 submarine model in both calm water and in waves also kim et al 2018 presented a study dealing with a steady turning self propelled maneuver of the bb2 geometry dubbioso et al 2017 analyzed the maneuvering characteristics of a notional submarine vehicle the cnr insean 2475 with two different configurations of the stern appendages recently the avt 301 nato working group flowfield prediction for manoeuvring underwater vehicles has carried out a study on the capabilities of different cfd solvers in dealing with large separated flows taking as benchmark the bb2 submarine advancing in both straight ahead and steady drift conditions toxopeus et al 2019 all above works were mainly focused on the analysis of the maneuvering performance including comparison with efd data in terms of global forces trajectory and or dynamic kinematic parameters for a maneuvering submarine strong vortices are generated from the root of the sail the well known horse shoe vortices the tip of the sail the forward hydroplanes generally placed on the side of the sail and from the aft rudders and diving planes renilson 2018 however it should be noted that none of the above works was focused on a detailed analysis of the intensity of those coherent structures with the exception of the experiments recently reported by lee et al 2019 and the comparison across maneuvering conditions in terms of ability of those structures to affect the signature of the submarine and the flow conditions within the propeller region the present paper is aimed at analyzing those vortices comparing their position evolution and intensity across four different operative conditions straight ahead static drift and positive negative pitch their influence on the flow conditions at the stern appendages and over the propeller plane is also discussed such analysis is conducted using an in house unsteady rans solver results were extensively verified and validated against available numerical and experimental data in the following sections after a short survey of the adopted mathematical model section 2 and numerical methodology section 3 the computational setup including the geometry of the submarine and its operative conditions is presented section 4 in section 5 a complete assessment of verification and validation is reported then the results section section 6 starts with an overview of the flow field around the submarine and is followed by a detalied discussion of the coherent structures shed by the submarine across the four operative conditions finally section 7 provides a summary of our findings 2 mathematical model simulations reported in the present work were conducted by means of the χnavis code resolving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations and developed in house at cnr inm the solver is based on a finite volume discretization in generalized curvilinear coordinates it is globally second order accurate in both space and time details are reported for example by di mascio et al 2001 2006 2009 broglia et al 2014 and broglia and durante 2018 only the main features are discussed here 2 1 governing equations in the framework of a finite volume methodology the conservation of mass and momentum for incompressible flows are enforced in their integral form by denoting with v a

equation 1 f ch is a forcing term utilized in the framework of the overlapping grids technique adopted here see di mascio et al 2006 and zaghi et al 2015 for more details equation 1 was scaled by using the submarine overall length l o a and its advance velocity u in urans methodologies turbulence is modeled the components of the stress tensor τ i j are computed as 3 τ i j 1 r e ν t u i x j u j

of equation 4 can be written as 6 λ q t i j k 1 v i j k r i j k v i j k f c h d v 0 where r i j k is the flux balance relative to the control volume v i j k the surface integrals are evaluated by means of a second order formula for the viscous fluxes the velocity gradients are computed using a standard second order centered finite volume approximation for the convective part the fluxes come from the solution of a riemann problem f f c q f c q f f c q l q r whose left q l and right q r states are estimated by means of a third order upwind based scheme van leer 1979 a second order accurate solution of the riemann problem is achieved instead of the exact one which should be computed iteratively increasing the computational burden see di mascio et al 2001 and posa and broglia 2019 for more details the resulting scheme was demonstrated second order accurate producing oscillations free solutions also in presence of discontinuities di mascio et al 2009 time integration of equation 6 is achieved by a second order three points implicit backward finite difference scheme the resulting system of coupled non linear algebraic equations is tackled via a pseudo time technique chorin 1967 using an implicit euler scheme with an approximate factorization beam and warming 1978 a local dual time step and a multi grid technique favini et al 1996 are exploited for faster convergence in the pseudo time more details on the overall solver can be found in di mascio et al 2006 2007 2009 broglia and durante 2018 and broglia et al 2014 4 computational setup numerical simulations were carried out around the notional bb2 submarine see fig 1 the bb2 model is a modification of the bb1 submarine based on a concept design by joubert 2004 2006 featuring larger aft control surfaces and a thicker sail located more forward the length over the maximum diameter of the bare hull is l o a 2 r m 7 3 the main geometrical details are given in table 1 and visualized in fig 2 simulations were performed at model scale with a scale factor of λ 18 348 the configuration considered is fully appended including fore planes on the sail and aft rudders without propeller the rudders consist of fixed and moving parts separated by a small gap of about 1 mm at model scale more information on the bb2 model can be found in overpelt et al 2015 and bettle 2014 all numerical simulations were carried out in deep fresh water conditions i e density ρ 1 000 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity ν 1 2 10 6 m2 s with no free surface effects at a constant advance speed equal to u 3 m s at model scale therefore the reynolds number considered in the computations is r e u l o a ν 9 565 10 6 computations were conducted for the straight ahead condition in level flight zero drift and pitch angles one steady drift angle and two pitch angles the operative conditions are summarized in table 2 non zero drift and pitch angles were achieved deflecting the incoming flow the drift is positive if the flow comes from port side whereas the pitch is positive when the flow comes from below the adopted frame of reference is shown in fig 1 with the x axis aligned with the axis of the submarine positive upstream the z axis oriented vertically positive downward and the y axis completing a right handed system 4 1 fluid domain and computational grid a rectangular box was selected as fluid domain around the bb2 model with upstream boundary at x 1 5 l o a downstream boundary at x 1 5 l o a lateral sides and top bottom boundaries at y z 1 l o a a structured grid composed of overlapping blocks was generated using the commercial software pointwise for the starboard half of the fluid domain this half grid was utilized for the simulation of the configurations in straight ahead and in pitch taking advantage of the symmetry of the flow relative to the y 0 plane instead for the non zero drift angle case producing asymmetric flow conditions between the sides of positive and negative y coordinates the half grid was mirrored relative to the y 0 plane to create the overall grid the number of cells of all block edges was set to be multiple of four allowing computations on three grid levels with consecutive grid refinement ratios equal to two fig 3 shows the block structure of the computational grid and fig 4 the mesh and block edges over the plane of symmetry a high quality structured grid was generated around the bb2 submarine out to a distance of at least 0 9 b away from its surface the structured region was expanded across the downstream direction out to a cylinder of diameter 11 68 b extending downstream up to the outlet section an inflation layer i e a series of block structured grids with thin elements clustered in the vicinity of the solid walls having a thickness of approximately 0 21 b was built around the bb2 surface the height of the first cells off the surface of the submarine was designed to achieve an average y value below 1 the average wall normal mesh expansion rate from the surface of the submarine is equal to 1 12 the near body grid corresponds to region 1 of the grid grd22 s4a l4 described in more detail in bettle 2020 in fig 5 the details of the computational grid at the root of the sailfin and at the junction between the sail and the main body provide a picture of the mesh refinement in the boundary layer region a block structured background mesh was adopted to resolve the region between the body fitted grid surrounding the submarine and the far field boundaries in total the full grid after mirroring was composed of 424 blocks 392 surrounding the submarine and 32 discretizing the background and about 27 4 million finite volumes 26 4 million of them were utilized for the solution of the flow within the region of the body fitted grid around the submarine table 3 provides a summary for the mesh parameters and metrics whereas in table 4 the dimensions of the first grid cells away from the surface of the body are provided in wall units no slip boundary conditions for velocity were enforced on the surface of the body while for pressure a condition of zero gradient along the normal direction was utilized dirichlet boundary conditions were adopted for velocity and pressure at the inlet and outlet of the computational domain respectively neumann conditions were enforced for pressure at the inlet and for the velocity vector at the outlet the lateral top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain were treated as far field boundaries i e a neumann condition was enforced for all variables the numerical solutions were computed by means of a full multi grid full approximation scheme fmg fas see favini et al 1996 with three grid levels generated by removing from the next finer one every other grid points the whole set of grid levels for which the refinement ratio is two was utilized for verification and validation purposes in the fmg fas approximation procedure the solution is computed on the coarsest grid level first then it is prolongated on the next finer grid and the solution is iterated by exploiting all coarser grid levels using a v cycle the process is iterated up to the finest grid level at each level the iterative solution is carried out until the l 2 norm of the residuals drops by four orders of magnitude up to a maximum number of 2000 multigrid cycles for the present computations a careful check on the variation of the forces over multigrid cycles was performed the root mean square variation of the forces and moments across the last 100 iterations was always less than 1 an example of iterative convergence is shown in fig 6 where the history of the residuals and non dimensional forces and moments versus multigrid cycles is reported for the straight ahead case the computational problem was tackled here via parallel high performance computing distributing the structured blocks across several cores communication between them for the coarse grain distributed memory parallelization was achieved via calls to standard message passing interface mpi libraries while fine grain shared memory parallelization was based on open message passing openmp libraries broglia et al 2014 in the framework of the present study the computation of the steady drift case utilized 136 cores with a computational cost of less than 24 wall clock hours and about half the time for the other cases each 5 verification and validation verification and validation were carried out on the hydrodynamic loads on the submarine the former deals with order of convergence and numerical uncertainty the latter with the modeling error against reference data values reported below refer to non dimensional forces and moments defined as 7 x y z x y z ρ u 2 l o a 2 k m n k m n ρ u 2 l o a 3 where denotes dimensional forces or moments across the directions defined by the frame of reference shown in fig 1 note that in the following ρ u and l o a will be utilized to scale all quantities results for verification assessment are summarized in table 5 the analysis was carried out for all simulated conditions in the table data from the coarse medium and fine meshes are denoted with s 3 s 2 and s 1 respectively the order of accuracy p was estimated as 8 p l n ε 32 ε 21 l n r where ε i j s i s j and r is the grid refinement ratio r 2 in the current analysis from the solutions on the medium and fine meshes and from the observed order of accuracy both the richardson s extrapolated error δ r e 9 δ r e ε 21 r p 1 and the generalized richardson s extrapolated solution s r e 10 s r e s 1 δ r e were computed when monotonic convergence is attained i e the difference between the results on two consecutive grid levels is decreasing 0 ε 21 ε 32 1 the grid uncertainty can be estimated several methods see for example roache 1997 eça and hoekstra 2006 stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 can be used in the present work the factor of safety method proposed by xing and stern 2010 was adopted in this method the distance from the asymptotic range is estimated via the ratio between the computed order of accuracy and the theoretical one i e p p p t h in this case p t h 2 when the solutions are in the asymptotic range the actual order of convergence is roughly equal to the theoretical value p 1 this method provides an overall 95 confidence level for the estimated uncertainty to bound the true error according to the factor of safety method the uncertainty can be computed as 11 u f s 2 45 0 85 p δ r e i f 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ r e i f p 1 in table 5 the estimated numerical uncertainties are reported since negligible iterative uncertainty was observed grid uncertainty can be considered as the only significant contribution to the numerical uncertainty in general the results in table 5 show monotonic convergence with the actual order of convergence usually close to the theoretical value a few exceptions can be seen as the monotonic divergence m d observed for the lateral force y and the roll moment k in the steady drift condition however in these cases an almost negligible variation of the estimated load with the grid level less than 2 occurs meaning that the value provided by the coarsest grid level is practically at convergence for these loads the contribution from the pressure component is dominant against the viscous one and can be estimated accurately even on rather coarse grids similar results are seen for the yaw moment n in the steady drift condition good results are also observed for the numerical uncertainty usually within 5 with a maximum of about 8 for the resistance x in steady drift as shown later in this case a wealth of coherent structures are shed from the appendages and due to boundary layer separation on the main body in comparison with the other operative conditions larger differences in the prediction of these structures and boundary layer separation across different grid resolutions are likely the source of the higher levels of grid uncertainty on the numerical assessment of resistance x the validation assessment was performed via comparison of the present results with data available in literature in particular against the numerical dataset produced in the framework of the nato avt 301 working group toxopeus et al 2019 several groups provided results for the bb2 submarine in straight ahead 44 submissions and steady drift 42 submissions conditions by using different numerical techniques turbulence models and computational grids reference results for the configurations in pitch are not available in table 6 averages d and standard deviations σ d across all available data are reported with the latter taken as the uncertainty of the former 12 d 1 n s i 1 n s d i σ d 100 d 1 n s i 1 n s d d i 2 where n s is the number of available reference data d i is the ith sample d being any of the computed hydrodynamic loads the error between the present results and the reference data ε d as percentage of d was computed as 13 ε d s r e d d and is reported in the last column of table 6 it is worth noting that for those loads not achieving monotonic convergence which are y and k in steady drift the result on the finest grid level was utilized since the extrapolated value s r e is unavailable the comparison in table 6 against the reference data shows a rather good agreement demonstrating the accuracy of the present results the error is usually within 4 with a maximum of about 12 for the prediction of the resistance x in the steady drift condition however for the latter a rather large standard deviation across the reference data was observed resulting from the presence of several outliers the accuracy of the computational results is reinforced via a detailed comparison with the experiments recently published by lee et al 2019 on the coherent structures shed by the same submarine model lee et al 2019 carried out wind tunnel measurements at length based reynolds numbers of 4 and 8 millions i e only slightly lower than the one simulated in the present study they considered the same drift angle of the submarine as in this work with an incidence of 10 relative to the free stream it should be also noted that the measurements reported by lee et al 2019 demonstrated negligible differences between r e 4 10 6 and r e 8 10 6 therefore we can assume them as a reference for the results from the present computations they consist of stereo particle image velocimetry spiv experiments on three cross stream planes normal to the free stream velocity the three planes are placed just after the sail in front of the rear appendages and midway located at 0 511 l o a 0 815 l o a and 0 650 l o a respectively from the nose of the submarine in table 7 the positions of the vortices originating from the tip of the sail and the tip of both windward a leeward sailplanes are compared against the measurements on each plane the onset and progression of these vortices will be illustrated in the following sections in agreement with the criterion adopted by lee et al 2019 all positions are reported on a frame of reference o x y z with the origin at the nose of the submarine the x axis aligned with the free stream velocity oriented downstream the z axis vertical positive upward and the y axis completing a right handed system of coordinates the comparison between the present simulations and the reference measurements is excellent across all planes and coherent structures the agreement keeps very close even at the most downstream plane although those structures already experienced a strong interaction between each other comparisons with the experiments is also provided for the circulation on the first plane the non dimensional circulation was defined as in lee et al 2019 for a direct comparison 14 κ γ r m u s i n β with γ a ω x d a where γ is the dimensional value of circulation and ω x is the vorticity component along the x axis normal to the measurement planes the area a was defined following lee et al 2019 they estimated the core radius r c as the distance from the center of the vortex to the location of maximum tangential velocity then they assumed the radius of the integration area equal to 1 25 r c comparisons are reported in table 7 they are fairly good with the circulation slightly overestimated by the numerical computations this result comes from a wider size of the vortices which is due to enhanced diffusion from rans turbulence modeling however it should be noted that this behavior is expected from rans computations as recently demonstrated by toxopeus et al 2019 6 results 6 1 overview of the flow in this section a general overview of the flow is provided in fig 7 where the q criterion is adopted for visualization of the main vortices colors show contours of non dimensional streamwise vorticity as expected due to the smaller pressure gradients generated at the end of the several appendages the straight ahead condition is the one producing the weaker coherent structures as shown in the top and bottom panels a of fig 7 in all other configurations several large vortices from both sail and fins are much more evident as shown in fig 8 a dealing with a detail of the negative pitch case fig 7c the sail produces a complex system of vortices originating from its tip and its root horseshoe vortices but also from the appendages of the sail sailplanes tip and horseshoe vortices similar tip and junction vortices are produced from the tip and the root of each fin at the rear of the submarine body see fig 8b more quantitative details aimed at comparing the several structures especially in drift and pitch will be provided later however fig 7 allows us to formulate some general considerations the third configuration represented in the top and bottom panels c of fig 7 corresponding to negative pitch is the one producing the most complex interactions involving the coherent structures in that case the sailplane tip vortices collide with the upper fins at the tail of the submarine this as shown in fig 9 affects the evolution of these vortices changing also their trajectories as in the case of the tip vortices shed by a propeller operating upstream of a hydrofoil see the recent works by hu et al 2020 and posa et al 2020a 2020b in addition as discussed more in detail below in this configuration the propeller region is populated by several vortices since those originating from the sail are directed towards the location of the propeller although here the latter was not included being outside the scope of this work and because of computational cost constraints in contrast when the submarine is in drift or in positive pitch the structures originating from the sail keep away from the stern of the submarine producing a lower density of coherent structures and weaker interaction in the propeller region the comparison across the panels of fig 7 also demonstrates that the largest horseshoe vortices from the sail occur in the condition of positive pitch of the submarine shown by the panels d of fig 7 this result could be the consequence of those vortices moving away from the surface of the submarine due to the orientation of the latter relative to the free stream in the other cases the viscous drag between the junction vortices and the boundary layer over the hull promotes instead a faster dissipation of the former downstream of the sail in addition the following analysis will demonstrate that the conditions of cross flow over the hull of the submarine allow its boundary layer to provide additional vorticity to the horseshoe vortices increasing their intensity in the following sections more details will be provided on the several vortices generated from the appendages of the submarine enabling a comparison across configurations fig 10 shows the four planes that will be taken into account to carry out this analysis they are orthogonal to the axis of the submarine and located across the sail plane p 1 downstream of the sail plane p 2 across the fins plane p 3 and at propeller plane plane p 4 their streamwise positions are equivalent to about 36 46 90 and 98 of the length of the submarine from its nose respectively the several coherent structures will be indicated in the visualizations below as sptv sailplane tip vortices spjv sailplane junction vortices stv sail tip vortices sjv sail junction vortices ftv fin tip vortices and fjv fin junction vortices 6 2 comparison across configurations 6 2 1 vortices across the sail in fig 11 a qualitative comparison is reported where the q criterion was utilized for pointing to the areas over the plane p 1 populated by the main vortices in the straight ahead condition fig 11a the signature of the horseshoe vortices from the sail and the sailplane tip vortices is well distinguishable the former generate smaller secondary vortices the presence of the sailplanes horseshoe vortices is not so evident since they are located within the boundary layer developing over the sail in drift fig 11b the topology is significantly modified the signature of the coherent structures becomes wider which is both a consequence of their larger size and orientation relative to the plane since their axis is not anymore orthogonal to the latter the asymmetry between the port and starboard sides of the panel in fig 11b is especially apparent for the sailplanes vortices the sailplanes tip vortices moved downwards and upwards on the starboard and port sides of the submarine respectively when compared against the contours in the panel of fig 11a in addition the lower leg of the starboard sailplane junction vortex moving away from the surface of the sail becomes significantly larger than in the straight ahead condition also in fig 11c where the configuration with negative pitch is considered the signatures of the tip sailplane vortices and the lower legs of the junction sailplane vortices are wider than in fig 11a showing a downward displacement while the junction vortices originating from the root of the sail are smaller than in the straight ahead condition it is not surprising to observe the opposite behaviors in fig 11d compared to fig 11c referring to the configuration with opposite positive pitch a more quantitative comparison across cases is reported in table 8 where both the cross section area and the circulation of the vortices in the plane p 1 are provided note that all vortices were identified assuming a threshold for q l 2 u 2 20 with the purpose of defining their cross section this criterion allowed us to compute their size and their circulation as flux of streamwise vorticity table 8 shows that in the plane p 1 the largest vortices with the highest values of circulation occur in the configuration with positive pitch as expected the smallest and weakest sptv vortices are generated in the straight ahead configuration however it is less obvious to see that the weakest sjv vortices are those produced by the submarine in negative pitch which is maybe a consequence of their shear with the boundary layer on the hull for the submarine in drift symmetry does not apply and the structures shed on the port side are stronger featuring larger values of circulation compared to those on the starboard side although their size is similar see sptv or even smaller see sjv 6 2 2 vortices downstream of the sail fig 12 shows the signature of the vortices generated by the sail in the plane p 2 compared to fig 11 the additional presence of the structures generated from the tip of the sail can be noticed in fig 12a one can see that the intensity of the tip sailplane vortices is declining very quickly downstream and they are actually weaker than the junction vortices generated by both sailplanes contours in fig 12b are much more complex the horizontal shift of all vortices relative to the plane of symmetry of the submarine body is evident especially for the tip vortices originating from the sailplanes however this behavior affects also the sail tip vortices and the sailplanes junction vortices with the branches coming from the starboard side having a significantly larger size than those coming from the port side actually this result was already visible over the plane p 1 across the sail in the configuration with negative pitch represented in the panel fig 12c the topology is actually less complex than in fig 12b with contours populated by the footprint of the tip vortices from the sail and the sailplanes and the lower branches of the horseshoe vortices from the sailplanes the junction vortices from the sail are instead practically missing which is likely the consequence of their interaction with the hull of the submarine note that in this configuration they are oriented towards its surface which promotes their faster dissipation in comparison with the straight ahead condition due to the opposite direction of the hull generated vorticity in panel fig 12d the deformation of the upper legs of the junction vortices coming from the sailplanes highlights their interaction with the structures coming from the tip of the sail in addition in agreement with the discussion above for fig 12c the horseshoe vortices produced at the root of the sail are the largest across all configurations since in this case they are directed away from the surface of the submarine therefore they experience a weaker interaction with the boundary layer and a slower dissipation compared to all other cases furthermore the intensity of the junction vortices from the sail is enhanced by the vorticity coming from the boundary layer over the hull due to cross flow this is shown in fig 13 where contours of streamwise vorticity are visualized over the plane p 2 dealing with a detail in the vicinity of the surface of the hull downstream of the sail on the left and right sides of fig 13 the cases with negative and positive pitch are considered for comparison also the streamlines of the in plane secondary flows are shown in the right panel the signature of the starboard leg of the strong junction vortex from the sail is evident the boundary layer over the hull supplies additional vorticity to the junction vortex as also demonstrated by the streamlines of the secondary flows table 9 points that the strongest stv vortex is by far that generated on the starboard side of the submarine in drift the same occurs also for the spjv vortex originating from the bottom side of the root of the starboard sailplane in agreement with the upstream position considered above the most significant sjv vortices are produced in positive pitch while in negative pitch the junction vortices from the sail are below the threshold value of q l 2 u 2 20 chosen to detect the coherent structures both pitch conditions generate the largest and strongest sptv vortices also in agreement with the comparisons observed on the upstream plane p 1 the sjv and sptv vortices shed on the port side of the submarine in drift have larger values of circulation than those on the starboard side 6 2 3 vortices across the fins fig 14 deals with the plane p 3 it is clear that vortices are weak in the straight ahead configuration both compared against those seen upstream and those at the same streamwise location in the other panels of fig 14 in drift fig 14b the largest structure is by far that coming from the tip of the sail although it is located away from the stern not influencing the working conditions of the fins and their loading conditions a similar discussion applies to the vortex from the tip of the starboard sailplane that coming from the tip of the port sailplane is instead not visible in the panel of fig 14b due to its upward shift in fig 14b also the footprint of the lower stern appendages is not negligible via their junction vortices especially from the bottom fin on the starboard side in the configuration with negative pitch fig 14c the signature of the sailplanes tip vortices is visible in the vicinity of the outer surfaces of the upper fins those vortices were actually deflected away from the symmetry plane of the submarine by their interaction with the stern appendages it should be noted that this interaction is detrimental to the efficiency of the appendages with a negative impact on the maneuverability of the submarine in pure pitch the tip of the sail generates weaker structures compared to the submarine in drift and they are almost not distinguishable in fig 14c actually there the most evident vortices are the junction ones originating from the root of the lower fins with the outer legs keeping in the vicinity of the surface of the stern and the inner legs moving away from it shifting downwards fig 14d is practically unaffected by the vortices produced by the sail note that the sailplanes tip vortices are located outside of the view in fig 14d above its upper border in this case the most significant vortices are by far the horseshoe vortices from the root of the upper fins in particular the inner ones due to the positive pitch of the submarine move upwards away from the surface of the stern in contrast with the outer ones which keep closer to the hull since their upward shift is bounded by the stern appendages this behavior is actually similar to that of the junction vortices from the lower fins seen in the configuration at negative pitch in fig 14c table 10 provides additional evidence that the largest strongest vortex is generated from the tip of the sail of the submarine in drift in the case with the submarine at negative pitch the sptv vortices keep rather intense even downstream of the interaction with the upper fins although at positive pitch they are larger and stronger however note that in fig 14d the sptv vortices are not visible since they moved upwards far away from the stern region with the exception of the straight ahead condition the fjv vortices are quite strong for all configurations in particular they have cross sections and circulations larger than those seen over the plane p 1 for the junction vortices originating from the root of the sail 6 2 4 vortices over the propeller plane in this section the footprint of the vortices over the propeller plane the plane where the propeller would be installed is considered it is almost insignificant in the straight ahead case as demonstrated by the contours in fig 15a in contrast a quite complex topology is visible in fig 15b the vortices originating from the tip of the fins are significant although always located away from the propeller region for which we can assume a radius equal to a half of the radial coordinate of the tip of the stern appendages it is interesting to notice that the tip vortex in the upper region of the starboard side is the weakest one across those produced by the four fins maybe because the presence of the tip vortex coming from the sail is able to affect the pressure gradient at the top right tip at inner radii a complex system of vortices comes from the root of the fins and is obviously able to affect the performance and the forces acting on a propeller installed at the tail of the submarine it is clear that the drift condition is able to cause a significant cross stream shift of such horseshoe vortices in fig 15b we can still see the signature of the vortices coming from the tips of the sail and starboard sailplane in negative pitch the topology is substantially different as shown in fig 15c the tip vortices are more similar between each other than in fig 15b all of them experience a downward displacement relative to the tip of the stern appendages the horseshoe vortices from the upper fins are weak whereas the stronger ones from the lower fins undergo a very different streamwise evolution of their legs the inner legs moved away from the surface of the stern while the outer legs kept closer to it in agreement with their behavior across the fins the latter are going to be ingested by the propeller at the tail of the submarine in the same fig 15c the signature of the sailplanes tip vortices is still visible confirming that they are very strong and able to affect the flow up to the rear of the submarine the contours in fig 15d are similar to those in fig 15c but with some differences i the tip vortices from the fins are shifted upward ii the junction vortices from the fins are stronger than in fig 15c iii the sailplanes tip vortices are missing since they are displaced upward far away from the surface of the stern table 11 points again to the significant signature even at the tail of the submarine by the vortex shed from the tip of the sail in the drift condition the circulation of the ftv vortices is also large at all conditions with the exception of the case with the submarine in straight ahead in drift those generated by the bottom fins are actually significantly more intense than those from the tip of the top fins while in both pitch conditions both areas and circulations of the ftv vortices are more uniform across all four stern appendages the properties of the fjv vortices over the propeller plane p 4 are especially interesting since they are obviously going to affect the inflow ingested by the propeller although it is worth noting that the suction generated by the latter not included in the present simulations would influence in turn the properties of the fjv vortices the present results indicate that they are stronger in drift than in both pitch configurations of the submarine 7 conclusions results of rans computations were presented on the towed bb2 submarine model joubert 2004 2006 at four operative conditions corresponding to straight ahead drift and both positive and negative pitch detailed comparisons with experiments in the literature toxopeus et al 2019 lee et al 2019 demonstrated the accuracy of the simulations the agreement was found very good not only in terms of loads over the submarine but also for the location and circulation of the vortices shed from the sail this work presented a comparison of the coherent structures generated by the submarine across the four simulated maneuvering conditions they affect the signature of the submarine which is obviously critical for strategic purposes in military scenarios they also affect the working conditions in terms of both performance and mechanical stress of both the stern appendages and the propeller installed at the tail of the ship although the latter was not included in the present work due to computational cost constraints computations demonstrated that the negative pitch maneuver is the one with the most significant impact of the vortices from the sail on the rear of the submarine involving both the stern appendages and the propeller plane this influence came especially from the tip of the sailplanes while both the tip and junction vortices from the main body of the sail were found weaker than in positive pitch and in drift in the latter cases the vortices from the sail moved away from the submarine therefore they were not able to affect substantially the flow conditions at its stern but they were still important in defining its wake signature in steady drift the vortex from the tip of the sail was found especially large and intense whereas in positive pitch the flow from the sail was mainly dominated by the vortices from the tip of the sailplanes and the junction vortices from the root of the sail as a consequence of the orientation of the submarine body relative to the free stream the pattern of both junction and tip vortices from the stern appendages was found to be strongly dependent on the manevering condition of the submarine in both pitch conditions the intensity of all tip vortices from the four stern appendages was rather uniform in contrast in drift those produced from the stern appendages on the bottom side of the submarine were observed to have values of circulations significantly higher than those from the rudders on the upper side in particular the one closest to the wake of the sail was much smaller and weaker with values of circulation an order of magnitude lower than all other tip vortices from the fins the strongest junction vortices were instead produced by the stern appendages in drift conditions they are especially important since they significantly affect the flow conditions at the propeller disk as expected the configuration in straight ahead condition that was assumed as a reference was that with the simplest system of vortices with by far the lowest values of circulation credit authorship contribution statement riccardo broglia conceptualization methodology software

21364,results of reynolds averaged navier stokes simulations are reported on a towed fully appended notional submarine model computations are validated against data in the literature dealing with both global loads and the vortices originating from the sail the analysis of the flow is focused on the coherent structures shed from the tip and the root of the appendages defining the wake signature of the submarine and affecting the flow field over the propeller plane their positions and intensities are compared across four operative conditions straight ahead drift and both positive and negative pitch computations demonstrate that the condition with negative pitch is the one producing the most complex topology of the flow in the stern region where the vortices from the tip of the sailplanes are able to influence both the fins and the flow at the propeller plane however the widest and most intense vortex is generated in drift from the tip of the sail because of the strong gradient of pressure produced between the two sides of the fore appendages the pattern of the coherent structures produced by the stern appendages is substantially dependent on the maneuvering conditions in both pitch conditions their tip vortices have values of circulation very similar across the four fins this is not the case in drift the one most affected by the wake of the sail is the smallest and weakest the most intense junction vortices from the stern appendages which are able to influence more directly the inflow of the propeller occur instead in drift keywords naval hydrodynamics submarines cfd coherent structures rans equations manouevering 1 introduction submarines in maneuvering conditions shed a wealth of vortical structures from the main body and the appendages such as the casing fins rudders and diving planes typical of this class of vessels renilson 2018 the interaction of these coherent structures with the control surfaces and the propeller at the tail of a submarine is detrimental to its manouevering capabilities and is a source of vibrations and emission of noise having a negative impact on its stealth capabilities in addition mechanical stress and fatigue are produced also due to cavitation phenomena occurring within the core of the vortices in this field a limited number of experimental works is available in the literature some studies were focused on the darpa suboff dsub which is a notional nuclear submarine geometry groves et al 1989 featuring a large length over diameter ratio huang et al 1992 performed experiments with and without appendages dealing with pressure and skin friction coefficients and profiles of first and second order statistics across the hull jiménez et al 2010a b focused their studies on the evolution of the wake of the submarine and the effects on the intermediate wake by its appendages another reference geometry was developed by the defence science and technology organization dsto as reported by joubert 2004 2006 after some modifications aimed at increasing its stability and control it is currently known as the bb2 submarine model it is representative of a diesel submarine with a large casing two fore fins placed on the side of the sail and an x form rudder arrangement overpelt et al 2015 several measurements were conducted at dsto on this model wind tunnel data include particle imaging velocimetry piv and load measurements surface pattern flow visualizations and velocity profiles in straight ahead and in static drift advancement at several reynolds numbers anderson et al 2012 quick et al 2012 quick and woodyatt 2014 fureby et al 2016 and lee et al 2019 free running maneuvering tests were also conducted by overpelt et al 2015 and carrica et al 2016 experimental tests are able to provide in depth information on the flow physics and are still vital for the validation of any cfd simulation but they have also some limitations for instance for captive model tests wind tunnel and towing tank measurements one of the major drawbacks is the need of supports influencing the flow fields moreover as much as for cfd computations also for flow measurements the spatial resolution of instrumentation limits the flow structures that can be captured in addition the access to some regions around the model is often not possible especially for example in presence of a propeller cfd has been proven to be a valid tool for flow field analysis and hydrodynamic performance predictions in naval hydrodynamics avoiding some of the drawbacks of the physical experiments for example the flow field is not influenced by any physical support and additional details of the flow can be revealed nevertheless numerical simulations still have significant limitations and issues originating mainly from their computational cost and the accuracy of turbulence closure models especially when dealing with large separated flows visonneau et al 2018 broglia et al 2019 numerical approaches with different levels of approximation have been utilized for the analysis of the hydrodynamics and maneuvering of submarines high fidelity large eddy simulations les of the flow around a submarine were performed by some authors this class of simulations uses huge computational grids as a very fine spatial resolution is one of the keys to the success of these techniques one of the first computations of this type was reported by posa and balaras 2016 where the towed appended dsub in straight ahead was simulated at a reynolds number based on the length of the submarine and the free stream velocity equal to r e 1 2 10 6 an immersed boundary method was adopted within a cylindrical grid composed of 2 8 billion points a comprehensive analysis of the flow was carried out including cfd validation against efd data from jiménez et al 2010b in a following study posa and balaras 2018 analyzed the flow field and the turbulent wake for the same submarine model in both towed and self propelled conditions in posa and balaras 2020 les computations on the towed appended dsub at r e 1 2 10 7 were reported discussing the reynolds number effect on the boundary layer and the wake of the submarine wang et al 2016 adopted an immersed boundary method based on a moving least squares reconstruction to perform les simulations around the fully appended dsub at a lower reynolds number r e 1 0 10 5 the bare hull was considered by shi et al 2019 where the immersed boundary method was utilized coupled with a new wall model reconstruction to reduce the computational effort at a reynolds number r e 1 2 10 6 the bare hull dsub was also studied by kumar and mahesh 2018 at a reynolds number r e 1 1 10 6 using a body fitted unstructured grid consisting of almost 610 millions volumes however in the above studies the dsub was simulated in the straight ahead configuration producing weak coherent structures this was motivated by the need of limiting the computational burden to make les more affordable especially at high reynolds numbers and in maneuvering conditions wall modeled les wmles or hybrid rans les methodologies such as detached eddy simulation des were also exploited for instance alin et al 2010 bhushan et al 2013 chase and carrica 2013 and chase et al 2013 compared les des and rans predictions for the dsub geometry in particular chase et al 2013 and chase and carrica 2013 investigated the dsub in self propulsion in captive steady turn and horizontal overshoot maneuvers the accuracy of wmles compared against les and rans based simulations was investigated for a series of naval hydrodynamics flows including also the dsto submarine by liefvendahl and fureby 2017 fureby and may 2017 and liefvendahl and johansson 2018 numerical simulations of the dsto submarine using wmles were also performed by anderson et al 2012 fureby et al 2016 norrison et al 2016 and petterson et al 2018 these works analyzed the dsto model in straight ahead and steady drift advancement as well as in self propulsion an in depth analysis was conducted on the flow field pointing to the importance of the coherent structures shed from the submarine appendages which are able to affect both the maneuvering performance of the fins as well as the propeller skin friction and velocity profiles were in fairly good agreement with measurements in addition fureby et al 2016 compared the coherent structures from wmles computations against piv experiments finding a good qualitative agreement although details on the intensity of the vortices were not reported unsteady rans computations were demonstrated to be a valid affordable alternative much less expensive than wmles or des especially for handling high reynolds numbers unsteady maneuvering conditions and for the analysis of a large number of different operative conditions one of the first papers dealing with a notional submarine geometry the onr body 1 in manoeuvring conditions was reported by pankajakshan et al 2002 a rans based approach was exploited to simulate the self propelled performance of the underwater vehicle undergoing a controlled overshoot maneuver self propelled horizontal and vertical maneuvers of the dsub submarine were investigated by martin et al 2015 bettle et al 2009 studied the buoyantly rising maneuver of the drdc str submarine model whereas webster et al 2018 applied both a fully cfd based solver and a steady state approach coupling a rans solver with the force equilibrium equations to calculate the velocity and pitch angle of an underwater vehicle in an unpowered negatively buoyant dive carrica et al 2016 2018 analyzed different free running maneuvers of the bb2 submarine model in both calm water and in waves also kim et al 2018 presented a study dealing with a steady turning self propelled maneuver of the bb2 geometry dubbioso et al 2017 analyzed the maneuvering characteristics of a notional submarine vehicle the cnr insean 2475 with two different configurations of the stern appendages recently the avt 301 nato working group flowfield prediction for manoeuvring underwater vehicles has carried out a study on the capabilities of different cfd solvers in dealing with large separated flows taking as benchmark the bb2 submarine advancing in both straight ahead and steady drift conditions toxopeus et al 2019 all above works were mainly focused on the analysis of the maneuvering performance including comparison with efd data in terms of global forces trajectory and or dynamic kinematic parameters for a maneuvering submarine strong vortices are generated from the root of the sail the well known horse shoe vortices the tip of the sail the forward hydroplanes generally placed on the side of the sail and from the aft rudders and diving planes renilson 2018 however it should be noted that none of the above works was focused on a detailed analysis of the intensity of those coherent structures with the exception of the experiments recently reported by lee et al 2019 and the comparison across maneuvering conditions in terms of ability of those structures to affect the signature of the submarine and the flow conditions within the propeller region the present paper is aimed at analyzing those vortices comparing their position evolution and intensity across four different operative conditions straight ahead static drift and positive negative pitch their influence on the flow conditions at the stern appendages and over the propeller plane is also discussed such analysis is conducted using an in house unsteady rans solver results were extensively verified and validated against available numerical and experimental data in the following sections after a short survey of the adopted mathematical model section 2 and numerical methodology section 3 the computational setup including the geometry of the submarine and its operative conditions is presented section 4 in section 5 a complete assessment of verification and validation is reported then the results section section 6 starts with an overview of the flow field around the submarine and is followed by a detalied discussion of the coherent structures shed by the submarine across the four operative conditions finally section 7 provides a summary of our findings 2 mathematical model simulations reported in the present work were conducted by means of the χnavis code resolving the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations and developed in house at cnr inm the solver is based on a finite volume discretization in generalized curvilinear coordinates it is globally second order accurate in both space and time details are reported for example by di mascio et al 2001 2006 2009 broglia et al 2014 and broglia and durante 2018 only the main features are discussed here 2 1 governing equations in the framework of a finite volume methodology the conservation of mass and momentum for incompressible flows are enforced in their integral form by denoting with v a control volume and with a v the boundary of its surface the navier stokes equations can be expressed as 1 λ t v q d v a v f c q f d q d s v f ch d v 0 in equation 1 t is time λ diag 0 1 1 1 is a diagonal matrix and q p u 1 u 2 u 3 t is the vector of the state variables for incompressible flows which are pressure and the velocity components across the three coordinate directions f c and f d are the convective and viscous fluxes given by 2 f c u i n i u j u i n i p n j t f d 0 τ j i n i t where i j 1 2 3 and n i is the i th component of the outward unit vector normal to the surface a v in equation 1 f ch is a forcing term utilized in the framework of the overlapping grids technique adopted here see di mascio et al 2006 and zaghi et al 2015 for more details equation 1 was scaled by using the submarine overall length l o a and its advance velocity u in urans methodologies turbulence is modeled the components of the stress tensor τ i j are computed as 3 τ i j 1 r e ν t u i x j u j x i in equation 3 r e is the reynolds number coming from scaling the urans equations and defined as r e u l o a ν with ν the kinematic viscosity of the fluid x i stands for the three coordinates in space while ν t is the turbulent viscosity which was modeled via the spalart and allmaras 1994 model 3 methodology the computational domain is discretized using adjacent or overlapped structured blocks composed of hexahedral volumes conservation laws are enforced in each control volume in an integral form 4 λ t v i j k q d v f 1 6 a i j k f f f c q f f d q d s v i j k f ch d v 0 where a i j k f indicates the f th face of the finite volume v i j k by defining with q i j k the volume average of the fluid variables within each control volume 5 q i j k 1 v i j k v i j k q d v a volume average of equation 4 can be written as 6 λ q t i j k 1 v i j k r i j k v i j k f c h d v 0 where r i j k is the flux balance relative to the control volume v i j k the surface integrals are evaluated by means of a second order formula for the viscous fluxes the velocity gradients are computed using a standard second order centered finite volume approximation for the convective part the fluxes come from the solution of a riemann problem f f c q f c q f f c q l q r whose left q l and right q r states are estimated by means of a third order upwind based scheme van leer 1979 a second order accurate solution of the riemann problem is achieved instead of the exact one which should be computed iteratively increasing the computational burden see di mascio et al 2001 and posa and broglia 2019 for more details the resulting scheme was demonstrated second order accurate producing oscillations free solutions also in presence of discontinuities di mascio et al 2009 time integration of equation 6 is achieved by a second order three points implicit backward finite difference scheme the resulting system of coupled non linear algebraic equations is tackled via a pseudo time technique chorin 1967 using an implicit euler scheme with an approximate factorization beam and warming 1978 a local dual time step and a multi grid technique favini et al 1996 are exploited for faster convergence in the pseudo time more details on the overall solver can be found in di mascio et al 2006 2007 2009 broglia and durante 2018 and broglia et al 2014 4 computational setup numerical simulations were carried out around the notional bb2 submarine see fig 1 the bb2 model is a modification of the bb1 submarine based on a concept design by joubert 2004 2006 featuring larger aft control surfaces and a thicker sail located more forward the length over the maximum diameter of the bare hull is l o a 2 r m 7 3 the main geometrical details are given in table 1 and visualized in fig 2 simulations were performed at model scale with a scale factor of λ 18 348 the configuration considered is fully appended including fore planes on the sail and aft rudders without propeller the rudders consist of fixed and moving parts separated by a small gap of about 1 mm at model scale more information on the bb2 model can be found in overpelt et al 2015 and bettle 2014 all numerical simulations were carried out in deep fresh water conditions i e density ρ 1 000 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity ν 1 2 10 6 m2 s with no free surface effects at a constant advance speed equal to u 3 m s at model scale therefore the reynolds number considered in the computations is r e u l o a ν 9 565 10 6 computations were conducted for the straight ahead condition in level flight zero drift and pitch angles one steady drift angle and two pitch angles the operative conditions are summarized in table 2 non zero drift and pitch angles were achieved deflecting the incoming flow the drift is positive if the flow comes from port side whereas the pitch is positive when the flow comes from below the adopted frame of reference is shown in fig 1 with the x axis aligned with the axis of the submarine positive upstream the z axis oriented vertically positive downward and the y axis completing a right handed system 4 1 fluid domain and computational grid a rectangular box was selected as fluid domain around the bb2 model with upstream boundary at x 1 5 l o a downstream boundary at x 1 5 l o a lateral sides and top bottom boundaries at y z 1 l o a a structured grid composed of overlapping blocks was generated using the commercial software pointwise for the starboard half of the fluid domain this half grid was utilized for the simulation of the configurations in straight ahead and in pitch taking advantage of the symmetry of the flow relative to the y 0 plane instead for the non zero drift angle case producing asymmetric flow conditions between the sides of positive and negative y coordinates the half grid was mirrored relative to the y 0 plane to create the overall grid the number of cells of all block edges was set to be multiple of four allowing computations on three grid levels with consecutive grid refinement ratios equal to two fig 3 shows the block structure of the computational grid and fig 4 the mesh and block edges over the plane of symmetry a high quality structured grid was generated around the bb2 submarine out to a distance of at least 0 9 b away from its surface the structured region was expanded across the downstream direction out to a cylinder of diameter 11 68 b extending downstream up to the outlet section an inflation layer i e a series of block structured grids with thin elements clustered in the vicinity of the solid walls having a thickness of approximately 0 21 b was built around the bb2 surface the height of the first cells off the surface of the submarine was designed to achieve an average y value below 1 the average wall normal mesh expansion rate from the surface of the submarine is equal to 1 12 the near body grid corresponds to region 1 of the grid grd22 s4a l4 described in more detail in bettle 2020 in fig 5 the details of the computational grid at the root of the sailfin and at the junction between the sail and the main body provide a picture of the mesh refinement in the boundary layer region a block structured background mesh was adopted to resolve the region between the body fitted grid surrounding the submarine and the far field boundaries in total the full grid after mirroring was composed of 424 blocks 392 surrounding the submarine and 32 discretizing the background and about 27 4 million finite volumes 26 4 million of them were utilized for the solution of the flow within the region of the body fitted grid around the submarine table 3 provides a summary for the mesh parameters and metrics whereas in table 4 the dimensions of the first grid cells away from the surface of the body are provided in wall units no slip boundary conditions for velocity were enforced on the surface of the body while for pressure a condition of zero gradient along the normal direction was utilized dirichlet boundary conditions were adopted for velocity and pressure at the inlet and outlet of the computational domain respectively neumann conditions were enforced for pressure at the inlet and for the velocity vector at the outlet the lateral top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain were treated as far field boundaries i e a neumann condition was enforced for all variables the numerical solutions were computed by means of a full multi grid full approximation scheme fmg fas see favini et al 1996 with three grid levels generated by removing from the next finer one every other grid points the whole set of grid levels for which the refinement ratio is two was utilized for verification and validation purposes in the fmg fas approximation procedure the solution is computed on the coarsest grid level first then it is prolongated on the next finer grid and the solution is iterated by exploiting all coarser grid levels using a v cycle the process is iterated up to the finest grid level at each level the iterative solution is carried out until the l 2 norm of the residuals drops by four orders of magnitude up to a maximum number of 2000 multigrid cycles for the present computations a careful check on the variation of the forces over multigrid cycles was performed the root mean square variation of the forces and moments across the last 100 iterations was always less than 1 an example of iterative convergence is shown in fig 6 where the history of the residuals and non dimensional forces and moments versus multigrid cycles is reported for the straight ahead case the computational problem was tackled here via parallel high performance computing distributing the structured blocks across several cores communication between them for the coarse grain distributed memory parallelization was achieved via calls to standard message passing interface mpi libraries while fine grain shared memory parallelization was based on open message passing openmp libraries broglia et al 2014 in the framework of the present study the computation of the steady drift case utilized 136 cores with a computational cost of less than 24 wall clock hours and about half the time for the other cases each 5 verification and validation verification and validation were carried out on the hydrodynamic loads on the submarine the former deals with order of convergence and numerical uncertainty the latter with the modeling error against reference data values reported below refer to non dimensional forces and moments defined as 7 x y z x y z ρ u 2 l o a 2 k m n k m n ρ u 2 l o a 3 where denotes dimensional forces or moments across the directions defined by the frame of reference shown in fig 1 note that in the following ρ u and l o a will be utilized to scale all quantities results for verification assessment are summarized in table 5 the analysis was carried out for all simulated conditions in the table data from the coarse medium and fine meshes are denoted with s 3 s 2 and s 1 respectively the order of accuracy p was estimated as 8 p l n ε 32 ε 21 l n r where ε i j s i s j and r is the grid refinement ratio r 2 in the current analysis from the solutions on the medium and fine meshes and from the observed order of accuracy both the richardson s extrapolated error δ r e 9 δ r e ε 21 r p 1 and the generalized richardson s extrapolated solution s r e 10 s r e s 1 δ r e were computed when monotonic convergence is attained i e the difference between the results on two consecutive grid levels is decreasing 0 ε 21 ε 32 1 the grid uncertainty can be estimated several methods see for example roache 1997 eça and hoekstra 2006 stern et al 2001 wilson et al 2001 can be used in the present work the factor of safety method proposed by xing and stern 2010 was adopted in this method the distance from the asymptotic range is estimated via the ratio between the computed order of accuracy and the theoretical one i e p p p t h in this case p t h 2 when the solutions are in the asymptotic range the actual order of convergence is roughly equal to the theoretical value p 1 this method provides an overall 95 confidence level for the estimated uncertainty to bound the true error according to the factor of safety method the uncertainty can be computed as 11 u f s 2 45 0 85 p δ r e i f 0 p 1 16 4 p 14 8 δ r e i f p 1 in table 5 the estimated numerical uncertainties are reported since negligible iterative uncertainty was observed grid uncertainty can be considered as the only significant contribution to the numerical uncertainty in general the results in table 5 show monotonic convergence with the actual order of convergence usually close to the theoretical value a few exceptions can be seen as the monotonic divergence m d observed for the lateral force y and the roll moment k in the steady drift condition however in these cases an almost negligible variation of the estimated load with the grid level less than 2 occurs meaning that the value provided by the coarsest grid level is practically at convergence for these loads the contribution from the pressure component is dominant against the viscous one and can be estimated accurately even on rather coarse grids similar results are seen for the yaw moment n in the steady drift condition good results are also observed for the numerical uncertainty usually within 5 with a maximum of about 8 for the resistance x in steady drift as shown later in this case a wealth of coherent structures are shed from the appendages and due to boundary layer separation on the main body in comparison with the other operative conditions larger differences in the prediction of these structures and boundary layer separation across different grid resolutions are likely the source of the higher levels of grid uncertainty on the numerical assessment of resistance x the validation assessment was performed via comparison of the present results with data available in literature in particular against the numerical dataset produced in the framework of the nato avt 301 working group toxopeus et al 2019 several groups provided results for the bb2 submarine in straight ahead 44 submissions and steady drift 42 submissions conditions by using different numerical techniques turbulence models and computational grids reference results for the configurations in pitch are not available in table 6 averages d and standard deviations σ d across all available data are reported with the latter taken as the uncertainty of the former 12 d 1 n s i 1 n s d i σ d 100 d 1 n s i 1 n s d d i 2 where n s is the number of available reference data d i is the ith sample d being any of the computed hydrodynamic loads the error between the present results and the reference data ε d as percentage of d was computed as 13 ε d s r e d d and is reported in the last column of table 6 it is worth noting that for those loads not achieving monotonic convergence which are y and k in steady drift the result on the finest grid level was utilized since the extrapolated value s r e is unavailable the comparison in table 6 against the reference data shows a rather good agreement demonstrating the accuracy of the present results the error is usually within 4 with a maximum of about 12 for the prediction of the resistance x in the steady drift condition however for the latter a rather large standard deviation across the reference data was observed resulting from the presence of several outliers the accuracy of the computational results is reinforced via a detailed comparison with the experiments recently published by lee et al 2019 on the coherent structures shed by the same submarine model lee et al 2019 carried out wind tunnel measurements at length based reynolds numbers of 4 and 8 millions i e only slightly lower than the one simulated in the present study they considered the same drift angle of the submarine as in this work with an incidence of 10 relative to the free stream it should be also noted that the measurements reported by lee et al 2019 demonstrated negligible differences between r e 4 10 6 and r e 8 10 6 therefore we can assume them as a reference for the results from the present computations they consist of stereo particle image velocimetry spiv experiments on three cross stream planes normal to the free stream velocity the three planes are placed just after the sail in front of the rear appendages and midway located at 0 511 l o a 0 815 l o a and 0 650 l o a respectively from the nose of the submarine in table 7 the positions of the vortices originating from the tip of the sail and the tip of both windward a leeward sailplanes are compared against the measurements on each plane the onset and progression of these vortices will be illustrated in the following sections in agreement with the criterion adopted by lee et al 2019 all positions are reported on a frame of reference o x y z with the origin at the nose of the submarine the x axis aligned with the free stream velocity oriented downstream the z axis vertical positive upward and the y axis completing a right handed system of coordinates the comparison between the present simulations and the reference measurements is excellent across all planes and coherent structures the agreement keeps very close even at the most downstream plane although those structures already experienced a strong interaction between each other comparisons with the experiments is also provided for the circulation on the first plane the non dimensional circulation was defined as in lee et al 2019 for a direct comparison 14 κ γ r m u s i n β with γ a ω x d a where γ is the dimensional value of circulation and ω x is the vorticity component along the x axis normal to the measurement planes the area a was defined following lee et al 2019 they estimated the core radius r c as the distance from the center of the vortex to the location of maximum tangential velocity then they assumed the radius of the integration area equal to 1 25 r c comparisons are reported in table 7 they are fairly good with the circulation slightly overestimated by the numerical computations this result comes from a wider size of the vortices which is due to enhanced diffusion from rans turbulence modeling however it should be noted that this behavior is expected from rans computations as recently demonstrated by toxopeus et al 2019 6 results 6 1 overview of the flow in this section a general overview of the flow is provided in fig 7 where the q criterion is adopted for visualization of the main vortices colors show contours of non dimensional streamwise vorticity as expected due to the smaller pressure gradients generated at the end of the several appendages the straight ahead condition is the one producing the weaker coherent structures as shown in the top and bottom panels a of fig 7 in all other configurations several large vortices from both sail and fins are much more evident as shown in fig 8 a dealing with a detail of the negative pitch case fig 7c the sail produces a complex system of vortices originating from its tip and its root horseshoe vortices but also from the appendages of the sail sailplanes tip and horseshoe vortices similar tip and junction vortices are produced from the tip and the root of each fin at the rear of the submarine body see fig 8b more quantitative details aimed at comparing the several structures especially in drift and pitch will be provided later however fig 7 allows us to formulate some general considerations the third configuration represented in the top and bottom panels c of fig 7 corresponding to negative pitch is the one producing the most complex interactions involving the coherent structures in that case the sailplane tip vortices collide with the upper fins at the tail of the submarine this as shown in fig 9 affects the evolution of these vortices changing also their trajectories as in the case of the tip vortices shed by a propeller operating upstream of a hydrofoil see the recent works by hu et al 2020 and posa et al 2020a 2020b in addition as discussed more in detail below in this configuration the propeller region is populated by several vortices since those originating from the sail are directed towards the location of the propeller although here the latter was not included being outside the scope of this work and because of computational cost constraints in contrast when the submarine is in drift or in positive pitch the structures originating from the sail keep away from the stern of the submarine producing a lower density of coherent structures and weaker interaction in the propeller region the comparison across the panels of fig 7 also demonstrates that the largest horseshoe vortices from the sail occur in the condition of positive pitch of the submarine shown by the panels d of fig 7 this result could be the consequence of those vortices moving away from the surface of the submarine due to the orientation of the latter relative to the free stream in the other cases the viscous drag between the junction vortices and the boundary layer over the hull promotes instead a faster dissipation of the former downstream of the sail in addition the following analysis will demonstrate that the conditions of cross flow over the hull of the submarine allow its boundary layer to provide additional vorticity to the horseshoe vortices increasing their intensity in the following sections more details will be provided on the several vortices generated from the appendages of the submarine enabling a comparison across configurations fig 10 shows the four planes that will be taken into account to carry out this analysis they are orthogonal to the axis of the submarine and located across the sail plane p 1 downstream of the sail plane p 2 across the fins plane p 3 and at propeller plane plane p 4 their streamwise positions are equivalent to about 36 46 90 and 98 of the length of the submarine from its nose respectively the several coherent structures will be indicated in the visualizations below as sptv sailplane tip vortices spjv sailplane junction vortices stv sail tip vortices sjv sail junction vortices ftv fin tip vortices and fjv fin junction vortices 6 2 comparison across configurations 6 2 1 vortices across the sail in fig 11 a qualitative comparison is reported where the q criterion was utilized for pointing to the areas over the plane p 1 populated by the main vortices in the straight ahead condition fig 11a the signature of the horseshoe vortices from the sail and the sailplane tip vortices is well distinguishable the former generate smaller secondary vortices the presence of the sailplanes horseshoe vortices is not so evident since they are located within the boundary layer developing over the sail in drift fig 11b the topology is significantly modified the signature of the coherent structures becomes wider which is both a consequence of their larger size and orientation relative to the plane since their axis is not anymore orthogonal to the latter the asymmetry between the port and starboard sides of the panel in fig 11b is especially apparent for the sailplanes vortices the sailplanes tip vortices moved downwards and upwards on the starboard and port sides of the submarine respectively when compared against the contours in the panel of fig 11a in addition the lower leg of the starboard sailplane junction vortex moving away from the surface of the sail becomes significantly larger than in the straight ahead condition also in fig 11c where the configuration with negative pitch is considered the signatures of the tip sailplane vortices and the lower legs of the junction sailplane vortices are wider than in fig 11a showing a downward displacement while the junction vortices originating from the root of the sail are smaller than in the straight ahead condition it is not surprising to observe the opposite behaviors in fig 11d compared to fig 11c referring to the configuration with opposite positive pitch a more quantitative comparison across cases is reported in table 8 where both the cross section area and the circulation of the vortices in the plane p 1 are provided note that all vortices were identified assuming a threshold for q l 2 u 2 20 with the purpose of defining their cross section this criterion allowed us to compute their size and their circulation as flux of streamwise vorticity table 8 shows that in the plane p 1 the largest vortices with the highest values of circulation occur in the configuration with positive pitch as expected the smallest and weakest sptv vortices are generated in the straight ahead configuration however it is less obvious to see that the weakest sjv vortices are those produced by the submarine in negative pitch which is maybe a consequence of their shear with the boundary layer on the hull for the submarine in drift symmetry does not apply and the structures shed on the port side are stronger featuring larger values of circulation compared to those on the starboard side although their size is similar see sptv or even smaller see sjv 6 2 2 vortices downstream of the sail fig 12 shows the signature of the vortices generated by the sail in the plane p 2 compared to fig 11 the additional presence of the structures generated from the tip of the sail can be noticed in fig 12a one can see that the intensity of the tip sailplane vortices is declining very quickly downstream and they are actually weaker than the junction vortices generated by both sailplanes contours in fig 12b are much more complex the horizontal shift of all vortices relative to the plane of symmetry of the submarine body is evident especially for the tip vortices originating from the sailplanes however this behavior affects also the sail tip vortices and the sailplanes junction vortices with the branches coming from the starboard side having a significantly larger size than those coming from the port side actually this result was already visible over the plane p 1 across the sail in the configuration with negative pitch represented in the panel fig 12c the topology is actually less complex than in fig 12b with contours populated by the footprint of the tip vortices from the sail and the sailplanes and the lower branches of the horseshoe vortices from the sailplanes the junction vortices from the sail are instead practically missing which is likely the consequence of their interaction with the hull of the submarine note that in this configuration they are oriented towards its surface which promotes their faster dissipation in comparison with the straight ahead condition due to the opposite direction of the hull generated vorticity in panel fig 12d the deformation of the upper legs of the junction vortices coming from the sailplanes highlights their interaction with the structures coming from the tip of the sail in addition in agreement with the discussion above for fig 12c the horseshoe vortices produced at the root of the sail are the largest across all configurations since in this case they are directed away from the surface of the submarine therefore they experience a weaker interaction with the boundary layer and a slower dissipation compared to all other cases furthermore the intensity of the junction vortices from the sail is enhanced by the vorticity coming from the boundary layer over the hull due to cross flow this is shown in fig 13 where contours of streamwise vorticity are visualized over the plane p 2 dealing with a detail in the vicinity of the surface of the hull downstream of the sail on the left and right sides of fig 13 the cases with negative and positive pitch are considered for comparison also the streamlines of the in plane secondary flows are shown in the right panel the signature of the starboard leg of the strong junction vortex from the sail is evident the boundary layer over the hull supplies additional vorticity to the junction vortex as also demonstrated by the streamlines of the secondary flows table 9 points that the strongest stv vortex is by far that generated on the starboard side of the submarine in drift the same occurs also for the spjv vortex originating from the bottom side of the root of the starboard sailplane in agreement with the upstream position considered above the most significant sjv vortices are produced in positive pitch while in negative pitch the junction vortices from the sail are below the threshold value of q l 2 u 2 20 chosen to detect the coherent structures both pitch conditions generate the largest and strongest sptv vortices also in agreement with the comparisons observed on the upstream plane p 1 the sjv and sptv vortices shed on the port side of the submarine in drift have larger values of circulation than those on the starboard side 6 2 3 vortices across the fins fig 14 deals with the plane p 3 it is clear that vortices are weak in the straight ahead configuration both compared against those seen upstream and those at the same streamwise location in the other panels of fig 14 in drift fig 14b the largest structure is by far that coming from the tip of the sail although it is located away from the stern not influencing the working conditions of the fins and their loading conditions a similar discussion applies to the vortex from the tip of the starboard sailplane that coming from the tip of the port sailplane is instead not visible in the panel of fig 14b due to its upward shift in fig 14b also the footprint of the lower stern appendages is not negligible via their junction vortices especially from the bottom fin on the starboard side in the configuration with negative pitch fig 14c the signature of the sailplanes tip vortices is visible in the vicinity of the outer surfaces of the upper fins those vortices were actually deflected away from the symmetry plane of the submarine by their interaction with the stern appendages it should be noted that this interaction is detrimental to the efficiency of the appendages with a negative impact on the maneuverability of the submarine in pure pitch the tip of the sail generates weaker structures compared to the submarine in drift and they are almost not distinguishable in fig 14c actually there the most evident vortices are the junction ones originating from the root of the lower fins with the outer legs keeping in the vicinity of the surface of the stern and the inner legs moving away from it shifting downwards fig 14d is practically unaffected by the vortices produced by the sail note that the sailplanes tip vortices are located outside of the view in fig 14d above its upper border in this case the most significant vortices are by far the horseshoe vortices from the root of the upper fins in particular the inner ones due to the positive pitch of the submarine move upwards away from the surface of the stern in contrast with the outer ones which keep closer to the hull since their upward shift is bounded by the stern appendages this behavior is actually similar to that of the junction vortices from the lower fins seen in the configuration at negative pitch in fig 14c table 10 provides additional evidence that the largest strongest vortex is generated from the tip of the sail of the submarine in drift in the case with the submarine at negative pitch the sptv vortices keep rather intense even downstream of the interaction with the upper fins although at positive pitch they are larger and stronger however note that in fig 14d the sptv vortices are not visible since they moved upwards far away from the stern region with the exception of the straight ahead condition the fjv vortices are quite strong for all configurations in particular they have cross sections and circulations larger than those seen over the plane p 1 for the junction vortices originating from the root of the sail 6 2 4 vortices over the propeller plane in this section the footprint of the vortices over the propeller plane the plane where the propeller would be installed is considered it is almost insignificant in the straight ahead case as demonstrated by the contours in fig 15a in contrast a quite complex topology is visible in fig 15b the vortices originating from the tip of the fins are significant although always located away from the propeller region for which we can assume a radius equal to a half of the radial coordinate of the tip of the stern appendages it is interesting to notice that the tip vortex in the upper region of the starboard side is the weakest one across those produced by the four fins maybe because the presence of the tip vortex coming from the sail is able to affect the pressure gradient at the top right tip at inner radii a complex system of vortices comes from the root of the fins and is obviously able to affect the performance and the forces acting on a propeller installed at the tail of the submarine it is clear that the drift condition is able to cause a significant cross stream shift of such horseshoe vortices in fig 15b we can still see the signature of the vortices coming from the tips of the sail and starboard sailplane in negative pitch the topology is substantially different as shown in fig 15c the tip vortices are more similar between each other than in fig 15b all of them experience a downward displacement relative to the tip of the stern appendages the horseshoe vortices from the upper fins are weak whereas the stronger ones from the lower fins undergo a very different streamwise evolution of their legs the inner legs moved away from the surface of the stern while the outer legs kept closer to it in agreement with their behavior across the fins the latter are going to be ingested by the propeller at the tail of the submarine in the same fig 15c the signature of the sailplanes tip vortices is still visible confirming that they are very strong and able to affect the flow up to the rear of the submarine the contours in fig 15d are similar to those in fig 15c but with some differences i the tip vortices from the fins are shifted upward ii the junction vortices from the fins are stronger than in fig 15c iii the sailplanes tip vortices are missing since they are displaced upward far away from the surface of the stern table 11 points again to the significant signature even at the tail of the submarine by the vortex shed from the tip of the sail in the drift condition the circulation of the ftv vortices is also large at all conditions with the exception of the case with the submarine in straight ahead in drift those generated by the bottom fins are actually significantly more intense than those from the tip of the top fins while in both pitch conditions both areas and circulations of the ftv vortices are more uniform across all four stern appendages the properties of the fjv vortices over the propeller plane p 4 are especially interesting since they are obviously going to affect the inflow ingested by the propeller although it is worth noting that the suction generated by the latter not included in the present simulations would influence in turn the properties of the fjv vortices the present results indicate that they are stronger in drift than in both pitch configurations of the submarine 7 conclusions results of rans computations were presented on the towed bb2 submarine model joubert 2004 2006 at four operative conditions corresponding to straight ahead drift and both positive and negative pitch detailed comparisons with experiments in the literature toxopeus et al 2019 lee et al 2019 demonstrated the accuracy of the simulations the agreement was found very good not only in terms of loads over the submarine but also for the location and circulation of the vortices shed from the sail this work presented a comparison of the coherent structures generated by the submarine across the four simulated maneuvering conditions they affect the signature of the submarine which is obviously critical for strategic purposes in military scenarios they also affect the working conditions in terms of both performance and mechanical stress of both the stern appendages and the propeller installed at the tail of the ship although the latter was not included in the present work due to computational cost constraints computations demonstrated that the negative pitch maneuver is the one with the most significant impact of the vortices from the sail on the rear of the submarine involving both the stern appendages and the propeller plane this influence came especially from the tip of the sailplanes while both the tip and junction vortices from the main body of the sail were found weaker than in positive pitch and in drift in the latter cases the vortices from the sail moved away from the submarine therefore they were not able to affect substantially the flow conditions at its stern but they were still important in defining its wake signature in steady drift the vortex from the tip of the sail was found especially large and intense whereas in positive pitch the flow from the sail was mainly dominated by the vortices from the tip of the sailplanes and the junction vortices from the root of the sail as a consequence of the orientation of the submarine body relative to the free stream the pattern of both junction and tip vortices from the stern appendages was found to be strongly dependent on the manevering condition of the submarine in both pitch conditions the intensity of all tip vortices from the four stern appendages was rather uniform in contrast in drift those produced from the stern appendages on the bottom side of the submarine were observed to have values of circulations significantly higher than those from the rudders on the upper side in particular the one closest to the wake of the sail was much smaller and weaker with values of circulation an order of magnitude lower than all other tip vortices from the fins the strongest junction vortices were instead produced by the stern appendages in drift conditions they are especially important since they significantly affect the flow conditions at the propeller disk as expected the configuration in straight ahead condition that was assumed as a reference was that with the simplest system of vortices with by far the lowest values of circulation credit authorship contribution statement riccardo broglia conceptualization methodology software
