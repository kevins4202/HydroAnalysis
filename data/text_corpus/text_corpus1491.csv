7455,the temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation this study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework two parameters of the monthly model i e k and m are assumed to be time variant at different months based on the hydrological data set from 121 mopex catchments in the united states we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters k and m and catchment properties ndvi and frequency of rainfall events α the results show that parameter k is positively correlated with ndvi or α while the correlation is opposite for parameter m indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m the multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between ε and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time variant parameters and ndvi the mean annual parameter ε is downscaled to monthly k and m the results show that it has lower nses than these from model with time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua while for several study catchments it has higher nses than that of the model with constant parameters the proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter keywords monthly water balance model seasonality of model parameters vegetation rainfall temporal scaling of model parameter 1 introduction parameters of conceptual hydrological models are simplified representations of the physical characteristics controlling rainfall runoff processes consequently it plays a significant role in producing accurate and credible predictions in hydrological modeling model parameters are usually assumed to be constant and calibrated using a particular data record with the purpose of obtaining an optimal parameter set duan et al 1993 or stationary parameter distributions beven and freer 2001 however it is no longer appropriate to treat parameters as time invariant for the following reasons firstly the climatic condition in a catchment may change during the calibration period numerous studies have reported that model parameter estimations depend on the historical records used for calibration merz et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 for example wu and johnston 2007 found that the soil evaporation compensation coefficient which is a parameter related to evapotranspiration process has relatively smaller value during normal years than that in drought years secondly catchment conditions may change due to natural disturbances e g bushfire and soil erosion or human interferences e g urbanization and deforestation for example the water storage capacity in a catchment showed an increasing trend due to land use and land cover change deng et al 2016 finally seasonal variations of model parameters have been noted by ye et al 1997 and paik et al 2005 coron et al 2012 also reported seasonal variations in model parameters owing to differences of the dominant runoff generation mechanisms among seasons for particular catchments therefore it is necessary to use time variant parameter s for accurately simulating state variables and fluxes particularly under a changing environment allowing the model parameters to vary with time provides one possible approach for better representation of the catchment process in hydrological models time variant parameters have been studied recently merz et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 patil and stieglitz 2015 three approaches have been proposed to estimate the time variant model parameters in previous studies 1 available data set is divided into consecutive subsets and parameters are calibrated separately for each subset gharari et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 2 a functional form of the selected time variant model parameters is developed and the parameters of the function are estimated using an optimization algorithm based on the entire historical record jeremiah et al 2013 westra et al 2014 and 3 data assimilation technique is used to identify the temporal variation of parameters based on hydrologic observations deng et al 2016 pathiraja et al 2016 model parameters are treated as time variant continuously or from period to period in the above studies with the objective of estimating the time variant parameters of hydrologic models along with the time variant model parameters parameter scaling at different spatial and temporal scales is another issue scale issues exist due to the heterogeneity and variability of catchments properties and it is crucial to hydrological modeling in a hydrological context scaling means transferring information from a larger scale to a smaller scale spatially or temporally and vice versa there are two scaling approaches to achieve the above objective tian et al 2006 one is process scale which is to re define new governing equations to reflect the catchment heterogeneity the other is modeling scale which is to devise effective parameters to account for the catchment dynamics the representative elementary watershed concept rew reggiani et al 1998 which is a strategy for the process scale has been used and extended to cope with the hydrological scaling reggiani and rientjes 2005 tian et al 2006 in the modeling scale the spatial and temporal scaling of parameters provides another useful strategy to enhance hydrologic understanding and model predictive capabilities blöschl and sivapalan 1995 for instance hydraulic conductivity can be measured at the point scale based on darcy s law while upscaling involves when it is applied to the catchment scale by the governing equation such as richards equation as an analog to spatial scaling of model parameters the temporal scaling of model parameters represents the relationship of parameters among different time scales at which the governing or conceptual equations are developed however research on temporal scaling of hydrologic model parameters is limited compared with spatial scaling previous research is mainly focused on the effect of different time steps of forcing data on model parameters and their temporal transferability for example littlewood and croke 2008 2013 assessed the influence of sub daily time steps of model input data on the calibrated model parameters melsen et al 2016 investigated the temporal transferability of model parameter under three relevant temporal resolutions of discharge data i e hourly daily and monthly using the variable infiltration capacity vic model at the thur basin in switzerland in order to evaluate the temporal scaling of parameters one way is to develop a hydrologic model applicable to two time scales e g monthly and mean annual this is challenging due to the large time scale gap instead it is practical to develop two models for different time scales but with the same model framework consequently the corresponding parameters at the two time scales will have the same physical or conceptual meaning to serve the purpose of evaluating the temporal scaling of hydrologic model parameters we use the budyko type model proposed by wang and tang 2014 and the monthly water balance model derived by zhao et al 2016 the budyko framework budyko 1974 which depicts the climate control on water balance has been widely used to investigate the relationship between model parameters and catchment conditions e g climate and landscape at the long term scale zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2009 cheng et al 2011 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 for example chen et al 2013 modeled the seasonal evaporation based on the extended budyko framework with consideration of soil water storage changes wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko type model for mean annual water balance and found that the parameter is mainly controlled by vegetation and temporal variability of rainfall zhang et al 2016 established a relationship between the landscape parameter and vegetation based on a budyko model and applied it for evaluating the regional hydrological response to vegetation change in this study the rainfall runoff model in which the soil water content is explicitly described is used to analyze the temporal variation of model parameters at monthly scale furthermore the temporal scaling of parameters is explored based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with the same modeling framework the objectives of this research are to 1 examine the relationship between the catchment properties and the time variant parameters in a water balance model at monthly scale and 2 investigate the temporal scaling of model parameters from mean annual to monthly scale the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief review of the monthly water balance model and the discussions of the seasonality of model parameters the study catchments and data are described in section 3 followed by results and discussion in section 4 conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology the temporal variation and scaling of parameters are investigated as follows the seasonality of two parameters for the monthly model and its linkage to the parameter of mean annual model are firstly quantified afterwards parameters of the two models across time scales are estimated based on the observations secondly the correlations between monthly parameters and catchment properties are analyzed and multiple linear regression is used to fit the empirical equations between the mean annual parameter and the monthly parameters then the relationship between mean annual parameter and monthly parameters i e the temporal scaling of model parameters is developed based on the fitted equations and the correlations between the monthly parameters and catchment properties 2 1 monthly water balance model the monthly water balance model is based on the optimality principle of entropy or power or the generalized proportionality relationship wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 this model is a modification of the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 both the abcd model and the scs curve number method for surface runoff at the event scale use the budyko type functions the monthly water balance model and its parameters are briefly described below and more detailed information is referred to zhao et al 2016 the general monthly water balance can be represented by the following equation 1 p t s 1 s 2 e t q t where p t is monthly precipitation s 1 and s 2 represent the soil water storage at the beginning and end of the month respectively e t is actual evaporation and q t is runoff the left hand side of eq 1 is the available water for competition and it is denoted as a t 2 a t p t s 1 the available water is partitioned into three components i e s 2 e t and q t in order to formulate this partitioning into two component competition like budyko equation and scs curve number method the end month storage and evaporation are combined and defined as y t 3 y t s 2 e t the reason for combining s 2 and e t is that both of them have upper bounds but runoff increases unboundedly with precipitation y t is called as evapotranspiration opportunity in the abcd model thomas 1981 based on the definitions of a t and y t eq 1 becomes the following equation 4 a t y t q t in eq 4 the available water a t is partitioned into y t and q t and this partitioning is quantified by the following function in the abcd model 5 y t a t b 2 m 2 m a t b 2 m 2 m 2 a t b m 2 m where m is a parameter and its range is 0 m 1 and b is the upper bound of y t eq 5 can be derived from the generalized proportionality relationship wang and tang 2014 the parameter m is defined as 6 m y t 0 y t where y t 0 is the initial value of y t as an analog to initial evaporation wang and tang 2014 the upper bound of evaporation is potential evaporation e p and the upper bound of s 2 is the catchment storage capacity and denoted as s b therefore b is computed by 7 b e p s b once y t is computed by eq 5 it is further partitioned into e t and s 2 this partitioning is quantified by the proportionality relationship as the partitioning in eq 5 as an analog to m k is defined as 8 k e t 0 e t by definition k ranges from 0 to 1 based on the proportionality relationship the ratio of continuing evaporation e t e t 0 to its potential value e p e t 0 is equal to the ratio of continuing evapotranspiration opportunity y t y t 0 to its potential value b y t 0 zhao et al 2016 9 e t e t 0 e p e t 0 y t y t 0 b y t 0 given the parameter values of m and s b y t is computed by eq 5 then e t is computed by eq 9 given the parameter value of k and runoff is computed by eq 4 the proportionality based monthly water balance model and the abcd model utilize the same equation i e eq 5 to compute y t however the equations for computing evaporation are different in the abcd model evaporation is calculated by y t s 2 after s 2 is computed using an exponential function i e s 2 y t e e p b it should be noted that b in the abcd model is an integral parameter while b in the proportionality based model is the sum of potential evaporation and catchment storage capacity eq 9 is used to compute evaporation by introducing initial evaporation runoff is computed from eqs 4 and 5 in the proportionality based model while in the abcd model runoff computed from eqs 4 and 5 is further separated into surface runoff and groundwater discharge which is modeled as a linear reservoir runoff separation has impact on model performance since the delay of runoff i e routing is important for some catchments especially for slow flow in this study we mainly focus on the model parameters under acceptable performance e g nse 0 6 in this study therefore the runoff separation is not considered for the proportionality based monthly water balance model to take into account the effect of snow storage and melt a simple temperature based module martinez and gupta 2010 is added to the proportionality based model the total precipitation p is partitioned into rain p r and snow p s as follows 10 p s t 0 t r t min t p t r t min t t r t s t s t min t t r p t min t t s where t r is the critical temperature above which all the precipitation falls as rain and t s is the critical temperature below which all the precipitation falls as snow t min t is the mean daily minimum temperature for the month the accumulated snow storage g t is stored in an infinite capacity tank where the snowmelt p sm is released at a rate determined by the critical temperature and the snowmelt coefficient f m according to 11 p sm t g t 1 p s t f m t r t min t g t 1 p s t f m t r t min t t r t s t s t min t t r 0 t min t t s p t in the monthly water balance model is calculated by 12 p t p sm t p r t p sm t p p s t 2 2 seasonality of model parameters in the monthly water balance model there are six parameters to be estimated including the initial evaporation ratio k the initial evapotranspiration opportunity ratio m the catchment storage capacity s b mm the critical temperature above which all the precipitation falls as rain t r c the critical temperature below which all the precipitation falls as snow t s c and the snowmelt coefficient f m note that t s is substituted by t δ t r t s for model parameter estimation parameters k and m may vary temporally due to the seasonality of vegetation and rainfall k and m have the similar definitions as the ratio between their initial and total values k for the monthly scale is an analog to ε defined as the ratio between mean annual initial evaporation and total evaporation by wang and tang 2014 they found that ε is correlated with ndvi and rainfall variability initial evaporation e 0 may increase with ndvi since interception loss increases with leaf area and is also affected by the frequency of rainfall events α at shorter time scales parameter m takes into account evaporation and soil wetting the effects of vegetation and rainfall on soil wetting have been reported in the literature e g voepel et al 2011 thus k and m are allowed to vary on the mean monthly basis to reflect the seasonal variability of catchment properties while s b and the three parameters for the snow module are treated as time invariant in this study based on the above discussion the inter annual variations of k and m are neglected but the mean monthly variation of the two parameters are considered 2 3 temporal scaling of model parameter wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko type model for mean annual water balance by generalizing the proportionality relationship of the scs curve number method based on this work zhao et al 2016 proposed a water balance model at different time scales which provides a common model framework for studying temporal scaling of model parameters the parameter ε of the one parameter budyko model is defined as the ratio of initial evaporation and total evaporation at the mean annual scale at the monthly scale two parameters are derived based on the proportionality relationship from the parameter ε since both storage change δ s and evaporation e are not negligible wang and tang 2014 zhao et al 2016 parameter ε is divided into two parameters in the monthly water balance model i e the initial evaporation ratio k and the initial evapotranspiration opportunity ratio m parameters k and ε have the similar definition as the ratio between their initial and total values except for the different time scales parameter m includes the catchment storage item for calculation and it shares the concept of proportionality with parameter ε according to wang and tang 2014 parameter ε has a physical meaning from the process perspective the dominant controlling factors on ε are vegetation and temporal variability of rainfall which have impacts on the process of soil moisture initial evaporation and actual evaporation the monthly parameters k and m have the potential to vary temporally due to the seasonality of vegetation and rainfall based on the connection between the mean annual and monthly parameters we aim to investigate parameter s relationship at different time scales section 4 the proposed method to infer monthly parameters from mean annual parameters involves several steps 1 the correlation between temporal variation of monthly k and m and the catchment properties i e ndvi and α is firstly analyzed 2 the empirical relationship between parameter ε and the mean values of k and m is developed by using multiple linear regression the results are presented in table 1 as will be further discussed in section 4 3 3 based on the empirical equations shown in table 1 the summation of monthly k and m can be computed through parameter ε respectively afterwards ndvi or α will be used as ratio to estimate the monthly values of k and m 2 4 parameter estimation at the mean annual scale the initial evaporation e 0 can be calculated directly through the water balance eq 13 and the partitioning eq 14 wang et al 2015 parameter ε of the mean annual water balance model is then computed by eq 15 13 p e q 14 e e 0 e p e 0 q p e 0 15 ε e 0 e where p e ep q and e 0 are mean annual precipitation actual evaporation potential evaporation runoff and initial evaporation respectively for calibration of monthly water balance model the objective function is to minimize the mean squared error based on runoff observations the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 is used for searching the optimal parameter values parameter ranges are determined on the reference of martinez and gupta 2010 and specified as follows the ranges of k m and f m are from 0 to 1 s b ranges from 0 to 4000 mm the range of tr is between 10 c and 10 c and t δ ranges from 0 c to 100 c parameters k and m of the monthly water balance model are considered to vary among different months the inter annual variations of the parameters are not considered therefore parameters to be estimated for each catchment include s b t r t δ f m and 12 monthly values for k and m for comparison k and m are also treated as constant for the 12 months and the corresponding model is called monthly model with time invariant parameters 2 5 evaluation index the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the volume error ve are used to evaluate the model performance the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to assess the linear relationship between the estimated parameters and the catchment characteristics 16 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 17 ve t 1 n q sim t t 1 n q obs t t 1 n q obs t 18 r t 1 n x x y y t 1 n x y 2 y y 2 where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed runoff for month t q obs is the mean value of observed runoff x and y are the variables x and y are the mean values of the variables and n is the total number of data points the nse has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling nse ranges from to 1 a nse value of 1 means a perfect match of simulated runoff to the observations and a value of 0 indicates that the model simulations are equivalent to the mean values of runoff observations the ve is a measure of bias between the simulated and observed runoff ve with a value of 0 denotes no bias and a negative value indicates an underestimation of the total runoff volume the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 and describes the degree of linearity between different variables 3 study catchments and data the study catchments are obtained from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 and the dataset includes daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and streamflow daily actual evaporation and monthly potential evaporation with a spatial resolution of 8 km are obtained from the university of montana zhang et al 2010 the potential evaporation is estimated using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 the actual evaporation estimated from remote sensing data is only used to select study catchments from the mopex dataset the bimonthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was generated from the avhrr gimms tucker et al 2005 and used for representing vegetation coverage mean values of ndvi at the monthly scale are computed for all the study catchments and used for further analysis monthly values of precipitation potential evaporation mean daily minimum temperature and streamflow from 1983 to 2003 are used for quantifying the monthly variation of k and m 121 study catchments are selected based on the following criteria 1 there is no missing data during the entire 21 years 2 the relative water balance error i e p q e p 100 is in the range from 10 to 10 3 the monthly actual evaporation is less than or equal to the potential evaporation and 4 human interferences are minimum wang and hejazi 2011 the area of the selected catchments ranges from 67 km2 to 9806 km2 and the slope ranges from 2 5 to 25 6 climate aridity index ai is defined as the ratio of mean annual potential evaporation to precipitation catchments are considered humid when ai is less than 1 catchments with ai greater than 1 are considered temperate 1 ai 2 or arid ai 2 budyko 1974 petersen et al 2012 the co variability index is defined as the correlation between monthly precipitation and potential evaporation i e ci ρ p i e p i ci is used to describe the relationship between cycles of precipitation and energy availability and it ranges from 1 to 1 according to petersen et al 2012 precipitation and temperature cycles are out of phase in phase when ci 0 4 ci 0 4 as illustrated in fig 1 most of the study catchments are located in humid and temperate area and one is in the arid region arizona catchments located in midwest show a strong positive correlation between pi and ep i indicating that the precipitation and temperature cycles are coherent precipitation and potential evaporation are out of phase for two catchments in northwest precipitation is uniformly distributed in more than half of the catchments 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance fig 2 presents the cumulative distribution of nse for the monthly water balance model with two parameter settings 1 time variant k and m and 2 constant k and m the results show that the model with time variant parameters outperforms the model with constant parameters for all the catchments 116 out of 121 catchments have nse values greater than 0 6 and are selected for further analysis in general catchments with nse greater than 0 8 are located predominantly in the wetter eastern and midwestern regions while the catchments with nse smaller than 0 8 are located predominantly in the great lakes regions and approximately 83 of them have normally distributed precipitation i e ci values range from 0 4 to 0 4 furthermore the nse difference δnse between the monthly water balance model with time variant and constant k and m is calculated to show the performance improvements achieved by considering time variant parameters in model simulation as seen in fig 3 the δ nse values range from 0 to 0 05 for 63 catchments from 0 05 to 0 1 for 46 catchments and are greater than 0 1 for 7 catchments the performance from the model with time variant parameters shows a more significant change in the midwest and mountain regions in the midwest the cropland is dominant wang and hejazi 2011 and it exerts significant control on evapotranspiration and further affects soil water content the treatment of time variant parameters k and m reflects the seasonal effect of vegetation thereby leading to higher nse values the ves for the 121 catchments are close or equal to one not shown suggesting that the runoff estimates meet the water balance condition 4 2 seasonal variation of k and m 4 2 1 seasonal variation of catchment properties vegetation and precipitation affect the seasonal water balance through both evaporation and water storage change to assess their impacts on parameters k and m the averaged values of ndvi and the fraction of rainy days are calculated for the 116 catchments the mean monthly ndvi for each catchment is calculated by 19 ndvi m 1 n i 1 n ndvi i m the fraction of rainy days α is computed from the daily precipitation data as the ratio between the number of days nr with a precipitation threshold and the total number of days in a month n the mean monthly α is 20 α m 1 n i 1 n α i m where n is the total years of the data series n 21 and m is month number m 1 2 12 4 2 2 modeling seasonal variation of parameters the pearson correlation coefficient r is computed to show the correlation between time variant model parameters and rainfall variability and vegetation various scenarios of fraction of rainy days including α 0 α 1 α 5 α 10 and α 15 corresponding to precipitation thresholds of 0 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 15 mm are chosen to evaluate the impact of precipitation threshold on the temporal variability of parameters as shown in fig 4 most significant correlation exists when precipitation threshold is set to 1 mm absolute values of correlation coefficients between k m and α have an increasing trend with precipitation threshold varying from 0 to 1 mm and they show a slightly decreasing trend with the increase of precipitation threshold afterwards results indicate that time variant parameters k and m are significantly correlated with α 1 at a significance level of 5 the average p value for correlations between k m and α 1 is the smallest among these scenarios therefore the fraction of rainy days α 1 is used as one of the catchment indicators to explore the dependence of the time variant parameters on the precipitation variability fig 5 presents a box plot top panel comparison of the r between monthly parameters k and m and catchment indicators ndvi and α 1 for the 116 catchments with nse 0 6 the results show that parameter k has positive correlations with both ndvi and α 1 while negative correlations for parameter m are obtained although several outliers exist number of catchments with p 0 05 r 0 3 and r 0 5 are presented at the bottom panel of fig 5 results show that approximately one third of the catchments in each case have a statistically significant correlation between time variant parameters and catchment indicators at the 5 significance level the initial evaporation ratio k is the ratio of initial evaporation e 0 to total evaporation e e 0 may increase with ndvi since the increase of vegetation coverage could result in higher interception loss ndvi and α 1 provide more potential for the occurrence of the initial water loss from the perspective of the vegetation conditions and water supply i e rainfall respectively therefore parameter k which represents the initial evaporation ratio is positively correlated with ndvi and α 1 the equation of yt in the monthly water balance model i e eq 5 is a monotonically increasing function of the initial evaporation opportunity m the runoff will increase with the decreasing of yt since qt at yt indicating that smaller value of m leads to greater runoff when the other items are given soil with higher vegetation coverage i e higher ndvi usually retains more water than that with lower ndvi cheng et al 2007 i e higher potential for runoff generation during the month with higher ndvi therefore parameter m has a negative correlation with ndvi as mentioned in section 3 study catchments are mostly humid or temperate ai 2 except one catchment with ai 2 thus a higher value of rainfall frequency can indirectly reflect a relatively higher amount of water supply from precipitation which provides more chance for runoff generation i e parameter m has a negative correlation with α 1 according to the above results most of the time variant parameter estimates have significant correlations with vegetation and temporal variability of precipitation specifically 85 catchments have a relatively strong correlation between time variant k and the catchment properties and 104 catchments for parameter m the number of catchments for which parameter k is correlated with ndvi α 1 and both ndvi and α 1 is 26 9 and 50 respectively while the corresponding number of catchments for parameter m is 12 17 and 75 respectively note that it is considered to be a relatively strong correlation when the absolute value of r is higher than 0 3 hinkle et al 2003 number of catchments that satisfied this criterion are shown at the bottom panel of fig 5 the results show that more catchments have a relatively significant correlation between time variant parameters and both ndvi and α 1 when compared to the number of catchments that show the similar degree of r between time variant parameters and the single indicator both vegetation and precipitation variabilities have an impact on the temporal variation of model parameters k and m a simple linear correlation may not reflect the complex relationship between the variation of parameters and the individual factors especially it has an interaction between vegetation and precipitation however the results of the 116 catchments still show a significant correlation between time variant parameters and indicators providing a statistical validation of seasonality of parameters k and m as discussed in section 2 2 4 3 temporal scaling from ε to k and m in section 2 3 we discussed the temporal scaling of model parameters at the mean annual and monthly scales and the potential transferability across time scales fig 6 shows the scatter plots between ε and the average values and cv for k and m the correlation coefficient between ε and the average value of k and m is 0 6 and 0 61 respectively and the correlation coefficient between ε and the cv of k and m is 0 18 and 0 5 respectively these indicate that ε has significant correlations with average values of both k and m while the linear coefficient between ε and the cv of k is negligible the average value and cv represent the magnitude and the monthly variability of the parameters the strong correlations indicate the strong interdependence of parameters at monthly and mean annual scales and the correlations are due to the physical linkage of hydrologic processes at different time scales monthly parameters k and m are derived from ε by considering different hydrological variables i e water storage change and evaporation all the three parameters have the same definition namely the ratio between the initial value of a variable and its total value the positive correlations between annual and monthly parameters provide a validation of the parameter relationship at different time scales discussed in section 2 3 from the perspective of statistical analysis the empirical equations for the mean annual parameter ε are obtained by using the multiple linear regression based on the monthly time variant parameters k and m as shown in table 1 all the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 6 indicating that the estimated ε from the empirical equations has a relatively high correlation to the ε obtained from the observations directly by comparing the estimation of ε in scenarios 1 and 2 it has no significant improvement on performance when the function form contains the cv of time variant parameters in scenario 1 thus the empirical equations in scenario 2 are used for parameter downscaling fig 7 shows the comparison of the ε estimates from the observations and ε from the empirical equations in scenario 2 fig 8 illustrates the model performance of the monthly water balance model with parameters k and m downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε the results show that the nse of 34 catchments has values lower than zero indicating a bad performance on runoff simulation 25 catchments have good performance with nse 0 6 to thoroughly illustrate the performance of the model with time variant parameters two hydrological criteria i e the box cox transformed root mean square error trmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge for a detail review refer to wang et al 2017 and gupta et al 2009 are used to assess the model performance in low and high flows respectively fig 9 presents the comparison of nse obtained from the monthly water balance model under different parameter scenarios i e time variant k and m being downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua algorithm and constant parameters being calibrated through sce ua algorithm the results show that all the runoff simulations from model with time variant k and m being downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε has lower nses than these from model with time variant k and m which are calibrated through sce ua along with lower kges and higher trmses however model performance of 4 catchments under the former scenario has similar nse trans nse fixed nse fixed 5 or higher nses than those of the model with constant parameters in addition the model with time variant k and m has higher nses and kges but lower trmses than those from the model with constant parameters calibrated through the sce ua algorithm indicating the former significantly outperforms the latter in the entire runoff series high and low flows two main systematic errors have impacts on the model performance during the temporal scaling process of parameters firstly it is the error from the empirical equations between ε and parameters k and m even the ε from the empirical equations has a high correlation coefficients in general the estimated ε for some catchments are away from the 45 degree line as shown in fig 7 the other error is from the allocation of the summation of monthly k and m using the ndvi as ratios after computing the summation of monthly k and m by the empirical equations in scenario 1 ndvi is then used as the ratio for the calculation of monthly parameters since ndvi is one of the factors controlling monthly variation of parameters uncertainty exists for using ndvi to disaggregate k and m for the other two scenarios the model parameters are calibrated through the sce ua algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained based on the objective function that aims to match the runoff observations therefore the monthly water balance model with time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua has better runoff simulations than the model with parameters k and m estimated from the mean annual parameter ε the mean annual parameter can be successfully downscaled to monthly time variant parameters k and m even though uncertainty exists in the disaggregation process generally the proposed method is feasible to downscale the mean annual parameter to the monthly time variant parameters providing impetus for developing monthly model at ungagged basins where monthly runoff observations are not available potential improvements for the proposed downscaling approach could be achieved by identifying more accurate equations to describe the relationship between the mean annual parameter and monthly time variant parameters such as analytical solutions from the model equations 5 conclusions the seasonality of parameters on a monthly water balance model and their dependence on vegetation and rainfall variability have been analyzed in this paper afterwards we explored the temporal scaling of parameters based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model concept conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the seasonality of parameters k and m is closely related to the temporal variation of the catchment properties i e ndvi and rainfall frequency α 1 specifically parameter k is positively correlated to ndvi or α 1 while inverse correlation is obtained between parameter m and ndvi or α 1 2 the temporal scaling of model parameters between mean annual and monthly time scales is quantified and results demonstrate that the monthly time variant parameters k and m can be successfully downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε 3 the monthly water balance model with time variant parameters can provide improvements on monthly runoff simulations this research provides one possible approach to estimate the monthly time variant parameters without calibration future research will explore the analytical linkage between the mean annual and monthly parameters based on model equations acknowledgements this study was supported by

7455,the temporal variation of model parameters is affected by the catchment conditions and has a significant impact on hydrological simulation this study aims to evaluate the seasonality and downscaling of model parameter across time scales based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model framework two parameters of the monthly model i e k and m are assumed to be time variant at different months based on the hydrological data set from 121 mopex catchments in the united states we firstly analyzed the correlation between parameters k and m and catchment properties ndvi and frequency of rainfall events α the results show that parameter k is positively correlated with ndvi or α while the correlation is opposite for parameter m indicating that precipitation and vegetation affect monthly water balance by controlling temporal variation of parameters k and m the multiple linear regression is then used to fit the relationship between ε and the means and coefficient of variations of parameters k and m based on the empirical equation and the correlations between the time variant parameters and ndvi the mean annual parameter ε is downscaled to monthly k and m the results show that it has lower nses than these from model with time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua while for several study catchments it has higher nses than that of the model with constant parameters the proposed method is feasible and provides a useful tool for temporal scaling of model parameter keywords monthly water balance model seasonality of model parameters vegetation rainfall temporal scaling of model parameter 1 introduction parameters of conceptual hydrological models are simplified representations of the physical characteristics controlling rainfall runoff processes consequently it plays a significant role in producing accurate and credible predictions in hydrological modeling model parameters are usually assumed to be constant and calibrated using a particular data record with the purpose of obtaining an optimal parameter set duan et al 1993 or stationary parameter distributions beven and freer 2001 however it is no longer appropriate to treat parameters as time invariant for the following reasons firstly the climatic condition in a catchment may change during the calibration period numerous studies have reported that model parameter estimations depend on the historical records used for calibration merz et al 2011 zhang et al 2011 for example wu and johnston 2007 found that the soil evaporation compensation coefficient which is a parameter related to evapotranspiration process has relatively smaller value during normal years than that in drought years secondly catchment conditions may change due to natural disturbances e g bushfire and soil erosion or human interferences e g urbanization and deforestation for example the water storage capacity in a catchment showed an increasing trend due to land use and land cover change deng et al 2016 finally seasonal variations of model parameters have been noted by ye et al 1997 and paik et al 2005 coron et al 2012 also reported seasonal variations in model parameters owing to differences of the dominant runoff generation mechanisms among seasons for particular catchments therefore it is necessary to use time variant parameter s for accurately simulating state variables and fluxes particularly under a changing environment allowing the model parameters to vary with time provides one possible approach for better representation of the catchment process in hydrological models time variant parameters have been studied recently merz et al 2011 brigode et al 2013 patil and stieglitz 2015 three approaches have been proposed to estimate the time variant model parameters in previous studies 1 available data set is divided into consecutive subsets and parameters are calibrated separately for each subset gharari et al 2013 thirel et al 2015 2 a functional form of the selected time variant model parameters is developed and the parameters of the function are estimated using an optimization algorithm based on the entire historical record jeremiah et al 2013 westra et al 2014 and 3 data assimilation technique is used to identify the temporal variation of parameters based on hydrologic observations deng et al 2016 pathiraja et al 2016 model parameters are treated as time variant continuously or from period to period in the above studies with the objective of estimating the time variant parameters of hydrologic models along with the time variant model parameters parameter scaling at different spatial and temporal scales is another issue scale issues exist due to the heterogeneity and variability of catchments properties and it is crucial to hydrological modeling in a hydrological context scaling means transferring information from a larger scale to a smaller scale spatially or temporally and vice versa there are two scaling approaches to achieve the above objective tian et al 2006 one is process scale which is to re define new governing equations to reflect the catchment heterogeneity the other is modeling scale which is to devise effective parameters to account for the catchment dynamics the representative elementary watershed concept rew reggiani et al 1998 which is a strategy for the process scale has been used and extended to cope with the hydrological scaling reggiani and rientjes 2005 tian et al 2006 in the modeling scale the spatial and temporal scaling of parameters provides another useful strategy to enhance hydrologic understanding and model predictive capabilities blöschl and sivapalan 1995 for instance hydraulic conductivity can be measured at the point scale based on darcy s law while upscaling involves when it is applied to the catchment scale by the governing equation such as richards equation as an analog to spatial scaling of model parameters the temporal scaling of model parameters represents the relationship of parameters among different time scales at which the governing or conceptual equations are developed however research on temporal scaling of hydrologic model parameters is limited compared with spatial scaling previous research is mainly focused on the effect of different time steps of forcing data on model parameters and their temporal transferability for example littlewood and croke 2008 2013 assessed the influence of sub daily time steps of model input data on the calibrated model parameters melsen et al 2016 investigated the temporal transferability of model parameter under three relevant temporal resolutions of discharge data i e hourly daily and monthly using the variable infiltration capacity vic model at the thur basin in switzerland in order to evaluate the temporal scaling of parameters one way is to develop a hydrologic model applicable to two time scales e g monthly and mean annual this is challenging due to the large time scale gap instead it is practical to develop two models for different time scales but with the same model framework consequently the corresponding parameters at the two time scales will have the same physical or conceptual meaning to serve the purpose of evaluating the temporal scaling of hydrologic model parameters we use the budyko type model proposed by wang and tang 2014 and the monthly water balance model derived by zhao et al 2016 the budyko framework budyko 1974 which depicts the climate control on water balance has been widely used to investigate the relationship between model parameters and catchment conditions e g climate and landscape at the long term scale zhang et al 2008 potter and zhang 2009 yang et al 2009 cheng et al 2011 istanbulluoglu et al 2012 li et al 2013 yang et al 2014 for example chen et al 2013 modeled the seasonal evaporation based on the extended budyko framework with consideration of soil water storage changes wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko type model for mean annual water balance and found that the parameter is mainly controlled by vegetation and temporal variability of rainfall zhang et al 2016 established a relationship between the landscape parameter and vegetation based on a budyko model and applied it for evaluating the regional hydrological response to vegetation change in this study the rainfall runoff model in which the soil water content is explicitly described is used to analyze the temporal variation of model parameters at monthly scale furthermore the temporal scaling of parameters is explored based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with the same modeling framework the objectives of this research are to 1 examine the relationship between the catchment properties and the time variant parameters in a water balance model at monthly scale and 2 investigate the temporal scaling of model parameters from mean annual to monthly scale the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 presents a brief review of the monthly water balance model and the discussions of the seasonality of model parameters the study catchments and data are described in section 3 followed by results and discussion in section 4 conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methodology the temporal variation and scaling of parameters are investigated as follows the seasonality of two parameters for the monthly model and its linkage to the parameter of mean annual model are firstly quantified afterwards parameters of the two models across time scales are estimated based on the observations secondly the correlations between monthly parameters and catchment properties are analyzed and multiple linear regression is used to fit the empirical equations between the mean annual parameter and the monthly parameters then the relationship between mean annual parameter and monthly parameters i e the temporal scaling of model parameters is developed based on the fitted equations and the correlations between the monthly parameters and catchment properties 2 1 monthly water balance model the monthly water balance model is based on the optimality principle of entropy or power or the generalized proportionality relationship wang et al 2015 zhao et al 2016 this model is a modification of the abcd model developed by thomas 1981 both the abcd model and the scs curve number method for surface runoff at the event scale use the budyko type functions the monthly water balance model and its parameters are briefly described below and more detailed information is referred to zhao et al 2016 the general monthly water balance can be represented by the following equation 1 p t s 1 s 2 e t q t where p t is monthly precipitation s 1 and s 2 represent the soil water storage at the beginning and end of the month respectively e t is actual evaporation and q t is runoff the left hand side of eq 1 is the available water for competition and it is denoted as a t 2 a t p t s 1 the available water is partitioned into three components i e s 2 e t and q t in order to formulate this partitioning into two component competition like budyko equation and scs curve number method the end month storage and evaporation are combined and defined as y t 3 y t s 2 e t the reason for combining s 2 and e t is that both of them have upper bounds but runoff increases unboundedly with precipitation y t is called as evapotranspiration opportunity in the abcd model thomas 1981 based on the definitions of a t and y t eq 1 becomes the following equation 4 a t y t q t in eq 4 the available water a t is partitioned into y t and q t and this partitioning is quantified by the following function in the abcd model 5 y t a t b 2 m 2 m a t b 2 m 2 m 2 a t b m 2 m where m is a parameter and its range is 0 m 1 and b is the upper bound of y t eq 5 can be derived from the generalized proportionality relationship wang and tang 2014 the parameter m is defined as 6 m y t 0 y t where y t 0 is the initial value of y t as an analog to initial evaporation wang and tang 2014 the upper bound of evaporation is potential evaporation e p and the upper bound of s 2 is the catchment storage capacity and denoted as s b therefore b is computed by 7 b e p s b once y t is computed by eq 5 it is further partitioned into e t and s 2 this partitioning is quantified by the proportionality relationship as the partitioning in eq 5 as an analog to m k is defined as 8 k e t 0 e t by definition k ranges from 0 to 1 based on the proportionality relationship the ratio of continuing evaporation e t e t 0 to its potential value e p e t 0 is equal to the ratio of continuing evapotranspiration opportunity y t y t 0 to its potential value b y t 0 zhao et al 2016 9 e t e t 0 e p e t 0 y t y t 0 b y t 0 given the parameter values of m and s b y t is computed by eq 5 then e t is computed by eq 9 given the parameter value of k and runoff is computed by eq 4 the proportionality based monthly water balance model and the abcd model utilize the same equation i e eq 5 to compute y t however the equations for computing evaporation are different in the abcd model evaporation is calculated by y t s 2 after s 2 is computed using an exponential function i e s 2 y t e e p b it should be noted that b in the abcd model is an integral parameter while b in the proportionality based model is the sum of potential evaporation and catchment storage capacity eq 9 is used to compute evaporation by introducing initial evaporation runoff is computed from eqs 4 and 5 in the proportionality based model while in the abcd model runoff computed from eqs 4 and 5 is further separated into surface runoff and groundwater discharge which is modeled as a linear reservoir runoff separation has impact on model performance since the delay of runoff i e routing is important for some catchments especially for slow flow in this study we mainly focus on the model parameters under acceptable performance e g nse 0 6 in this study therefore the runoff separation is not considered for the proportionality based monthly water balance model to take into account the effect of snow storage and melt a simple temperature based module martinez and gupta 2010 is added to the proportionality based model the total precipitation p is partitioned into rain p r and snow p s as follows 10 p s t 0 t r t min t p t r t min t t r t s t s t min t t r p t min t t s where t r is the critical temperature above which all the precipitation falls as rain and t s is the critical temperature below which all the precipitation falls as snow t min t is the mean daily minimum temperature for the month the accumulated snow storage g t is stored in an infinite capacity tank where the snowmelt p sm is released at a rate determined by the critical temperature and the snowmelt coefficient f m according to 11 p sm t g t 1 p s t f m t r t min t g t 1 p s t f m t r t min t t r t s t s t min t t r 0 t min t t s p t in the monthly water balance model is calculated by 12 p t p sm t p r t p sm t p p s t 2 2 seasonality of model parameters in the monthly water balance model there are six parameters to be estimated including the initial evaporation ratio k the initial evapotranspiration opportunity ratio m the catchment storage capacity s b mm the critical temperature above which all the precipitation falls as rain t r c the critical temperature below which all the precipitation falls as snow t s c and the snowmelt coefficient f m note that t s is substituted by t δ t r t s for model parameter estimation parameters k and m may vary temporally due to the seasonality of vegetation and rainfall k and m have the similar definitions as the ratio between their initial and total values k for the monthly scale is an analog to ε defined as the ratio between mean annual initial evaporation and total evaporation by wang and tang 2014 they found that ε is correlated with ndvi and rainfall variability initial evaporation e 0 may increase with ndvi since interception loss increases with leaf area and is also affected by the frequency of rainfall events α at shorter time scales parameter m takes into account evaporation and soil wetting the effects of vegetation and rainfall on soil wetting have been reported in the literature e g voepel et al 2011 thus k and m are allowed to vary on the mean monthly basis to reflect the seasonal variability of catchment properties while s b and the three parameters for the snow module are treated as time invariant in this study based on the above discussion the inter annual variations of k and m are neglected but the mean monthly variation of the two parameters are considered 2 3 temporal scaling of model parameter wang and tang 2014 derived a one parameter budyko type model for mean annual water balance by generalizing the proportionality relationship of the scs curve number method based on this work zhao et al 2016 proposed a water balance model at different time scales which provides a common model framework for studying temporal scaling of model parameters the parameter ε of the one parameter budyko model is defined as the ratio of initial evaporation and total evaporation at the mean annual scale at the monthly scale two parameters are derived based on the proportionality relationship from the parameter ε since both storage change δ s and evaporation e are not negligible wang and tang 2014 zhao et al 2016 parameter ε is divided into two parameters in the monthly water balance model i e the initial evaporation ratio k and the initial evapotranspiration opportunity ratio m parameters k and ε have the similar definition as the ratio between their initial and total values except for the different time scales parameter m includes the catchment storage item for calculation and it shares the concept of proportionality with parameter ε according to wang and tang 2014 parameter ε has a physical meaning from the process perspective the dominant controlling factors on ε are vegetation and temporal variability of rainfall which have impacts on the process of soil moisture initial evaporation and actual evaporation the monthly parameters k and m have the potential to vary temporally due to the seasonality of vegetation and rainfall based on the connection between the mean annual and monthly parameters we aim to investigate parameter s relationship at different time scales section 4 the proposed method to infer monthly parameters from mean annual parameters involves several steps 1 the correlation between temporal variation of monthly k and m and the catchment properties i e ndvi and α is firstly analyzed 2 the empirical relationship between parameter ε and the mean values of k and m is developed by using multiple linear regression the results are presented in table 1 as will be further discussed in section 4 3 3 based on the empirical equations shown in table 1 the summation of monthly k and m can be computed through parameter ε respectively afterwards ndvi or α will be used as ratio to estimate the monthly values of k and m 2 4 parameter estimation at the mean annual scale the initial evaporation e 0 can be calculated directly through the water balance eq 13 and the partitioning eq 14 wang et al 2015 parameter ε of the mean annual water balance model is then computed by eq 15 13 p e q 14 e e 0 e p e 0 q p e 0 15 ε e 0 e where p e ep q and e 0 are mean annual precipitation actual evaporation potential evaporation runoff and initial evaporation respectively for calibration of monthly water balance model the objective function is to minimize the mean squared error based on runoff observations the shuffled complex evolution sce ua algorithm duan et al 1993 is used for searching the optimal parameter values parameter ranges are determined on the reference of martinez and gupta 2010 and specified as follows the ranges of k m and f m are from 0 to 1 s b ranges from 0 to 4000 mm the range of tr is between 10 c and 10 c and t δ ranges from 0 c to 100 c parameters k and m of the monthly water balance model are considered to vary among different months the inter annual variations of the parameters are not considered therefore parameters to be estimated for each catchment include s b t r t δ f m and 12 monthly values for k and m for comparison k and m are also treated as constant for the 12 months and the corresponding model is called monthly model with time invariant parameters 2 5 evaluation index the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the volume error ve are used to evaluate the model performance the pearson correlation coefficient r is used to assess the linear relationship between the estimated parameters and the catchment characteristics 16 nse 1 t 1 n q sim t q obs t 2 t 1 n q obs t q obs 2 17 ve t 1 n q sim t t 1 n q obs t t 1 n q obs t 18 r t 1 n x x y y t 1 n x y 2 y y 2 where q sim t and q obs t are the simulated and observed runoff for month t q obs is the mean value of observed runoff x and y are the variables x and y are the mean values of the variables and n is the total number of data points the nse has been widely used to assess the goodness of fit for hydrological modeling nse ranges from to 1 a nse value of 1 means a perfect match of simulated runoff to the observations and a value of 0 indicates that the model simulations are equivalent to the mean values of runoff observations the ve is a measure of bias between the simulated and observed runoff ve with a value of 0 denotes no bias and a negative value indicates an underestimation of the total runoff volume the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 and describes the degree of linearity between different variables 3 study catchments and data the study catchments are obtained from the model parameter estimation experiment mopex duan et al 2006 and the dataset includes daily precipitation minimum and maximum temperature and streamflow daily actual evaporation and monthly potential evaporation with a spatial resolution of 8 km are obtained from the university of montana zhang et al 2010 the potential evaporation is estimated using the priestley taylor method priestley and taylor 1972 the actual evaporation estimated from remote sensing data is only used to select study catchments from the mopex dataset the bimonthly normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data was generated from the avhrr gimms tucker et al 2005 and used for representing vegetation coverage mean values of ndvi at the monthly scale are computed for all the study catchments and used for further analysis monthly values of precipitation potential evaporation mean daily minimum temperature and streamflow from 1983 to 2003 are used for quantifying the monthly variation of k and m 121 study catchments are selected based on the following criteria 1 there is no missing data during the entire 21 years 2 the relative water balance error i e p q e p 100 is in the range from 10 to 10 3 the monthly actual evaporation is less than or equal to the potential evaporation and 4 human interferences are minimum wang and hejazi 2011 the area of the selected catchments ranges from 67 km2 to 9806 km2 and the slope ranges from 2 5 to 25 6 climate aridity index ai is defined as the ratio of mean annual potential evaporation to precipitation catchments are considered humid when ai is less than 1 catchments with ai greater than 1 are considered temperate 1 ai 2 or arid ai 2 budyko 1974 petersen et al 2012 the co variability index is defined as the correlation between monthly precipitation and potential evaporation i e ci ρ p i e p i ci is used to describe the relationship between cycles of precipitation and energy availability and it ranges from 1 to 1 according to petersen et al 2012 precipitation and temperature cycles are out of phase in phase when ci 0 4 ci 0 4 as illustrated in fig 1 most of the study catchments are located in humid and temperate area and one is in the arid region arizona catchments located in midwest show a strong positive correlation between pi and ep i indicating that the precipitation and temperature cycles are coherent precipitation and potential evaporation are out of phase for two catchments in northwest precipitation is uniformly distributed in more than half of the catchments 4 results and discussion 4 1 model performance fig 2 presents the cumulative distribution of nse for the monthly water balance model with two parameter settings 1 time variant k and m and 2 constant k and m the results show that the model with time variant parameters outperforms the model with constant parameters for all the catchments 116 out of 121 catchments have nse values greater than 0 6 and are selected for further analysis in general catchments with nse greater than 0 8 are located predominantly in the wetter eastern and midwestern regions while the catchments with nse smaller than 0 8 are located predominantly in the great lakes regions and approximately 83 of them have normally distributed precipitation i e ci values range from 0 4 to 0 4 furthermore the nse difference δnse between the monthly water balance model with time variant and constant k and m is calculated to show the performance improvements achieved by considering time variant parameters in model simulation as seen in fig 3 the δ nse values range from 0 to 0 05 for 63 catchments from 0 05 to 0 1 for 46 catchments and are greater than 0 1 for 7 catchments the performance from the model with time variant parameters shows a more significant change in the midwest and mountain regions in the midwest the cropland is dominant wang and hejazi 2011 and it exerts significant control on evapotranspiration and further affects soil water content the treatment of time variant parameters k and m reflects the seasonal effect of vegetation thereby leading to higher nse values the ves for the 121 catchments are close or equal to one not shown suggesting that the runoff estimates meet the water balance condition 4 2 seasonal variation of k and m 4 2 1 seasonal variation of catchment properties vegetation and precipitation affect the seasonal water balance through both evaporation and water storage change to assess their impacts on parameters k and m the averaged values of ndvi and the fraction of rainy days are calculated for the 116 catchments the mean monthly ndvi for each catchment is calculated by 19 ndvi m 1 n i 1 n ndvi i m the fraction of rainy days α is computed from the daily precipitation data as the ratio between the number of days nr with a precipitation threshold and the total number of days in a month n the mean monthly α is 20 α m 1 n i 1 n α i m where n is the total years of the data series n 21 and m is month number m 1 2 12 4 2 2 modeling seasonal variation of parameters the pearson correlation coefficient r is computed to show the correlation between time variant model parameters and rainfall variability and vegetation various scenarios of fraction of rainy days including α 0 α 1 α 5 α 10 and α 15 corresponding to precipitation thresholds of 0 mm 1 mm 5 mm 10 mm and 15 mm are chosen to evaluate the impact of precipitation threshold on the temporal variability of parameters as shown in fig 4 most significant correlation exists when precipitation threshold is set to 1 mm absolute values of correlation coefficients between k m and α have an increasing trend with precipitation threshold varying from 0 to 1 mm and they show a slightly decreasing trend with the increase of precipitation threshold afterwards results indicate that time variant parameters k and m are significantly correlated with α 1 at a significance level of 5 the average p value for correlations between k m and α 1 is the smallest among these scenarios therefore the fraction of rainy days α 1 is used as one of the catchment indicators to explore the dependence of the time variant parameters on the precipitation variability fig 5 presents a box plot top panel comparison of the r between monthly parameters k and m and catchment indicators ndvi and α 1 for the 116 catchments with nse 0 6 the results show that parameter k has positive correlations with both ndvi and α 1 while negative correlations for parameter m are obtained although several outliers exist number of catchments with p 0 05 r 0 3 and r 0 5 are presented at the bottom panel of fig 5 results show that approximately one third of the catchments in each case have a statistically significant correlation between time variant parameters and catchment indicators at the 5 significance level the initial evaporation ratio k is the ratio of initial evaporation e 0 to total evaporation e e 0 may increase with ndvi since the increase of vegetation coverage could result in higher interception loss ndvi and α 1 provide more potential for the occurrence of the initial water loss from the perspective of the vegetation conditions and water supply i e rainfall respectively therefore parameter k which represents the initial evaporation ratio is positively correlated with ndvi and α 1 the equation of yt in the monthly water balance model i e eq 5 is a monotonically increasing function of the initial evaporation opportunity m the runoff will increase with the decreasing of yt since qt at yt indicating that smaller value of m leads to greater runoff when the other items are given soil with higher vegetation coverage i e higher ndvi usually retains more water than that with lower ndvi cheng et al 2007 i e higher potential for runoff generation during the month with higher ndvi therefore parameter m has a negative correlation with ndvi as mentioned in section 3 study catchments are mostly humid or temperate ai 2 except one catchment with ai 2 thus a higher value of rainfall frequency can indirectly reflect a relatively higher amount of water supply from precipitation which provides more chance for runoff generation i e parameter m has a negative correlation with α 1 according to the above results most of the time variant parameter estimates have significant correlations with vegetation and temporal variability of precipitation specifically 85 catchments have a relatively strong correlation between time variant k and the catchment properties and 104 catchments for parameter m the number of catchments for which parameter k is correlated with ndvi α 1 and both ndvi and α 1 is 26 9 and 50 respectively while the corresponding number of catchments for parameter m is 12 17 and 75 respectively note that it is considered to be a relatively strong correlation when the absolute value of r is higher than 0 3 hinkle et al 2003 number of catchments that satisfied this criterion are shown at the bottom panel of fig 5 the results show that more catchments have a relatively significant correlation between time variant parameters and both ndvi and α 1 when compared to the number of catchments that show the similar degree of r between time variant parameters and the single indicator both vegetation and precipitation variabilities have an impact on the temporal variation of model parameters k and m a simple linear correlation may not reflect the complex relationship between the variation of parameters and the individual factors especially it has an interaction between vegetation and precipitation however the results of the 116 catchments still show a significant correlation between time variant parameters and indicators providing a statistical validation of seasonality of parameters k and m as discussed in section 2 2 4 3 temporal scaling from ε to k and m in section 2 3 we discussed the temporal scaling of model parameters at the mean annual and monthly scales and the potential transferability across time scales fig 6 shows the scatter plots between ε and the average values and cv for k and m the correlation coefficient between ε and the average value of k and m is 0 6 and 0 61 respectively and the correlation coefficient between ε and the cv of k and m is 0 18 and 0 5 respectively these indicate that ε has significant correlations with average values of both k and m while the linear coefficient between ε and the cv of k is negligible the average value and cv represent the magnitude and the monthly variability of the parameters the strong correlations indicate the strong interdependence of parameters at monthly and mean annual scales and the correlations are due to the physical linkage of hydrologic processes at different time scales monthly parameters k and m are derived from ε by considering different hydrological variables i e water storage change and evaporation all the three parameters have the same definition namely the ratio between the initial value of a variable and its total value the positive correlations between annual and monthly parameters provide a validation of the parameter relationship at different time scales discussed in section 2 3 from the perspective of statistical analysis the empirical equations for the mean annual parameter ε are obtained by using the multiple linear regression based on the monthly time variant parameters k and m as shown in table 1 all the correlation coefficients are greater than 0 6 indicating that the estimated ε from the empirical equations has a relatively high correlation to the ε obtained from the observations directly by comparing the estimation of ε in scenarios 1 and 2 it has no significant improvement on performance when the function form contains the cv of time variant parameters in scenario 1 thus the empirical equations in scenario 2 are used for parameter downscaling fig 7 shows the comparison of the ε estimates from the observations and ε from the empirical equations in scenario 2 fig 8 illustrates the model performance of the monthly water balance model with parameters k and m downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε the results show that the nse of 34 catchments has values lower than zero indicating a bad performance on runoff simulation 25 catchments have good performance with nse 0 6 to thoroughly illustrate the performance of the model with time variant parameters two hydrological criteria i e the box cox transformed root mean square error trmse and the kling gupta efficiency kge for a detail review refer to wang et al 2017 and gupta et al 2009 are used to assess the model performance in low and high flows respectively fig 9 presents the comparison of nse obtained from the monthly water balance model under different parameter scenarios i e time variant k and m being downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua algorithm and constant parameters being calibrated through sce ua algorithm the results show that all the runoff simulations from model with time variant k and m being downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε has lower nses than these from model with time variant k and m which are calibrated through sce ua along with lower kges and higher trmses however model performance of 4 catchments under the former scenario has similar nse trans nse fixed nse fixed 5 or higher nses than those of the model with constant parameters in addition the model with time variant k and m has higher nses and kges but lower trmses than those from the model with constant parameters calibrated through the sce ua algorithm indicating the former significantly outperforms the latter in the entire runoff series high and low flows two main systematic errors have impacts on the model performance during the temporal scaling process of parameters firstly it is the error from the empirical equations between ε and parameters k and m even the ε from the empirical equations has a high correlation coefficients in general the estimated ε for some catchments are away from the 45 degree line as shown in fig 7 the other error is from the allocation of the summation of monthly k and m using the ndvi as ratios after computing the summation of monthly k and m by the empirical equations in scenario 1 ndvi is then used as the ratio for the calculation of monthly parameters since ndvi is one of the factors controlling monthly variation of parameters uncertainty exists for using ndvi to disaggregate k and m for the other two scenarios the model parameters are calibrated through the sce ua algorithm the optimal parameters are obtained based on the objective function that aims to match the runoff observations therefore the monthly water balance model with time variant k and m being calibrated through sce ua has better runoff simulations than the model with parameters k and m estimated from the mean annual parameter ε the mean annual parameter can be successfully downscaled to monthly time variant parameters k and m even though uncertainty exists in the disaggregation process generally the proposed method is feasible to downscale the mean annual parameter to the monthly time variant parameters providing impetus for developing monthly model at ungagged basins where monthly runoff observations are not available potential improvements for the proposed downscaling approach could be achieved by identifying more accurate equations to describe the relationship between the mean annual parameter and monthly time variant parameters such as analytical solutions from the model equations 5 conclusions the seasonality of parameters on a monthly water balance model and their dependence on vegetation and rainfall variability have been analyzed in this paper afterwards we explored the temporal scaling of parameters based on monthly and mean annual water balance models with a common model concept conclusions can be drawn as follows 1 the seasonality of parameters k and m is closely related to the temporal variation of the catchment properties i e ndvi and rainfall frequency α 1 specifically parameter k is positively correlated to ndvi or α 1 while inverse correlation is obtained between parameter m and ndvi or α 1 2 the temporal scaling of model parameters between mean annual and monthly time scales is quantified and results demonstrate that the monthly time variant parameters k and m can be successfully downscaled from the mean annual parameter ε 3 the monthly water balance model with time variant parameters can provide improvements on monthly runoff simulations this research provides one possible approach to estimate the monthly time variant

7456,the source region of the yellow river sryr is greatly important for water resources throughout the entire yellow river basin streamflow in the sryr has experienced great changes over the past few decades which is closely related to the frozen ground degradation however the extent of this influence is still unclear in this study the air freezing index ddfa is selected as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation a water energy balance equation within the budyko framework is employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change which manifests as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation which can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change the results show that the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 55 and 33 respectively of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr from period 1 1965 1989 to period 2 1990 2003 in the permafrost dominated region upstream of the jimai hydrological station the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 71 of the streamflow decrease from period 2 1990 2003 to period 3 2004 2015 the observed streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation this could be attributed to the combined effects of increasing potential evapotranspiration and more importantly frozen ground degradation frozen ground degradation could influence streamflow by increasing the groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in permafrost dominated regions these findings will help develop a better understanding of the impact of frozen ground degradation on water resources in the tibetan plateau keywords streamflow change frozen ground degradation budyko framework source region of the yellow river tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp also known as the third pole of the globe has the largest area of alpine permafrost in the world qiu 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 cuo et al 2015 almost all of the tp is underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground because of its high elevation guo and wang 2013 the tp contains the headwaters of several major asian rivers including the yellow river yangtze river and brahmaputra river and these rivers provide water for more than 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 however due to limited observations and the complicated interactions between hydrological and cryospheric processes the responses of streamflow and other eco hydrological variables to climate change and the consequent cryospheric changes in the tp are not well understood which has aroused wide concern recently cao et al 2006 immerzeel et al 2010 kang et al 2010 yang et al 2011 qiu 2012 yi et al 2014 cuo et al 2015 qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b qin et al 2017 the source region of the yellow river sryr upstream of the tangnaihai hydrological station is located in the northeastern tp and provides 34 8 of the total water resources of the yellow river hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 qin et al 2017 several studies have reported the degradation of frozen ground in the sryr including an upward shift in the permafrost lower limit shifts in the permafrost boundary and a decrease in the maximum frozen depth jin et al 2009 fang et al 2011 frozen ground degradation can influence soil infiltration and drainage enhance groundwater surface water interaction and increase the baseflow in many cold regions walvoord and kurylyk 2016 bense et al 2012 suggested a large increase in groundwater discharge to streams in response to permafrost degradation based on numerical simulations for several arctic rivers applying gray relational analysis to the upper heihe river basin northeastern tp qin et al 2016 found that the annual maximum frozen depth was one of the major factors on increases in the baseflow during the cold season cuo et al 2015 discovered that precipitation changes and frozen ground degradation enhanced the surface hydrological processes in the northern tp based on variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations frozen ground degradation was also found to be associated with a slowdown in winter recession and the flattening of intra annual streamflow in the sryr niu et al 2016 qin et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in northeastern china duan et al 2017a and in arctic rivers lyon and destouni 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the influence of frozen ground degradation on annual streamflow however is not consistent among different regions to the best of our knowledge few quantitative analyses have been employed to investigate the impacts of frozen ground degradation on streamflow in the tp and the mechanism of the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation is still unclear recently duan et al 2017b quantified the streamflow response to permafrost degradation based on the assumption that an increase in the active layer thickness would increase the annual streamflow in northeastern china however many researchers hypothesized that permafrost degradation would decrease the streamflow in the tp by lowering the groundwater table cheng and wu 2007 jin et al 2009 yang et al 2010 and enlarging the water storage capacity via an increased thawing depth niu et al 2016 this is different from the hypothesis provided by duan et al 2017b and different from the situation observed for arctic rivers qiu 2012 because of the inconsistency in the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation among different regions this study does not initially assume whether frozen ground degradation will increase or decrease streamflow instead this study employs the budyko framework to quantify the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function of the available water and energy the budyko framework has been applied to reflect the impacts of changes in dynamic landscape factors including vegetation cover potter and zhang 2009 donohue et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a human activities xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 ning et al 2017 and snowfall fraction berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 barnhart et al 2016 on annual streamflow however the budyko framework has not yet been extended to quantify the impacts of frozen ground degradation a number of previous studies identified a decrease in streamflow in the sryr during the 1990s cao et al 2006 zheng et al 2007 consequently numerous attempts have been made to understand the causes of such streamflow variations hu et al 2011 found that the correlation coefficients between the annual precipitation and annual streamflow increase from upstream to downstream and that a decrease in streamflow can be associated with decreasing wet season precipitation and rising temperatures utilizing sensitivity based methods zheng et al 2009 and zhao et al 2009 estimated that climate change manifesting as variations in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration contributed to 30 of the streamflow reduction at the tangnaihai station in the 1990s they further attributed the other 70 of the streamflow reduction to land use changes and human activities by employing the vic model in the sryr cuo et al 2015 discovered a deviation between observed streamflow and vic simulated streamflow values using a static land use map and they found that the land use induced deviation expanded during 1960 2000 streamflow changes that cannot be directly explained by climate factors may also arise from cryospheric changes such as frozen ground degradation cheng and wu 2007 cuo et al 2015 and variations in the snowfall fraction of the total precipitation berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 where further investigations are needed recent studies have found that the streamflow trend reversed from decreasing to increasing since the 2000s due to the increasing precipitation however the streamflow did not recover as much as precipitation meng et al 2016 meng et al 2016 attributed all of the streamflow changes in the 2000s to evapotranspiration changes based on the vic model meanwhile xu et al 2013 highlighted the importance of the increase in the water storage detected by gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite since 2003 cuo et al 2015 claimed that the three rivers source region reserve project which was launched in 2003 also played a role in the observed streamflow changes such ecological projects have already produced positive effects on grassland restoration on the tp xu et al 2016 and reduced the growing season water yield due to increased evapotranspiration and soil water retention in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2017 the impacts of ecological projects on annual streamflow in the sryr however have rarely been analyzed in summary previous studies used sensitivity based methods or process based models to analyze the possible reasons for streamflow changes in the sryr zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 cuo et al 2015 however most of these studies included only one change point close to the year 1990 and they did not explain the observed increase in streamflow since the 2000s while the impacts of frozen ground degradation on streamflow changes were conceptualized in previous investigations few quantitative analyses have been performed and thus the underlying mechanisms are still unclear therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 understand the long term streamflow changes over the past 50 years in the sryr 2 develop a decomposition approach within the budyko framework to analyze the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation and 3 use the extended budyko framework to quantify the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the sryr is located in the transitional zone of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost in the northeastern tp jin et al 2009 in this study the sryr refers to the upstream catchment above the tangnaihai hydrological station the sryr covers an area of 122 000 km2 that accounts for 16 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 35 of the total runoff of the yellow river hu et al 2011 the elevation of the sryr ranges from 2656 m to 6350 m fig 1 and decreases from the southwest to the northeast the zoige wetland which is located in the southeastern sryr is one of the largest alpine wetlands in the tp and it is dominated by helophyte species zhang et al 2016b 2 2 data digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 daily mean air temperature wind speed daily average relative humidity and sunshine hour data from the 22 meteorological stations fig 1 located within and around the sryr were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 was utilized to produce 1 km gridded datasets on a daily basis the gridded precipitation data were spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the climatology based optimal method proposed by shen and xiong 2016 the fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs was estimated using a single temperature threshold method if the daily mean air temperature is lower than 1 c then the daily precipitation is considered to be entirely snowfall and vice versa sato et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 berghuijs et al 2014 to minimize the effects of carry over storage of snowfall all of the annual values used in this study are from 1 september to 31 august as a hydrologic year the multi year average snowfall fraction fs is 0 19 for the sryr table 1 which is similar to other estimates in this region sato et al 2008 hu et al 2011 the daily potential evapotranspiration e0 was calculated based on the penman equation as recommended by shuttleworth 1993 details regarding the equations and procedures used to calculate e0 can be found in yang et al 2007 and zhang et al 2015 the leaf area index lai3g dataset and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation fpar3g dataset both of which were derived from the 3rd generation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi3g of the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms zhu et al 2013 were adopted in this study the lai3g and fpar3g datasets both have a 15 day temporal resolution and a 1 12 0 0833 spatial resolution and they are available from july 1981 to december 2011 monthly streamflow data from the jimai maqu and tangnaihai hydrological stations are available during 1965 2015 in this study the sryr is divided into 3 sub regions according to the locations of the 3 hydrological stations 1 the region upstream of jimai jm 2 the region between jimai and maqu jm mq and 3 the region between maqu and tangnaihai mq tnh see figs 1 and 2 to obtain the runoff depths in jm mq and mq tnh the runoff volume at the upper stream station was subtracted from the runoff volume at the lower stream station and the resulting difference was then divided by the area of the sub region between the two stations according to the map of permafrost on the qinghai tibetan plateau 1 3 000 000 scale complied by the institute of geographic science chinese academy of sciences igs cas ran et al 2012 fig 2 jm has the largest proportion of permafrost 63 0 while jm mq has the smallest proportion of permafrost 8 7 table 1 the multi year average climatic hydrologic and vegetation characteristics and the permafrost information for the 3 sub regions and the entire sryr are shown in table 1 jm represents a permafrost dominated area while jm mq and mq tnh represent seasonally frozen ground dominated areas of which jm mq has a denser vegetation cover this study adopts two evapotranspiration et products fig 3 to investigate the possible mechanism of the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow the first et product is the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam a global dataset with a 0 25 resolution spanning 1980 2016 that uses a priestley taylor approach to calculate e0 and integrates point wise et observations at fluxnet sites with reanalysis data and satellite based information miralles et al 2014 zhang et al 2016c the second et product was calculated using a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm that was specifically calibrated and calculated for the sryr with a 3 km resolution during 1981 2011 qin et al 2017 gbehm is a distributed hydrological model that can be used for the simulation of hydrological processes in cold regions gao et al 2016 the transpiration rate in gbehm is calculated using the same algorithm as the sib2 model and fpar data are used in the transpiration calculation more details can be found in gao et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 the annual et anomaly series derived from gleam and gbehm in the sryr show similar inter annual variabilities with a correlation coefficient r of 0 61 fig 3 the annual water storage change δs derived from these two et products are also compared with the grace derived water storage change δ s grace the annual et derived from either gleam or gbehm can then be used to obtain δs by utilizing the water balance equation 1a δ s gleam i p gleam i q i et gleam i 1b δ s gbehm i p gbehm i q i et gbehm i where p i and q i represent the annual precipitation and streamflow in the hydrologic year i p i is different between the two products since gleam uses the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset for its precipitation forcing beck et al 2017 while gbehm adopts gridded precipitation data spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the method proposed by shen and xiong 2016 terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data derived using grace satellite data from the center for space research csr for 2002 2015 were downloaded with a resolution of 1 landerer and swenson 2012 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the twsa time series for the sryr were derived using an area weighting method and filtered using a 3 month moving average method xu et al 2013 the value of δ s grace during the hydrologic year i which starts in september can be estimated as follows xu et al 2013 2 δ s grace i twsa september i 1 twsa september i fig 3 shows that the δs time series derived from gleam δ s gleam gbehm δ s gbehm and grace δ s grace are similar with regard to their amplitudes and annual fluctuations indicating that these et products are reliable in the sryr 3 methods 3 1 attribution analysis within the budyko framework water storage changes generally cannot be ignored at the annual scale i e δ s i 0 and thus the water balance equation is expressed as follows 3 q p et δ s where q p et and δ s respectively represent the observed annual streamflow precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water storage change unit mm the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function of the available water and energy and it assumes that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is a function of the aridity index ϕ e 0 p 4 et p f ϕ different forms of f ϕ have been proposed under the budyko framework schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 budyko 1974 fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015b based on dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning yang et al 2008 derived the water energy balance equation analytically which is expressed as eq 5 and is known as the choudhury yang equation 5a et budyko pe 0 p n e 0 n 1 n 5b f ϕ ϕ n 1 1 n where the annual precipitation p and annual e0 respectively represent the available water and the available energy and the parameter n represents the catchment characteristics which are mainly related to properties of the soil topography and vegetation yang et al 2007 zhou et al 2015a zhang et al 2016a if the annual et and q are determined only by climate factors they should be exactly the same as their corresponding budyko estimated values ignoring δs the streamflow estimated using the budyko curve should be as follows 6 q budyko f p e 0 n p et budyko p pe 0 p n e 0 n 1 n we assume that the long term average of the observed annual streamflow is equal to the budyko based estimated streamflow thus by using long term averages of the observed annual streamflow precipitation and e0 the catchment parameter n can be calculated at the annual scale however a deviation exists between the observed annual q and qbudyko eq 3 can be rewritten as follows 7 q p et budyko et dev δ s p et budyko et dev δ s q budyko q dev where q dev is the deviation of the observed annual q from qbudyko q dev q q budyko qdev includes two components q dev et dev δ s the deviation of et from the budyko estimated et et dev et et budyko and the water storage change δ s it is caused by the landscape factors including frozen ground and vegetation and can be written as a function of these factors frozen ground measurements are rare and are usually restricted to point scale estimates in frozen ground regions therefore the air freezing index ddfa is selected as the indicator for frozen ground degradation in this study and it is calculated using the following equation frauenfeld et al 2007 8 ddf a j 1 n f t j t j 0 c where n f is the number of days with an air temperature below 0 c in a given hydrologic year j 1 2 n f and t j is the daily mean air temperature c on a specific day j more details about the selection of ddfa as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation will be discussed in section 5 1 if we assume that ddfa is independent of other landscape factors we have the following equation 9 q dev g ddf a h other landscape factors the shape of g ddf a reflects the relationship between frozen ground and streamflow and it is fitted using 5 year sequential averages of q dev and ddfa in this study yang et al 2016 for each variable ten samples of the 5 year means are yielded during 1965 2014 i e 1965 1969 1970 1974 2010 2014 from eq 7 the long term streamflow change between two periods δ q can be attributed to the direct impact of climate change δ q c and the impact of landscape change δ q l 10 δ q δ q budyko δ q dev δ q c δ q l if we set the parameter n in eq 5 time invariant in a certain region then δ q budyko δ q c and all the landscape induced streamflow change are remained in δ q dev thus δ q dev δ q l the climate contribution to streamflow changes can be estimated via the climate elasticity method zheng et al 2009 wang and hejazi 2011 yang and yang 2011 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 the precipitation elasticity of streamflow ε p is defined as ε p dq q dp p and the potential evapotranspiration elasticity of streamflow ε e 0 is defined as ε e 0 dq q de 0 e 0 thus the climate induced streamflow change δ q c can be estimated by 11 δ q c δ q p δ q e 0 ε p δ p p q ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 q following the derivation process described by arora 2002 the climate elasticity of streamflow i e ε p and ε e 0 can be expressed as follows 12a ε e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ 12b ε p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ combining eq 12 with the choudhury yang equation shown in eq 5b the climate elasticity of streamflow can be calculated by the long term aridity index ϕ climate induced streamflow change δ q c can be obtained using eq 12 and the remaining term is attributed to landscape change δ q 1 the landscape induced streamflow change δ q l can be further attributed to frozen ground degradation δ q f and land use changes δ q lu 13 δ q l δ q f δ q lu the streamflow change caused by frozen ground degradation δ q f can be calculated by eq 14 and the remaining term is attributed to land use changes δ q lu 14 δ q f δ g ddf a g ddf a 2 g ddf a 1 where ddf a 1 and ddf a 2 are the mean air freezing indices during two different periods in this study climate induced streamflow change δ q c represents the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in both precipitation and e0 while the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow δ q f can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change 3 2 change point and trend detection in this study the moving t test was adopted to detect change points within the streamflow time series the t test assesses whether the means of two subsamples are significantly different from one another the formula for the t test is as follows zheng et al 2007 yin et al 2015 15 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 16 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x i s and ni are the mean standard deviation and size of the two independent samples i 1 2 the t test has n 1 n 2 2 degrees of freedom the moving t test applies the t test to a subseries with a fixed length n before and after the potential change points n n 1 n 2 if the calculated t value is larger than the critical value t α then the point is accepted as a change point at the significance level α in this study n 10 and α 0 05 and thus the critical value is t α 2 1 the mann kendall nonparametric test is applied in this study to detect the significance of a trend in the long term time series yang et al 2004 and a significance level of 0 05 is chosen for all trend analyses in this study 4 results 4 1 long term streamflow variations the long term inter annual streamflow and precipitation variabilities are shown in fig 4 the annual streamflow in all sub regions of the sryr showed decreasing trends during 1965 2015 and the decreasing trend in jm mq was significant at the 0 05 significance level 12 26 mm 10a table 2 in contrast the annual precipitation among all of the sub regions of the sryr showed increasing trends during 1965 2015 except for jm mq where the annual precipitation decreased slightly 1 04 mm 10a for the entire sryr the annual streamflow showed an insignificant decreasing trend 6 51 mm 10a during 1965 2015 in contrast to an insignificant annual precipitation increasing trend 6 48 mm 10a resulting in a significant decrease in the runoff ratio 0 01 10a over the past 50 years at the 0 05 significance level table 2 two abrupt change points in the annual streamflow in the sryr were detected using the moving t test which were respectively 1989 and 2003 fig 5 thus the past 50 years can be divided into 3 periods period 1 p1 1965 1989 period 2 p2 1990 2003 and period 3 p3 2004 2015 the abrupt change points of the annual streamflow are similar to the change points of the annual precipitation fig 5 during p1 the streamflow and precipitation among all of the sub regions fluctuated around the multi year average and increased insignificantly at the 0 05 significance level fig 4 while during p2 nearly all of the sub regions experienced a decrease in both streamflow and precipitation and the streamflow decreasing rate 22 47 mm 10a was larger than precipitation decreasing rate 9 68 mm 10a the mean annual streamflow and precipitation values during the three periods are also indicated in fig 4 the decrease in the annual streamflow value between p1 and p2 was larger than the decrease in the annual precipitation except within mq tnh during p3 the annual precipitation trends in all of the sub regions except mq tnh reversed and started to increase and the annual streamflow throughout the entire sryr also increased slightly 2 67 mm 10a table 2 the precipitation in all of the sryr sub regions during p3 exceeded their multi year averages however the streamflow in all of these sub regions during p3 did not recover as much as the precipitation instead the streamflow returned only approximately to the multi year average value in p3 and was even lower than the average value in p1 fig 4 the runoff ratio exhibited the most rapid decrease during p2 0 04 10a during which time the mean annual air temperature increased by 0 98 c 10a throughout the entire sryr table 2 4 2 decomposition into climate and landscape induced streamflow changes the values of the catchment parameter n precipitation elasticity of streamflow ε p and potential evapotranspiration elasticity of streamflow ε e 0 are shown in table 3 the results show that the streamflow in permafrost dominated jm is more sensitive to climate factors compared with the other two sub regions the values of the climate elasticity of streamflow were ε p 2 20 and ε e 0 1 20 which means that a 10 increase in either the precipitation or e0 will result in a 22 increase or a 12 decrease in streamflow at jm respectively attribution analysis of the streamflow changes between different periods was conducted based on the climate elasticity table 4 from p1 to p2 the direct impact of climate change can explain only 55 0 of the streamflow decrease while landscape changes can explain another 45 0 of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr the direct impact of climate change can explain only 21 3 of the streamflow decrease in the permafrost dominated jm and 69 5 of the streamflow decrease in the seasonally frozen ground dominated mq tnh meanwhile 78 7 and 30 5 of the streamflow decreases in jm and mq tnh were caused by landscape changes which is similar to the results of previous studies zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 from p2 to p3 the 83 7 mm increase in precipitation for the entire sryr caused a 48 1 mm increase in streamflow while the increase in e0 led to a 5 1 mm decrease in streamflow therefore the climate induced increase in streamflow δ q c was 43 0 mm but the observed streamflow only increased by 34 1 mm table 4 this indicates that landscape changes had a negative effect on streamflow δ q l 0 which was true for all of the sub regions of the sryr and for both p1 p2 and p2 p3 the streamflow decrease caused by landscape factors was 21 1 mm from p1 to p2 and 8 9 mm from p2 to p3 for the entire sryr 4 3 streamflow response to frozen ground degradation the shape of g ddf a in eq 9 reflects the relationship between frozen ground and streamflow from the scatter plots of the 5 year sequential average of q dev vs that of ddfa shown in fig 6 the relationship between q dev and ddfa can be described using a power function 17 g ddf a a ddf a b c d e the values of the parameters a b c d and e were determined via a least squares method and the fitted equations are labeled in fig 6 the values of the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 38 to 0 63 for the three sub regions and 0 72 for the entire sryr indicating that the fitted power function curves are effective for reflecting the relationship between streamflow and frozen ground in the sryr combining the equations of g ddf a and eq 14 table 4 can be extended into table 5 which further decomposes landscape induced streamflow changes δ q l into the parts attributed to frozen ground degradation δ q f and land use change δ q lu the impacts of climate change and frozen ground degradation can explain almost all of the streamflow changes in the sryr since the values of δ q c δ q f δ q are close to 100 table 5 the results show that from p1 to p2 frozen ground degradation manifesting as a decrease in ddfa can explain 70 7 of the streamflow decrease in the permafrost dominated jm and more than 20 of the streamflow decrease in the seasonally frozen ground dominated jm mq and mq tnh for the entire sryr frozen ground degradation caused a 15 3 mm decrease in the annual streamflow accounting for 32 6 of the total streamflow decrease the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 6 of the streamflow change from p1 to p2 land use changes resulted in a 12 4 decrease in streamflow for the entire sryr from p1 to p2 that can be attributed to the combined effects of a decrease in grasslands and increases in cultivated land forest and water bodies table 6 while from p2 to p3 the streamflow is projected to increase by 48 1 mm only considering the effects of precipitation δqp 48 1 mm for the entire sryr while the observed annual streamflow only increased by 34 1 mm δq 34 1 mm the difference can be attributed to the effects of increasing e0 δ q e 0 5 1 mm and more importantly the frozen ground degradation δqf 13 1 mm tables 4 and 5 the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 5 of the streamflow change from p2 to p3 the values of δ q lu from p2 to p3 were positive and close to zero which might be related to a decrease in cultivated land area as well as to the establishment of the three rivers source region reserve in 2003 cuo et al 2015 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 selection of air freezing index as the indicator of frozen ground degradation frozen ground observation is much more difficult than the meteorological observation hence the frozen ground observations are very rare therefore the air freezing index ddfa and thawing index ddta are often used to map the permafrost distribution and predict the ground freeze thaw state at large scale frauenfeld et al 2007 in this study we choose the air freezing index ddfa to represent the degree of frozen ground degradation the degree of frozen ground degradation is co determined by multiple variables including air temperature and other factors as demonstrated by the stefan equation peng et al 2017 18 mtsfg 2 λ f n f l ρ l θ f ddf a where mtsfg is the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground representing the maximum depth from the ground surface to the freezing front in a freezing season ddfa is the air freezing index over a hydrologic year c day λf is the thermal conductivity of frozen soil nf is the freezing n factor which corresponds to the ratio between ground surface and air freezing index and relates to land surface conditions klene et al 2001 l is the latent heat of fusion 3 34 105 j kg 1 ρl is the density of liquid water 1 00 103 kg m 3 θf is the volumetric liquid water content before soil freezing by analyzing freezing depth data across china peng et al 2017 found that ddfa could account for more than 90 of the variability in mtsfg while no correlation was found between mtsfg and the snow depth due to limited data and relatively stable soil and land surface properties relative to climate forcing a simplified stefan equation has been adopted by many studies wang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 peng et al 2017 19 mtsfg e ddf a where e is an edaphic parameter representing all of the factors other than ddfa that influence the freezing depth the value of e is relatively steady at a certain location and variations in ddfa can represent the inter annual variability in frozen ground degradation to illustrate the validity of utilizing ddfa to represent the degree of frozen ground degradation in the study area long term observations of the soil freezing depth at 10 stations in the sryr during 1967 2015 were obtained from the cma a strong correlation between mtsfg and ddf a with a mean correlation coefficient r value of 0 64 was observed among the 10 stations in the sryr fig s1 the degree of frozen ground degradation is directly determined by the soil temperature therefore we calculate the ground freezing index ddfg using observations of the ground surface 0 cm temperature and the soil temperature at depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 80 cm at the 10 stations by summing up all of the daily temperatures lower than 0 c in a given hydrologic year ddfa and ddfg decreased significantly over the past few decades and the inter annual variabilities in ddfa and ddfg showed a similar pattern fig s2 the value of r between ddfg at different depths and ddfa generally decreased with an increase in the soil depth and most of the corresponding r values are larger than 0 6 fig s3 except at the maqu zoige and hongyuan stations where the mtsfg values are relatively small 100 cm these results show that ddfa perform effectively as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation in the sryr in addition to ddfa ddta is also commonly used as an indicator for estimating the degree of frozen ground degradation frauenfeld et al 2007 duan et al 2017a we also calculate ddta by summing up all of the daily temperatures higher than 0 c in a given hydrologic year then eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 20 q dev l ddt a h other landscape factors the shape of l ddta which also reflects the relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow was fitted using a 5 year sequential average and ddfa from the scatter plots of the 5 year sequential average of qdev vs that of ddta fig s4 the relationship between qdev and ddta can also be described with a similar power function 21 l ddt a a b ddt a c d e the values of the parameters a b c d and e were determined via a least squares method and the fitted equations are labeled in fig s4 from the newly derived function l ddta we can calculate the streamflow change caused by the frozen ground degradation δqf using the following equation 22 δ q f δ l ddt a l ddt a 2 l ddt a 1 using ddta for different periods i e ddta 1 and ddta 2 we can obtain the streamflow change caused by the frozen ground degradation δqf and the corresponding results table s1 the values of δqf changed only slightly compared with the previous results acquired by selecting ddfa as the indicator as is shown in table 5 therefore the relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow does not rely much on the choice of the frozen ground index hence the results derived from the proposed method within the budyko framework are reasonable and the method is robust 5 2 impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow the budyko framework adopted in this study is used for quantifying the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation which strictly speaking could be regarded as an indirect impact of climate change we assume that ddfa is independent of other landscape factors and we consequently obtain eq 9 to distinguish the impact of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow there are many landscape factors that could cause the deviations between the observed and budyko estimated streamflow values zhang et al 2016a frozen ground and vegetation in the sryr have experienced great changes over the past few decades and they might represent the most prominent landscape factors influencing streamflow therefore we tested the relationship between ddfa and the lai and we did not find a significant correlation based on the results obtained in this study the direct impact of climate change can explain only 21 3 of the streamflow decrease in jm from period 1 1965 1989 to period 2 1990 2003 which is similar to the results of previous studies in the study area zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 furthermore this study provides an explicit non linear relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow changes in the sryr fig 6 and quantifies the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation table 5 the negative correlation between q dev and ddfa supports the hypothesis that frozen ground degradation decreases streamflow in the tp cheng and wu 2007 jin et al 2009 yang et al 2010 as frozen ground degrades the state point of ddfa q dev in fig 6 moves from the upper right to the lower left along the fitted curves frozen ground degradation decreases streamflow in the sryr but this decreasing effect gradually diminishes with the degradation stage this deceleration was more obvious in the permafrost dominated jm and it initiated in 1995 when ddfa dropped below 2100 c day since 1995 the air temperature has abruptly increased by 0 63 c 10a as stated in duan et al 2017b the resulting increase in the active layer thickness and the thawing of permafrost might have contributed to the annual streamflow and caused the diminished decreasing effects of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow after quantifying the impacts of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow the possible mechanisms of those impacts are discussed as follows since q dev reflects the deviation between the observed and budyko estimated annual streamflow qdev q qbudyko caused by landscape factors including the frozen ground it can be further decomposed into water storage changes δ s and deviations between the actual and budyko estimated et etdev et etbudyko eq 7 q dev et dev δ s the calculation of q dev does not rely on the values of actual et while the decomposition of q dev relies on the values of actual et two different et products i e gleam and gbehm are adopted in this study and they use different precipitation forcings a comparison between those forcings can be found in fig s5 to investigate the different mechanisms between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground dominated regions this section divides the entire sryr into the permafrost dominated region upstream of jimai station jm with 63 0 area underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground dominated region between jimai and tangnaihai station jm tnh with only 17 3 area underlain by permafrost the decadal changes in q dev and its two components δ s and et dev during 1981 2010 in the sryr are shown in fig 7 the decadal changes in ddfa and the mean annual lai are also shown in fig 7 the median values of q dev that represent the deviation between the observed and budyko estimated q qdev q qbudyko continued to decrease and became less than zero in the 2000s in both regions indicating that landscape factors caused the streamflow to become lower than the budyko based estimates during the 2000s this phenomenon was caused by an increase in δ s rather than an increase in et dev which holds for both gleam and gbehm and it may have been related to the rapid decrease in ddfa from the 1990s to the 2000s fig 7 an increase in δ s within the sryr subsequent to 2002 was also found using grace data especially in those areas underlain by permafrost xu et al 2013 these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that permafrost degradation decreases streamflow by enlarging the water storage capacity with an increasing active layer thickness niu et al 2016 and that permafrost may even degrade into seasonally frozen ground and cause more water to percolate into deep aquifers thereby increasing the groundwater storage qin et al 2017 an increase in the active layer thickness and the thawing of permafrost might have contributed to the annual streamflow since the 2000s however the increase in δ s exerted a greater impact on streamflow which could have counteracted the increase in streamflow and caused the streamflow to decrease these combined changes ultimately resulted in a diminished decreasing impact of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow as is shown in fig 6 6 conclusions in this study long term streamflow variations in the source region of the yellow river sryr were analyzed and attribution analysis within the budyko framework was employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change the impact of frozen ground degradation and land use change according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the past 50 years can be divided into 3 sub periods period 1 p1 1965 1989 period 2 p2 1990 2003 and period 3 p3 2004 2015 for the entire sryr the annual streamflow showed an insignificant decreasing trend 6 51 mm 10a during 1965 2015 in contrast to the insignificant increasing annual precipitation trend 6 48 mm 10a at the 0 05 significance level 2 from p1 to p2 the direct impact of climate change can explain only 55 0 of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr frozen ground degradation can explain an additional 32 6 of the streamflow decrease in the sryr during the same period in the permafrost dominated region upstream of the jimai hydrological station frozen ground degradation can explain 70 7 of the observed streamflow decrease 3 from p2 to p3 the streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation this disparity could be attributable to the combined effects of an increasing potential evapotranspiration δ qe 0 5 1 mm and more importantly to frozen ground degradation δqf 13 1 mm the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 5 of the streamflow change from p2 to p3 for the entire sryr 4 frozen ground degradation could reduce streamflow by increasing groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in a permafrost region the methods developed in this study can be used in other catchments as well to help develop a better understanding of the impacts of frozen ground degradation on water resources in

7456,the source region of the yellow river sryr is greatly important for water resources throughout the entire yellow river basin streamflow in the sryr has experienced great changes over the past few decades which is closely related to the frozen ground degradation however the extent of this influence is still unclear in this study the air freezing index ddfa is selected as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation a water energy balance equation within the budyko framework is employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change which manifests as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation which can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change the results show that the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 55 and 33 respectively of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr from period 1 1965 1989 to period 2 1990 2003 in the permafrost dominated region upstream of the jimai hydrological station the impact of frozen ground degradation can explain 71 of the streamflow decrease from period 2 1990 2003 to period 3 2004 2015 the observed streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation this could be attributed to the combined effects of increasing potential evapotranspiration and more importantly frozen ground degradation frozen ground degradation could influence streamflow by increasing the groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in permafrost dominated regions these findings will help develop a better understanding of the impact of frozen ground degradation on water resources in the tibetan plateau keywords streamflow change frozen ground degradation budyko framework source region of the yellow river tibetan plateau 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp also known as the third pole of the globe has the largest area of alpine permafrost in the world qiu 2008 immerzeel et al 2010 cuo et al 2015 almost all of the tp is underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground because of its high elevation guo and wang 2013 the tp contains the headwaters of several major asian rivers including the yellow river yangtze river and brahmaputra river and these rivers provide water for more than 1 4 billion people immerzeel et al 2010 however due to limited observations and the complicated interactions between hydrological and cryospheric processes the responses of streamflow and other eco hydrological variables to climate change and the consequent cryospheric changes in the tp are not well understood which has aroused wide concern recently cao et al 2006 immerzeel et al 2010 kang et al 2010 yang et al 2011 qiu 2012 yi et al 2014 cuo et al 2015 qin et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b qin et al 2017 the source region of the yellow river sryr upstream of the tangnaihai hydrological station is located in the northeastern tp and provides 34 8 of the total water resources of the yellow river hu et al 2011 yuan et al 2015 qin et al 2017 several studies have reported the degradation of frozen ground in the sryr including an upward shift in the permafrost lower limit shifts in the permafrost boundary and a decrease in the maximum frozen depth jin et al 2009 fang et al 2011 frozen ground degradation can influence soil infiltration and drainage enhance groundwater surface water interaction and increase the baseflow in many cold regions walvoord and kurylyk 2016 bense et al 2012 suggested a large increase in groundwater discharge to streams in response to permafrost degradation based on numerical simulations for several arctic rivers applying gray relational analysis to the upper heihe river basin northeastern tp qin et al 2016 found that the annual maximum frozen depth was one of the major factors on increases in the baseflow during the cold season cuo et al 2015 discovered that precipitation changes and frozen ground degradation enhanced the surface hydrological processes in the northern tp based on variable infiltration capacity vic model simulations frozen ground degradation was also found to be associated with a slowdown in winter recession and the flattening of intra annual streamflow in the sryr niu et al 2016 qin et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in northeastern china duan et al 2017a and in arctic rivers lyon and destouni 2010 walvoord and kurylyk 2016 the influence of frozen ground degradation on annual streamflow however is not consistent among different regions to the best of our knowledge few quantitative analyses have been employed to investigate the impacts of frozen ground degradation on streamflow in the tp and the mechanism of the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation is still unclear recently duan et al 2017b quantified the streamflow response to permafrost degradation based on the assumption that an increase in the active layer thickness would increase the annual streamflow in northeastern china however many researchers hypothesized that permafrost degradation would decrease the streamflow in the tp by lowering the groundwater table cheng and wu 2007 jin et al 2009 yang et al 2010 and enlarging the water storage capacity via an increased thawing depth niu et al 2016 this is different from the hypothesis provided by duan et al 2017b and different from the situation observed for arctic rivers qiu 2012 because of the inconsistency in the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation among different regions this study does not initially assume whether frozen ground degradation will increase or decrease streamflow instead this study employs the budyko framework to quantify the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function of the available water and energy the budyko framework has been applied to reflect the impacts of changes in dynamic landscape factors including vegetation cover potter and zhang 2009 donohue et al 2010 zhang et al 2016a human activities xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 ning et al 2017 and snowfall fraction berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 barnhart et al 2016 on annual streamflow however the budyko framework has not yet been extended to quantify the impacts of frozen ground degradation a number of previous studies identified a decrease in streamflow in the sryr during the 1990s cao et al 2006 zheng et al 2007 consequently numerous attempts have been made to understand the causes of such streamflow variations hu et al 2011 found that the correlation coefficients between the annual precipitation and annual streamflow increase from upstream to downstream and that a decrease in streamflow can be associated with decreasing wet season precipitation and rising temperatures utilizing sensitivity based methods zheng et al 2009 and zhao et al 2009 estimated that climate change manifesting as variations in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration contributed to 30 of the streamflow reduction at the tangnaihai station in the 1990s they further attributed the other 70 of the streamflow reduction to land use changes and human activities by employing the vic model in the sryr cuo et al 2015 discovered a deviation between observed streamflow and vic simulated streamflow values using a static land use map and they found that the land use induced deviation expanded during 1960 2000 streamflow changes that cannot be directly explained by climate factors may also arise from cryospheric changes such as frozen ground degradation cheng and wu 2007 cuo et al 2015 and variations in the snowfall fraction of the total precipitation berghuijs et al 2014 zhang et al 2015 where further investigations are needed recent studies have found that the streamflow trend reversed from decreasing to increasing since the 2000s due to the increasing precipitation however the streamflow did not recover as much as precipitation meng et al 2016 meng et al 2016 attributed all of the streamflow changes in the 2000s to evapotranspiration changes based on the vic model meanwhile xu et al 2013 highlighted the importance of the increase in the water storage detected by gravity recovery and climate experiment grace satellite since 2003 cuo et al 2015 claimed that the three rivers source region reserve project which was launched in 2003 also played a role in the observed streamflow changes such ecological projects have already produced positive effects on grassland restoration on the tp xu et al 2016 and reduced the growing season water yield due to increased evapotranspiration and soil water retention in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2017 the impacts of ecological projects on annual streamflow in the sryr however have rarely been analyzed in summary previous studies used sensitivity based methods or process based models to analyze the possible reasons for streamflow changes in the sryr zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 cuo et al 2015 however most of these studies included only one change point close to the year 1990 and they did not explain the observed increase in streamflow since the 2000s while the impacts of frozen ground degradation on streamflow changes were conceptualized in previous investigations few quantitative analyses have been performed and thus the underlying mechanisms are still unclear therefore the objectives of this study are to 1 understand the long term streamflow changes over the past 50 years in the sryr 2 develop a decomposition approach within the budyko framework to analyze the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation and 3 use the extended budyko framework to quantify the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the sryr is located in the transitional zone of seasonally frozen ground and permafrost in the northeastern tp jin et al 2009 in this study the sryr refers to the upstream catchment above the tangnaihai hydrological station the sryr covers an area of 122 000 km2 that accounts for 16 of the total area of the yellow river basin and it yields 35 of the total runoff of the yellow river hu et al 2011 the elevation of the sryr ranges from 2656 m to 6350 m fig 1 and decreases from the southwest to the northeast the zoige wetland which is located in the southeastern sryr is one of the largest alpine wetlands in the tp and it is dominated by helophyte species zhang et al 2016b 2 2 data digital elevation data with a resolution of 90 m were obtained from the shuttle radar topography mission srtm jarvis et al 2008 daily mean air temperature wind speed daily average relative humidity and sunshine hour data from the 22 meteorological stations fig 1 located within and around the sryr were downloaded from the china meteorological administration cma http data cma cn an angular distance weighting method with elevation corrections yang et al 2004 was utilized to produce 1 km gridded datasets on a daily basis the gridded precipitation data were spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the climatology based optimal method proposed by shen and xiong 2016 the fraction of precipitation falling as snow fs was estimated using a single temperature threshold method if the daily mean air temperature is lower than 1 c then the daily precipitation is considered to be entirely snowfall and vice versa sato et al 2008 zhang et al 2008 berghuijs et al 2014 to minimize the effects of carry over storage of snowfall all of the annual values used in this study are from 1 september to 31 august as a hydrologic year the multi year average snowfall fraction fs is 0 19 for the sryr table 1 which is similar to other estimates in this region sato et al 2008 hu et al 2011 the daily potential evapotranspiration e0 was calculated based on the penman equation as recommended by shuttleworth 1993 details regarding the equations and procedures used to calculate e0 can be found in yang et al 2007 and zhang et al 2015 the leaf area index lai3g dataset and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation fpar3g dataset both of which were derived from the 3rd generation of the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi3g of the global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms zhu et al 2013 were adopted in this study the lai3g and fpar3g datasets both have a 15 day temporal resolution and a 1 12 0 0833 spatial resolution and they are available from july 1981 to december 2011 monthly streamflow data from the jimai maqu and tangnaihai hydrological stations are available during 1965 2015 in this study the sryr is divided into 3 sub regions according to the locations of the 3 hydrological stations 1 the region upstream of jimai jm 2 the region between jimai and maqu jm mq and 3 the region between maqu and tangnaihai mq tnh see figs 1 and 2 to obtain the runoff depths in jm mq and mq tnh the runoff volume at the upper stream station was subtracted from the runoff volume at the lower stream station and the resulting difference was then divided by the area of the sub region between the two stations according to the map of permafrost on the qinghai tibetan plateau 1 3 000 000 scale complied by the institute of geographic science chinese academy of sciences igs cas ran et al 2012 fig 2 jm has the largest proportion of permafrost 63 0 while jm mq has the smallest proportion of permafrost 8 7 table 1 the multi year average climatic hydrologic and vegetation characteristics and the permafrost information for the 3 sub regions and the entire sryr are shown in table 1 jm represents a permafrost dominated area while jm mq and mq tnh represent seasonally frozen ground dominated areas of which jm mq has a denser vegetation cover this study adopts two evapotranspiration et products fig 3 to investigate the possible mechanism of the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow the first et product is the global land evaporation amsterdam model gleam a global dataset with a 0 25 resolution spanning 1980 2016 that uses a priestley taylor approach to calculate e0 and integrates point wise et observations at fluxnet sites with reanalysis data and satellite based information miralles et al 2014 zhang et al 2016c the second et product was calculated using a geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm that was specifically calibrated and calculated for the sryr with a 3 km resolution during 1981 2011 qin et al 2017 gbehm is a distributed hydrological model that can be used for the simulation of hydrological processes in cold regions gao et al 2016 the transpiration rate in gbehm is calculated using the same algorithm as the sib2 model and fpar data are used in the transpiration calculation more details can be found in gao et al 2016 and qin et al 2017 the annual et anomaly series derived from gleam and gbehm in the sryr show similar inter annual variabilities with a correlation coefficient r of 0 61 fig 3 the annual water storage change δs derived from these two et products are also compared with the grace derived water storage change δ s grace the annual et derived from either gleam or gbehm can then be used to obtain δs by utilizing the water balance equation 1a δ s gleam i p gleam i q i et gleam i 1b δ s gbehm i p gbehm i q i et gbehm i where p i and q i represent the annual precipitation and streamflow in the hydrologic year i p i is different between the two products since gleam uses the multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep dataset for its precipitation forcing beck et al 2017 while gbehm adopts gridded precipitation data spatially interpolated from gauge observations using the method proposed by shen and xiong 2016 terrestrial water storage anomaly twsa data derived using grace satellite data from the center for space research csr for 2002 2015 were downloaded with a resolution of 1 landerer and swenson 2012 https grace jpl nasa gov data get data monthly mass grids land the twsa time series for the sryr were derived using an area weighting method and filtered using a 3 month moving average method xu et al 2013 the value of δ s grace during the hydrologic year i which starts in september can be estimated as follows xu et al 2013 2 δ s grace i twsa september i 1 twsa september i fig 3 shows that the δs time series derived from gleam δ s gleam gbehm δ s gbehm and grace δ s grace are similar with regard to their amplitudes and annual fluctuations indicating that these et products are reliable in the sryr 3 methods 3 1 attribution analysis within the budyko framework water storage changes generally cannot be ignored at the annual scale i e δ s i 0 and thus the water balance equation is expressed as follows 3 q p et δ s where q p et and δ s respectively represent the observed annual streamflow precipitation actual evapotranspiration and water storage change unit mm the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 states that the annual water balance can be expressed as a function of the available water and energy and it assumes that the ratio of actual evapotranspiration to precipitation et p is a function of the aridity index ϕ e 0 p 4 et p f ϕ different forms of f ϕ have been proposed under the budyko framework schreiber 1904 ol dekop 1911 pike 1964 budyko 1974 fu 1981 zhang et al 2001 yang et al 2008 zhou et al 2015b based on dimensional analysis and mathematical reasoning yang et al 2008 derived the water energy balance equation analytically which is expressed as eq 5 and is known as the choudhury yang equation 5a et budyko pe 0 p n e 0 n 1 n 5b f ϕ ϕ n 1 1 n where the annual precipitation p and annual e0 respectively represent the available water and the available energy and the parameter n represents the catchment characteristics which are mainly related to properties of the soil topography and vegetation yang et al 2007 zhou et al 2015a zhang et al 2016a if the annual et and q are determined only by climate factors they should be exactly the same as their corresponding budyko estimated values ignoring δs the streamflow estimated using the budyko curve should be as follows 6 q budyko f p e 0 n p et budyko p pe 0 p n e 0 n 1 n we assume that the long term average of the observed annual streamflow is equal to the budyko based estimated streamflow thus by using long term averages of the observed annual streamflow precipitation and e0 the catchment parameter n can be calculated at the annual scale however a deviation exists between the observed annual q and qbudyko eq 3 can be rewritten as follows 7 q p et budyko et dev δ s p et budyko et dev δ s q budyko q dev where q dev is the deviation of the observed annual q from qbudyko q dev q q budyko qdev includes two components q dev et dev δ s the deviation of et from the budyko estimated et et dev et et budyko and the water storage change δ s it is caused by the landscape factors including frozen ground and vegetation and can be written as a function of these factors frozen ground measurements are rare and are usually restricted to point scale estimates in frozen ground regions therefore the air freezing index ddfa is selected as the indicator for frozen ground degradation in this study and it is calculated using the following equation frauenfeld et al 2007 8 ddf a j 1 n f t j t j 0 c where n f is the number of days with an air temperature below 0 c in a given hydrologic year j 1 2 n f and t j is the daily mean air temperature c on a specific day j more details about the selection of ddfa as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation will be discussed in section 5 1 if we assume that ddfa is independent of other landscape factors we have the following equation 9 q dev g ddf a h other landscape factors the shape of g ddf a reflects the relationship between frozen ground and streamflow and it is fitted using 5 year sequential averages of q dev and ddfa in this study yang et al 2016 for each variable ten samples of the 5 year means are yielded during 1965 2014 i e 1965 1969 1970 1974 2010 2014 from eq 7 the long term streamflow change between two periods δ q can be attributed to the direct impact of climate change δ q c and the impact of landscape change δ q l 10 δ q δ q budyko δ q dev δ q c δ q l if we set the parameter n in eq 5 time invariant in a certain region then δ q budyko δ q c and all the landscape induced streamflow change are remained in δ q dev thus δ q dev δ q l the climate contribution to streamflow changes can be estimated via the climate elasticity method zheng et al 2009 wang and hejazi 2011 yang and yang 2011 xu et al 2014 yang et al 2014 the precipitation elasticity of streamflow ε p is defined as ε p dq q dp p and the potential evapotranspiration elasticity of streamflow ε e 0 is defined as ε e 0 dq q de 0 e 0 thus the climate induced streamflow change δ q c can be estimated by 11 δ q c δ q p δ q e 0 ε p δ p p q ε e 0 δ e 0 e 0 q following the derivation process described by arora 2002 the climate elasticity of streamflow i e ε p and ε e 0 can be expressed as follows 12a ε e 0 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ 12b ε p 1 ϕ f ϕ 1 f ϕ combining eq 12 with the choudhury yang equation shown in eq 5b the climate elasticity of streamflow can be calculated by the long term aridity index ϕ climate induced streamflow change δ q c can be obtained using eq 12 and the remaining term is attributed to landscape change δ q 1 the landscape induced streamflow change δ q l can be further attributed to frozen ground degradation δ q f and land use changes δ q lu 13 δ q l δ q f δ q lu the streamflow change caused by frozen ground degradation δ q f can be calculated by eq 14 and the remaining term is attributed to land use changes δ q lu 14 δ q f δ g ddf a g ddf a 2 g ddf a 1 where ddf a 1 and ddf a 2 are the mean air freezing indices during two different periods in this study climate induced streamflow change δ q c represents the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in both precipitation and e0 while the impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow δ q f can be regarded as part of the indirect impact of climate change 3 2 change point and trend detection in this study the moving t test was adopted to detect change points within the streamflow time series the t test assesses whether the means of two subsamples are significantly different from one another the formula for the t test is as follows zheng et al 2007 yin et al 2015 15 t x 1 x 2 s 1 n 1 1 n 2 16 s n 1 s 1 2 n 2 s 2 2 n 1 n 2 2 where x i s and ni are the mean standard deviation and size of the two independent samples i 1 2 the t test has n 1 n 2 2 degrees of freedom the moving t test applies the t test to a subseries with a fixed length n before and after the potential change points n n 1 n 2 if the calculated t value is larger than the critical value t α then the point is accepted as a change point at the significance level α in this study n 10 and α 0 05 and thus the critical value is t α 2 1 the mann kendall nonparametric test is applied in this study to detect the significance of a trend in the long term time series yang et al 2004 and a significance level of 0 05 is chosen for all trend analyses in this study 4 results 4 1 long term streamflow variations the long term inter annual streamflow and precipitation variabilities are shown in fig 4 the annual streamflow in all sub regions of the sryr showed decreasing trends during 1965 2015 and the decreasing trend in jm mq was significant at the 0 05 significance level 12 26 mm 10a table 2 in contrast the annual precipitation among all of the sub regions of the sryr showed increasing trends during 1965 2015 except for jm mq where the annual precipitation decreased slightly 1 04 mm 10a for the entire sryr the annual streamflow showed an insignificant decreasing trend 6 51 mm 10a during 1965 2015 in contrast to an insignificant annual precipitation increasing trend 6 48 mm 10a resulting in a significant decrease in the runoff ratio 0 01 10a over the past 50 years at the 0 05 significance level table 2 two abrupt change points in the annual streamflow in the sryr were detected using the moving t test which were respectively 1989 and 2003 fig 5 thus the past 50 years can be divided into 3 periods period 1 p1 1965 1989 period 2 p2 1990 2003 and period 3 p3 2004 2015 the abrupt change points of the annual streamflow are similar to the change points of the annual precipitation fig 5 during p1 the streamflow and precipitation among all of the sub regions fluctuated around the multi year average and increased insignificantly at the 0 05 significance level fig 4 while during p2 nearly all of the sub regions experienced a decrease in both streamflow and precipitation and the streamflow decreasing rate 22 47 mm 10a was larger than precipitation decreasing rate 9 68 mm 10a the mean annual streamflow and precipitation values during the three periods are also indicated in fig 4 the decrease in the annual streamflow value between p1 and p2 was larger than the decrease in the annual precipitation except within mq tnh during p3 the annual precipitation trends in all of the sub regions except mq tnh reversed and started to increase and the annual streamflow throughout the entire sryr also increased slightly 2 67 mm 10a table 2 the precipitation in all of the sryr sub regions during p3 exceeded their multi year averages however the streamflow in all of these sub regions during p3 did not recover as much as the precipitation instead the streamflow returned only approximately to the multi year average value in p3 and was even lower than the average value in p1 fig 4 the runoff ratio exhibited the most rapid decrease during p2 0 04 10a during which time the mean annual air temperature increased by 0 98 c 10a throughout the entire sryr table 2 4 2 decomposition into climate and landscape induced streamflow changes the values of the catchment parameter n precipitation elasticity of streamflow ε p and potential evapotranspiration elasticity of streamflow ε e 0 are shown in table 3 the results show that the streamflow in permafrost dominated jm is more sensitive to climate factors compared with the other two sub regions the values of the climate elasticity of streamflow were ε p 2 20 and ε e 0 1 20 which means that a 10 increase in either the precipitation or e0 will result in a 22 increase or a 12 decrease in streamflow at jm respectively attribution analysis of the streamflow changes between different periods was conducted based on the climate elasticity table 4 from p1 to p2 the direct impact of climate change can explain only 55 0 of the streamflow decrease while landscape changes can explain another 45 0 of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr the direct impact of climate change can explain only 21 3 of the streamflow decrease in the permafrost dominated jm and 69 5 of the streamflow decrease in the seasonally frozen ground dominated mq tnh meanwhile 78 7 and 30 5 of the streamflow decreases in jm and mq tnh were caused by landscape changes which is similar to the results of previous studies zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 from p2 to p3 the 83 7 mm increase in precipitation for the entire sryr caused a 48 1 mm increase in streamflow while the increase in e0 led to a 5 1 mm decrease in streamflow therefore the climate induced increase in streamflow δ q c was 43 0 mm but the observed streamflow only increased by 34 1 mm table 4 this indicates that landscape changes had a negative effect on streamflow δ q l 0 which was true for all of the sub regions of the sryr and for both p1 p2 and p2 p3 the streamflow decrease caused by landscape factors was 21 1 mm from p1 to p2 and 8 9 mm from p2 to p3 for the entire sryr 4 3 streamflow response to frozen ground degradation the shape of g ddf a in eq 9 reflects the relationship between frozen ground and streamflow from the scatter plots of the 5 year sequential average of q dev vs that of ddfa shown in fig 6 the relationship between q dev and ddfa can be described using a power function 17 g ddf a a ddf a b c d e the values of the parameters a b c d and e were determined via a least squares method and the fitted equations are labeled in fig 6 the values of the coefficients of determination r2 were 0 38 to 0 63 for the three sub regions and 0 72 for the entire sryr indicating that the fitted power function curves are effective for reflecting the relationship between streamflow and frozen ground in the sryr combining the equations of g ddf a and eq 14 table 4 can be extended into table 5 which further decomposes landscape induced streamflow changes δ q l into the parts attributed to frozen ground degradation δ q f and land use change δ q lu the impacts of climate change and frozen ground degradation can explain almost all of the streamflow changes in the sryr since the values of δ q c δ q f δ q are close to 100 table 5 the results show that from p1 to p2 frozen ground degradation manifesting as a decrease in ddfa can explain 70 7 of the streamflow decrease in the permafrost dominated jm and more than 20 of the streamflow decrease in the seasonally frozen ground dominated jm mq and mq tnh for the entire sryr frozen ground degradation caused a 15 3 mm decrease in the annual streamflow accounting for 32 6 of the total streamflow decrease the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 6 of the streamflow change from p1 to p2 land use changes resulted in a 12 4 decrease in streamflow for the entire sryr from p1 to p2 that can be attributed to the combined effects of a decrease in grasslands and increases in cultivated land forest and water bodies table 6 while from p2 to p3 the streamflow is projected to increase by 48 1 mm only considering the effects of precipitation δqp 48 1 mm for the entire sryr while the observed annual streamflow only increased by 34 1 mm δq 34 1 mm the difference can be attributed to the effects of increasing e0 δ q e 0 5 1 mm and more importantly the frozen ground degradation δqf 13 1 mm tables 4 and 5 the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 5 of the streamflow change from p2 to p3 the values of δ q lu from p2 to p3 were positive and close to zero which might be related to a decrease in cultivated land area as well as to the establishment of the three rivers source region reserve in 2003 cuo et al 2015 table 6 5 discussion 5 1 selection of air freezing index as the indicator of frozen ground degradation frozen ground observation is much more difficult than the meteorological observation hence the frozen ground observations are very rare therefore the air freezing index ddfa and thawing index ddta are often used to map the permafrost distribution and predict the ground freeze thaw state at large scale frauenfeld et al 2007 in this study we choose the air freezing index ddfa to represent the degree of frozen ground degradation the degree of frozen ground degradation is co determined by multiple variables including air temperature and other factors as demonstrated by the stefan equation peng et al 2017 18 mtsfg 2 λ f n f l ρ l θ f ddf a where mtsfg is the maximum thickness of seasonally frozen ground representing the maximum depth from the ground surface to the freezing front in a freezing season ddfa is the air freezing index over a hydrologic year c day λf is the thermal conductivity of frozen soil nf is the freezing n factor which corresponds to the ratio between ground surface and air freezing index and relates to land surface conditions klene et al 2001 l is the latent heat of fusion 3 34 105 j kg 1 ρl is the density of liquid water 1 00 103 kg m 3 θf is the volumetric liquid water content before soil freezing by analyzing freezing depth data across china peng et al 2017 found that ddfa could account for more than 90 of the variability in mtsfg while no correlation was found between mtsfg and the snow depth due to limited data and relatively stable soil and land surface properties relative to climate forcing a simplified stefan equation has been adopted by many studies wang et al 2015 wu et al 2015 peng et al 2017 19 mtsfg e ddf a where e is an edaphic parameter representing all of the factors other than ddfa that influence the freezing depth the value of e is relatively steady at a certain location and variations in ddfa can represent the inter annual variability in frozen ground degradation to illustrate the validity of utilizing ddfa to represent the degree of frozen ground degradation in the study area long term observations of the soil freezing depth at 10 stations in the sryr during 1967 2015 were obtained from the cma a strong correlation between mtsfg and ddf a with a mean correlation coefficient r value of 0 64 was observed among the 10 stations in the sryr fig s1 the degree of frozen ground degradation is directly determined by the soil temperature therefore we calculate the ground freezing index ddfg using observations of the ground surface 0 cm temperature and the soil temperature at depths of 10 cm 20 cm and 80 cm at the 10 stations by summing up all of the daily temperatures lower than 0 c in a given hydrologic year ddfa and ddfg decreased significantly over the past few decades and the inter annual variabilities in ddfa and ddfg showed a similar pattern fig s2 the value of r between ddfg at different depths and ddfa generally decreased with an increase in the soil depth and most of the corresponding r values are larger than 0 6 fig s3 except at the maqu zoige and hongyuan stations where the mtsfg values are relatively small 100 cm these results show that ddfa perform effectively as an indicator for the degree of frozen ground degradation in the sryr in addition to ddfa ddta is also commonly used as an indicator for estimating the degree of frozen ground degradation frauenfeld et al 2007 duan et al 2017a we also calculate ddta by summing up all of the daily temperatures higher than 0 c in a given hydrologic year then eq 9 can be rewritten as follows 20 q dev l ddt a h other landscape factors the shape of l ddta which also reflects the relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow was fitted using a 5 year sequential average and ddfa from the scatter plots of the 5 year sequential average of qdev vs that of ddta fig s4 the relationship between qdev and ddta can also be described with a similar power function 21 l ddt a a b ddt a c d e the values of the parameters a b c d and e were determined via a least squares method and the fitted equations are labeled in fig s4 from the newly derived function l ddta we can calculate the streamflow change caused by the frozen ground degradation δqf using the following equation 22 δ q f δ l ddt a l ddt a 2 l ddt a 1 using ddta for different periods i e ddta 1 and ddta 2 we can obtain the streamflow change caused by the frozen ground degradation δqf and the corresponding results table s1 the values of δqf changed only slightly compared with the previous results acquired by selecting ddfa as the indicator as is shown in table 5 therefore the relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow does not rely much on the choice of the frozen ground index hence the results derived from the proposed method within the budyko framework are reasonable and the method is robust 5 2 impact of frozen ground degradation on streamflow the budyko framework adopted in this study is used for quantifying the direct impact of climate change manifesting as changes in precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as well as the impact of frozen ground degradation which strictly speaking could be regarded as an indirect impact of climate change we assume that ddfa is independent of other landscape factors and we consequently obtain eq 9 to distinguish the impact of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow there are many landscape factors that could cause the deviations between the observed and budyko estimated streamflow values zhang et al 2016a frozen ground and vegetation in the sryr have experienced great changes over the past few decades and they might represent the most prominent landscape factors influencing streamflow therefore we tested the relationship between ddfa and the lai and we did not find a significant correlation based on the results obtained in this study the direct impact of climate change can explain only 21 3 of the streamflow decrease in jm from period 1 1965 1989 to period 2 1990 2003 which is similar to the results of previous studies in the study area zhao et al 2009 zheng et al 2009 furthermore this study provides an explicit non linear relationship between frozen ground degradation and streamflow changes in the sryr fig 6 and quantifies the streamflow response to frozen ground degradation table 5 the negative correlation between q dev and ddfa supports the hypothesis that frozen ground degradation decreases streamflow in the tp cheng and wu 2007 jin et al 2009 yang et al 2010 as frozen ground degrades the state point of ddfa q dev in fig 6 moves from the upper right to the lower left along the fitted curves frozen ground degradation decreases streamflow in the sryr but this decreasing effect gradually diminishes with the degradation stage this deceleration was more obvious in the permafrost dominated jm and it initiated in 1995 when ddfa dropped below 2100 c day since 1995 the air temperature has abruptly increased by 0 63 c 10a as stated in duan et al 2017b the resulting increase in the active layer thickness and the thawing of permafrost might have contributed to the annual streamflow and caused the diminished decreasing effects of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow after quantifying the impacts of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow the possible mechanisms of those impacts are discussed as follows since q dev reflects the deviation between the observed and budyko estimated annual streamflow qdev q qbudyko caused by landscape factors including the frozen ground it can be further decomposed into water storage changes δ s and deviations between the actual and budyko estimated et etdev et etbudyko eq 7 q dev et dev δ s the calculation of q dev does not rely on the values of actual et while the decomposition of q dev relies on the values of actual et two different et products i e gleam and gbehm are adopted in this study and they use different precipitation forcings a comparison between those forcings can be found in fig s5 to investigate the different mechanisms between permafrost and seasonally frozen ground dominated regions this section divides the entire sryr into the permafrost dominated region upstream of jimai station jm with 63 0 area underlain by permafrost and seasonally frozen ground dominated region between jimai and tangnaihai station jm tnh with only 17 3 area underlain by permafrost the decadal changes in q dev and its two components δ s and et dev during 1981 2010 in the sryr are shown in fig 7 the decadal changes in ddfa and the mean annual lai are also shown in fig 7 the median values of q dev that represent the deviation between the observed and budyko estimated q qdev q qbudyko continued to decrease and became less than zero in the 2000s in both regions indicating that landscape factors caused the streamflow to become lower than the budyko based estimates during the 2000s this phenomenon was caused by an increase in δ s rather than an increase in et dev which holds for both gleam and gbehm and it may have been related to the rapid decrease in ddfa from the 1990s to the 2000s fig 7 an increase in δ s within the sryr subsequent to 2002 was also found using grace data especially in those areas underlain by permafrost xu et al 2013 these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that permafrost degradation decreases streamflow by enlarging the water storage capacity with an increasing active layer thickness niu et al 2016 and that permafrost may even degrade into seasonally frozen ground and cause more water to percolate into deep aquifers thereby increasing the groundwater storage qin et al 2017 an increase in the active layer thickness and the thawing of permafrost might have contributed to the annual streamflow since the 2000s however the increase in δ s exerted a greater impact on streamflow which could have counteracted the increase in streamflow and caused the streamflow to decrease these combined changes ultimately resulted in a diminished decreasing impact of frozen ground degradation on the annual streamflow as is shown in fig 6 6 conclusions in this study long term streamflow variations in the source region of the yellow river sryr were analyzed and attribution analysis within the budyko framework was employed to quantify the streamflow response to the direct impact of climate change the impact of frozen ground degradation and land use change according to the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the past 50 years can be divided into 3 sub periods period 1 p1 1965 1989 period 2 p2 1990 2003 and period 3 p3 2004 2015 for the entire sryr the annual streamflow showed an insignificant decreasing trend 6 51 mm 10a during 1965 2015 in contrast to the insignificant increasing annual precipitation trend 6 48 mm 10a at the 0 05 significance level 2 from p1 to p2 the direct impact of climate change can explain only 55 0 of the streamflow decrease for the entire sryr frozen ground degradation can explain an additional 32 6 of the streamflow decrease in the sryr during the same period in the permafrost dominated region upstream of the jimai hydrological station frozen ground degradation can explain 70 7 of the observed streamflow decrease 3 from p2 to p3 the streamflow did not increase as much as the precipitation this disparity could be attributable to the combined effects of an increasing potential evapotranspiration δ qe 0 5 1 mm and more importantly to frozen ground degradation δqf 13 1 mm the direct impact of climate change and the impact of frozen ground degradation can collectively explain 87 5 of the streamflow change from p2 to p3 for the entire sryr 4 frozen ground degradation could reduce streamflow by increasing groundwater storage when the active layer thickness increases in a permafrost region the methods developed in this study can be used in other catchments as well to help develop a better understanding of the impacts of frozen ground degradation on water resources in

7457,this paper presents a new methodology for optimizing water quality monitoring wqm networks of reservoirs and lakes using the concept of the value of information voi and utilizing results of a calibrated numerical water quality simulation model with reference to the value of information theory water quality of every checkpoint with a specific prior probability differs in time after analyzing water quality samples taken from potential monitoring points the posterior probabilities are updated using the baye s theorem and voi of the samples is calculated in the next step the stations with maximum voi is selected as optimal stations this process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network locations for each interval the results of the proposed voi based methodology is compared with those obtained using an entropy theoretic approach as the results of the two methodologies would be partially different in the next step the results are combined using a weighting method finally the optimal sampling interval and location of wqm stations are chosen using the evidential reasoning er decision making method the efficiency and applicability of the methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data of the karkheh reservoir in the southwestern part of iran keywords spatio temporal optimization water quality monitoring network reservoir value of information theory entropy theory evidential reasoning method 1 introduction over the last decades many dams have been constructed to address human needs such as supplying drinking industrial and irrigation water demands fulfilling these goals and supplying water with moderately good quality necessitate water quality monitoring of reservoirs the main issue in this type of monitoring is financial burden of sampling and analysis of water samples to tackle this issue and provide comprehensive information about the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in these important water bodies water quality monitoring wqm networks for reservoirs should be optimally designed because of three dimensional variations of water quality in reservoirs monitoring of water quality in such systems is different from other water resources there are many statistical studies on river polder groundwater and rainfall monitoring network design many of these studies are entropy based e g krstanovic and singh 1992a b harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 mogheir et al 2006 alfonso et al 2010a b mishra and coulibaly 2010 stosic et al 2017 hosseini and kerachian

literature on the optimization of monitoring networks of rivers polders and groundwater systems previous works on the optimization of monitoring networks of reservoirs have been very limited according to unep who 1996 1 united nations environment programme unep 1 long term wqm with one station next to the center or the deepest part of the lake is necessary for lakes with appropriate horizontal mixing also the number of wqm stations must be more than one in stratified lakes this number is recommended to estimate by log 10 s where s is the lake area in km2 which can be utilized for great lakes with a vast variety of deep basins and a wide range of narrow bays unep who 1996 obviously this guideline cannot be used for finding the location of wqm stations in thermally stratified reservoirs jimenez et al 2005 developed a methodology for the design of quasi optimal monitoring networks for lakes and reservoirs the main components of their methodology were a numerical model which was used due to the lack of field data a kriging based module for spatial interpolation and getting estimates from the available monitoring networks and a genetic algorithm based optimization model to generate the set of non dominated optimal accuracy vs costs monitoring networks beveridge et al 2012 utilized a geostatistical method to determine optimal wqm stations of the great winnipeg lake by clustering the lake and omitting stations with redundant information they combined the kriging method which suggested redundant stations considering all existing stations and the local moran s i values which determined redundant stations of each cluster kovacs et al 2014 developed a method on the basis of combined cluster and discriminant analysis ccda to classify sampling sites into homogeneous groups they declared that their technique is applicable to reduce the number of wqm stations in lakes yenilmez et al 2014 proposed a model for determining the optimal location of wqm stations to measure dissolved oxygen do in porsuk reservoir by the combination of kernel density estimation kde and ordinary kriging methods the kde method was utilized to decrease congestion of wqm stations which resulted in the reduction of number of stations from 65 to 10 and the introduction of 5 locations for new stations lee et al 2014 proposed an approach based on information theory to optimize the location of wqm stations in a specific depth in a reservoir the results revealed that average water quality at optimal sampling stations was similar to this average in all potential wqm points nikoo et al 2016 developed a multi objective optimization model based on the non dominated sorting genetic algorithms nsga ii optimization model entropy theory a calibrated numerical model based on ce qual w2 and bargaining theory to optimize the location of wqm stations in karkheh reservoir considering utility function of main stakeholders in this study only spatial optimization of wqm network was considered recently aboutalebi et al 2017 optimized the location of wqm stations in a reservoir based on nsga ii optimization model with the objects of minimizing prediction error of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and the average time of mtbe detection the concept of voi was first used by decision makers to figure out whether it would be economic to invest in obtaining further stochastic information or not alfonso and price 2012 previous applications of voi theory are mainly rooted in two studies 1 hirshleifer and riley 1979 who introduced the voi theory in order to address some decision making problems under uncertainty and 2 alfonso and price 2012 who optimized the location of hydrometric monitoring stations by applying hydrodynamic models associated with the voi concept they searched the location of some hydrometric monitoring stations along a polder system in the netherlands to minimize flood damage typically the existing approaches for the optimization of reservoir wqm stations specify the optimal location of wqm stations in only one dimension and none of them provides optimal sampling interval in addition in previous works the voi theory has been used to optimize the location of wqm stations in some water bodies such as polders not reservoirs in this paper a new methodology is developed to spatially and temporally optimize a reservoir wqm network in this regard water quality in the reservoir is estimated based on the results of a calibrated numerical simulation model the wqm network is optimized using the concept of value of information and entropy theory and the results are compared if the results of two methods are different they might be combined using a weighting method and the spatio temporal optimization of the monitoring network is done using a hybrid voi entropy method in the final step the optimal wqm stations and sampling interval are specified using the evidential reasoning method the karkheh reservoir in iran is taken into account as a case study in order to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology 2 methodologies a flowchart of the proposed methodology for spatio temporal optimization of reservoir wqm networks is presented in fig 1 different steps of this flowchart are explained in the following sections 2 1 data collection the collected information includes necessary data for the calibration and validation of the reservoir water quality simulation model i e ce qual w2 the physical characteristics of reservoir evaporation rate relative moisture wind speed weather temperature reservoir operating rules and time series of inflow quantity and quality are the main inputs of the simulation model the simulation model is calibrated and verified using observed data obtained from existing monitoring networks to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in the reservoir a suitable water quality index wqi should be used 2 2 value of information voi generally water quality in a monitoring station with a specific prior probability varies in time by obtaining new data the posterior probability and the voi of the new data can be estimated using the baye s theorem a combination of monitoring stations with maximum voi can be selected as optimal wqm configuration this process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network characteristics for each water quality sampling interval in the following sections more details about the proposed methodology for estimating voi of monitoring stations are presented 2 2 1 calculation of voi for various sets of potential wqm locations at first a decision maker has an opinion about states of water quality in various part of the reservoir based on previous observations or simulations after receiving new information messages his or her viewpoint will be updated which may contribute to taking actions if messages assist the decision maker to do the right thing they are valuable otherwise they cause damages hence according to the voi concept messages are evaluated and quantified based on the right or wrong outlook given to decision maker alfonso and price 2012 the steps of calculating voi of each station in order to estimate the states of other points are given in the supplementary material 2 2 2 determination of the maximum number of required wqm stations actually points c and d in the supplementary material can be any of potential wqm locations in this step the voi of potential wqm station c point 5 2 it is assumed that point 5 is located in 5 km distance from an origin in an arbitrary one dimension reservoir 2 in figs 2 and 3 for determining states of other potential wqm locations is calculated fig 2 and a curve is fitted to these voi values fig 3 in figs 2 and 3 it is assumed that a reservoir is simulated in one dimension and point 5 is a wqm station located in 5 km from an origin e g from the dam in an arbitrary reservoir that determines states of other potential wqm locations in the same depth it should also be noted that if the reservoir is simulated in two dimensions the voi diagram would be a three dimensional surface as presented in fig 3 the maximum voi occurs at point 5 it means that if a decision maker wants to know just the state of point 5 he should put a new wqm station at this point and his willingness to pay for putting a station decreases by getting away from this point each potential wqm location has a special voi curve and in all voi diagrams voi of each curve is normalized by dividing all voi values by the maximum voi value fig 4 shows the schematic voi diagrams for stations 3 5 and 7 the total voi of each potential wqm location is equal to the integral of its voi curve obviously if just one optimal wqm station is adequate the station with maximum total voi is chosen as can be seen in fig 4 the unbroken and the dashed lines respectively show the value of information of point 3 or 5 for evaluating the state of point 6 which implies a decision maker s willingness to pay for establishing a station in point 3 or 5 if he or she wants to know states of point 6 since the dashed line is longer than the unbroken line if station 5 is established station 3 would not provide any further information for determining the state of point 6 consequently if more than one station is needed the overlap of curves is not considered and the maximum value voi curves i e an envelope curve is assumed as voi curve of the set of stations as an example the total voi of both stations 3 and 5 is shown in fig 5 finally the total voi values of different sets of stations are calculated by integrating the envelope curves and a set with maximum voi value is selected as the optimal set of wqm stations at last the diagram of optimal voi value versus the number of wqm stations is drawn in order to find the maximum number of required wqm stations although voi values are normalized standardized the total voi value which is the integral of corresponding voi curve is not therefore the total voi value of each set of optimal wqm stations should be normalized by dividing its value by the total voi of the set of all potential wqm stations 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis over the percentages of data used to calculate prior and posterior probabilities sensitivity analysis is done by changing the percentage of data used for the calculation of prior and posterior probabilities and the estimation of the effect of this change on the obtained voi and the optimal location of wqm stations 2 2 4 time dependence coefficient when water quality of a reservoir is monitored at each station there is a dependency between water quality data in time which is shown by a time dependence coefficient tdc this coefficient is different with temporal correlation coefficient in statistics tdc is calculated using a new approach in which at a potential wqm station existing data is shifted in time and the value of information of one time data for estimating states of other times is calculated for different time lags each potential wqm location has a specific time dependence coefficient diagram so in order to decrease the complexity of using tdcs in spatio temporal optimization it is recommended to average tdcs of all potential wqm locations in each time lag to draw a unified tdc lag for all parts of the reservoir fig 6 fig 6 illustrates a clear cut example of tdc diagram in different time lags obviously the monitored data gives the decision maker an insight into reservoir water quality before and after monitoring time it is assumed that tdcs of former and later time lags are the same the effect of tdc is shown in the process of spatio temporal optimization by multiplying optimal voi of each time interval voi δ t by the summation of these coefficients 1 finalvoi δ t voi δ t max tdc δ t min max tdc 2 δ t min max tdc δ t δ t min δ t where δ t is the time interval δ t min is the minimum possible time interval regarding the output of reservoir simulation model as an example for eq 1 consider fig 6 as the tdc diagram where δ t min 10 d and δ t 60 d hence fig 6 should be drawn for every 60 days which is shown in fig 7 the summation of maximum amounts of coefficients in 10 20 60 days should be acquired as the final tdc of 60 days time step finalvoi 60 voi 60 1 0 97 0 90 0 75 0 90 0 97 10 60 2 2 5 spatio temporal optimization of wqm network in this stage for each sampling interval and each number of wqm stations voi of all combination of stations set is calculated the set of stations which have the maximum amount of voi is selected as the optimal one the result will be the pareto front among voi and sampling interval for a different number of wqm stations 2 3 optimization of wqm network using the entropy theory as presented in fig 1 spatio temporal optimization of reservoir wqm stations can also be done by utilizing the entropy theory in the following subsections the main steps of the procedure are described 2 3 1 calculation of joint entropy for various sets of potential wqm locations for comparing the results of voi and entropy methods all stages of section 2 2 are done by entropy method too however the results of the voi and entropy based methods could be different because they use different concepts for estimating information content of observed data in the discrete entropy theory the range of variation of each water quality variable should be discretized to nci classes according to the following equation masoumi and kerachian 2009 2 nci 1 1 33 ln nc where nc is the time series size of the data in each station the marginal entropy h x is computed by 3 h x i 1 s p x i ln p x i where x denotes wqi at a potential wqm station x i shows the ith state of wqi p x i is the probability of occurrence of water quality state i s is the total number of states when there are two different wqis x and y in two different stations transinformation entropy t x y is estimated as 3 mogheir 2003 3 4 t x y i 1 s j 1 s p x i y j ln p x i y j p x i p y j where p x i y j is the probability of simultaneous occurrence of states i and j for wqis x and y in two different stations respectively the joint entropy h jo int for two indices x and y at two potential wqm stations is estimated as follows 5 h jo int h x h y t x y 2 3 2 determining the maximum number of required wqm stations in this step for each number of wqm stations the set with the maximum amount of hjoint is selected as the optimal one the optimal hjoint versus the number of wqm stations is shown in a diagram to figure out the maximum number of required stations by the peak hmax in all subsequent steps hjoint will be normalized by eq 6 6 h jn h jo int h max where h jn is the standardized joint entropy 2 3 3 information transfer index iti in order to calculate iti the data in each wqm station should be shifted in time this process is similar to computing tdc but its concept is different 4 mogheir 2003 4 7 iti t x y h x y 8 h x y i 1 s j 1 s p x i y j ln p x i y j where x is the data without any shifting in time y is the data with shifting in time and h x y is the joint entropy between

eq 1 finally joint entropy in each time step finalh δ t is calculated 10 finalh δ t h jn δ t max iti δ t min max iti 2 δ t min max iti δ t δ t min δ t where the definition of δ t min is the same as eq 1 and h jn δ t is the optimal joint entropy of each time interval at last the number of optimal wqm stations time step finalh δ t pareto front is estimated 2 4 comparing the results of voi and entropy based methods and combining them in this section how to compare the results of two methods and how to combine them is explained as follows 2 4 1 comparing the results the results of the entropy and voi methods should be compared considering some criteria such as 1 tdc and iti diagrams which show the dependency between water quality data in time according to voi and entropy based methods 2 pareto fronts among optimal voi sampling interval and the number of wqm stations and pareto fronts among optimal joint entropy sampling interval and the number of wqm stations and 3 optimal locations of wqm stations for each sampling interval if the results are unignorably different combining the results of the two concepts is recommended 2 4 2 combining the results the results of the entropy and voi methodologies are combined using a simple weighting method 11 hv δ t w 1 finalh δ t w 2 finalvoi δ t 12 s t w 1 w 2 1 where w1 and w2 are relative weights in fact the optimal wqm stations for each sampling interval and required number of stations are the potential wqm locations with a maximum value of hv δ t 2 5 selection of the final spatial and temporal configuration wqm network using evidential reasoning er method the result of former steps is a pareto front among a number of stations sampling interval and the dimensionless combination of voi and joint entropy hv to choose the best alternative the evidential reasoning er method is utilized for more details about the theory and applications of er method in decision making problems refer to xu and yang 2002 2003 2005 yang and xu 2013 and monghasemi et al 2017 the attributes criteria are hv and annual operational cost which is 13 cos t cos t measurement n cos t transport cos t device frequency annually 14 frequency annually 360 δ t where n is the number of optimal wqm stations frequencyannually is the number of sampling missions in a year costmeasurement costtransport and costdevice are the costs of measuring wqvs of each sample transportation and renting measurement devices for one day respectively in eq 13 it is assumed that the maximum number of wqm stations that can be monitored in a day is 5 therefore for more than 5 stations the function is as follows 15 cos t cos t measurement n cos t transport cos t device t frequency annually where t is the number of days of each monitoring mission 3 case study the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data from karkheh reservoir located in the south western part of iran the capacity of this reservoir is 5 9 billion cubic meters which is the largest artificial lake in iran the length and maximum depth of reservoir are 66 km and 105 m respectively the location of karkheh dam and its reservoir is shown in fig 8 the collected data includes necessary information for the simulation calibration and validation of ce qual w2 model the needed data include the geometry of reservoir daily rainfall evaporation relative moisture wind speed air temperature time series of inflow water quantity and quality i e do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 and electrical conductivity ec and results of reservoir wqms in the past 4 results as shown in fig 1 to generate the required data for designing a wqm network the reservoir wqvs are simulated using a calibrated ce qual w2 simulation model this simulation model has been calibrated and verified by rezazadeh 2012 considering wqvs of do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 ec and water temperature fig 9 illustrates segments and layers defined in the simulation model in the second step 11 potential wqm stations shown in fig 10 is selected based on spatial variations of wqvs in karkheh reservoir in the third step wqi of each potential wqm station is estimated based on iran surface water quality index irwqisc for all months during the simulation period the irwqisc was developed by iran department of environment 2013 fig 11 shows the wqi of potential station 1 as an example for using voi concept it is crucial to define utility matrix according to irwqisc in this indicator there are 7 classes for water quality the utility matrix table 1 elements are made by subtracting the center of each class of irwqisc which is shown in supplementary material table s2 elements of this matrix that generally reveal the relative damage cost of wrong actions are mainly negative for example assume that water quality in a location is poor while it is announced as good this error in evaluating water quality would cause a damage equal to 55 units 6th row and 2nd column of table 1 since negative elements of the utility matrix mainly show losses max u a in eq s7 in the supplementary material will be negative and indicates the minimum cost as can be seen in table 1 matrix diagonal elements have very small values comparing to other elements in the fourth step the value of information of each potential wqm station for determining the states of other locations in the reservoir is computed and diagrams of voi length 5 segment of reservoir in ce qual w2 model 5 depth 6 layer 6 is drawn a numerical example for estimating voi is presented in supplementary material in the fifth step the integral of voi length depth diagrams for each set of potential wqm stations is calculated and the set with maximum integral is selected as the optimal wqm stations fig 12 indicates the optimal voi values of each set of wqm stations to calculate the voi values the result of the ce qual w2 model with a 5 day interval is used and it is assumed that the last 10 of the generated data last 4 years is posterior the voi values in fig 12 have been standardized by dividing voi of each set of wqm stations by the voi of all 11 potential wqm stations as the set of 5 wqm stations provides 96 of maximum voi the maximum number of required wqm stations to evaluate water quality of all parts of the reservoir is considered to be 5 i e stations 3 4 6 7 and 9 in fig 10 in the sixth step the sensitivity of results to the percentages of prior and posterior data sets is analyzed table 2 in real world problems prior data is usually long term data collected in the past and posterior data is short term data which has been recently collected as wqm networks in iran are usually redesigned after several years in this paper the last 10 of the generated data is considered as the posterior data in the seventh step according to section 2 2 4 tdc is calculated for each station and different time lags as shown in fig 13 the tdc has basically higher values at primary time lags a very limited seasonal correlation can be also observed in some potential wqm stations at last the average tdc of all diagrams in every time step is presented as a unique curve shown in fig 14 in the eighth step for each sampling interval from 5 to 180 days the optimal location of wqm stations is determined fig 15 illustrates the optimal voi versus sampling interval curves for each number of wqm stations according to unep who 1996 at least 2 wqm stations is necessary for karkheh reservoir so there are no curves for 1 station in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 by increasing the number of wqm stations or decreasing sampling interval the voi rises and the decision maker receives more information about the quality of water in the reservoir it is also shown that by increasing the number of stations the curves get closer and the voi which is provided by each new station is decreased each point on curves presented in fig 15 introduces a set of optimal wqm stations as an example table 3 presents the optimal sets of 2 wqm stations with various sampling intervals to validate the results of the voi method they are compared with those of the entropy method for using the discrete entropy theory first the number of classes of reservoir water quality states is determined nc in eq 2 is equal to 480 so the maximum number of classes is 9 but in this way the probabilities of occurrence of some water quality classes are zero in all years of simulation hence 7 classes of states are assumed which coincidentally is the same as the number of water quality classes in irwqisc in the second stage for each number of wqm stations at a specific sampling interval the set of wqm stations with the maximum amount of hjoint is searched and the diagram of optimal hjoint versus the number of wqm stations is drawn fig 16 according to fig 16 hmax occurs at the set of 8 wqm stations hjn in fig 17 denotes optimal standardized joint entropy which is equal to the division of hjoint of each set of wqm stations to hmax since the maximum amount of hjoint occurs at 8 wqm stations it is logical that spatio temporal optimization is done up to this number of stations however to compare the results of the voi and entropy based methods the spatio temporal optimization by entropy theory is done up to 5 wqm stations which were the maximum number of required stations in voi method in the third stage iti is calculated by shifting time series of water quality in time fig 18 presents iti versus lag time curves for all potential wqm stations at last the iti of all potential wqm stations is averaged in each lag time which leads to a unique diagram fig 19 in the fourth stage for each sampling interval the locations of optimal wqm stations is determined the result is a pareto front among hjn and sampling interval for each number of wqm stations shown in fig 20 each point on the curves presents a set of optimal reservoir wqm stations i e table 4 now the results of voi and entropy methods are compared from different aspects 1 graphs of iti and tdc versus time lags fig 21 the diagrams of these methods are similar but the final increase in tdc by approaching the corresponding time in the next year is much more since the difference in the trend of these two diagrams occurs before 250 days in karkheh reservoir this trend does not change the results if the final sampling interval is less than 250 days 2 pareto front among voi and hjn sampling interval the number of wqm stations figs 15 and 20 these two figures and their interpretations are similar however the corresponding value of hjn is a little less than voi 3 the location of optimal wqm station for each sampling intervals as an example table 4 compares the main results of spatio temporal optimization of wqm network based on voi and entropy methods however these results are not the same according to entropy theory the wqm stations with less similar information to other stations in the reservoir and more temporal fluctuation in water quality are selected for example station 1 that is near the reservoir inflow and station 10 which located near the reservoir outlets are selected on the other hand in the voi method the decision maker s opinion about value or damage of right or wrong actions taken on the basis of new messages significantly affect the results in addition a set of reservoir wqm stations which offers better insight into water quality of other parts of the reservoir and have more valuable updated probabilities p s m is chosen for instance station 1 and 10 are rarely selected because these wqm stations do not give a good insight into states of other parts of karkheh reservoir as the entropy and voi methods have different theoretical backgrounds in terms of transinformation among stations it is recommended to combine their results using a weighting technique two voi and entropy approaches are combined as explained in section 2 4 2 according to engineering judgments the relative importance of voi and entropy is the same so w 1 w 2 0 5 in eqs 11 and 12 the results of the hybrid voi entropy method is demonstrated in fig 22 each point on the curves shown in the fig 22 refers to the location of a set of wqm stations listed in table 5 as can be seen in table 5 there are many alternatives for the decision maker to choose hence a multi criteria decision making technique i e er method is used the process starts when alternatives attributes and weights are inputted to intelligent decision system for multiple criteria assessment ids software version 1 2 the attributes are hv 7 standardized value of the combined voi and joint entropy 7 and the total monitoring cost fig 22 presents the hv values of the alternatives it should be noted that alternatives with sampling intervals more than 60 days are not considered because of having hv 0 5 also alternatives with sampling intervals less than 15 days are not considered due to economic aspects the cost of each alternative a set of wqm stations is calculated using eqs 16 and 17 all costs have been estimated based on consultations with some water quality examination laboratories in iran in 2016 in eq 13 costmeasurement is the cost of measuring do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 ec and temperature in a laboratory or at the site which is 30 u s dollars as well as costtransport and costdevice which are both 42 u s dollars for one day therefore the annual cost for monitoring the karkheh reservoir is determined as follows 16 cos t 1 30 n 84 360 t where t is sampling interval d and n is the number of optimal wqm stations in eq 16 it is assumed that do is measured by a thermometer after water sampling to have more accurate water temperature measurements it is suggested to use a multi parameter in situ water quality measurement instrument with a daily renting cost of 556 u s dollars this cost is added to the former costdevice i e 42 dollars in this way the annual monitoring cost is 17 cos t 2 30 n 640 360 t table 6 presents the attributes values for different alternatives in terms of costs there are two groups of attributes 1 hv and cos t 1 and 2 hv and cos t 2 so alternatives are ranked twice tables 7 and 8 show the sensitivity of the best 6 alternatives ranking to relative weights of attributes according to tables 7 and 8 when the relative weight of hv is more than that of cost which means that the importance of knowing valid water quality is more than cost 6 best alternatives are almost constant but their rankings may change otherwise the 6 best alternatives are so sensitive to relative weights in the author s opinion the temperature should be measured in situ and the importance of recognizing valid water quality is equal or more than the monitoring cost when equal weights are considered for both attributes alternative number 12 has the best rank this alternative stands for 5 optimal wqm stations and a sampling interval of 25 days table 6 and the selected stations numbers are 3 4 6 7 and 9 table 5 since the width of karkheh reservoir is not large the selected stations can provide appropriate information about the water body however when the limited variations of water quality along the reservoir width are important according to the author s engineering judgment two stations should be considered at segment 50 3 km distant from the longitudinal axis 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a methodology was presented for the optimal spatio temporal design of wqm networks for reservoirs using a hybrid voi entropy technique in the entropy method wqm stations with more temporal fluctuations in their water quality and less similar data to other stations are chosen in voi method the value of collected data and information for which a decision maker is willing to pay is optimized such that wqm stations which give good insight into water quality of other parts of the reservoir are selected according to voi theory a new information is valuable if it leads to making the correct decision and appropriate actions by proposing a hybrid voi entropy methodology the advantages of both voi and entropy theories are used for designing a monitoring system of reservoirs in this methodology some criteria such as minimizing total monitoring cost reducing redundant information maximizing the coverage of the monitoring network and evaluating spatial and temporal fluctuations of water quality are explicitly or implicitly taken into account to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the methodology it is applied to the largest man made water reservoir in iran the results showed that 5 wqm stations i e stations 3 4 6 7 and 9 and a 25 day sampling interval is the best configuration for the monitoring network of the karkheh reservoir in future works the current methodology should be extended to provide monitoring stations in the three dimensions as well as seasonal monitoring stations and sampling frequencies appendix a supplementary

7457,this paper presents a new methodology for optimizing water quality monitoring wqm networks of reservoirs and lakes using the concept of the value of information voi and utilizing results of a calibrated numerical water quality simulation model with reference to the value of information theory water quality of every checkpoint with a specific prior probability differs in time after analyzing water quality samples taken from potential monitoring points the posterior probabilities are updated using the baye s theorem and voi of the samples is calculated in the next step the stations with maximum voi is selected as optimal stations this process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network locations for each interval the results of the proposed voi based methodology is compared with those obtained using an entropy theoretic approach as the results of the two methodologies would be partially different in the next step the results are combined using a weighting method finally the optimal sampling interval and location of wqm stations are chosen using the evidential reasoning er decision making method the efficiency and applicability of the methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data of the karkheh reservoir in the southwestern part of iran keywords spatio temporal optimization water quality monitoring network reservoir value of information theory entropy theory evidential reasoning method 1 introduction over the last decades many dams have been constructed to address human needs such as supplying drinking industrial and irrigation water demands fulfilling these goals and supplying water with moderately good quality necessitate water quality monitoring of reservoirs the main issue in this type of monitoring is financial burden of sampling and analysis of water samples to tackle this issue and provide comprehensive information about the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in these important water bodies water quality monitoring wqm networks for reservoirs should be optimally designed because of three dimensional variations of water quality in reservoirs monitoring of water quality in such systems is different from other water resources there are many statistical studies on river polder groundwater and rainfall monitoring network design many of these studies are entropy based e g krstanovic and singh 1992a b harmancioglu and alpaslan 1992 mogheir et al 2006 alfonso et al 2010a b mishra and coulibaly 2010 stosic et al 2017 hosseini and kerachian

literature on the optimization of monitoring networks of rivers polders and groundwater systems previous works on the optimization of monitoring networks of reservoirs have been very limited according to unep who 1996 1 united nations environment programme unep 1 long term wqm with one station next to the center or the deepest part of the lake is necessary for lakes with appropriate horizontal mixing also the number of wqm stations must be more than one in stratified lakes this number is recommended to estimate by log 10 s where s is the lake area in km2 which can be utilized for great lakes with a vast variety of deep basins and a wide range of narrow bays unep who 1996 obviously this guideline cannot be used for finding the location of wqm stations in thermally stratified reservoirs jimenez et al 2005 developed a methodology for the design of quasi optimal monitoring networks for lakes and reservoirs the main components of their methodology were a numerical model which was used due to the lack of field data a kriging based module for spatial interpolation and getting estimates from the available monitoring networks and a genetic algorithm based optimization model to generate the set of non dominated optimal accuracy vs costs monitoring networks beveridge et al 2012 utilized a geostatistical method to determine optimal wqm stations of the great winnipeg lake by clustering the lake and omitting stations with redundant information they combined the kriging method which suggested redundant stations considering all existing stations and the local moran s i values which determined redundant stations of each cluster kovacs et al 2014 developed a method on the basis of combined cluster and discriminant analysis ccda to classify sampling sites into homogeneous groups they declared that their technique is applicable to reduce the number of wqm stations in lakes yenilmez et al 2014 proposed a model for determining the optimal location of wqm stations to measure dissolved oxygen do in porsuk reservoir by the combination of kernel density estimation kde and ordinary kriging methods the kde method was utilized to decrease congestion of wqm stations which resulted in the reduction of number of stations from 65 to 10 and the introduction of 5 locations for new stations lee et al 2014 proposed an approach based on information theory to optimize the location of wqm stations in a specific depth in a reservoir the results revealed that average water quality at optimal sampling stations was similar to this average in all potential wqm points nikoo et al 2016 developed a multi objective optimization model based on the non dominated sorting genetic algorithms nsga ii optimization model entropy theory a calibrated numerical model based on ce qual w2 and bargaining theory to optimize the location of wqm stations in karkheh reservoir considering utility function of main stakeholders in this study only spatial optimization of wqm network was considered recently aboutalebi et al 2017 optimized the location of wqm stations in a reservoir based on nsga ii optimization model with the objects of minimizing prediction error of methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe and the average time of mtbe detection the concept of voi was first used by decision makers to figure out whether it would be economic to invest in obtaining further stochastic information or not alfonso and price 2012 previous applications of voi theory are mainly rooted in two studies 1 hirshleifer and riley 1979 who introduced the voi theory in order to address some decision making problems under uncertainty and 2 alfonso and price 2012 who optimized the location of hydrometric monitoring stations by applying hydrodynamic models associated with the voi concept they searched the location of some hydrometric monitoring stations along a polder system in the netherlands to minimize flood damage typically the existing approaches for the optimization of reservoir wqm stations specify the optimal location of wqm stations in only one dimension and none of them provides optimal sampling interval in addition in previous works the voi theory has been used to optimize the location of wqm stations in some water bodies such as polders not reservoirs in this paper a new methodology is developed to spatially and temporally optimize a reservoir wqm network in this regard water quality in the reservoir is estimated based on the results of a calibrated numerical simulation model the wqm network is optimized using the concept of value of information and entropy theory and the results are compared if the results of two methods are different they might be combined using a weighting method and the spatio temporal optimization of the monitoring network is done using a hybrid voi entropy method in the final step the optimal wqm stations and sampling interval are specified using the evidential reasoning method the karkheh reservoir in iran is taken into account as a case study in order to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of the proposed methodology 2 methodologies a flowchart of the proposed methodology for spatio temporal optimization of reservoir wqm networks is presented in fig 1 different steps of this flowchart are explained in the following sections 2 1 data collection the collected information includes necessary data for the calibration and validation of the reservoir water quality simulation model i e ce qual w2 the physical characteristics of reservoir evaporation rate relative moisture wind speed weather temperature reservoir operating rules and time series of inflow quantity and quality are the main inputs of the simulation model the simulation model is calibrated and verified using observed data obtained from existing monitoring networks to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of water quality in the reservoir a suitable water quality index wqi should be used 2 2 value of information voi generally water quality in a monitoring station with a specific prior probability varies in time by obtaining new data the posterior probability and the voi of the new data can be estimated using the baye s theorem a combination of monitoring stations with maximum voi can be selected as optimal wqm configuration this process is repeated for each sampling interval to obtain optimal monitoring network characteristics for each water quality sampling interval in the following sections more details about the proposed methodology for estimating voi of monitoring stations are presented 2 2 1 calculation of voi for various sets of potential wqm locations at first a decision maker has an opinion about states of water quality in various part of the reservoir based on previous observations or simulations after receiving new information messages his or her viewpoint will be updated which may contribute to taking actions if messages assist the decision maker to do the right thing they are valuable otherwise they cause damages hence according to the voi concept messages are evaluated and quantified based on the right or wrong outlook given to decision maker alfonso and price 2012 the steps of calculating voi of each station in order to estimate the states of other points are given in the supplementary material 2 2 2 determination of the maximum number of required wqm stations actually points c and d in the supplementary material can be any of potential wqm locations in this step the voi of potential wqm station c point 5 2 it is assumed that point 5 is located in 5 km distance from an origin in an arbitrary one dimension reservoir 2 in figs 2 and 3 for determining states of other potential wqm locations is calculated fig 2 and a curve is fitted to these voi values fig 3 in figs 2 and 3 it is assumed that a reservoir is simulated in one dimension and point 5 is a wqm station located in 5 km from an origin e g from the dam in an arbitrary reservoir that determines states of other potential wqm locations in the same depth it should also be noted that if the reservoir is simulated in two dimensions the voi diagram would be a three dimensional surface as presented in fig 3 the maximum voi occurs at point 5 it means that if a decision maker wants to know just the state of point 5 he should put a new wqm station at this point and his willingness to pay for putting a station decreases by getting away from this point each potential wqm location has a special voi curve and in all voi diagrams voi of each curve is normalized by dividing all voi values by the maximum voi value fig 4 shows the schematic voi diagrams for stations 3 5 and 7 the total voi of each potential wqm location is equal to the integral of its voi curve obviously if just one optimal wqm station is adequate the station with maximum total voi is chosen as can be seen in fig 4 the unbroken and the dashed lines respectively show the value of information of point 3 or 5 for evaluating the state of point 6 which implies a decision maker s willingness to pay for establishing a station in point 3 or 5 if he or she wants to know states of point 6 since the dashed line is longer than the unbroken line if station 5 is established station 3 would not provide any further information for determining the state of point 6 consequently if more than one station is needed the overlap of curves is not considered and the maximum value voi curves i e an envelope curve is assumed as voi curve of the set of stations as an example the total voi of both stations 3 and 5 is shown in fig 5 finally the total voi values of different sets of stations are calculated by integrating the envelope curves and a set with maximum voi value is selected as the optimal set of wqm stations at last the diagram of optimal voi value versus the number of wqm stations is drawn in order to find the maximum number of required wqm stations although voi values are normalized standardized the total voi value which is the integral of corresponding voi curve is not therefore the total voi value of each set of optimal wqm stations should be normalized by dividing its value by the total voi of the set of all potential wqm stations 2 2 3 sensitivity analysis over the percentages of data used to calculate prior and posterior probabilities sensitivity analysis is done by changing the percentage of data used for the calculation of prior and posterior probabilities and the estimation of the effect of this change on the obtained voi and the optimal location of wqm stations 2 2 4 time dependence coefficient when water quality of a reservoir is monitored at each station there is a dependency between water quality data in time which is shown by a time dependence coefficient tdc this coefficient is different with temporal correlation coefficient in statistics tdc is calculated using a new approach in which at a potential wqm station existing data is shifted in time and the value of information of one time data for estimating states of other times is calculated for different time lags each potential wqm location has a specific time dependence coefficient diagram so in order to decrease the complexity of using tdcs in spatio temporal optimization it is recommended to average tdcs of all potential wqm locations in each time lag to draw a unified tdc lag for all parts of the reservoir fig 6 fig 6 illustrates a clear cut example of tdc diagram in different time lags obviously the monitored data gives the decision maker an insight into reservoir water quality before and after monitoring time it is assumed that tdcs of former and later time lags are the same the effect of tdc is shown in the process of spatio temporal optimization by multiplying optimal voi of each time interval voi δ t by the summation of these coefficients 1 finalvoi δ t voi δ t max tdc δ t min max tdc 2 δ t min max tdc δ t δ t min δ t where δ t is the time interval δ t min is the minimum possible time interval regarding the output of reservoir simulation model as an example for eq 1 consider fig 6 as the tdc diagram where δ t min 10 d and δ t 60 d hence fig 6 should be drawn for every 60 days which is shown in fig 7 the summation of maximum amounts of coefficients in 10 20 60 days should be acquired as the final tdc of 60 days time step finalvoi 60 voi 60 1 0 97 0 90 0 75 0 90 0 97 10 60 2 2 5 spatio temporal optimization of wqm network in this stage for each sampling interval and each number of wqm stations voi of all combination of stations set is calculated the set of stations which have the maximum amount of voi is selected as the optimal one the result will be the pareto front among voi and sampling interval for a different number of wqm stations 2 3 optimization of wqm network using the entropy theory as presented in fig 1 spatio temporal optimization of reservoir wqm stations can also be done by utilizing the entropy theory in the following subsections the main steps of the procedure are described 2 3 1 calculation of joint entropy for various sets of potential wqm locations for comparing the results of voi and entropy methods all stages of section 2 2 are done by entropy method too however the results of the voi and entropy based methods could be different because they use different concepts for estimating information content of observed data in the discrete entropy theory the range of variation of each water quality variable should be discretized to nci classes according to the following equation masoumi and kerachian 2009 2 nci 1 1 33 ln nc where nc is the time series size of the data in each station the marginal entropy h x is computed by 3 h x i 1 s p x i ln p x i where x denotes wqi at a potential wqm station x i shows the ith state of wqi p x i is the probability of occurrence of water quality state i s is the total number of states when there are two different wqis x and y in two different stations transinformation entropy t x y is estimated as 3 mogheir 2003 3 4 t x y i 1 s j 1 s p x i y j ln p x i y j p x i p y j where p x i y j is the probability of simultaneous occurrence of states i and j for wqis x and y in two different stations respectively the joint entropy h jo int for two indices x and y at two potential wqm stations is estimated as follows 5 h jo int h x h y t x y 2 3 2 determining the maximum number of required wqm stations in this step for each number of wqm stations the set with the maximum amount of hjoint is selected as the optimal one the optimal hjoint versus the number of wqm stations is shown in a diagram to figure out the maximum number of required stations by the peak hmax in all subsequent steps hjoint will be normalized by eq 6 6 h jn h jo int h max where h jn is the standardized joint entropy 2 3 3 information transfer index iti in order to calculate iti the data in each wqm station should be shifted in time this process is similar to computing tdc but its concept is different 4 mogheir 2003 4 7 iti t x y h x y 8 h x y i 1 s j 1 s p x i y j ln p x i y j where x is the data without any shifting in time y is the data with shifting in time and h x y is the joint entropy between x and y as iti diagrams of potential wqm stations are different the average iti for each time lag iti δ t is estimated as follows 9 iti δ t n 1 n iti n δ t n where the definition of δ t is the same as eq 1 finally joint entropy in each time step finalh δ t is calculated 10 finalh δ t h jn δ t max iti δ t min max iti 2 δ t min max iti δ t δ t min δ t where the definition of δ t min is the same as eq 1 and h jn δ t is the optimal joint entropy of each time interval at last the number of optimal wqm stations time step finalh δ t pareto front is estimated 2 4 comparing the results of voi and entropy based methods and combining them in this section how to compare the results of two methods and how to combine them is explained as follows 2 4 1 comparing the results the results of the entropy and voi methods should be compared considering some criteria such as 1 tdc and iti diagrams which show the dependency between water quality data in time according to voi and entropy based methods 2 pareto fronts among optimal voi sampling interval and the number of wqm stations and pareto fronts among optimal joint entropy sampling interval and the number of wqm stations and 3 optimal locations of wqm stations for each sampling interval if the results are unignorably different combining the results of the two concepts is recommended 2 4 2 combining the results the results of the entropy and voi methodologies are combined using a simple weighting method 11 hv δ t w 1 finalh δ t w 2 finalvoi δ t 12 s t w 1 w 2 1 where w1 and w2 are relative weights in fact the optimal wqm stations for each sampling interval and required number of stations are the potential wqm locations with a maximum value of hv δ t 2 5 selection of the final spatial and temporal configuration wqm network using evidential reasoning er method the result of former steps is a pareto front among a number of stations sampling interval and the dimensionless combination of voi and joint entropy hv to choose the best alternative the evidential reasoning er method is utilized for more details about the theory and applications of er method in decision making problems refer to xu and yang 2002 2003 2005 yang and xu 2013 and monghasemi et al 2017 the attributes criteria are hv and annual operational cost which is 13 cos t cos t measurement n cos t transport cos t device frequency annually 14 frequency annually

each sample transportation and renting measurement devices for one day respectively in eq 13 it is assumed that the maximum number of wqm stations that can be monitored in a day is 5 therefore for more than 5 stations the function is as follows 15 cos t cos t measurement n cos t transport cos t device t frequency annually where t is the number of days of each monitoring mission 3 case study the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology are evaluated using available water quantity and quality data from karkheh reservoir located in the south western part of iran the capacity of this reservoir is 5 9 billion cubic meters which is the largest artificial lake in iran the length and maximum depth of reservoir are 66 km and 105 m respectively the location of karkheh dam and its reservoir is shown in fig 8 the collected data includes necessary information for the simulation calibration and validation of ce qual w2 model the needed data include the geometry of reservoir daily rainfall evaporation relative moisture wind speed air temperature time series of inflow water quantity and quality i e do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 and electrical conductivity ec and results of reservoir wqms in the past 4 results as shown in fig 1 to generate the required data for designing a wqm network the reservoir wqvs are simulated using a calibrated ce qual w2 simulation model this simulation model has been calibrated and verified by rezazadeh 2012 considering wqvs of do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 ec and water temperature fig 9 illustrates segments and layers defined in the simulation model in the second step 11 potential wqm stations shown in fig 10 is selected based on spatial variations of wqvs in karkheh reservoir in the third step wqi of each potential wqm station is estimated based on iran surface water quality index irwqisc for all months during the simulation period the irwqisc was developed by iran department of environment 2013 fig 11 shows the wqi of potential station 1 as an example for using voi concept it is crucial to define utility matrix according to irwqisc in this indicator there are 7 classes for water quality the utility matrix table 1 elements are made by subtracting the center of each class of irwqisc which is shown in supplementary material table s2 elements of this matrix that generally reveal the relative damage cost of wrong actions are mainly negative for example assume that water quality in a location is poor while it is announced as good this error in evaluating water quality would cause a damage equal to 55 units 6th row and 2nd column of table 1 since negative elements of the utility matrix mainly show losses max u a in eq s7 in the supplementary material will be negative and indicates the minimum cost as can be seen in table 1 matrix diagonal elements have very small values comparing to other elements in the fourth step the value of information of each potential wqm station for determining the states of other locations in the reservoir is computed and diagrams of voi length 5 segment of reservoir in ce qual w2 model 5 depth 6 layer 6 is drawn a numerical example for estimating voi is presented in supplementary material in the fifth step the integral of voi length depth diagrams for each set of potential wqm stations is calculated and the set with maximum integral is selected as the optimal wqm stations fig 12 indicates the optimal voi values of each set of wqm stations to calculate the voi values the result of the ce qual w2 model with a 5 day interval is used and it is assumed that the last 10 of the generated data last 4 years is posterior the voi values in fig 12 have been standardized by dividing voi of each set of wqm stations by the voi of all 11 potential wqm stations as the set of 5 wqm stations provides 96 of maximum voi the maximum number of required wqm stations to evaluate water quality of all parts of the reservoir is considered to be 5 i e stations 3 4 6 7 and 9 in fig 10 in the sixth step the sensitivity of results to the percentages of prior and posterior data sets is analyzed table 2 in real world problems prior data is usually long term data collected in the past and posterior data is short term data which has been recently collected as wqm networks in iran are usually redesigned after several years in this paper the last 10 of the generated data is considered as the posterior data in the seventh step according to section 2 2 4 tdc is calculated for each station and different time lags as shown in fig 13 the tdc has basically higher values at primary time lags a very limited seasonal correlation can be also observed in some potential wqm stations at last the average tdc of all diagrams in every time step is presented as a unique curve shown in fig 14 in the eighth step for each sampling interval from 5 to 180 days the optimal location of wqm stations is determined fig 15 illustrates the optimal voi versus sampling interval curves for each number of wqm stations according to unep who 1996 at least 2 wqm stations is necessary for karkheh reservoir so there are no curves for 1 station in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 by increasing the number of wqm stations or decreasing sampling interval the voi rises and the decision maker receives more information about the quality of water in the reservoir it is also shown that by increasing the number of stations the curves get closer and the voi which is provided by each new station is decreased each point on curves presented in fig 15 introduces a set of optimal wqm stations as an example table 3 presents the optimal sets of 2 wqm stations with various sampling intervals to validate the results of the voi method they are compared with those of the entropy method for using the discrete entropy theory first the number of classes of reservoir water quality states is determined nc in eq 2 is equal to 480 so the maximum number of classes is 9 but in this way the probabilities of occurrence of some water quality classes are zero in all years of simulation hence 7 classes of states are assumed which coincidentally is the same as the number of water quality classes in irwqisc in the second stage for each number of wqm stations at a specific sampling interval the set of wqm stations with the maximum amount of hjoint is searched and the diagram of optimal hjoint versus the number of wqm stations is drawn fig 16 according to fig 16 hmax occurs at the set of 8 wqm stations hjn in fig 17 denotes optimal standardized joint entropy which is equal to the division of hjoint of each set of wqm stations to hmax since the maximum amount of hjoint occurs at 8 wqm stations it is logical that spatio temporal optimization is done up to this number of stations however to compare the results of the voi and entropy based methods the spatio temporal optimization by entropy theory is done up to 5 wqm stations which were the maximum number of required stations in voi method in the third stage iti is calculated by shifting time series of water quality in time fig 18 presents iti versus lag time curves for all potential wqm stations at last the iti of all potential wqm stations is averaged in each lag time which leads to a unique diagram fig 19 in the fourth stage for each sampling interval the locations of optimal wqm stations is determined the result is a pareto front among hjn and sampling interval for each number of wqm stations shown in fig 20 each point on the curves presents a set of optimal reservoir wqm stations i e table 4 now the results of voi and entropy methods are compared from different aspects 1 graphs of iti and tdc versus time lags fig 21 the diagrams of these methods are similar but the final increase in tdc by approaching the corresponding time in the next year is much more since the difference in the trend of these two diagrams occurs before 250 days in karkheh reservoir this trend does not change the results if the final sampling interval is less than 250 days 2 pareto front among voi and hjn sampling interval the number of wqm stations figs 15 and 20 these two figures and their interpretations are similar however the corresponding value of hjn is a little less than voi 3 the location of optimal wqm station for each sampling intervals as an example table 4 compares the main results of spatio temporal optimization of wqm network based on voi and entropy methods however these results are not the same according to entropy theory the wqm stations with less similar information to other stations in the reservoir and more temporal fluctuation in water quality are selected for example station 1 that is near the reservoir inflow and station 10 which located near the reservoir outlets are selected on the other hand in the voi method the decision maker s opinion about value or damage of right or wrong actions taken on the basis of new messages significantly affect the results in addition a set of reservoir wqm stations which offers better insight into water quality of other parts of the reservoir and have more valuable updated probabilities p s m is chosen for instance station 1 and 10 are rarely selected because these wqm stations do not give a good insight into states of other parts of karkheh reservoir as the entropy and voi methods have different theoretical backgrounds in terms of transinformation among stations it is recommended to combine their results using a weighting technique two voi and entropy approaches are combined as explained in section 2 4 2 according to engineering judgments the relative importance of voi and entropy is the same so w 1 w 2 0 5 in eqs 11 and 12 the results of the hybrid voi entropy method is demonstrated in fig 22 each point on the curves shown in the fig 22 refers to the location of a set of wqm stations listed in table 5 as can be seen in table 5 there are many alternatives for the decision maker to choose hence a multi criteria decision making technique i e er method is used the process starts when alternatives attributes and weights are inputted to intelligent decision system for multiple criteria assessment ids software version 1 2 the attributes are hv 7 standardized value of the combined voi and joint entropy 7 and the total monitoring cost fig 22 presents the hv values of the alternatives it should be noted that alternatives with sampling intervals more than 60 days are not considered because of having hv 0 5 also alternatives with sampling intervals less than 15 days are not considered due to economic aspects the cost of each alternative a set of wqm stations is calculated using eqs 16 and 17 all costs have been estimated based on consultations with some water quality examination laboratories in iran in 2016 in eq 13 costmeasurement is the cost of measuring do no 3 po 4 3 nh 4 ec and temperature in a laboratory or at the site which is 30 u s dollars as well as costtransport and costdevice which are both 42 u s dollars for one day therefore the annual cost for monitoring the karkheh reservoir is determined as follows 16 cos t 1 30 n 84 360 t where t is sampling interval d and n is the number of optimal wqm stations in eq 16 it is assumed that do is measured by a thermometer after water sampling to have more accurate water temperature measurements it is suggested to use a multi parameter in situ water quality measurement instrument with a daily renting cost of 556 u s dollars this cost is added to the former costdevice i e 42 dollars in this way the annual monitoring cost is 17 cos t 2 30 n 640 360 t table 6 presents the attributes values for different alternatives in terms of costs there are two groups of attributes 1 hv and cos t 1 and 2 hv and cos t 2 so alternatives are ranked twice tables 7 and 8 show the sensitivity of the best 6 alternatives ranking to relative weights of attributes according to tables 7 and 8 when the relative weight of hv is more than that of cost which means that the importance of knowing valid water quality is more than cost 6 best alternatives are almost constant but their rankings may change otherwise the 6 best alternatives are so sensitive to relative weights in the author s opinion the temperature should be measured in situ and the importance of recognizing valid water quality is equal or more than the monitoring cost when equal weights are considered for both attributes alternative number 12 has the best rank this alternative stands for 5 optimal wqm stations and a sampling interval of 25 days table 6 and the selected stations numbers are 3 4 6 7 and 9 table 5 since the width of karkheh reservoir is not large the selected stations can provide appropriate information about the water body however when the limited variations of water quality along the reservoir width are important according to the author s engineering judgment two stations should be considered at segment 50 3 km distant from the longitudinal axis 5 summary and conclusion in this paper a methodology was presented for the optimal spatio temporal design of wqm networks for reservoirs using a hybrid voi entropy technique in the entropy method wqm stations with more temporal fluctuations in their water quality and less similar data to other stations are chosen in voi method the value of collected data and information for which a decision maker is willing to pay is optimized such that wqm stations which give good insight into water quality of other parts of the reservoir are selected according to voi theory a new information is valuable if it leads to making the correct decision and appropriate actions by proposing a hybrid voi entropy methodology the advantages of both voi and entropy theories are used for designing a monitoring system of reservoirs in this methodology some criteria such as minimizing total monitoring cost reducing redundant information maximizing the coverage of the monitoring network and evaluating spatial and temporal fluctuations of water quality are explicitly or implicitly taken into account to evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the methodology it is applied to the largest man made water reservoir in iran the results showed that 5 wqm stations i e stations 3 4 6 7 and 9 and a 25 day sampling interval is the best configuration for the monitoring network of the karkheh reservoir in future works the current methodology should be extended to provide monitoring stations in the three dimensions as well as seasonal monitoring stations and sampling frequencies appendix a supplementary

7458,the inverse problem of groundwater models is often ill posed and model parameters are likely to be poorly constrained identifiability is improved if diverse data types are used for parameter estimation however some models including detailed solute transport models are further limited by prohibitive computation times this often precludes the use of concentration data for parameter estimation even if those data are available in the case of surface water groundwater sw gw models concentration data can provide sw gw mixing ratios which efficiently constrain the estimate of exchange flow but are rarely used we propose to reduce computational limits by simulating sw gw exchange at a sink well or drain based on particle tracking under steady state flow conditions particle tracking is used to simulate advective transport a comparison between the particle tracking surrogate model and an advective dispersive model shows that dispersion can often be neglected when the mixing ratio is computed for a sink allowing for use of the particle tracking surrogate model the surrogate model was implemented to solve the inverse problem for a real sw gw transport problem with heads and concentrations combined in a weighted hybrid objective function the resulting inversion showed markedly reduced uncertainty in the transmissivity field compared to calibration on head data alone keywords particle tracking surrogate model stream aquifer null space monte carlo 1 introduction parameters involved in groundwater models are generally obtained by history matching against hydraulic head data however this approach generally leads to ill posed inverse problems anderman and hill 1997 carrera et al 2005 this is particularly the case for groundwater surface water gw sw models where independent estimates of surface water in outflow are most important for constraining surface water exchanges fleckenstein et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 the use of additional diverse field observations can alleviate the ill posedness zhou et al 2014 however successful examples of including solute concentration for parameter estimation are scarce christiansen et al 1995 hunt et al 2006 medina and carrera 1996 pool et al 2015 the computational burden of simulating advection and dispersion at the field scale is a primary barrier to the use of concentration data for gw sw interaction investigations depending on the problem a single simulation of advective dispersive transport over periods of years to decades may require hours even on modern computers hill and tiedeman 2006 konikow 2011 several thousands of model runs are generally necessary to complete parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis anderson et al 2015 this suggests that alternative approaches to simulate solute transport that reduce the computation effort could have significant advantages for modeling and understanding gw sw processes transport models fall into two general categories in all cases solution of the flow equation provides heads water fluxes and flow directions but as discussed by konikow 2011 transport modeling approaches are then based on either i modeling transport as advection dominated or ii solving the full advective dispersive transport problem theoretically measured concentrations can only be used to constrain the more complex models which consider dispersion konikow 2011 only few cases that included concentration data for parameter estimation were based on advective dispersion models christiansen et al 1995 fienen et al 2009 tonkin and doherty 2009 all modeling efforts require trade offs hill et al 2016 one common example is that aquifer parameters may be considered to be homogeneous to allow for examination of other processes such as gw sw exchange thus few studies have attempted to infer heterogeneous conductivity fields based on concentration data carniato et al 2015 the goal of this study is to examine alternative modeling strategies to support such investigations over the past decade surrogate modeling has been used to reduce the computational requirements of some hydrogeological problems surrogate models are lower fidelity models that adequately capture the most important features of the original complex model while reducing the computational cost razavi et al 2012 surrogates are used most often during parameter estimation or uncertainty analysis which require numerous model runs however a candidate surrogate model should meet certain criteria burrows and doherty 2015 i the surrogate model must compute the key outputs made by the complex model ii the output values of the surrogate model should be reasonably consistent with those of the original complex model and iii parameters used by both models must play similar roles our specific objective was to test whether particle tracking could act as a suitable surrogate for more computationally demanding advective dispersive models thereby allowing for the use of concentration data to constrain heterogeneous conductivity fields particle tracking techniques have been compared to advective dispersive transport models such as mt3dms for example gusyev et al 2014 found very similar simulated tritium concentrations based on particle tracking modpath modflow and solute transport mt3dms modflow models advective transport has also been used in sw gw modeling to reproduce temperature observations brookfield et al 2009 engeler et al 2011 kurtz et al 2014 mouhri et al 2013 lake plume elevation fienen et al 2009 hunt et al 2006 advective front locations anderman and hill 1997 hill and tiedeman 2006 travel time between a lake and a well pint et al 2003 or to delineate the hyporheic zone kasahara and wondzell 2003 storey et al 2003 particle tracking has already been used for parameter estimation pint et al 2003 hunt et al 2006 however particle tracking has never been used as a surrogate model for advective dispersive transport to simulate sw gw exchanges nor has it been used with head and flow observations at production wells to constrain heterogeneous conductivity fields in this study we do not use concentration data directly for calibration rather we use simulated and inferred mixing ratios which describe the fractional mixing of several end member waters with different chemical compositions carrera et al 2004 rueedi et al 2005 in this case we examine the mixing of surface water sw and groundwater gw mixing ratios are commonly inferred from concentrations measured in field collected water samples we proposed a method to use modpath results to define mixing ratios that can be compared with field derived values we first benchmark our modpath based approach against results derived from mt3dms advective dispersion model results thereafter we apply our particle tracking surrogate model to a case study and examine the benefits and limitations compared to calibration with head data alone 2 a proxy model for advective dispersive transport 2 1 approach to test our proposed proxy modeling approach we simulate sw gw mixing in a pumping well under steady state flow conditions the value of the mixing ratio may range between 0 gw only to 1 sw only for the sake of simplicity we assume that mass transport is non reactive the approach is based on using backward tracking to determine the origins of a set of particles disseminated around a sink point of interest well or drain the method is based on the assumption that particle velocity and concentrations can be used to define the mass flux coming from a flow tube atteia 2011 the procedure to compute the mixing ratio β at a given sink point can be detailed as follows 1 the flow field is computed for steady state conditions with the flow model 2 a large number of particles 1000 are disseminated around the sink point of interest 3 backward particle tracking is conducted from the sink point back to the origin of flow stream and boundary condition 4 the mixing ratio at the sink point β is then calculated from the fraction of the particles that originate in the stream or at a boundary the procedure for the computation of the concentration associated with each particle βi depends on the type of the source point fig 1 when a particle originates from an external boundary condition prescribed head or flow the particle concentration as it reaches the sink simply corresponds to the mixing ratio of gw βi 0 fig 1 a in contrast a particle originating from an aquifer cell in interaction with a stream is not necessarily entirely sw βi 1 rather these particles will be a mix of stream water and gw fig 1b determination of the average βi value for particles originating passing through these cells requires consideration of the balance of flow into the cell from the stream and from neighboring aquifer cells fig 2 defining water originating from the neighboring cells to have a mixing ratio of 0 pure gw the mixing ratio of water leaving the cell β r can be obtained as follows 1 β r q s i 1 q i where q s is the flow from the stream to the aquifer cell in interaction with the stream and i 1 q i is the sum of all inputs to this cell q s q b q l see fig 2 where q b is the flow from back and front sides of the cell q l is the flow from the left and right side of the cell longitudinal to the stream for the case depicted in fig 2 note that β r will only be greater than zero for losing reaches q s 0 the value of the mixing ratio β at the sink point step 4 is obtained from the mean of the respective particle mixing ratios β i weighted by particle velocities v i 2 β i 1 v i β i i 1 v i 2 2 validation a synthetic case 2 2 1 model setting the major assumption underlying the use of a particle tracking surrogate model is that dispersion can be neglected for the mixing ratios of the sink points a synthetic 2d case is considered to test this assumption we consider a production well in an unconfined aquifer in interaction with a stream fig 3 the domain 100 150 m is discretized with a fine 2d regular mesh 1 1 m cells which thus satisfies the criteria on the grid peclet number to avoid numerical dispersion with a finite difference scheme pe 1 even for a dispersivity of 1 m zheng and wang 1999 lateral boundary conditions are fixed head fh 10 m to the left and 9 5 m to the right no flow is imposed at the upper and lower domain boundaries the stream is simulated with a head dependent flux cauchy type boundary condition with a head of 9 m and a conductance of 0 01 m2 s 1 these boundary conditions have been adjusted to achieve some mixing of sw and gw in the stream cells see cross section in fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity is homogeneous over the model with a value of 3 10 4 m s 1 aquifer thickness is set to 30 m transmissivity is assumed to be independent of water level fluctuations modflow parameter laycon 0 which corresponds to the boussineq assumption simulations have been conducted for flow rates in the sink point ranging from 0 to 600 m3 h 1 the wells are considered as fully penetrating the stream water concentration is arbitrarily fixed to 1 while fixed head boundary conditions yield water with concentration 0 the sw gw mixing ratio in the production well is simulated with the advective dispersive transport model mt3dms and the particle tracking code modpath steady state flow conditions are simulated with modflow using the pcg solver models modflow modpath mt3dms are pre and post processed using the python wrapper flopy bakker et al 2016 and qgridder pryet et al 2015 on the qgis platform qgis 2012 particle tracking with modpath is performed with a set of 1 000 particles disseminated around the production well at 0 5 m from it exchange flow with the stream is simulated with the weak source option set to 2 which stops particles in cells with a weak source such as a stream in losing condition the iface parameter used to associate a flow term with a grid cell face pollock 1994 is set to 6 to be consistent with recommendation of abrams et al 2012 for surface water weak sinks the weak sink option is set to 1 which allows particles to pass through cells with weak sinks such as a stream in gaining conditions mt3dms simulations are performed with hmoc solvers which is a hybrid of moc and mmoc scheme zheng and wang 1999 with a longitudinal dispersion set to 1 m the same simulations are also performed for a longitudinal dispersion set to 10 and 100 m to determine the impact of dispersion on the simulated mixing ratio in a pumping well transverse dispersion is set to 10 of the longitudinal dispersion 2 2 2 synthetic case results mixing ratios in the pumping well simulated with modpath and mt3dms are compared in fig 4 both models yield very similar results fig 4a below a pumping rate of 100 m3 h 1 the head in the well is above the head of the stream so that well water has a mixing ratio of 0 above this pumping rate a mix of stream water and water originating from the right fixed head boundary conditions supplies the well the agreement between mixing ratios computed with mt3dms and modpath validates the proposed approach in terms of particle count weighting of each particle by its velocity and computing the mixing ratios of stream particles βi results obtained with a longitudinal dispersion of 10 m and 100 m reveal interesting features fig 4 in fig 4b the same simulation as a is performed for modpath that does not take into account dispersion when longitudinal dispersion reaches excessively large values 100 m β decreases but remains similar the error on β is 6 this can be compared to the uncertainty on mixing ratio associated with measurement error which generally range between 8 and 20 rueedi et al 2005 for the presented test case even with an excessively large longitudinal dispersion value of 100 m the error of the surrogate model remains small with respect to the expected measurement error 3 application 3 1 study site a particle tracking surrogate for transport model is applied to a study of a well field which supplies about 20 of the fresh water to the urban area of bordeaux france fig 5 a stream crosses the well field so that stream aquifer interactions are of strategic interest the stream flows over plio quaternary sandy materials overlying an oligocene limestone aquifer these two geological formations are hydraulically connected with similar hydraulic conductivity and therefore considered herein as a single heterogeneous aquifer canik 1968 groundwater is abstracted with two pumping wells and a 500 m long drainage gallery equipped with a pump the mean hydraulic conductivity is on the order of 5 10 4 m s 1 the thickness of the aquifer varies between 40 and 60 m the structure of the aquifer is highly heterogeneous with some structures highlighted by field observations and geophysical surveys cousquer 2017 the width of the stream varies between 10 and 15 m with a depth of about 1 m depending on the hydraulic regime of the stream 3 2 field measurements flow and transport observations have been collected in the field concentration measurements at the production wells and drain are interpreted as a mixture of surface water and groundwater the chemical composition of surface water is based on water samples collected in the stream the groundwater end member is based on water samples collected from a well sufficiently distant from the stream to avoid mixing the mixing model is based on the concentrations ca2 and hco3 ion concentrations at production wells and gallery are reported by orthogonal projection on the mixing line that links the two end members carrera et al 2004 rueedi et al 2005 ion concentration is then obtained after field water sampling on october 10th 2015 and analyzed by a dionex ic columns for ca2 and titration for hco3 estimates of mixing ratios may be affected by two kinds of uncertainties i on the location of end members and ii measured concentrations of ca2 and hco3 for the point of interest the error on the end member compositions has been estimated by the standard deviation between concentrations of ions ca2 and hco3 in points estimated to be likely end members three piezometers have been selected to be likely groundwater end members and stream water was sampled at three locations the error on production well ions concentration is based on reported analytical method errors an uncertainty of about 8 fig 6 was found through error propagation on the orthogonal projection equation hughes and hase 2010 wells w1 and w2 and the drain have 10 30 and 90 stream water respectively which are very contrasting values given their proximity to the stream this can be explained by the high heterogeneity of the aquifer that can lead to preferential flow paths pressure was monitored in all of the wells shown in fig 5 3 3 model development two models have been developed for parameter estimation both models are based on the same spatial extents but they differ in temporal discretization and in their underlying equations both models are based on the assumption of a head independent transmissivity boussinesq assumption and consider 2d horizontal flow only dupuit forchheimer assumption the validity of this latter hypothesis was verified with the criteria provided by haitjema 2016 the first model simulates transient flow with modflow 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 it aims to reproduce observed water levels in the observations wells fig 5 over a period of 700 days stream level drain level recharge and wells discharge are time varying boundary conditions and were set according to field observations the second model is the surrogate model for flow and advective transport under steady state flow conditions this model is based on modflow 2005 and modpath with the methodology described and tested in the previous section the results of the second model will be compared with simulated values from a third model based on the advective dispersive transport code mt3dms with a longitudinal dispersion of 1 m this third model is not used for parameter estimation process rather it is only used to assess the validity of the surrogate model by comparing the values of mixing ratios obtained with the surrogate model with those obtained with the advection dispersion model the model domain is centered on the well field and extends over ca 12 km2 4 5 km 2 6 km fig 6 model boundary conditions were set in accordance with regional groundwater heads and flow directions cabaret 2011 north and south boundary conditions are head dependent flux boundary conditions ghb east and west boundary conditions are no flux both models are discretized on a 10 m 10 m grid with a total of 117 448 cells the stream is simulated with head dependent flux boundary conditions cauchy type cousquer et al 2017 with the modflow riv package the drain gallery is also simulated with head dependent flux boundary conditions with the modflow drn package wells are represented by sink terms in corresponding aquifer cells groundwater recharge is calculated with a reservoir model ledoux et al 1984 from climate data soil condition are fairly homogeneous over the area of interest cousquer 2017 therefore a uniform recharge has been applied to the entire model area 3 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis 3 4 1 parameter estimation parameter estimation was conducted to minimize the residual between observed and simulated groundwater heads discharge rates at the drainage gallery and mixing ratios at the production wells and the drain both transient and steady state models are used for parameter estimation as described in fig 7 fields of hydraulic conductivity and porosity have been parameterized with a set of 250 adjustable pilot points de marsily et al 1984 with an extension of pilot point value to grid cells by kriging with an exponential viariogram with a range of 250 m a sill of 1 and a nugget of 0 1 following the recommendations of doherty et al 2011 parameter estimation has been conducted with the gauss levemberg marqart algorithm glma a non linear newton method for parameter estimation implemented in pest welter et al 2012 a hybrid regularization tikhonov tsvd has also been conducted to stabilize the solution fienen et al 2009 the algorithm is based on the minimization of an objective function representing the weighted mean square error between model outcome values and measured values in the presented test case three data types are considered in the objective function water levels wells discharge rates and mixing ratios it is preferred that each data type is equally well represented in the objective function anderson et al 2015 furthermore for a given data type each observation location should be equally well presented to satisfy these two requirements observations are weighted in the objective function as follows 3 ϕ l 1 l k 1 k l i 1 n k l ω k l r k l 2 where l is the number of data types heads discharge rates concentrations kl is the number of observation points for the l th data type and nk l is the number of observation records for the k th observation point of

7458,the inverse problem of groundwater models is often ill posed and model parameters are likely to be poorly constrained identifiability is improved if diverse data types are used for parameter estimation however some models including detailed solute transport models are further limited by prohibitive computation times this often precludes the use of concentration data for parameter estimation even if those data are available in the case of surface water groundwater sw gw models concentration data can provide sw gw mixing ratios which efficiently constrain the estimate of exchange flow but are rarely used we propose to reduce computational limits by simulating sw gw exchange at a sink well or drain based on particle tracking under steady state flow conditions particle tracking is used to simulate advective transport a comparison between the particle tracking surrogate model and an advective dispersive model shows that dispersion can often be neglected when the mixing ratio is computed for a sink allowing for use of the particle tracking surrogate model the surrogate model was implemented to solve the inverse problem for a real sw gw transport problem with heads and concentrations combined in a weighted hybrid objective function the resulting inversion showed markedly reduced uncertainty in the transmissivity field compared to calibration on head data alone keywords particle tracking surrogate model stream aquifer null space monte carlo 1 introduction parameters involved in groundwater models are generally obtained by history matching against hydraulic head data however this approach generally leads to ill posed inverse problems anderman and hill 1997 carrera et al 2005 this is particularly the case for groundwater surface water gw sw models where independent estimates of surface water in outflow are most important for constraining surface water exchanges fleckenstein et al 2010 hunt et al 2006 sophocleous 2002 the use of additional diverse field observations can alleviate the ill posedness zhou et al 2014 however successful examples of including solute concentration for parameter estimation are scarce christiansen et al 1995 hunt et al 2006 medina and carrera 1996 pool et al 2015 the computational burden of simulating advection and dispersion at the field scale is a primary barrier to the use of concentration data for gw sw interaction investigations depending on the problem a single simulation of advective dispersive transport over periods of years to decades may require hours even on modern computers hill and tiedeman 2006 konikow 2011 several thousands of model runs are generally necessary to complete parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis anderson et al 2015 this suggests that alternative approaches to simulate solute transport that reduce the computation effort could have significant advantages for modeling and understanding gw sw processes transport models fall into two general categories in all cases solution of the flow equation provides heads water fluxes and flow directions but as discussed by konikow 2011 transport modeling approaches are then based on either i modeling transport as advection dominated or ii solving the full advective dispersive transport problem theoretically measured concentrations can only be used to constrain the more complex models which consider dispersion konikow 2011 only few cases that included concentration data for parameter estimation were based on advective dispersion models christiansen et al 1995 fienen et al 2009 tonkin and doherty 2009 all modeling efforts require trade offs hill et al 2016 one common example is that aquifer parameters may be considered to be homogeneous to allow for examination of other processes such as gw sw exchange thus few studies have attempted to infer heterogeneous conductivity fields based on concentration data carniato et al 2015 the goal of this study is to examine alternative modeling strategies to support such investigations over the past decade surrogate modeling has been used to reduce the computational requirements of some hydrogeological problems surrogate models are lower fidelity models that adequately capture the most important features of the original complex model while reducing the computational cost razavi et al 2012 surrogates are used most often during parameter estimation or uncertainty analysis which require numerous model runs however a candidate surrogate model should meet certain criteria burrows and doherty 2015 i the surrogate model must compute the key outputs made by the complex model ii the output values of the surrogate model should be reasonably consistent with those of the original complex model and iii parameters used by both models must play similar roles our specific objective was to test whether particle tracking could act as a suitable surrogate for more computationally demanding advective dispersive models thereby allowing for the use of concentration data to constrain heterogeneous conductivity fields particle tracking techniques have been compared to advective dispersive transport models such as mt3dms for example gusyev et al 2014 found very similar simulated tritium concentrations based on particle tracking modpath modflow and solute transport mt3dms modflow models advective transport has also been used in sw gw modeling to reproduce temperature observations brookfield et al 2009 engeler et al 2011 kurtz et al 2014 mouhri et al 2013 lake plume elevation fienen et al 2009 hunt et al 2006 advective front locations anderman and hill 1997 hill and tiedeman 2006 travel time between a lake and a well pint et al 2003 or to delineate the hyporheic zone kasahara and wondzell 2003 storey et al 2003 particle tracking has already been used for parameter estimation pint et al 2003 hunt et al 2006 however particle tracking has never been used as a surrogate model for advective dispersive transport to simulate sw gw exchanges nor has it been used with head and flow observations at production wells to constrain heterogeneous conductivity fields in this study we do not use concentration data directly for calibration rather we use simulated and inferred mixing ratios which describe the fractional mixing of several end member waters with different chemical compositions carrera et al 2004 rueedi et al 2005 in this case we examine the mixing of surface water sw and groundwater gw mixing ratios are commonly inferred from concentrations measured in field collected water samples we proposed a method to use modpath results to define mixing ratios that can be compared with field derived values we first benchmark our modpath based approach against results derived from mt3dms advective dispersion model results thereafter we apply our particle tracking surrogate model to a case study and examine the benefits and limitations compared to calibration with head data alone 2 a proxy model for advective dispersive transport 2 1 approach to test our proposed proxy modeling approach we simulate sw gw mixing in a pumping well under steady state flow conditions the value of the mixing ratio may range between 0 gw only to 1 sw only for the sake of simplicity we assume that mass transport is non reactive the approach is based on using backward tracking to determine the origins of a set of particles disseminated around a sink point of interest well or drain the method is based on the assumption that particle velocity and concentrations can be used to define the mass flux coming from a flow tube atteia 2011 the procedure to compute the mixing ratio β at a given sink point can be detailed as follows 1 the flow field is computed for steady state conditions with the flow model 2 a large number of particles 1000 are disseminated around the sink point of interest 3 backward particle tracking is conducted from the sink point back to the origin of flow stream and boundary condition 4 the mixing ratio at the sink point β is then calculated from the fraction of the particles that originate in the stream or at a boundary the procedure for the computation of the concentration associated with each particle βi depends on the type of the source point fig 1 when a particle originates from an external boundary condition prescribed head or flow the particle concentration as it reaches the sink simply corresponds to the mixing ratio of gw βi 0 fig 1 a in contrast a particle originating from an aquifer cell in interaction with a stream is not necessarily entirely sw βi 1 rather these particles will be a mix of stream water and gw fig 1b determination of the average βi value for particles originating passing through these cells requires consideration of the balance of flow into the cell from the stream and from neighboring aquifer cells fig 2 defining water originating from the neighboring cells to have a mixing ratio of 0 pure gw the mixing ratio of water leaving the cell β r can be obtained as follows 1 β r q s i 1 q i where q s is the flow from the stream to the aquifer cell in interaction with the stream and i 1 q i is the sum of all inputs to this cell q s q b q l see fig 2 where q b is the flow from back and front sides of the cell q l is the flow from the left and right side of the cell longitudinal to the stream for the case depicted in fig 2 note that β r will only be greater than zero for losing reaches q s 0 the value of the mixing ratio β at the sink point step 4 is obtained from the mean of the respective particle mixing ratios β i weighted by particle velocities v i 2 β i 1 v i β i i 1 v i 2 2 validation a synthetic case 2 2 1 model setting the major assumption underlying the use of a particle tracking surrogate model is that dispersion can be neglected for the mixing ratios of the sink points a synthetic 2d case is considered to test this assumption we consider a production well in an unconfined aquifer in interaction with a stream fig 3 the domain 100 150 m is discretized with a fine 2d regular mesh 1 1 m cells which thus satisfies the criteria on the grid peclet number to avoid numerical dispersion with a finite difference scheme pe 1 even for a dispersivity of 1 m zheng and wang 1999 lateral boundary conditions are fixed head fh 10 m to the left and 9 5 m to the right no flow is imposed at the upper and lower domain boundaries the stream is simulated with a head dependent flux cauchy type boundary condition with a head of 9 m and a conductance of 0 01 m2 s 1 these boundary conditions have been adjusted to achieve some mixing of sw and gw in the stream cells see cross section in fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity is homogeneous over the model with a value of 3 10 4 m s 1 aquifer thickness is set to 30 m transmissivity is assumed to be independent of water level fluctuations modflow parameter laycon 0 which corresponds to the boussineq assumption simulations have been conducted for flow rates in the sink point ranging from 0 to 600 m3 h 1 the wells are considered as fully penetrating the stream water concentration is arbitrarily fixed to 1 while fixed head boundary conditions yield water with concentration 0 the sw gw mixing ratio in the production well is simulated with the advective dispersive transport model mt3dms and the particle tracking code modpath steady state flow conditions are simulated with modflow using the pcg solver models modflow modpath mt3dms are pre and post processed using the python wrapper flopy bakker et al 2016 and qgridder pryet et al 2015 on the qgis platform qgis 2012 particle tracking with modpath is performed with a set of 1 000 particles disseminated around the production well at 0 5 m from it exchange flow with the stream is simulated with the weak source option set to 2 which stops particles in cells with a weak source such as a stream in losing condition the iface parameter used to associate a flow term with a grid cell face pollock 1994 is set to 6 to be consistent with recommendation of abrams et al 2012 for surface water weak sinks the weak sink option is set to 1 which allows particles to pass through cells with weak sinks such as a stream in gaining conditions mt3dms simulations are performed with hmoc solvers which is a hybrid of moc and mmoc scheme zheng and wang 1999 with a longitudinal dispersion set to 1 m the same simulations are also performed for a longitudinal dispersion set to 10 and 100 m to determine the impact of dispersion on the simulated mixing ratio in a pumping well transverse dispersion is set to 10 of the longitudinal dispersion 2 2 2 synthetic case results mixing ratios in the pumping well simulated with modpath and mt3dms are compared in fig 4 both models yield very similar results fig 4a below a pumping rate of 100 m3 h 1 the head in the well is above the head of the stream so that well water has a mixing ratio of 0 above this pumping rate a mix of stream water and water originating from the right fixed head boundary conditions supplies the well the agreement between mixing ratios computed with mt3dms and modpath validates the proposed approach in terms of particle count weighting of each particle by its velocity and computing the mixing ratios of stream particles βi results obtained with a longitudinal dispersion of 10 m and 100 m reveal interesting features fig 4 in fig 4b the same simulation as a is performed for modpath that does not take into account dispersion when longitudinal dispersion reaches excessively large values 100 m β decreases but remains similar the error on β is 6 this can be compared to the uncertainty on mixing ratio associated with measurement error which generally range between 8 and 20 rueedi et al 2005 for the presented test case even with an excessively large longitudinal dispersion value of 100 m the error of the surrogate model remains small with respect to the expected measurement error 3 application 3 1 study site a particle tracking surrogate for transport model is applied to a study of a well field which supplies about 20 of the fresh water to the urban area of bordeaux france fig 5 a stream crosses the well field so that stream aquifer interactions are of strategic interest the stream flows over plio quaternary sandy materials overlying an oligocene limestone aquifer these two geological formations are hydraulically connected with similar hydraulic conductivity and therefore considered herein as a single heterogeneous aquifer canik 1968 groundwater is abstracted with two pumping wells and a 500 m long drainage gallery equipped with a pump the mean hydraulic conductivity is on the order of 5 10 4 m s 1 the thickness of the aquifer varies between 40 and 60 m the structure of the aquifer is highly heterogeneous with some structures highlighted by field observations and geophysical surveys cousquer 2017 the width of the stream varies between 10 and 15 m with a depth of about 1 m depending on the hydraulic regime of the stream 3 2 field measurements flow and transport observations have been collected in the field concentration measurements at the production wells and drain are interpreted as a mixture of surface water and groundwater the chemical composition of surface water is based on water samples collected in the stream the groundwater end member is based on water samples collected from a well sufficiently distant from the stream to avoid mixing the mixing model is based on the concentrations ca2 and hco3 ion concentrations at production wells and gallery are reported by orthogonal projection on the mixing line that links the two end members carrera et al 2004 rueedi et al 2005 ion concentration is then obtained after field water sampling on october 10th 2015 and analyzed by a dionex ic columns for ca2 and titration for hco3 estimates of mixing ratios may be affected by two kinds of uncertainties i on the location of end members and ii measured concentrations of ca2 and hco3 for the point of interest the error on the end member compositions has been estimated by the standard deviation between concentrations of ions ca2 and hco3 in points estimated to be likely end members three piezometers have been selected to be likely groundwater end members and stream water was sampled at three locations the error on production well ions concentration is based on reported analytical method errors an uncertainty of about 8 fig 6 was found through error propagation on the orthogonal projection equation hughes and hase 2010 wells w1 and w2 and the drain have 10 30 and 90 stream water respectively which are very contrasting values given their proximity to the stream this can be explained by the high heterogeneity of the aquifer that can lead to preferential flow paths pressure was monitored in all of the wells shown in fig 5 3 3 model development two models have been developed for parameter estimation both models are based on the same spatial extents but they differ in temporal discretization and in their underlying equations both models are based on the assumption of a head independent transmissivity boussinesq assumption and consider 2d horizontal flow only dupuit forchheimer assumption the validity of this latter hypothesis was verified with the criteria provided by haitjema 2016 the first model simulates transient flow with modflow 2005 mcdonald and harbaugh 1988 it aims to reproduce observed water levels in the observations wells fig 5 over a period of 700 days stream level drain level recharge and wells discharge are time varying boundary conditions and were set according to field observations the second model is the surrogate model for flow and advective transport under steady state flow conditions this model is based on modflow 2005 and modpath with the methodology described and tested in the previous section the results of the second model will be compared with simulated values from a third model based on the advective dispersive transport code mt3dms with a longitudinal dispersion of 1 m this third model is not used for parameter estimation process rather it is only used to assess the validity of the surrogate model by comparing the values of mixing ratios obtained with the surrogate model with those obtained with the advection dispersion model the model domain is centered on the well field and extends over ca 12 km2 4 5 km 2 6 km fig 6 model boundary conditions were set in accordance with regional groundwater heads and flow directions cabaret 2011 north and south boundary conditions are head dependent flux boundary conditions ghb east and west boundary conditions are no flux both models are discretized on a 10 m 10 m grid with a total of 117 448 cells the stream is simulated with head dependent flux boundary conditions cauchy type cousquer et al 2017 with the modflow riv package the drain gallery is also simulated with head dependent flux boundary conditions with the modflow drn package wells are represented by sink terms in corresponding aquifer cells groundwater recharge is calculated with a reservoir model ledoux et al 1984 from climate data soil condition are fairly homogeneous over the area of interest cousquer 2017 therefore a uniform recharge has been applied to the entire model area 3 4 parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis 3 4 1 parameter estimation parameter estimation was conducted to minimize the residual between observed and simulated groundwater heads discharge rates at the drainage gallery and mixing ratios at the production wells and the drain both transient and steady state models are used for parameter estimation as described in fig 7 fields of hydraulic conductivity and porosity have been parameterized with a set of 250 adjustable pilot points de marsily et al 1984 with an extension of pilot point value to grid cells by kriging with an exponential viariogram with a range of 250 m a sill of 1 and a nugget of 0 1 following the recommendations of doherty et al 2011 parameter estimation has been conducted with the gauss levemberg marqart algorithm glma a non linear newton method for parameter estimation implemented in pest welter et al 2012 a hybrid regularization tikhonov tsvd has also been conducted to stabilize the solution fienen et al 2009 the algorithm is based on the minimization of an objective function representing the weighted mean square error between model outcome values and measured values in the presented test case three data types are considered in the objective function water levels wells discharge rates and mixing ratios it is preferred that each data type is equally well represented in the objective function anderson et al 2015 furthermore for a given data type each observation location should be equally well presented to satisfy these two requirements observations are weighted in the objective function as follows 3 ϕ l 1 l k 1 k l i 1 n k l ω k l r k l 2 where l is the number of data types heads discharge rates concentrations kl is the number of observation points for the l th data type and nk l is the number of observation records for the k th observation point of the l th data type nk l 1 when considering steady state values the weighing factor of each observation is defined as follows 4 ω k l 1 n k l k l σ k l 2 where σ k l is the standard deviation of the variable of interest every observation of each station inside each data type is well balanced in the pre calibration objective function table 1 a total of 38 000 model runs were required for parameter estimation which were run in parallel on a 20 core cpu this required 2 75 days with the surrogate model and would have required more than a month if a classical advective dispersive model had been used with the calibrated parameter set the simulated values showed a reasonably good adjustment with observed values with rmse errors of 0 19 m for heads in the observations wells a rmse of 11 7 m3 h

7459,subsurface flow is often recognized as a dominant runoff generation process however observing subsurface properties and understanding how they control flow pathways remains challenging this paper investigates how surface slope and bedrock cleavage control subsurface flow pathways in a slate bedrock headwater catchment in luxembourg characterised by a double peak streamflow response we use a range of experimental techniques including field observations of soil and bedrock characteristics and a sprinkling experiment at a site located 40 m upslope from the stream channel the sprinkling experiment uses br as a tracer which is measured at a well downslope from the plot and at various locations along the stream together with well and stream hydrometric responses the sprinkling experiment is used to estimate velocities and celerities which in turn are used to infer flow pathways our results indicate that the single or first peak of double peak events is rainfall driven controlled by rainfall while the second peak is storage driven controlled by storage the comparison between velocity and celerity estimates suggests a fast flowpath component connecting the hillslope to the stream but velocity information was too scarce to fully support such a hypothesis in addition different estimates of celerities suggest a seasonal influence of both rainfall intensity rate and residual water storage on the celerity responses at the hillslope scale at the catchment outlet the estimated of the total mass of br recovered in the stream was about 2 5 of the application further downstream the estimate mass of br was about 4 0 of the application this demonstrates that flowpaths do not appear to align with the slope gradient in contrast they appear to follow the strike of the bedrock cleavage our results have expanded our understanding of the importance of the subsurface in particular the underlying bedrock systems and the importance of cleavage orientation as well as topography in controlling subsurface flow direction in this catchment keywords velocity celerity fractured bedrock tracer experiments bedrock cleavage 1 introduction subsurface flow can be a dominant

beven and germann 1982 bryan and jones 1997 chappell 2010 jackson 1992 runoff generation processes are typically studied at the hillslope scale dunne 1978 notwithstanding recent advances in measuring techniques measuring subsurface flow as well as the subsurface properties that control subsurface flow remains impracticable at other than the scale of small cores gabrielli et al 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 wienhöfer and zehe 2014 besides the soil properties the bedrock structure can have a strong influence on subsurface runoff although hard bedrock is often considered impermeable tromp

parent lithology and history chappell et al 2007 onda et al 2001 can cause extreme spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater flow rate cook et al 1996 2003 in order to understand how fractured bedrocks control hydrologic response it is necessary to describe each of the involved subsurface flowpaths and storage structures banks et al 2009 hale et al 2016 this approach however is impractical particularly for large areas therefore more commonly subsurface properties are inferred using other techniques such as by using geochemical tracers harr 1977 sidle et al 1995 tracer studies are employed to understand how quickly in what concentration and from what sources water reaches the stream tracer input output relationships are used to estimate the transit time distributions of water in the catchment klaus et al 2015 mcguire et al 2007 nyberg et al 1999 and can be useful to characterise flowpaths trudgill et al 1983 wienhöfer and zehe 2014 unfortunately the interpretation of the tracer results is often biased by the spatial and temporal resolution and analytical protocols of tracer collection abbott et al 2016 weihermüller et al 2007 tracer data can also be used to estimate velocities and celerities which can aid the interpretation of subsurface flow pathways in particular differences between velocities and celerities are thought to explain the rapid runoff of stored water during rainfall events mcdonnell and beven 2014 however few studies to date have quantified in situ velocities and celerities novel model frameworks consider both celerity distributions which manifest themselves in the hydrograph and velocity distributions manifested in tracer responses birkel and soulsby 2015 davies et al 2011 laine kaulio et al 2014 scudeler et al 2016 soulsby et al 2015 in a framework based on velocity celerity analysis the hydrograph and flow path velocity characteristics are integrated while average celerity and average velocity can be estimated at catchment scales rasmussen et al 2000 there have been very few studies that have attempted to study the characteristics of both celerities and velocities at field scale scaini et al 2017 our work is undertaken in the weierbach experimental catchment in luxembourg a site underlain by devonian slate juilleret et al 2011 moragues quiroga et al 2017 characterised by double peak runoff responses martínez carreras et al 2016 we complement previous work scaini et al 2017 which was based on the interpretation of estimates of maximum velocities and flow celerities during vertical infiltration and showed that at the plot scale the flow direction in the soil profile is predominantly vertical until the relatively impermeable boundary of the bedrock system is encountered the impermeable layer is located at about 2 3 m below the surface scaini et al 2017 the conditions required for the onset of lateral subsurface flow at the hillslope scale have not been previously investigated and are the focus of this complementary work our objective is to quantify celerities and velocities in the path between the hillslope plot and the stream by analysing artificial sprinkling experiments and stream chemistry specific research questions include i how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs ii how do bedrock structural properties particularly cleavage orientation influence tracer transport from plot to stream iii how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the research site followed by section 3 where the equipment used is presented and section 4 describing the sprinkling experiments and the analysis applied section 5 describes results on hydrometric response to rainfall and sprinkling tracer detection and velocity and celerity estimates section 6 discusses each of these research questions the paper concludes by summarizing the key findings of the study in relation to each of the research questions 2 description of the experimental field site the weierbach an experimental site located in the north west of luxembourg is a forested catchment underlain by devonian slate altitudes range from 465 to 512 m a s l average annual rainfall is 812 m a 2007 2016 and annual runoff ratios are around 0 55 2005 2008 martínez carreras et al 2016 geologically the catchment soils are developed on pleistocene periglacial slope deposits overlying in situ compact and slightly weathered slate bedrock also called saprock eggleton 2001 juilleret et al 2011 martínez carreras et al 2016 the whole regolith classification is dystric cambisol ruptic endoskeletic siltic protospodic according to the wrb reference wrb 2015 overlying a regolithic saprock vertifractic rootic slatic juilleret et al 2016 the 642 plot used for the sprinkling experiments is located 40 m uphill from the stream on the left bank fig 1 the slope is steep average of 10 and perpendicular to the stream rock cleavage or foliation is a property of rocks referring to layering along approximately parallel surfaces singhal and gupta 2010 the cleavage planes lead to preferential cracks within the rock depending on the extent of connectedness and orientation cracks can have a variable impact on water movement at the hillslope site a geological compass and clinometer measurement of the strike and dip of the cleavage plans showed on average 70 n degrees and a vertical dipping in other words diagonally with respect to the surface slope a sketch of its orientation is shown in fig 1b previous work assumed that significant lateral parallel to the surface topography subsurface flow would occur in the fractured bedrock or saprock or in the stony basal layer of the periglacial cover beds juilleret et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 our previous analysis however showed that the significance of lateral flow in the near surface soil profile at the site is very low scaini et al 2017 thus subsurface hillslope contributions to streamflow should are expected only below 2 3 m in the fractured slate bedrock this zone however is characterised by low porosity and resistivity which complicates the detection of lateral flow using geophysical methods here we attempt to examine the hillslope to channel flow pathways by characterising the release of water from the hillslope monitoring the outflow to the stream using tracers 3 materials considering the hillslope as a system we present the equipment used to generate or measure i input of water and tracers ii internal states including water content and concentrations iii output of water and tracers in the stream 3 1 input natural precipitation was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific ltd model 52203 located 3 5 km from the experimental catchment at the roodt automatic weather station the high density of vegetation hindered measurements of natural precipitation closer to the experimental plot 3 2 internal states in order to detect lateral flow beneath the collection troughs two groundwater wells of 2 in diameter were installed at the base of the plot drilling was performed from the surface of the forest road on the two sides of the roof covering the base of the plot the two wells were drilled to 2 gw1 and 2 4 m gw2 depth and equipped with pressure sensors for measurement of conductivity temperature and water level hydromet ott ctd fig 1c additionally a 3 in diameter groundwater well gw3 located 12 m from the stream fig 1b was monitored for water table depth fluctuations electric conductivity ec and temperature using another ott ctd sensor the well gw3 was drilled in 2009 and was sited to follow the cleavage strike fig 1b the chemical composition of the well water was analysed with grab samples collected at variable time steps during the experiments to characterise the evolution of the concentrations of the well outside the artificial experiments bi weekly samples were taken during a period of 2 years finally a 2 in groundwater well located on the plateau uphill of the study plot gw4 was monitored for water table depth fluctuations electric conductivity ec and temperature starting from september 2014 using a multi probe td diver schlumberger water services as the monitoring was not permanent during the studied period this well was used mostly as a reference for overall water table fluctuations 3 3 outputs stream water level at the outlet sw was measured using a pressure transducer isco 4120 flow logger in combination with a v notch weir ec at the outlet was also continuously monitored using a conductivity probe wtw 3310 the chemical composition of the stream water at sw was monitored during a period of 2 years using manual bi weekly samples additionally a high resolution stream sampling set up was undertaken during the sprinkling experiments the stream was sampled at 3 different locations i at sw the outlet ii 30 m upstream upstream respect to the study hillslope and iii 15 m downstream using automatic water samplers isco 6712 fig 1c manual samples were also manually collected at 2 intermediate locations fig 1c 4 methods this section describes the measurements performed during the sprinkling experiments section 4 1 and the analyses of the measured data collected during the experiments section 4 2 4 1 sprinkling experiments artificial irrigation experiments were carried out between march 31st and april 10th 2014 experiment 1 and had the aim to explore plot scale generation of shallow lateral flow described in scaini et al 2017 experiment 1 raised the need for additional monitoring of the stream to help understand the subsurface flow pathways experiment 2 was therefore performed using different tracers between march 11th and 16th 2015 for a full description of the experiments and analysis of flows in the near surface soil see scaini et al 2017 4 1 1 plot scale monitoring experiment 1 during experiment 1 solutions containing different concentrations of nacl and kbr were used to sprinkle the area the sampling protocol was mostly carried out at the plot scale to characterise plot response given some shortcomings in the experimental design absence of shallow lateral flow limited information on deeper storage need of including stream sampling to study the release of water from the hillslope described in scaini et al 2017 we refined the methodology and experimental design in a second experiment 4 1 2 stream intensive sampling experiment 2 during experiment 2 solutions of water and nacl were applied and additional data were used to monitor hillslope response the stream was sampled at high frequency at 3 locations fig 1c stars using isco automatic samplers section 3 3 programmed at 30 min time step during the experiment and progressively longer time steps for a period of 3 weeks after the experiment from 1 h to 6 h time step manual samples were taken at 2 locations at hourly time step during the experiment fig 1c circles 4 2 analyses of measured data 4 2 1 hydrometric monitoring during the experiments the water table depth fluctuations ec and temperature were recorded at 15 min intervals in gw3 in order to capture lower lateral flow the two wells at the bottom of the plot gw1 and gw2 in fig 1c recorded water table height temperature and ec at variable time step up to 5 s time step during the experiments runoff and ec at the outlet grey star fig 1b were continuously recorded at 15 min intervals 4 2 2 natural rainfall events analysis a series of natural rainfall events were considered for the analysis the selection criteria focused on rainfall events of a total of at least 15 mm to analyse event magnitudes as much as possible similar to the sprinkling each event was considered separately when the time elapsed from the previous event was at least 3 h as during the sprinkling experiments each day s irrigation was carried out non stop or stopped for a period between 1 and 3 h rainfall intensity catchment wetness in terms of antecedent precipitation index api calculated for 30 and 7 days prior to the rainfall event and the timing of stream and groundwater response were calculated for each rainfall event cross correlation was used to calculate the time lag for which the correlation between rainfall and stream discharge was maximum in the same way the time lag corresponding to the maximum correlation between rainfall and water table depth was also computed in this case maximum inverse correlation double peaks in the hydrograph were observed from late autumn to early spring when soil moisture values are higher there were also a few cases where summer double peak events occurred linked to large precipitation events martínez carreras et al 2016 cross correlation was also computed for the double peak events the results of cross correlations were used to check for differences between single and double peak discharge and groundwater response timings 4 2 3 tracer monitoring the arrival time of the tracers to each sampling point was determined by comparison with the background values tracers dissolved in the input water were used to track the water knowing precisely its input times and chemical composition all collected water samples were filtered using acrodisc syringe 0 45 µm filters pall corporation in order to be analysed for chloride cl and bromide br concentrations using ionic chromatography dionex ics 5000 the detection limit of the analyses was 0 01 mg l 1 for cl and 0 02 0 01 mg l 1 for br background anions and cations in the stream and groundwater were measured over a three year long bi weekly sampling campaign between 2011 and 2013 the average value of the background cl concentration in the input water was 3 33 2 45 mg l 1 no detectable br concentrations were found in the background samples the average ec value in the stream water was 45 10 µs cm 1 cl detected in the well over the 3 years bi weekly campaign were equal to 5 15 0 42 mg l 1 while ec had mean value of 107 6 µs cm 1 a linear regression model to estimate cl from ec was fitted to such data chang et al 1983 siosemarde et al 2010 br concentrations during the high frequency sampling stream campaign experiment 2 section 4 1 2 were used to calculate the mass of br leaving the system this was performed by i interpolating the missing concentration data to hourly time step ii multiplying br concentrations to discharge available at hourly time step to obtain the load iii summing up all the values to obtain the total mass of br 4 2 4 velocity estimates given the importance of both celerity and velocity in storage discharge responses mcdonnell and beven 2014 estimates of both quantities were derived using a data based approach for both velocities and celerities a time difference and distance are required a velocity distribution summarizes the range of velocities of water particles within the subsurface wider distributions are indicative of larger heterogeneities and variability of flow pathways whereas narrower distributions are representative of more homogeneous conditions davies and beven 2012 maximum velocity can be derived as the first detection of a tracer at a measurement point and represents the fastest flow pathway mcdonnell and beven 2014 mean velocity provides information on propagation storage and remobilisation of tracers maximum and mean velocity determined from the tracer data and the information on the lengths and times used to compute each velocity are shown in table 1 a the arrival times of br and ec used as a proxy for salt tracer to well and stream were used to estimate information on velocities for the time information each velocity was computed using tracer application as a starting point at the well gw3 the maximum velocity was computed by dividing the distance between the plot and the well by the time at which a start of ec rise corresponding to the time at which the tracer plume reached the well occurred v max w table 1a the well ec peak provided time information regarding the arrival of the maximum concentration of the plume an approximation of the mean velocity v w in the same way the plot stream downslope distance was divided by the time between start of tracer application and start of the ec rise in the stream to compute the maximum velocity v max s the plot stream downslope distance was divided by the timing of the stream ec peak to estimate the mean velocity v s 4 2 5 celerity estimates celerity is defined with respect to the speed with which a perturbation to the flow propagates through the flow domain mcdonnell and beven 2014 celerity responses depend on the nature of the perturbation and the antecedent wetness which in our case is determined by the artificial and natural rainfall events defining a consistent framework to calculate the spatial propagation of a perturbation is critical to be able to look at the celerity estimates for the purposes of analysis we need to provide working definitions of celerities that can be calculated from the data for the water table we can assume that the first response following rainfall will be a good indication of first wetting celerity in the unsaturated zone classically as a wetting front shock beven 1981 but here more likely as a result of preferential flow in the case of the stream the initial rise will be a combination of the initial response in the riparian area and routing through the channel network we can also define celerities based on the time to peak of the water table and hydrograph for the water table response this will represent an average for the unsaturated zone and saturated zone response upstream of the well for the discharge it represents and integral of the hillslope and channel network responses including likely fast pathways through the bedrock fractures of hillslopes as recent research suggested jackisch et al 2016 martínez carreras et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 thus we calculate the following celerity indices as described in fig 2 and table 1b using the natural rainfall events described in section 4 2 2 1 initial event celerity csu was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and start of discharge rise at outlet 2 integral event hydrograph celerity css was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and peak discharge at the outlet 3 initial hillslope celerity cwu was estimated using the time frame between rainfall and start of water table response in gw3 4 integral hillslope celerity cws was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and peak of water table response in gw3 to define the relevant downslope distances we used a 5 5 dem in the single or first peak events the distance was defined as the mean downslope distance between the stream and the hillslope slope 6 5 in the double peak events the mean downslope distance between the stream and the divide slope 6 5 was used to include the plateau as in the formulation of martínez carreras et al 2016 css fig 2b mean hillslope lengths used for the stream celerity cs were defined using the following procedure i computing the euclidean distance to the stream for each pixel of the dem ii computing and clustering the slopes of the weierbach 6 5 and 6 5 iii computing the average downslope distance for all the pixels 6 5 corresponding to the hillslope and 6 5 plateau in the case of the well response the fixed planar distance between the 2 wells located respectively on the plateau gw4 and at the bottom of the slope gw3 was used to compute information of celerity fig 2b such measure was divided by the start of water table rise to compute cwu and time of peak to compute cws both calculated from the start of the rainfall event 5 results 5 1 response to natural rainfall and to sprinkling table 2 summarizes the characteristics of 21 natural events 12 in 2014 and 9 in 2015 having cumulative rainfall higher than 15 mm section 4 2 2 in addition to the characteristics of each rainfall event the maximum cross correlations between rainfall and groundwater and rainfall and discharge responses are given for each event the relationship between time series was analysed as a first check for relationships between variables the average of the maximum correlation coefficients r between rainfall and discharge as used to indicate the average lag time was equal to 0 66 in all cases the corresponding time lag was below 1 h showing a relatively homogeneous response of the discharge to rainfall in terms of timing table 2 in the case of event 19 the maximum correlation occurred for the non lagged discharge showing that the response to rainfall was quicker than 15 min one time step table 2 the maximum lag time between rainfall and water table response ranged between 0 5 and 12 5 h table 2 with maximum r between 0 10 and 0 70 showing a more complex timing response in all the single peak cases the start of the discharge rising limb and discharge peak always preceded the first rise of the water table in the cases where a double peak occurred the discharge peak followed the maximum rise of the water table measured from gw3 with peaks lagged between 1 and 3 h fig 3 shows the discharge storage relationship fig 3a as well as the ec well relationship fig 3b with a few events of more than 15 mm rainfall highlighted by colours events 1 2 3 7 10 12 table 2 the event of december 2014 highlighted in yellow in fig 3 generated the highest water table reaching 1 m below soil surface and discharge peak up to 80 l s 1 the relationship between water table depth and ec does not follow a clear pattern even though we can see the peaks due to the tracing experiments where despite the absence of response in the water table the ec rose to the maximum values for the series fig 3b the stream and gw3 were not affected by the experiments both stream discharge and groundwater depth did not have a significant response during both experiment 1 and experiment 2 table 3 shows for both experiment 1 and 2 the minimum and maximum values of groundwater ec and depth to water table measured at gw3 and stream ec and discharge measured at sw the maximum values of ec during the period following experiment 1 resulting from the salt dissolved in the sprinkling water are given in brackets both experiments were conducted in low flow periods discharge range 1 2 l s 1 in experiment 1 and 4 7 l s 1 in experiment 2 fig 4 shows the time series of natural and sprinkled rainfall a gw3 depth to the surface and sw discharge b ec in sw left y axis and gw3 right y axis c fig 3d and e show respectively stream and gw3 cl and br concentrations expressed as mg l 1 following experiment 1 detectable ec rises in gw3 were observed fig 4c three distinct ec peaks were observed i following experiment 1 ii following experiment 2 iii in late 2015 indicated in fig 4c the ec in gw3 started to rise on april 09th and peaked on april 18th 2014 with 201 µs cm 1 the closest sample analysed was taken on the april 19th where ec was 179 µs cm 1 and cl was 28 79 mg l 1 fig 4d the average value of the ec in gw3 rose from 107 6 µs cm 1 before experiment 1 to 148 19 µs cm 1 after experiment 1 fig 4c the second ec peak following experiment 2 was lower than the previous year with a peak value of 176 µs cm 1 reached on march 14th 2015 the third rise occurred in late 2015 slowly rising starting in september 21st until its recession in november 11th with a peak of 207 µs cm 1 on october 23rd during a dry period api7 3 5 mm api30 30 mm in the stream ec rose twice on the last 2 days of experiment 1 april 09th and 10th 2014 cl and br were applied respectively to each of these events section 4 1 1 stream ec started to peak around 1330 on april 09th 6 h after the well ec started rising the two stream ec peaks were sharp both had duration of 4 h between start and fall and occurred on the only 2 days where shallow lateral flow occurred respectively 430 and 330 after the shallow lateral flow had initiated scaini et al 2017 the 2 peaks of stream ec were equal to 74 5 and 72 9 µs cm 1 respectively the estimated amount of each peak s cl concentration was respectively 4 09 and 4 02 mg l 1 using the calibration curve between ec and cl described in section 4 2 3 the first few natural rainfall events after experiment 1 did not generate any ec change in the stream fig 4c in july between the 11th and the 21st an ec peak was detected at the stream outlet fig 4c the july peak reached the maximum of stream ec in the whole time series reaching 145 µs cm 1 the delayed peak in stream ec followed three important summer events july 6th 16 mm 8th 16 2 mm and 9th 21 6 mm for a total of 53 7 mm in three days api30 48 0 mm api7 9 4 mm to understand this behaviour we analyse the events of a similar magnitude or higher during the 2 ear period comprising the events 5 2 tracer detection in gw3 cl detection rose from an average value of 5 15 0 42 mg l 1 before experiment 1 to an average value of 7 88 6 64 mg l 1 after it fig 4e this suggests that significant amounts of cl moved through the hillslope and likely reached the stream the natural presence of cl in stream water does not allow the data to be analysed unambiguously as the average concentrations before 3 15 0 13 mg l 1 and after 3 22 0 51 mg l 1 the experiments were very similar therefore we focus on br as it was the only tracer that could be used to characterise hillslope response fig 5 shows cumulative rainfall plotted against cumulative discharge in both 2014 and 2015 in light blue highlighted by circles experiments 1 and 2 are shown the time where br was detected in gw3 and in sw are highlighted br was detected on multiple samples in summer 2015 first it reached sw in detectable quantities during the higher frequency sampling of experiment 2 fig 4e then it was detected on multiple occasions between may 11th and 13th june 24th and july 08th and until september 08th 2015 with rising concentrations during both summers the stream was intermittently dry with experiment 1 a total of 5 kg of kbr were released during sprinkling through the following months br was first detected in gw3 starting on june 11th and was detected in 3 consecutive samples until beginning of august 2014 starting from august 20th br was not detected anymore in the well until experiment 2 when br was again detected in all samples between march 12th and march 23rd fig 4e br concentrations in gw3 in this time period were on average 0 30 0 25 mg l 1 in the stream br was detected only few months later on august 06th 2014 br detection in sw was limited to only 1 sample in 2014 with 0 04 mg l 1 the one collected on august 06th in 2015 br was detected again in the stream in concentrations of 0 04 0 02 mg l 1 fig 4d fig 6 shows the relationship between gw3 and sw cl a sw cl and sw discharge b gw3 cl and groundwater depth c gw3 cl and gw3 ec d the same relationships are shown for br in the right column fig 6e h the scatterplots show that br concentrations in sw are ten times lower than in gw3 br was not detected in most of the samples in sw only 8 out of the 56 samples following tracer input fig 6f all the detections corresponded to low water table depth fig 6g and low flow days below 5 l s 1 apart from two cases with respectively 8 6 l s 1 on 01 04 2015 and 20 6 l s 1 03 12 2015 fig 6f moreover br concentrations were detected in sw mostly when the sample occurred on a non rainy day fig 3 an exception is the last part of 2015 with 2 samples where br was detected on rainfall events lower than 1 m experiment 2 stream sampling showed that there was significant br remobilisation in later events we observed similar or lower concentrations in the sampling points downstream with respect to 3 other sampling sites located upstream and on the topographical slope fig 1c at sw the total of br exported during the 1 month high sampling period during and following experiment 2 was equal to 125 68 g 2 5 of the total br sprinkled while the amount of br export in the downstream site was equal to 201 01 g 4 0 the specific contribution to stream flow during periods of discharge similar to those during the experimental sprinkling table 3 estimated using discharge measurements upstream and downstream from the hillslope total reach length of 10 m is 0 22 0 14 l s 1 manuscript in preparation 5 3 velocity estimates derived from the applied tracers estimates of maximum velocity were derived using the double stream ec peak on the last 2 days of experiment 1 section 4 2 4 these estimates were equal to 238 10 3 m h 1 april 9th and 208 10 3 m h 1 april 10th the maximum velocity estimated from the start of ec rise at gw3 a few days after the sprinkling was equal to 191 10 3 m h 1 the velocity estimated for the peak ec in the well corresponded to 98 10 3 m h 1 on the falling limb of gw3 ec plume the stream ec described in section 5 1 was used to estimate a measure of the arrival of the maximum velocity and the mean velocity in connection with the groundwater system equal to 17 0 10 3 m h 1 start of raise and 15 0 10 3 m h 1 corresponding to stream ec peak in 2014 the velocity derived from detecting br in sw in the biweekly samples ranged between 16 0 and 14 1 10 3 m h 1 calculated respectively for br detected on august 06th and the previous sample on july 24th in 2015 velocities ranged between 4 9 march 12th during experiment 2 and 2 7 10 3 m h 1 december 3rd the last sample where br was detected 5 4 celerity estimates derived from sprinkling and natural events fig 7 shows the box plot of each of the celerity indices estimated using discharge and water table response timings section 4 2 5 celerity values more than 3 standard deviations above the mean are indicated by red crosses and their event number event celerities were equal to 19 6 15 2 m h 1 csu and 15 2 21 8 m h 1 css while hillslope celerities were equal to 89 8 106 2 m h 1 cwu and 25 2 34 3 m h 1 cws fig 7 cwu values were overall much higher than the other estimates with a maximum of 450 m h 1 for event 3 fig 7 the maximum celerities for all estimates corresponded to the rainfall events that occurred in summer 2014 event 3 4 7 and 8 event 7 in particular was characterised by the highest intensity rate 37 mm h 1 as 21 mm rained in 30 min followed by event 3 with an intensity rate of 11 mm h 1 fig 8 shows celerity estimates plotted against each event s intensity rate event intensity duration distinguishing dry summer and wet winter events other predictors such as maximum intensity rainfall duration antecedent moisture conditions and antecedent precipitation index did not explain the different celerity response 6 discussion 6 1 how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs the artificial sprinkling experiments did not generate significant hydrometric responses in the gw3 or sw due to the small amount of sprinkled water on the plot relative to the upslope hillslope area section 5 1 hydrometric responses in this catchment are comprised of an initial discharge peak coinciding with incident precipitation depending on antecedent storage conditions this peak can occur independently or concurrently with a large secondary peak referred to as a double peak response martínez carreras et al 2016 during single peak events rainfall 15 mm sw discharge peaked in less than 1 h while the water table measured at gw3 reacted after the discharge peak at the same time maximum cross correlations between rainfall and discharge in single peak events were always greater than the maximum cross correlations between rainfall and water table table 2 indicating that discharge and rainfall were better correlated during single peak events greater than 15 mm the delayed hillslope runoff response relative to that of streamflow has been observed in other studies harr 1977 montgomery et al 1997 penna et al 2015 turton et al 1992 weyman 1970 this suggests a complexity in the groundwater response time in comparison to discharge and suggests delayed recharge to the water table from the unsaturated zone over most of the catchment area except perhaps in near saturated riparian areas considering that the first peak is indeed primarily event water as proposed by jackisch et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 the cross correlation analysis suggests that the hillslope response in some cases may be controlled by a storage threshold rather than rainfall characteristics gannon et al 2014 graham et al 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the computed cross correlations using time series from double peak events show that there is a mechanism of release of water that is activated when the depth to groundwater reaches to within 1 6 1 5 m of the soil surface for rainfall events of more than 15 mm above this limit the water table triggers a connection to the stream within a time frame of 1 3 h such connection is demonstrated by the correlation of the second lagged discharge rise to water table dynamics rather than to rainfall such cases could be defined as storage driven discharge peaks and correspond to the second type of peak response described in martínez carreras et al 2016 in the case of the storage driven double peak events cross correlation analysis suggests the first peak can be seen as rainfall driven as the maximum correlation to rainfall is similar to correlation coefficients among single peak events section 5 1 some events exhibit a general poor correlation among rainfall discharge and water table dynamics event 12 and 21 double peak events characterised by long rainfall duration and low intensity table 2 this is likely due to composite rainfall driven and storage driven discharge peaks which are more difficult to evaluate with the cross correlation technique the rising of the water table at the hillslope base concomitantly or before discharge increase is a common perception of hillslope groundwater contributions kim et al 2004 mosley 1979 sklash and farvolden 1979 the different temporal response observed here between groundwater and streamflow in the rainfall driven and storage driven peaks indicates a more complex non linear hillslope response mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and helps demonstrate the dependence of the runoff on storage as shown in martínez carreras et al 2016 6 2 tracer transport between plot and stream 6 2 1 groundwater response the amounts of cl and br sprinkled during the 2 experiments were detected in both gw3 and sw at different times section 5 2 in gw3 a rise in water table corresponded to a decrease in ec indicating dilution whilst a decrease in water table corresponded to a rise in ec value indicating higher concentrations fig 4 the tracers stored in the subsurface are likely responsible for the ec rise in gw3 as ec is an indicator for dissolved ions hayashi 2004 previous work at the plot scale from soil analysis performed in autumn 2014 after experiment 1 was carried out showed that significant amounts of cl and br stored in the soil were likely remobilised during rainfall events and that such remobilisation was more pronounced in the case of heavy summer events scaini et al 2017 unpublished additional laboratory experiments established that the soil of the studied hillslope has the potential to retain on average about 30 and 25 of cl and br respectively fig si 1 they also show that the stored tracers cannot be totally removed from the soil matrix during successive leaching experiments and about 10 of both tracers could be suspected to stay for a longer term fig si 2 an interesting consequence of this behaviour is shown by the third peak in the water table ec fig 4c during one of the driest months of the series october 2015 30 mm rainfall the water table level was low 1 9 m below the surface and stable under these conditions well ec exhibited its highest value for the entire two year series 207 µs cm 1 on october 23rd however the groundwater level readings between september and november 2015 are suspect of malfunctioning of the instrument because the water level does not decrease during a period without rainfalls as the ec ofthe water table is recorded by the same instrument we cannot yet make a sound interpretation of this late rise of ec because it might be caused by an instrumental error 6 2 2 stream response an inverse relationship between ec and discharge linked to dilution was also observed in the stream data and has been documented by others kobayashi 1986 in support of this interpretation br was detected in the stream measurement points only on low flow days fig 6 when stream chemistry was not diluted with water from rainfall events the only stream br sample that was detected during high discharge 20 6 l s 1 was also the only sample containing detectable br this event occurred after a long period of low flow 0 31 0 25 l s 1 unfortunately stream ec was not available during such a time period fig 4 the reason for stream ec rise during low flows and heavy summer events in 2014 could be due to groundwater fluxes releasing in the stream the high ec water containing tracers in wet conditions such contribution could be not detected because of its minor contribution to catchment scale runoff generation as we do observe little br in the stream during rainfall events the tracer detection in the stream only under low flow conditions does not mean that there is no br during high flows tracer flux may increase during high flows but the increase may still not achieve concentrations above the detection limit as this hillslope with an upslope accumulating area of 3 ha represents a small fraction of the total catchment area 46 ha 6 3 how do bedrock structural properties influence tracer transport from plot to stream recent studies have recognized the importance of identifying runoff generating mechanisms governed by fractured bedrock hydrogeology banks et al 2009 hale et al 2016 in the weierbach limited information has been available to date to understand the extent that fractured bedrock can influence subsurface flow dynamics our set up allowed us to investigate whether water from the hillslope during events moved along the bedrock cleavage plans or along the predominant slope angle fig 1 c differences in concentration between the stream sampling points show a clear increase in the downslope sampling points with respect to the sampling point located along the predominant slope angle this suggests that the predominant flowpath direction follows the bedrock cleavage and not the surface slope mass flux estimates of br export were higher at the furthest downstream measurement point 4 of input relative to sw the stream outlet 2 5 of input br was detected only twice directly downstream from the hillslope section 5 2 unfortunately the two wells located at the bottom of the experimental plot gw1 and gw2 were dry throughout the observation period and do not provide useful information other than to further reinforce the heterogeneous nature of the bedrock with the available data we cannot query whether the tracer plume moved further downstream than the strike had suggested i e did more tracer reach the stream at angles greater than the bedrock cleavage our data suggest the possibility that groundwater flow was dominated by a downslope gradient different from the surface slope such a possibility is described in fig 9 where arrows indicate the prevalent flow direction in the soil layer vertical and bedrock laterally oriented fractures due to cleavage this 2 layered structure suggests that the deeper groundwater body within the bedrock would also cause the catchment area to differ from its topographical approximation the importance of the subsurface boundaries have been recently discussed in hydrological studies hale et al 2016 identified subsurface permeability structure as the main control on water storage and release in another study fractured sedimentary bedrock were responsible for the rapid response of bedrock groundwater at the hillslope scale padilla et al 2014 and resultant generated runoff padilla et al 2015 pfister et al 2017 have documented bedrock geological controls on catchment storage mixing and release in a set of 16 nested catchments in luxembourg in our study we could not locate the maximum depth to which groundwater storage extends but we did manage to identify a structure that controls flow direction through the cleavage orientation and demonstrated its importance in directing hillslope runoff in this catchment a component of flow through the bedrock could also control a larger component of the water balance as was the case in panola tromp van meerveld et al 2007 our hillslope scale experiment showed that in the case of fractured systems like the weierbach catchment not only bedrock topography but also the cleavage controls the release of water to the stream our findings are valid for rainfall events greater than 15 m as large amounts of water were sprinkled on a 642 plot section 4 1 during relatively dry antecedent conditions across the catchment more generally we suggest that in addition to accounting for flow that occurs at the bedrock and soil interface we should also recognize the importance of the cleavage orientation to correctly characterise and predict the fracture contributions to runoff 6 4 how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities being able to estimate both celerity and velocity responses is an important step toward determining dynamic storage variability which controls both the hydrometric stream flow response and the storage that regulates solute transport beven 2012 birkel and soulsby 2015 davies and beven 2015 the integral celerity responses estimated for natural rainfall events were characterised by values within the 25th and 75th percentiles except for a few cases with exceptionally high values while the initial estimates were more variable particularly in the hillslope response fig 7 the heterogeneity of our celerity estimates reflects the complexity of the response of the catchment figs 7 and 8 the differences between initial and integral response of our estimates refer to the combination of different processes that are likely involved in the responses iorgulescu et al 2007 mcdonnell et al 2010 reeves et al 1996 the highest celerities observed during events characterised by high intensity and short duration were observed during june and july of 2014 events 3 4 7 and 8 in table 2 fig 7 the highest celerities corresponded to summer events where the intensity rate was the highest suggesting an influence of both event intensity and residual storage summer warm conditions on celerity responses in such a system a higher rainfall rate would generate a faster response in the unsaturated zone once a storage threshold has been exceeded resulting in a quicker celerity the importance of unsaturated zone dynamics in the hydrologic response was suggested in early studies in permeable soils torres et al 1998 and could explain the maximum initial celerities being higher than the integral celerities barnard et al 2010 we observed a seasonality effect in the intensity rate celerity response of fig 8 a 20 mm event in summer generates a higher impact on the residual storage of water than the same intensity in winter as such water quantity would be diluted within the higher winter residual storage in turn antecedent conditions in terms of api7 api30 and antecedent moisture of the correspondent rainfall event did not contribute to explain the high celerity values the hillslope set up included continuous measurement of water table depth and streamflow as well as ec monitoring and water sampling allowing for a comparison between velocities and celerities in comparison to the celerity the maximum velocity values indicated by a grey dotted line in fig 7 were always below 1 m h 1 in the same range of the lower celerities derived from the natural events equal to 0 9 1 1 m h 1 small amounts of shallow lateral preferential flow were observed at the sprinkler plot throughflow trenches at depths of 25 and 50 cm in the work of scaini et al 2017 for these flows the maximum vertical velocities estimated for the tracers were variable and ranged as high as 677 420 10 3 m h 1 whilst celerities were as high as 971 625 10 3 m h 1 at the plot scale the highest measured maximum velocity was equal to 1 2 h 1 here we estimated the maximum velocities at the hillslope scale as estimated by the two ec peaks recorded in sw 238 and 208 10 3 m h 1 and found that they are higher than maximum velocity in gw3 191 10 3 m h 1 suggesting possible preferential flow pathways sections 5 3 and 6 1 the ec peaks are not high in magnitude as increase in ec to 74 5 would correspond to a concentration of cl of 4 09 mg l1 section 4 2 3 and do not suggest a significant volume of tracer reaching the water table though no sample was available on those dates these maximum velocities suggest that preferential flowpaths may allow for the hillslope to contribute to the first discharge peak under the experimental conditions dry antecedent conditions and artificial sprinkling on the 642 plot only table 3 it is possible that preferential flow along the hillslope may not reach deep enough to instigate a downslope response see for example germann 2014 the estimate of maximum velocity to the stream following the groundwater well peak vmax ws both estimated by ec data 17 0 10 3 m h 1 and br detection 14 0 and 16 0 10 3 m h 1 were in agreement with each other given the sparse sampling interval section 4 2 4 the movement of tracer in the soil is complex with br involved in remobilisation processes as demonstrated by the high sampling stream set up during and after experiment 2 additionally we only calculated sample means with additional issues about i flux weighting as we detect concentrations but not fluxes at the well and ii dilution at the stream to concentrations below detection limit with the possibility of incomplete mixing with the stream water such problems in tracing preferential pathways and sources in fractured bedrock systems have been encountered by others genereux et al 1993 shand et al 2007 7 conclusions this study analysed the subsurface flow pathways in the weierbach catchment luxembourg the peculiarity of this catchment is that it is underlain by slate bedrock which is orientated in a preferential direction a major focus of this work was to understand the influence of this anisotropy on subsurface processes sprinkling experiments were designed to infer subsurface flow pathways in particular tracer concentrations were monitored at multiple sites through the stream and in a well located along the main direction of the bedrock cleavage estimates of hillslope and hydrograph celerities were calculated using water table and discharge responses respectively our main research questions are i how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs ii how do bedrock characteristic including orientation of the fractures influence tracer transport from plot to stream iii how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities from the combined hydrometric and chemical analyses we managed to provide answers to our specific questions for natural rainfall events of more than 15 mm there is a difference between the mechanisms controlling the rainfall driven single or first peaks in double peak events and storage driven second peak in double peak events discharge peaks supporting recent work undertaken by martínez carreras et al 2016 our results suggest that rainfall rate and residual storage present a seasonality effect and are the primary controls on celerity responses the characteristics of our site suggested that bedrock structural properties as cleavage orientation control flow direction as subsurface flowpaths were in line with the orientation of the bedrock fractures combining velocity and celerity estimates we suggest that there could be a fast flowpath component connecting the hillslope to the stream but velocity information was too scarce to prove such a hypothesis as velocity estimates were largely lower than celerities this study has suggested the importance of fracture orientation in subsurface flow generation in forested catchments in particular cleavage orientation is important in determining the

7459,subsurface flow is often recognized as a dominant runoff generation process however observing subsurface properties and understanding how they control flow pathways remains challenging this paper investigates how surface slope and bedrock cleavage control subsurface flow pathways in a slate bedrock headwater catchment in luxembourg characterised by a double peak streamflow response we use a range of experimental techniques including field observations of soil and bedrock characteristics and a sprinkling experiment at a site located 40 m upslope from the stream channel the sprinkling experiment uses br as a tracer which is measured at a well downslope from the plot and at various locations along the stream together with well and stream hydrometric responses the sprinkling experiment is used to estimate velocities and celerities which in turn are used to infer flow pathways our results indicate that the single or first peak of double peak events is rainfall driven controlled by rainfall while the second peak is storage driven controlled by storage the comparison between velocity and celerity estimates suggests a fast flowpath component connecting the hillslope to the stream but velocity information was too scarce to fully support such a hypothesis in addition different estimates of celerities suggest a seasonal influence of both rainfall intensity rate and residual water storage on the celerity responses at the hillslope scale at the catchment outlet the estimated of the total mass of br recovered in the stream was about 2 5 of the application further downstream the estimate mass of br was about 4 0 of the application this demonstrates that flowpaths do not appear to align with the slope gradient in contrast they appear to follow the strike of the bedrock cleavage our results have expanded our understanding of the importance of the subsurface in particular the underlying bedrock systems and the importance of cleavage orientation as well as topography in controlling subsurface flow direction in this catchment keywords velocity celerity fractured bedrock tracer experiments bedrock cleavage 1 introduction subsurface flow can be a dominant mechanism in runoff generation and has been widely investigated dunne 1978 hewlett and hibbert 1967 whipkey 1965 subsurface flow takes place both in the soil matrix beven 2010 gilman and newson 1980 jones and crane 1984 uchida et al 2005 and in soil cracks located between the soil and an impeding layer earthworm burrows root channels or other forms of macropores which enable the movement of water beven and germann 1982 bryan and jones 1997 chappell 2010 jackson 1992 runoff generation processes are typically studied at the hillslope scale dunne 1978 notwithstanding recent advances in measuring techniques measuring subsurface flow as well as the subsurface properties that control subsurface flow remains impracticable at other than the scale of small cores gabrielli et al 2012 hale and mcdonnell 2016 wienhöfer and zehe 2014 besides the soil properties the bedrock structure can have a strong influence on subsurface runoff although hard bedrock is often considered impermeable tromp van meerveld et al 2007 weyman 1973 wrede et al 2015 this assumption is often hopeful rather than realistic beven 2006 fractured bedrocks are very common in europe lorz et al 2011 and flow through bedrock can be substantial padilla et al 2015 tromp van meerveld et al 2007 hale et al 2016 identified subsurface permeability structures as the main control on water storage and release permeable bedrocks pose additional challenges regarding the identification of subsurface water release to the stream cook et al 2003 sklash and farvolden 1979 the geometry of fractures which depends on the parent lithology and history chappell et al 2007 onda et al 2001 can cause extreme spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity and groundwater flow rate cook et al 1996 2003 in order to understand how fractured bedrocks control hydrologic response it is necessary to describe each of the involved subsurface flowpaths and storage structures banks et al 2009 hale et al 2016 this approach however is impractical particularly for large areas therefore more commonly subsurface properties are inferred using other techniques such as by using geochemical tracers harr 1977 sidle et al 1995 tracer studies are employed to understand how quickly in what concentration and from what sources water reaches the stream tracer input output relationships are used to estimate the transit time distributions of water in the catchment klaus et al 2015 mcguire et al 2007 nyberg et al 1999 and can be useful to characterise flowpaths trudgill et al 1983 wienhöfer and zehe 2014 unfortunately the interpretation of the tracer results is often biased by the spatial and temporal resolution and analytical protocols of tracer collection abbott et al 2016 weihermüller et al 2007 tracer data can also be used to estimate velocities and celerities which can aid the interpretation of subsurface flow pathways in particular differences between velocities and celerities are thought to explain the rapid runoff of stored water during rainfall events mcdonnell and beven 2014 however few studies to date have quantified in situ velocities and celerities novel model frameworks consider both celerity distributions which manifest themselves in the hydrograph and velocity distributions manifested in tracer responses birkel and soulsby 2015 davies et al 2011 laine kaulio et al 2014 scudeler et al 2016 soulsby et al 2015 in a framework based on velocity celerity analysis the hydrograph and flow path velocity characteristics are integrated while average celerity and average velocity can be estimated at catchment scales rasmussen et al 2000 there have been very few studies that have attempted to study the characteristics of both celerities and velocities at field scale scaini et al 2017 our work is undertaken in the weierbach experimental catchment in luxembourg a site underlain by devonian slate juilleret et al 2011 moragues quiroga et al 2017 characterised by double peak runoff responses martínez carreras et al 2016 we complement previous work scaini et al 2017 which was based on the interpretation of estimates of maximum velocities and flow celerities during vertical infiltration and showed that at the plot scale the flow direction in the soil profile is predominantly vertical until the relatively impermeable boundary of the bedrock system is encountered the impermeable layer is located at about 2 3 m below the surface scaini et al 2017 the conditions required for the onset of lateral subsurface flow at the hillslope scale have not been previously investigated and are the focus of this complementary work our objective is to quantify celerities and velocities in the path between the hillslope plot and the stream by analysing artificial sprinkling experiments and stream chemistry specific research questions include i how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs ii how do bedrock structural properties particularly cleavage orientation influence tracer transport from plot to stream iii how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities the manuscript is structured as follows section 2 presents the research site followed by section 3 where the equipment used is presented and section 4 describing the sprinkling experiments and the analysis applied section 5 describes results on hydrometric response to rainfall and sprinkling tracer detection and velocity and celerity estimates section 6 discusses each of these research questions the paper concludes by summarizing the key findings of the study in relation to each of the research questions 2 description of the experimental field site the weierbach an experimental site located in the north west of luxembourg is a forested catchment underlain by devonian slate altitudes range from 465 to 512 m a s l average annual rainfall is 812 m a 2007 2016 and annual runoff ratios are around 0 55 2005 2008 martínez carreras et al 2016 geologically the catchment soils are developed on pleistocene periglacial slope deposits overlying in situ compact and slightly weathered slate bedrock also called saprock eggleton 2001 juilleret et al 2011 martínez carreras et al 2016 the whole regolith classification is dystric cambisol ruptic endoskeletic siltic protospodic according to the wrb reference wrb 2015 overlying a regolithic saprock vertifractic rootic slatic juilleret et al 2016 the 642 plot used for the sprinkling experiments is located 40 m uphill from the stream on the left bank fig 1 the slope is steep average of 10 and perpendicular to the stream rock cleavage or foliation is a property of rocks referring to layering along approximately parallel surfaces singhal and gupta 2010 the cleavage planes lead to preferential cracks within the rock depending on the extent of connectedness and orientation cracks can have a variable impact on water movement at the hillslope site a geological compass and clinometer measurement of the strike and dip of the cleavage plans showed on average 70 n degrees and a vertical dipping in other words diagonally with respect to the surface slope a sketch of its orientation is shown in fig 1b previous work assumed that significant lateral parallel to the surface topography subsurface flow would occur in the fractured bedrock or saprock or in the stony basal layer of the periglacial cover beds juilleret et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 our previous analysis however showed that the significance of lateral flow in the near surface soil profile at the site is very low scaini et al 2017 thus subsurface hillslope contributions to streamflow should are expected only below 2 3 m in the fractured slate bedrock this zone however is characterised by low porosity and resistivity which complicates the detection of lateral flow using geophysical methods here we attempt to examine the hillslope to channel flow pathways by characterising the release of water from the hillslope monitoring the outflow to the stream using tracers 3 materials considering the hillslope as a system we present the equipment used to generate or measure i input of water and tracers ii internal states including water content and concentrations iii output of water and tracers in the stream 3 1 input natural precipitation was recorded by a tipping bucket rain gauge campbell scientific ltd model 52203 located 3 5 km from the experimental catchment at the roodt automatic weather station the high density of vegetation hindered measurements of natural precipitation closer to the experimental plot 3 2 internal states in order to detect lateral flow beneath the collection troughs two groundwater wells of 2 in diameter were installed at the base of the plot drilling was performed from the surface of the forest road on the two sides of the roof covering the base of the plot the two wells were drilled to 2 gw1 and 2 4 m gw2 depth and equipped with pressure sensors for measurement of conductivity temperature and water level hydromet ott ctd fig 1c additionally a 3 in diameter groundwater well gw3 located 12 m from the stream fig 1b was monitored for water table depth fluctuations electric conductivity ec and temperature using another ott ctd sensor the well gw3 was drilled in 2009 and was sited to follow the cleavage strike fig 1b the chemical composition of the well water was analysed with grab samples collected at variable time steps during the experiments to characterise the evolution of the concentrations of the well outside the artificial experiments bi weekly samples were taken during a period of 2 years finally a 2 in groundwater well located on the plateau uphill of the study plot gw4 was monitored for water table depth fluctuations electric conductivity ec and temperature starting from september 2014 using a multi probe td diver schlumberger water services as the monitoring was not permanent during the studied period this well was used mostly as a reference for overall water table fluctuations 3 3 outputs stream water level at the outlet sw was measured using a pressure transducer isco 4120 flow logger in combination with a v notch weir ec at the outlet was also continuously monitored using a conductivity probe wtw 3310 the chemical composition of the stream water at sw was monitored during a period of 2 years using manual bi weekly samples additionally a high resolution stream sampling set up was undertaken during the sprinkling experiments the stream was sampled at 3 different locations i at sw the outlet ii 30 m upstream upstream respect to the study hillslope and iii 15 m downstream using automatic water samplers isco 6712 fig 1c manual samples were also manually collected at 2 intermediate locations fig 1c 4 methods this section describes the measurements performed during the sprinkling experiments section 4 1 and the analyses of the measured data collected during the experiments section 4 2 4 1 sprinkling experiments artificial irrigation experiments were carried out between march 31st and april 10th 2014 experiment 1 and had the aim to explore plot scale generation of shallow lateral flow described in scaini et al 2017 experiment 1 raised the need for additional monitoring of the stream to help understand the subsurface flow pathways experiment 2 was therefore performed using different tracers between march 11th and 16th 2015 for a full description of the experiments and analysis of flows in the near surface soil see scaini et al 2017 4 1 1 plot scale monitoring experiment 1 during experiment 1 solutions containing different concentrations of nacl and kbr were used to sprinkle the area the sampling protocol was mostly carried out at the plot scale to characterise plot response given some shortcomings in the experimental design absence of shallow lateral flow limited information on deeper storage need of including stream sampling to study the release of water from the hillslope described in scaini et al 2017 we refined the methodology and experimental design in a second experiment 4 1 2 stream intensive sampling experiment 2 during experiment 2 solutions of water and nacl were applied and additional data were used to monitor hillslope response the stream was sampled at high frequency at 3 locations fig 1c stars using isco automatic samplers section 3 3 programmed at 30 min time step during the experiment and progressively longer time steps for a period of 3 weeks after the experiment from 1 h to 6 h time step manual samples were taken at 2 locations at hourly time step during the experiment fig 1c circles 4 2 analyses of measured data 4 2 1 hydrometric monitoring during the experiments the water table depth fluctuations ec and temperature were recorded at 15 min intervals in gw3 in order to capture lower lateral flow the two wells at the bottom of the plot gw1 and gw2 in fig 1c recorded water table height temperature and ec at variable time step up to 5 s time step during the experiments runoff and ec at the outlet grey star fig 1b were continuously recorded at 15 min intervals 4 2 2 natural rainfall events analysis a series of natural rainfall events were considered for the analysis the selection criteria focused on rainfall events of a total of at least 15 mm to analyse event magnitudes as much as possible similar to the sprinkling each event was considered separately when the time elapsed from the previous event was at least 3 h as during the sprinkling experiments each day s irrigation was carried out non stop or stopped for a period between 1 and 3 h rainfall intensity catchment wetness in terms of antecedent precipitation index api calculated for 30 and 7 days prior to the rainfall event and the timing of stream and groundwater response were calculated for each rainfall event cross correlation was used to calculate the time lag for which the correlation between rainfall and stream discharge was maximum in the same way the time lag corresponding to the maximum correlation between rainfall and water table depth was also computed in this case maximum inverse correlation double peaks in the hydrograph were observed from late autumn to early spring when soil moisture values are higher there were also a few cases where summer double peak events occurred linked to large precipitation events martínez carreras et al 2016 cross correlation was also computed for the double peak events the results of cross correlations were used to check for differences between single and double peak discharge and groundwater response timings 4 2 3 tracer monitoring the arrival time of the tracers to each sampling point was determined by comparison with the background values tracers dissolved in the input water were used to track the water knowing precisely its input times and chemical composition all collected water samples were filtered using acrodisc syringe 0 45 µm filters pall corporation in order to be analysed for chloride cl and bromide br concentrations using ionic chromatography dionex ics 5000 the detection limit of the analyses was 0 01 mg l 1 for cl and 0 02 0 01 mg l 1 for br background anions and cations in the stream and groundwater were measured over a three year long bi weekly sampling campaign between 2011 and 2013 the average value of the background cl concentration in the input water was 3 33 2 45 mg l 1 no detectable br concentrations were found in the background samples the average ec value in the stream water was 45 10 µs cm 1 cl detected in the well over the 3 years bi weekly campaign were equal to 5 15 0 42 mg l 1 while ec had mean value of 107 6 µs cm 1 a linear regression model to estimate cl from ec was fitted to such data chang et al 1983 siosemarde et al 2010 br concentrations during the high frequency sampling stream campaign experiment 2 section 4 1 2 were used to calculate the mass of br leaving the system this was performed by i interpolating the missing concentration data to hourly time step ii multiplying br concentrations to discharge available at hourly time step to obtain the load iii summing up all the values to obtain the total mass of br 4 2 4 velocity estimates given the importance of both celerity and velocity in storage discharge responses mcdonnell and beven 2014 estimates of both quantities were derived using a data based approach for both velocities and celerities a time difference and distance are required a velocity distribution summarizes the range of velocities of water particles within the subsurface wider distributions are indicative of larger heterogeneities and variability of flow pathways whereas narrower distributions are representative of more homogeneous conditions davies and beven 2012 maximum velocity can be derived as the first detection of a tracer at a measurement point and represents the fastest flow pathway mcdonnell and beven 2014 mean velocity provides information on propagation storage and remobilisation of tracers maximum and mean velocity determined from the tracer data and the information on the lengths and times used to compute each velocity are shown in table 1 a the arrival times of br and ec used as a proxy for salt tracer to well and stream were used to estimate information on velocities for the time information each velocity was computed using tracer application as a starting point at the well gw3 the maximum velocity was computed by dividing the distance between the plot and the well by the time at which a start of ec rise corresponding to the time at which the tracer plume reached the well occurred v max w table 1a the well ec peak provided time information regarding the arrival of the maximum concentration of the plume an approximation of the mean velocity v w in the same way the plot stream downslope distance was divided by the time between start of tracer application and start of the ec rise in the stream to compute the maximum velocity v max s the plot stream downslope distance was divided by the timing of the stream ec peak to estimate the mean velocity v s 4 2 5 celerity estimates celerity is defined with respect to the speed with which a perturbation to the flow propagates through the flow domain mcdonnell and beven 2014 celerity responses depend on the nature of the perturbation and the antecedent wetness which in our case is determined by the artificial and natural rainfall events defining a consistent framework to calculate the spatial propagation of a perturbation is critical to be able to look at the celerity estimates for the purposes of analysis we need to provide working definitions of celerities that can be calculated from the data for the water table we can assume that the first response following rainfall will be a good indication of first wetting celerity in the unsaturated zone classically as a wetting front shock beven 1981 but here more likely as a result of preferential flow in the case of the stream the initial rise will be a combination of the initial response in the riparian area and routing through the channel network we can also define celerities based on the time to peak of the water table and hydrograph for the water table response this will represent an average for the unsaturated zone and saturated zone response upstream of the well for the discharge it represents and integral of the hillslope and channel network responses including likely fast pathways through the bedrock fractures of hillslopes as recent research suggested jackisch et al 2016 martínez carreras et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 thus we calculate the following celerity indices as described in fig 2 and table 1b using the natural rainfall events described in section 4 2 2 1 initial event celerity csu was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and start of discharge rise at outlet 2 integral event hydrograph celerity css was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and peak discharge at the outlet 3 initial hillslope celerity cwu was estimated using the time frame between rainfall and start of water table response in gw3 4 integral hillslope celerity cws was estimated using the time frame between rainfall start and peak of water table response in gw3 to define the relevant downslope distances we used a 5 5 dem in the single or first peak events the distance was defined as the mean downslope distance between the stream and the hillslope slope 6 5 in the double peak events the mean downslope distance between the stream and the divide slope 6 5 was used to include the plateau as in the formulation of martínez carreras et al 2016 css fig 2b mean hillslope lengths used for the stream celerity cs were defined using the following procedure i computing the euclidean distance to the stream for each pixel of the dem ii computing and clustering the slopes of the weierbach 6 5 and 6 5 iii computing the average downslope distance for all the pixels 6 5 corresponding to the hillslope and 6 5 plateau in the case of the well response the fixed planar distance between the 2 wells located respectively on the plateau gw4 and at the bottom of the slope gw3 was used to compute information of celerity fig 2b such measure was divided by the start of water table rise to compute cwu and time of peak to compute cws both calculated from the start of the rainfall event 5 results 5 1 response to natural rainfall and to sprinkling table 2 summarizes the characteristics of 21 natural events 12 in 2014 and 9 in 2015 having cumulative rainfall higher than 15 mm section 4 2 2 in addition to the characteristics of each rainfall event the maximum cross correlations between rainfall and groundwater and rainfall and discharge responses are given for each event the relationship between time series was analysed as a first check for relationships between variables the average of the maximum correlation coefficients r between rainfall and discharge as used to indicate the average lag time was equal to 0 66 in all cases the corresponding time lag was below 1 h showing a relatively homogeneous response of the discharge to rainfall in terms of timing table 2 in the case of event 19 the maximum correlation occurred for the non lagged discharge showing that the response to rainfall was quicker than 15 min one time step table 2 the maximum lag time between rainfall and water table response ranged between 0 5 and 12 5 h table 2 with maximum r between 0 10 and 0 70 showing a more complex timing response in all the single peak cases the start of the discharge rising limb and discharge peak always preceded the first rise of the water table in the cases where a double peak occurred the discharge peak followed the maximum rise of the water table measured from gw3 with peaks lagged between 1 and 3 h fig 3 shows the discharge storage relationship fig 3a as well as the ec well relationship fig 3b with a few events of more than 15 mm rainfall highlighted by colours events 1 2 3 7 10 12 table 2 the event of december 2014 highlighted in yellow in fig 3 generated the highest water table reaching 1 m below soil surface and discharge peak up to 80 l s 1 the relationship between water table depth and ec does not follow a clear pattern even though we can see the peaks due to the tracing experiments where despite the absence of response in the water table the ec rose to the maximum values for the series fig 3b the stream and gw3 were not affected by the experiments both stream discharge and groundwater depth did not have a significant response during both experiment 1 and experiment 2 table 3 shows for both experiment 1 and 2 the minimum and maximum values of groundwater ec and depth to water table measured

rises in gw3 were observed fig 4c three distinct ec peaks were observed i following experiment 1 ii following experiment 2 iii in late 2015 indicated in fig 4c the ec in gw3 started to rise on april 09th and peaked on april 18th 2014 with 201 µs cm 1 the closest sample analysed was taken on the april 19th where ec was 179 µs cm 1 and cl was 28 79 mg l 1 fig 4d the average value of the ec in gw3 rose from 107 6 µs cm 1 before experiment 1 to 148 19 µs cm 1 after experiment 1 fig 4c the second ec peak following experiment 2 was lower than the previous year with a peak value of 176 µs cm 1 reached on march 14th 2015 the third rise occurred in late 2015 slowly rising starting in september 21st until its recession in november 11th with a peak of 207 µs cm 1 on october 23rd during a dry period api7 3 5 mm api30 30 mm in the stream ec rose twice on the last 2 days of experiment 1 april 09th and 10th 2014 cl and br were applied respectively to each of these events section 4 1 1 stream ec started to peak around 1330 on april 09th 6 h after the well ec started rising the two stream ec peaks were sharp both had duration of 4 h between start and fall and occurred on the only 2 days where shallow lateral flow occurred respectively 430 and 330 after the shallow lateral flow had initiated scaini et al 2017 the 2 peaks of stream ec were equal to 74 5 and 72 9 µs cm 1 respectively the estimated amount of each peak s cl concentration was respectively 4 09 and 4 02 mg l 1 using the calibration curve between ec and cl described in section 4 2 3 the first few natural rainfall events after experiment 1 did not generate any ec change in the stream fig 4c in july between the 11th and the 21st an ec peak was detected at the stream outlet fig 4c the july peak reached the maximum of stream ec in the whole time series reaching 145 µs cm 1 the delayed peak in stream ec followed three important summer events july 6th 16 mm 8th 16 2 mm and 9th 21 6 mm for a total of 53 7 mm in three days api30 48 0 mm api7 9 4 mm to understand this behaviour we analyse the events of a similar magnitude or higher during the 2 ear period comprising the events 5 2 tracer detection in gw3 cl detection rose from an average value of 5 15 0 42 mg l 1 before experiment 1 to an average value of 7 88 6 64 mg l 1 after it fig 4e this suggests that significant amounts of cl moved through the hillslope and likely reached the stream the natural presence of cl in stream water does not allow the data to be analysed unambiguously as the average concentrations before 3 15 0 13 mg l 1 and after 3 22 0 51 mg l 1 the experiments were very similar therefore we focus on br as it was the only tracer that could be used to characterise hillslope response fig 5 shows cumulative rainfall plotted against cumulative discharge in both 2014 and 2015 in light blue highlighted by circles experiments 1 and 2 are shown the time where br was detected in gw3 and in sw are highlighted br was detected on multiple samples in summer 2015 first it reached sw in detectable quantities during the higher frequency sampling of experiment 2 fig 4e then it was detected on multiple occasions between may 11th and 13th june 24th and july 08th and until september 08th 2015 with rising concentrations during both summers the stream was intermittently dry with experiment 1 a total of 5 kg of kbr were released during sprinkling through the following months br was first detected in gw3 starting on june 11th and was detected in 3 consecutive samples until beginning of august 2014 starting from august 20th br was not detected anymore in the well until experiment 2 when br was again detected in all samples between march 12th and march 23rd fig 4e br concentrations in gw3 in this time period were on average 0 30 0 25 mg l 1 in the stream br was detected only few months later on august 06th 2014 br detection in sw was limited to only 1 sample in 2014 with 0 04 mg l 1 the one collected on august 06th in 2015 br was detected again in the stream in concentrations of 0 04 0 02 mg l 1 fig 4d fig 6 shows the relationship between gw3 and sw cl a sw cl and sw discharge b gw3 cl and groundwater depth c gw3 cl and gw3 ec d the same relationships are shown for br in the right column fig 6e h the scatterplots show that br concentrations in sw are ten times lower than in gw3 br was not detected in most of the samples in sw only 8 out of the 56 samples following tracer input fig 6f all the detections corresponded to low water table depth fig 6g and low flow days below 5 l s 1 apart from two cases with respectively 8 6 l s 1 on 01 04 2015 and 20 6 l s 1 03 12 2015 fig 6f moreover br concentrations were detected in sw mostly when the sample occurred on a non rainy day fig 3 an exception is the last part of 2015 with 2 samples where br was detected on rainfall events lower than 1 m experiment 2 stream sampling showed that there was significant br remobilisation in later events we observed similar or lower concentrations in the sampling points downstream with respect to 3 other sampling sites located upstream and on the topographical slope fig 1c at sw the total of br exported during the 1 month high sampling period during and following experiment 2 was equal to 125 68 g 2 5 of the total br sprinkled while the amount of br export in the downstream site was equal to 201 01 g 4 0 the specific contribution to stream flow during periods of discharge similar to those during the experimental sprinkling table 3 estimated using discharge measurements upstream and downstream from the hillslope total reach length of 10 m is 0 22 0 14 l s 1 manuscript in preparation 5 3 velocity estimates derived from the applied tracers estimates of maximum velocity were derived using the double stream ec peak on the last 2 days of experiment 1 section 4 2 4 these estimates were equal to 238 10 3 m h 1 april 9th and 208 10 3 m h 1 april 10th the maximum velocity estimated from the start of ec rise at gw3 a few days after the sprinkling was equal to 191 10 3 m h 1 the velocity estimated for the peak ec in the well corresponded to 98 10 3 m h 1 on the falling limb of gw3 ec plume the stream ec described in section 5 1 was used to estimate a measure of the arrival of the maximum velocity and the mean velocity in connection with the groundwater system equal to 17 0 10 3 m h 1 start of raise and 15 0 10 3 m h 1 corresponding to stream ec peak in 2014 the velocity derived from detecting br in sw in the biweekly samples ranged between 16 0 and 14 1 10 3 m h 1 calculated respectively for br detected on august 06th and the previous sample on july 24th in 2015 velocities ranged between 4 9 march 12th during experiment 2 and 2 7 10 3 m h 1 december 3rd the last sample where br was detected 5 4 celerity estimates derived from sprinkling and natural events fig 7 shows the box plot of each of the celerity indices estimated using discharge and water table response timings section 4 2 5 celerity values more than 3 standard deviations above the mean are indicated by red crosses and their event number event celerities were equal to 19 6 15 2 m h 1 csu and 15 2 21 8 m h 1 css while hillslope celerities were equal to 89 8 106 2 m h 1 cwu and 25 2 34 3 m h 1 cws fig 7 cwu values were overall much higher than the other estimates with a maximum of 450 m h 1 for event 3 fig 7 the maximum celerities for all estimates corresponded to the rainfall events that occurred in summer 2014 event 3 4 7 and 8 event 7 in particular was characterised by the highest intensity rate 37 mm h 1 as 21 mm rained in 30 min followed by event 3 with an intensity rate of 11 mm h 1 fig 8 shows celerity estimates plotted against each event s intensity rate event intensity duration distinguishing dry summer and wet winter events other predictors such as maximum intensity rainfall duration antecedent moisture conditions and antecedent precipitation index did not explain the different celerity response 6 discussion 6 1 how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs the artificial sprinkling experiments did not generate significant hydrometric responses in the gw3 or sw due to the small amount of sprinkled water on the plot relative to the upslope hillslope area section 5 1 hydrometric responses in this catchment are comprised of an initial discharge peak coinciding with incident precipitation depending on antecedent storage conditions this peak can occur independently or concurrently with a large secondary peak referred to as a double peak response martínez carreras et al 2016 during single peak events rainfall 15 mm sw discharge peaked in less than 1 h while the water table measured at gw3 reacted after the discharge peak at the same time maximum cross correlations between rainfall and discharge in single peak events were always greater than the maximum cross correlations between rainfall and water table table 2 indicating that discharge and rainfall were better correlated during single peak events greater than 15 mm the delayed hillslope runoff response relative to that of streamflow has been observed in other studies harr 1977 montgomery et al 1997 penna et al 2015 turton et al 1992 weyman 1970 this suggests a complexity in the groundwater response time in comparison to discharge and suggests delayed recharge to the water table from the unsaturated zone over most of the catchment area except perhaps in near saturated riparian areas considering that the first peak is indeed primarily event water as proposed by jackisch et al 2016 wrede et al 2015 the cross correlation analysis suggests that the hillslope response in some cases may be controlled by a storage threshold rather than rainfall characteristics gannon et al 2014 graham et al 2010 tromp van meerveld and mcdonnell 2006 the computed cross correlations using time series from double peak events show that there is a mechanism of release of water that is activated when the depth to groundwater reaches to within 1 6 1 5 m of the soil surface for rainfall events of more than 15 mm above this limit the water table triggers a connection to the stream within a time frame of 1 3 h such connection is demonstrated by the correlation of the second lagged discharge rise to water table dynamics rather than to rainfall such cases could be defined as storage driven discharge peaks and correspond to the second type of peak response described in martínez carreras et al 2016 in the case of the storage driven double peak events cross correlation analysis suggests the first peak can be seen as rainfall driven as the maximum correlation to rainfall is similar to correlation coefficients among single peak events section 5 1 some events exhibit a general poor correlation among rainfall discharge and water table dynamics event 12 and 21 double peak events characterised by long rainfall duration and low intensity table 2 this is likely due to composite rainfall driven and storage driven discharge peaks which are more difficult to evaluate with the cross correlation technique the rising of the water table at the hillslope base concomitantly or before discharge increase is a common perception of hillslope groundwater contributions kim et al 2004 mosley 1979 sklash and farvolden 1979 the different temporal response observed here between groundwater and streamflow in the rainfall driven and storage driven peaks indicates a more complex non linear hillslope response mcguire and mcdonnell 2010 and helps demonstrate the dependence of the runoff on storage as shown in martínez carreras et al 2016 6 2 tracer transport between plot and stream 6 2 1 groundwater response the amounts of cl and br sprinkled during the 2 experiments were detected in both gw3 and sw at different times section 5 2 in gw3 a rise in water table corresponded to a decrease in ec indicating dilution whilst a decrease in water table corresponded to a rise in ec value indicating higher concentrations fig 4 the tracers stored in the subsurface are likely responsible for the ec rise in gw3 as ec is an indicator for dissolved ions hayashi 2004 previous work at the plot scale from soil analysis performed in autumn 2014 after experiment 1 was carried out showed that significant amounts of cl and br stored in the soil were likely remobilised during rainfall events and that such remobilisation was more pronounced in the case of heavy summer events scaini et al 2017 unpublished additional laboratory experiments established that the soil of the studied hillslope has the potential to retain on average about 30 and 25 of cl and br respectively fig si 1 they also show that the stored tracers cannot be totally removed from the soil matrix during successive leaching experiments and about 10 of both tracers could be suspected to stay for a longer term fig si 2 an interesting consequence of this behaviour is shown by the third peak in the water table ec fig 4c during one of the driest months of the series october 2015 30 mm rainfall the water table level was low 1 9 m below the surface and stable under these conditions well ec exhibited its highest value for the entire two year series 207 µs cm 1 on october 23rd however the groundwater level readings between september and november 2015 are suspect of malfunctioning of the instrument because the water level does not decrease during a period without rainfalls as the ec ofthe water table is recorded by the same instrument we cannot yet make a sound interpretation of this late rise of ec because it might be caused by an instrumental error 6 2 2 stream response an inverse relationship between ec and discharge linked to dilution was also observed in the stream data and has been documented by others kobayashi 1986 in support of this interpretation br was detected in the stream measurement points only on low flow days fig 6 when stream chemistry was not diluted with water from rainfall events the only stream br sample that was detected during high discharge 20 6 l s 1 was also the only sample containing detectable br this event occurred after a long period of low flow 0 31 0 25 l s 1 unfortunately stream ec was not available during such a time period fig 4 the reason for stream ec rise during low flows and heavy summer events in 2014 could be due to groundwater fluxes releasing in the stream the high ec water containing tracers in wet conditions such contribution could be not detected because of its minor contribution to catchment scale runoff generation as we do observe little br in the stream during rainfall events the tracer detection in the stream only under low flow conditions does not mean that there is no br during high flows tracer flux may increase during high flows but the increase may still not achieve concentrations above the detection limit as this hillslope with an upslope accumulating area of 3 ha represents a small fraction of the total catchment area 46 ha 6 3 how do bedrock structural properties influence tracer transport from plot to stream recent studies have recognized the importance of identifying runoff generating mechanisms governed by fractured bedrock hydrogeology banks et al 2009 hale et al 2016 in the weierbach limited information has been available to date to understand the extent that fractured bedrock can influence subsurface flow dynamics our set up allowed us to investigate whether water from the hillslope during events moved along the bedrock cleavage plans or along the predominant slope angle fig 1 c differences in concentration between the stream sampling points show a clear increase in the downslope sampling points with respect to the sampling point located along the predominant slope angle this suggests that the predominant flowpath direction follows the bedrock cleavage and not the surface slope mass flux estimates of br export were higher at the furthest downstream measurement point 4 of input relative to sw the stream outlet 2 5 of input br was detected only twice directly downstream from the hillslope section 5 2 unfortunately the two wells located at the bottom of the experimental plot gw1 and gw2 were dry throughout the observation period and do not provide useful information other than to further reinforce the heterogeneous nature of the bedrock with the available data we cannot query whether the tracer plume moved further downstream than the strike had suggested i e did more tracer reach the stream at angles greater than the bedrock cleavage our data suggest the possibility that groundwater flow was dominated by a downslope gradient different from the surface slope such a possibility is described in fig 9 where arrows indicate the prevalent flow direction in the soil layer vertical and bedrock laterally oriented fractures due to cleavage this 2 layered structure suggests that the deeper groundwater body within the bedrock would also cause the catchment area to differ from its topographical approximation the importance of the subsurface boundaries have been recently discussed in hydrological studies hale et al 2016 identified subsurface permeability structure as the main control on water storage and release in another study fractured sedimentary bedrock were responsible for the rapid response of bedrock groundwater at the hillslope scale padilla et al 2014 and resultant generated runoff padilla et al 2015 pfister et al 2017 have documented bedrock geological controls on catchment storage mixing and release in a set of 16 nested catchments in luxembourg in our study we could not locate the maximum depth to which groundwater storage extends but we did manage to identify a structure that controls flow direction through the cleavage orientation and demonstrated its importance in directing hillslope runoff in this catchment a component of flow through the bedrock could also control a larger component of the water balance as was the case in panola tromp van meerveld et al 2007 our hillslope scale experiment showed that in the case of fractured systems like the weierbach catchment not only bedrock topography but also the cleavage controls the release of water to the stream our findings are valid for rainfall events greater than 15 m as large amounts of water were sprinkled on a 642 plot section 4 1 during relatively dry antecedent conditions across the catchment more generally we suggest that in addition to accounting for flow that occurs at the bedrock and soil interface we should also recognize the importance of the cleavage orientation to correctly characterise and predict the fracture contributions to runoff 6 4 how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities being able to estimate both celerity and velocity responses is an important step toward determining dynamic storage variability which controls both the hydrometric stream flow response and the storage that regulates solute transport beven 2012 birkel and soulsby 2015 davies and beven 2015 the integral celerity responses estimated for natural rainfall events were characterised by values within the 25th and 75th percentiles except for a few cases with exceptionally high values while the initial estimates were more variable particularly in the hillslope response fig 7 the heterogeneity of our celerity estimates reflects the complexity of the response of the catchment figs 7 and 8 the differences between initial and integral response of our estimates refer to the combination of different processes that are likely involved in the responses iorgulescu et al 2007 mcdonnell et al 2010 reeves et al 1996 the highest celerities observed during events characterised by high intensity and short duration were observed during june and july of 2014 events 3 4 7 and 8 in table 2 fig 7 the highest celerities corresponded to summer events where the intensity rate was the highest suggesting an influence of both event intensity and residual storage summer warm conditions on celerity responses in such a system a higher rainfall rate would generate a faster response in the unsaturated zone once a storage threshold has been exceeded resulting in a quicker celerity the importance of unsaturated zone dynamics in the hydrologic response was suggested in early studies in permeable soils torres et al 1998 and could explain the maximum initial celerities being higher than the integral celerities barnard et al 2010 we observed a seasonality effect in the intensity rate celerity response of fig 8 a 20 mm event in summer generates a higher impact on the residual storage of water than the same intensity in winter as such water quantity would be diluted within the higher winter residual storage in turn antecedent conditions in terms of api7 api30 and antecedent moisture of the correspondent rainfall event did not contribute to explain the high celerity values the hillslope set up included continuous measurement of water table depth and streamflow as well as ec monitoring and water sampling allowing for a comparison between velocities and celerities in comparison to the celerity the maximum velocity values indicated by a grey dotted line in fig 7 were always below 1 m h 1 in the same range of the lower celerities derived from the natural events equal to 0 9 1 1 m h 1 small amounts of shallow lateral preferential flow were observed at the sprinkler plot throughflow trenches at depths of 25 and 50 cm in the work of scaini et al 2017 for these flows the maximum vertical velocities estimated for the tracers were variable and ranged as high as 677 420 10 3 m h 1 whilst celerities were as high as 971 625 10 3 m h 1 at the plot scale the highest measured maximum velocity was equal to 1 2 h 1 here we estimated the maximum velocities at the hillslope scale as estimated by the two ec peaks recorded in sw 238 and 208 10 3 m h 1 and found that they are higher than maximum velocity in gw3 191 10 3 m h 1 suggesting possible preferential flow pathways sections 5 3 and 6 1 the ec peaks are not high in magnitude as increase in ec to 74 5 would correspond to a concentration of cl of 4 09 mg l1 section 4 2 3 and do not suggest a significant volume of tracer reaching the water table though no sample was available on those dates these maximum velocities suggest that preferential flowpaths may allow for the hillslope to contribute to the first discharge peak under the experimental conditions dry antecedent conditions and artificial sprinkling on the 642 plot only table 3 it is possible that preferential flow along the hillslope may not reach deep enough to instigate a downslope response see for example germann 2014 the estimate of maximum velocity to the stream following the groundwater well peak vmax ws both estimated by ec data 17 0 10 3 m h 1 and br detection 14 0 and 16 0 10 3 m h 1 were in agreement with each other given the sparse sampling interval section 4 2 4 the movement of tracer in the soil is complex with br involved in remobilisation processes as demonstrated by the high sampling stream set up during and after experiment 2 additionally we only calculated sample means with additional issues about i flux weighting as we detect concentrations but not fluxes at the well and ii dilution at the stream to concentrations below detection limit with the possibility of incomplete mixing with the stream water such problems in tracing preferential pathways and sources in fractured bedrock systems have been encountered by others genereux et al 1993 shand et al 2007 7 conclusions this study analysed the subsurface flow pathways in the weierbach catchment luxembourg the peculiarity of this catchment is that it is underlain by slate bedrock which is orientated in a preferential direction a major focus of this work was to understand the influence of this anisotropy on subsurface processes sprinkling experiments were designed to infer subsurface flow pathways in particular tracer concentrations were monitored at multiple sites through the stream and in a well located along the main direction of the bedrock cleavage estimates of hillslope and hydrograph celerities were calculated using water table and discharge responses respectively our main research questions are i how are groundwater and streamflow dynamics related to rainfall inputs ii how do bedrock characteristic including orientation of the fractures influence tracer transport from plot to stream iii how does tracer transport relate to estimates of celerities from the combined hydrometric and chemical analyses we managed to provide answers to our specific questions for natural rainfall events of more than 15 mm there is a difference between the mechanisms controlling the rainfall driven single or first peaks in double peak events and storage driven second peak in double peak events discharge peaks supporting recent work undertaken by martínez carreras et al 2016 our results suggest that rainfall rate and residual storage present a seasonality effect and are the primary controls on celerity responses the characteristics of our site suggested that bedrock structural properties as cleavage orientation control flow direction as subsurface flowpaths were in line with the orientation of the bedrock fractures combining velocity and celerity estimates we suggest that there could be a fast flowpath component connecting the hillslope to the stream but velocity information was too scarce to prove such a hypothesis as velocity estimates were largely lower than celerities this study has suggested the importance of fracture orientation in subsurface flow generation in forested catchments in particular cleavage orientation is important in determining the catchment area contributing to runoff which may differ significantly from the contributing area determined based on topography acknowledgments research funded by national research fund of luxembourg
