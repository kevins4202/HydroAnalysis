14610,in the present study effect of external and internal concentration polarization ecp and icp and reversible fouling on water flux behavior was evaluated for an activated sludge concentration process a solution of activated sludge from the biological treatment unit of a wastewater treatment plant was used as a feed solution fs with an initial total suspended solids tss concentration of 6198 mg l residual brine from a stuffed olive factory was used as a draw solution ds because of its osmotic potential equivalent to 1 2 m nacl this resulted in an increase in the initial fs concentration to around 16 850 mg l the experimental tests were carried out in a pilot plant with a flat fo membrane cell of 34 cm2 and fs and ds flow rates of 2 l min 1 and 0 5 l min 1 respectively at 20 0 3 c an active layer facing the fs orientation was selected because of the high tss concentration of the feed permeate flux showed initial values around 13 5 0 5 l m 2 h for the first two hours of operation but this gradually decreased to 5 3 0 5 l m 2 h after 24 h by modeling permeate flux performance the role that the feed and draw concentrations membrane orientation and membrane properties play in water flux were elucidated and linked to the prevalence of external and internal concentration polarization internal concentration polarization and fouling on the active layer were

important issue in mediterranean countries where table olives are considered important components of the mediterranean diet there is also significant consumption in other countries outside mediterranean region such as the usa russia and brazil the production of table olives is carried out in numerous industrial plants these manufacturing plants generate each year a large volume of table olive processing wastewater topw from the different production stages storage brines lye treatment brining fermentation and washing and color fixing the pollution load of these residues is considerable because the major constituent is organic matter consisting mainly of aromatic and phenolic compounds generating of enormous amounts of polluting and difficult to handle wastewater streams 1 2 3 in the case of anchovy stuffed olives processing the residual brine is the main waste stream of the process it is generated from the fermentation of brine aqueous nacl solution that is carried out in tanks where spontaneous fermentation takes place during the storage the concentration of nacl in brine is 2 10 that depending of the type of table olive processes 4 5 however the stuffed olive industry is forced to comply with the most stringent environmental regulations for the elimination of organic pollutants and the quality of their treated effluent on the other hand conventional activated sludge is the most commonly used method for municipal wastewater treatment however process produces a large amount of high water content sludge hence sludge dewatering process is obligatory for traditional wastewater treatment plant twwtp and often occurs approximately 50 60 of the total operating cost of the whole wastewater treatment plant 6 7 an appropriate control and effective management practices for the activated sludge arising from the processes of a wwtp are essential to decrease the annual volume of activated sludge residues generated in addition to optimizing operating costs 8 the process of physicochemical dehydration concentration of activated sludge is the main means for minimizing the volume of sludge generated however conventional concentration treatments performed by the processes of sedimentation in series or the addition of organic and or inorganic flocculants followed by mechanical dehydration have a limited field of action 9 forward osmosis fo membrane technology has been proposed as an alternative for the dehydration of activated sledges given its high efficiency and lower operating cost 10 forward osmosis has grown significantly in recent years for a variety of applications such as for example the concentration of fruit juices and in integrated processes with reverse osmosis desalination plants among others 11 however applications in the area of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment have developed more slowly the main advantage in the use of fo in water treatment arises from its low energy consumption as the application of external pressure is not necessary its efficiency comes from a high level of pollutant rejection and from a lower susceptibility to fouling than pressure driven membrane processes 11 as in the natural process of osmosis fo requires two solutions with different chemical potentials to promote solvent flow through a membrane the feed solution fs is usually the solution with a low chemical potential and the solution with the high chemical potential that is to say with high osmotic pressure is called the draw solution ds it is worth mentioning that the water flux in a direct osmosis process is limited by the effects of concentration polarization on the active surface of the membrane and within the membrane s porous structure this phenomenon was first described by loeb et al 12 who experimented with commercial ro membranes and concluded that the main limitation of fo occurs within the porous membrane support layer furthermore the higher the osmotic force applied in fo the greater the influence of concentration polarization that is to say the resulting flux in the fo membrane will not increase proportionally to the applied osmotic pressure difference 13 the novelty of the current work is focused on the possibility of sustainably giving value to the fermentation brine wastewater stream by using it in activated sludge concentration using a fo process for this investigation the draw solution ds consisted of residual brine from a table olive production and the feed solution fs was used sludge from biological treatment at a wwtp brine from industrial processes is a secondary product with problems for reuse and waste control however it meets the necessary conditions for it to be considered a good ds in fo processes within the logic of zero liquid discharge and by products valorization fo process performance was evaluated in terms of transmembrane flux as a function of the osmotic pressure concentration of sludge and by model to the experimental result 2 modeling of water and solute transport in fo this section describes the one dimensional mathematical modeling used to predict permeate flux through a flat sheet membrane in fo 2 1 osmotic process and mass transport in fo in fo the force for the transport of the water flux through the membrane is the osmotic pressure difference caused by the solute concentrations in the fs and ds in general without considering the effects of polarization by internal and or external concentrations the equation for the water flux in the fo membrane is defined as follows 14 1 j w a π d b π f b where jw a πd dyπ f b represent respectively the water flow through the membrane the water permeability coefficient the osmotic pressure of the draw solution and the osmotic pressure of the feed solution the osmotic pressure is determined using the modified van t hoff eq 12 2 π n i o n r g t c where nion is the ionization number rg is the ideal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and c is the concentration of the solution similarly the flux of solute js without regard to the effects of polarization by internal and or external concentrations in fo can be expressed as 3 j s b c d b c f b cd b and c f b represent the solute concentration at the membrane solution interface on the side of the draw solution and on the feed solution side respectively where b is the solute permeability coefficient the osmotically driven membrane processes are susceptible to the effect of salt reverse diffusion where a small amount of salt penetrates from the draw solution to the feed solution side this phenomenon is due to the concentration gradient across the membrane 15 the solute permeability coefficient of a semipermeable membrane can be obtained from ro experiments 16 and can be expressed by 4 b 1 r δ p δ π r r is the solute rejection of the membrane and is defined as 5 r 1 c p c f where cp is the salt concentration in the permeate solution and cf is the salt concentration in the feed solution 2 2 concentration polarization cp asymmetric forward osmosis membranes have two layers a dense active membrane layer active layer over a porous support layer as in other concentration processes the phenomenon of concentration polarization also occurs in fo it can be defined as the accumulation or decrease of solutes near the membrane surface 17 in forward osmosis separation processes concentration polarization is caused by the difference in concentrations in the bulk feed and draw solutions the concentrations at the feed membrane and draw solution membrane interfaces and the concentration at the active layer support layer interface see fig 1 for an asymmetric fo membrane the concentration polarization effects can be due to the external concentration ecp which occurs at the surface of the active layer or the internal concentration icp which occurs within the porous membrane support layer the general equation for concentration polarization in pressure driven membrane processes can be expressed as 18 6 c m c b e x p j w k where k is the mass transfer coefficient and cm and cb are the concentrations of the feed solution at the membrane surface and in the bulk respectively 2 3 external concentration polarization ecp in previous studies mccutcheon and elimelech 19 and tan and ng 20 developed concentrated and dilutive ecp models based on film theory for a fo process under different membrane orientation 7 concentrative ecp π f m π f b e x p j w k f 8 dilutive ecp π d m π d b e x p j w k d where πf m and πd m are respectively the osmotic pressure at the fs active layer interface and ds active layer interface kf is the mass transfer coefficient on the feed side and kd is the mass transfer coefficient on the draw side in the external concentration polarization model it is assumed that the membrane completely rejects the solute and that the osmotic pressure is linearly proportional to the corresponding concentration 19 21 considering only the ecp in a symmetric membrane equation 9 for the water flux in fo can be modified to include both external concentration polarization effects concentrative and dilutive 9 j w a π d b e x p j w k d π f b e x p j w k f 2 4 internal concentration polarization icp in forward osmosis separation processes the decrease in permeate flux through the membrane is predominantly caused by icp due to the fact that there is also an axial flow of a salt solution at the porous side of the asymmetric fo membrane this phenomenon can reduce the flux in the membrane by more than 80 relative to the initial flux 19 22 23 when the active membrane layer is facing the feed solution al fs orientation the water permeates through the membrane and the draw solution is diluted in the porous membrane substructure this phenomenon is called dilutive icp 12 16 19 the permeate flux in the membrane can be expressed as 10 j w 1 k l n a π d b b a π f m b j w al fs when the fo active layer is placed against the draw solution al ds orientation solutes from the feed solution fs accumulate in the porous support layer as a result of their retention by the rejection layer this phenomenon is called concentrative icp the forward osmosis water flux jw is given by 11 j w 1 k l n a π d m b j w a π f b b al ds where k is the solute resistivity layer a membrane structure parameter and a measure of the transport of the salt by diffusion within the porous support in other words it reflects the degree of icp in the membrane support when k assumes low values the polarization effect tends to decrease and this consequently results in a larger permeate flux in the membrane k is given as 16 23 12 k t s τ d ε where ts is the thickness of the porous support layer τ is the tortuosity of the membrane d is the diffusion coefficient on the side of the entrainment solution and ε is the porosity however both ecp and icp occur simultaneously and have significant impacts on the fo process as they extensively reduce the effective osmotic pressure across the membrane as has been demonstrated in several earlier studies by mccutcheon and elimelech et al 19 24 25 where the feed solution flow adjacent to the membrane active layer which is due to both concentrative ecp in the active layer and dilutive icp in the porous support layer has an effects on water flux an analytical model for the both effects on permeate flux has been developed to predict water flux in fo 14 21 13 j w a π d b e x p j w k π f b e x p j w k f on the other hand in case of the membrane support layer facing the feed solution solutes from fs accumulates in the porous support layer as a result of their retention by the rejection layer and both dilutive ecp and concentrative icp occur in pro mode 19 the corresponding model on the water flux in al ds orientation can be expressed as 14 21 14 j w a π d b e x p j w k d π f b e x p j w k 2 5 the reverse salt flux js the calculation of the reverse salt flux across the active layer of the membrane without the effects of icp and ecp can be described by equation 15 26 15 j s b c d m c f m using the classical convection diffusion equation the salt flux across the porous support is the sum of the diffusive component driven by the salt concentration gradient and the convective component as described by 16 j s d d c x d x j w c x however eq 15 and 16 present an experimental limitation as cd m and cf m are interfacial concentrations on the side of the membrane s active layer and they are therefore not experimentally accessible tiraferri et al 27 28 used experimentally measurable parameters and incorporated the phenomena of external ecp and internal icp concentration polarization 17 j s b c d b exp j w s d c f b exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k exp j w s d thus eq 17 represents the reverse solute flux across the membrane in experimentally accessible quantifiable terms 3 materials and methods 3 1 fo membrane a commercial asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta membrane from hti osmem hydration technology inc albany or was used in the experiments with an effective area of 34 cm2 and salt rejection of 99 under manufacture test condition specifications table 1 presents some physical and chemical characteristics of the membrane 3 2 feed solution fs and draw solution ds a synthetic ds was prepared by dissolving sodium chloride nacl in deionized water di to achieve a concentration of 68 1 g l simulating a typical concentration for industrial olive brine furthermore anchovy stuffed olive brine from a factory was used with an initial conductivity of 132 5 ms cm 1 equivalent to a concentration about 93 0 5 g l a standard calibration curve was established to determine the relationship between the salt nacl concentration in the solutions and conductivity it was found to be linear over the range of 56 g l 97 g l corresponding to the initial and final draw solution concentrations in the active sludge dewatering for the feed solution samples were taken of activated sludge from the biological treatment at a wwtp located in the southern valencian autonomous region in spain the activated sludge liquor samples had an initial mixed suspended solids concentration tssi of 6198 mg l the characteristics of the brine used as the ds and of the activated sludge liquor used as the fs are presented in table 2 and table 3 3 3 experimental setup the fo experiments were conducted in a bench scale membrane system a schematic diagram illustration of the fo setup for active sludge dewatering is shown in fig 2 3 4 fo experimental procedure the pilot plant used in the experiment allows batch recirculation working with a membrane module fo using flat sheets with area of up to 34 cm2 the draw and feed solutions as illustrated in fig 2 were circulated in a closed loop and the initial volume in the fs and ds tanks was 1 0 l the draw solution reservoir was placed on a weighing balance in order to continuously monitor the weight change throughout the process this was carried out through a data acquisition system programmed in labview national instruments usa and then processed by matlab mathworks the experimental tests were carried out with the active membrane layer in contact with the feed solution under fs and ds flow rates of 2 l min 1 and 0 5 l min 1 respectively at 20 0 3 c 3 5 fo solute flux experimental procedure forward osmosis experiments were carried out in order to test the mathematical model for reverse salt flux 27 29 and verify the accuracy of the salt permeability coefficient b previously determined in ro experiments in the experiments the mass of the draw solution was monitored as a function of time in order to determine the water flux through the membrane in addition the solute concentration nacl in the feed and in the draw solution was also monitored by immersing a conductivity probe and taking measurements at 5 min intervals based on analysis of the experimental data the average time for stabilization of jw was around 50 min 10 min at which time it is assumed that the inverse flux of solute is in steady state the collected data for conductivity mass difference and water flux were used to calculate the experimental solute flux 3 6 water permeability a and salt rejection r the water permeability coefficient a and the salt rejection r of the fo membrane were determined by testing the membrane in ro mode a pressurized cross flow flat sheet module with cta membranes from hti osmem with 98 cm2 effective area was used in the experiments the water permeability coefficient was obtained from the pure water permeate flux results over a hydraulic pressure range of 0 30 bar salt rejection r was determined using a feed solution with a constant concentration of 1500 mg l nacl relative to an osmotic pressure of 2 1 bar and subsequent measurement of the conductivity of the plant permeates and feed the salt permeability coefficient b which is an intrinsic measure of a membrane s ability to retain salt was determined based on the classical solution diffusion theory 3 7 mass transfer coefficient k the mass transfer coefficient k was determined using eq 18 18 k s h d h d where sh d and d h are the sherwood number the diffusion coefficient and the hydraulic diameter of the membrane channel respectively eqs 19 and 20 were used to calculate the value of sh 19 s h 1 85 r e s c d h l 0 33 20 s h 1 85 r e 0 75 s c 0 33 where re and sc are the dimensionless reynolds and schmidt numbers respectively for cases with laminar flow re 2100 equation 19 was applied to calculate the sherwood number while in cases where re 2100 equation 20 was applied the hydraulic channel diameter of the flow channel was calculated according to equation 21 proposed by schock 30 21 d h 2 w h w h where w and h represent the width and height of the rectangular channel respectively the viscosity density and diffusivity of the solute diffusion coefficient determined at any temperature for the nacl and brine solutions were calculated following the equations described by sharqawy 2010 31 based on the nacl diffusion coefficient at 25 c 1 61 10 9 m2 s 32 4 results and discussion 4 1 water permeability coefficient a and solute permeability coefficient b fig 3 shows the water permeate flux and salt rejection as a function of the hydraulic pressure applied to the referred membrane as expected the permeate flux that crosses the membrane increases linearly as the hydraulic pressure assumes higher values in the range from 0 to 30 bar the water permeability coefficient a for the membrane was found to be around 1 094 l m 2 h bar and it can be calculated from the slope of the fitting line for the permeate flux as a function of hydraulic pressure a j w δ p δ π during the ro experiment the water flux was set at an average of 8 5 l m 2 h for a pressure of 10 bar the salt rejection r in the membrane was observed to increase as a function of the applied hydraulic pressure it was not exactly linear and the values obtained for salt rejection were between 81 38 2 bar and 95 14 30 bar the salt permeability coefficient b was determined by fitting the rejection data into equation 4 it was found to be approximately 1 21 10 7 m2 s it is worth mentioning that the values found for the membrane s structural coefficients a and b are in agreement with the values indicated in previous studies by tang and zhao 29 33 4 2 solute resistivity k and membrane structure parameter s the solute resistivity coefficient in the membrane support layer is a parameter that cannot be directly measured in experimental tests and it depends directly on the membrane structural parameter s it is defined as 34 22 s k d t s τ ε in light of the previous paragraph an alternative manner in which to obtain k with representativeness is to obtain the linearization of equations 10 and 13 as proposed by lee and mccutcheon 12 16 19 and to then adjust them using previously measured water flux experimental data k is the slope of the linearized equations with their respective input experimental data the previously measured test data were developed by taking di water as the feed solution and 1 0 m nacl as the draw solution fig 4 shows the linear relationship between the water flux jw and solute resistivity k for the methodology proposed by lee and maccutcheon it is worth noting that when k assumes low values it results in higher permeate flux in the membrane due to lower icp values and greater diffusion of the draw solution in the porous membrane layer 33 an important observation regarding the difference found in k it is due the model proposed by k l lee taking into account the possible effect of the reverse solute flux from ds to fs the mccutcheon model assumes that the membrane has a high percentage of rejection so that the solute flux js can produce without affecting the water flux 4 3 experimental water flux and solute flux using the values taken by labview and matlab for the mass change in the draw solution δm kg the time δt h membrane area a m2 and water density ρ h 2 o kg l 1 it was possible to calculate the permeate experimental flux through the membrane according to equation 23 23 j p δ m δ t a ρ h 2 o the reverse solute flux across the membrane was calculated from measurements of changes in the concentrations of feed solution and draw solution equation 24 describes the solute nacl balance in the feed solution 24 j s t c f t v f 0 j w t a m t c f 0 v f 0 a m t where c f 0 c f t v f 0 represents respectively the initial nacl concentration in the feed solution the solute concentration in the fs as a function in the time and the initial volume in the feed j w t is the water flux that cross the membrane am the membrane area and t is the elapsed time of the experiment fig 5 graphically represents the relationship between permeate water flux and solute flux with the draw concentration the experiments were carried out with a recirculation flow of 0 6 l min 1 with di water as feed and nacl solution 68 81 g l 1 as the draw solution concentration similar to the concentration of the residual brine the osmotic pressure of the draw solution decreased with time due to the water flux permeability from the feed solution to the ds and the salt flux nacl from the draw solution to the fs note that as the ds concentration decreased the water flux and the reverse solute flux also decreased gradually the results show that the water flux decreased from 14 37 0 5 l m 2 h 1 to 11 98 0 5 l m 2 h 1 with similar trends in all the tests carried out while the solute flux assumed initial values of 7 60 0 5 g m 2 h 1 decreasing to 3 77 0 5 g m 2 h 1 with the dilution of the draw solution 4 4 membrane flux decline during dewatering sludge and brine dilution as the water permeates across the fo membrane from the fs to the ds under osmotically driven pressure the weight of the fs decreases and the weight of the ds increases over time in the concentration experiment with active sludge from a wwtp the initial concentration of the total suspended solids tss was 6198 mg l and it was possible to achieve a final concentration of 16 850 mg l tss fs and ds circulated tangentially to the surface of membrane feed solution in contact with the active layer and draw solution in contact with the porous layer at a recirculation rate of 2 l min 1 active sludge and 0 5 l min 1 residual brine with respect to the permeate flux it was possible to obtain initial values around 13 5 0 5 l m 2 h 1 in the first two hours of operation however over the operation time the flux fell gradually by around 39 25 to values of 5 3 0 5 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h see fig 6 two phenomena should be highlighted that directly influenced the permeate flux decrease firstly the effect of the dilution brine concentration ds and consequently decrease in the osmotic pressure process driving force see fig 7 concentration polarization effects were also involved in this effect secondly after 24 h of fo dewatering performance a thin layer of sludge was observed to be attached to the membrane surface it was easily removed by a simple surface cleaning with di water reversible fouling layers with more than 96 of flux recovery 4 5 effects of the draw solution concentration on the permeate flux the prediction of the spatial variation in the flow rate concentration and flux profiles were numerically determined by solving the ordinary differential equations odes for the mass conservation for feed and draw in a control volume in fo processes eqs 25 to 30 in conjunction with the water flux eq 23 and salt flux eq 24 the total volumetric flow rate equations and the species mass balance equations for nacl in the feed are respectively 25 d q f d a c j w 26 d q f c f d x f j s s m f 27 c f c f 0 q f 0 q f c a c q f 0 q f 1 similarly the differential material balance on the draw solution side gives 28 d q d d a c j w 29 d q f c f d x d j s s m d 30 c d c d 0 q d 0 q d c a c q d 0 q d 1 where qf and qd are the total volumetric flow rate of feed and draw side cf and cd are the salt concentration level in the bulk streams of the feed and draw solutions ac is denotes cross sectional membrane area in the direction of the feed stream fs or ds and sm f and sm d represent the contact area between forward osmosis membrane and feed and draw solution cac is defined as the effective concentration of the active layer 12 26 29 33 c a c j s j w b a h 0 h 0 is the osmotic proportionality coefficient the initial values of the variables in the differential equations eqs 25 26 and 29 30 are presented in table 4 fig 8 shows the water flux variation as a function of the draw solution concentration with the initial value of 93 14 g l corresponding to a flux of 14 00 l m 2 h 1 diluted to a concentration 57 66 g l and water flux of 5 60 l m 2 h 1 therefore the ds concentration along the channel can be related to the permeate flux using the following interpolation equation 31 j w c d 4 66 e 07 c d 2 4 39 e 06 c d 0 000273 4 6 evaluation of the forward osmosis model this section presents the results of the mathematical modeling icp and ecp in comparison to the experimental data of the water flux across the fo membrane as a function of the osmotic pressure difference to evaluate the mathematical model proposed in this section the experimental data were divided into two stages i deionized water di as fs and nacl solution 68 81 g l 1 as ds calculated to obtain a similar conductivity to the olive brine ii active sludge liquor with an initial mixed suspension solids concentration tssi around 6 198 66 g l 1 as fs and anchovy stuffed olives brine with an initial conductivity around 132 5 ms cm 1 equivalent to a concentration of about 93 0 5 g l 1as ds recirculation rate of 0 5 l min 1 for ds and 2 l min 1 for fs were used for both experiments at a temperature of 20 c the modeling used the geometric parameters experimental conditions and membrane properties presented in table 4 the physical and chemical properties of the nacl used in the experiment were taken from the literature 25 as mentioned in section 3 4 fo experimental procedure the pilot plant operate under batch recirculation thus we can assume that the fs and ds flows were countercurrent fig 9 a b shows the mathematical modeling proposed by mccutcheon and elimelech 11 for the calculation of the water flux in comparison to the experimental data as a function of the osmotic pressure difference obtained for the fo configuration described in section 3 3 and 3 4 in fig 9 a the results show a good fit of the modeling and the experimental data mainly in the zone of the lowest osmotic pressure difference with a maximum deviation of 6 84 in zone of the highest osmotic pressure difference however in fig 9 b the results show a less precise fit one possible causes for the deviation between the model to the experimental data is that the effect of the reverse solute flux fs to the ds interfered with the osmotic pressure gradient and consequently decreasing the driving force of process another effect is that the high amount of total suspended solids tss 4100 mg l 1 high quantity of salts 17 and several phenolic compounds in residual brine may have become attached to the active layer and support layer surface of the membrane causing fouling due to concentration polarization ecp and icp in addition the high concentration of the total suspended solids tss in the active sludge 6198 mg l to 16 850 mg l may be causing reversible fouling resistances due to the effect of total suspended solids loading on the surface of the membrane these three factors reverse solute flux concentration polarization and reversible fouling by suspended solids not absorbed on membrane surface can be explain the water flux model deviation for sludge used as a fs compared with di water as fs 5 conclusions this work have demonstrated the feasibility of residual brine from stuffed olive industry as the ds for the dewatering of active sludge from a wwtp the permeate flux during concentration of the active sludge and consequently brine dilution presented initial values around 13 5 0 5 lm 2 h 1 in the first two hours of operation however over the time of the experiment the flux gradually fell by 39 25 equivalent to a water flux around 5 3 0 5 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the 24 h this was of experiment caused by membrane fouling and the reduction in the chemical osmotic pressure driven by the ds measured in terms of salt conductivity which reduced from 132 3 ms cm of experiment 1 to 81 9 ms cm 1 in the modeling of the permeate flux performance it is important to understand the role played in the water flux by the fs and ds concentrations membrane orientation membrane properties and membrane fouling the results of modeling the water flux nacl as ds with concentration of 68 81 g l 1equivalent 1 17 m and di water as fs presented a good fit to the experimental data with a maximum relative error of 6 84 for the zone with the highest osmotic potential difference however when trying to adjust the models to the experimental data for residual brine as the ds and active sludge as the fs the fit was not as accurate this could be due coupled effects of both ecp and icp and reversible fouling during sludge dewatering process pre treatment of residual brine and active sludge can be suggested as a possible way to reduce the effects of both ecp and icp and fouling phenomena in order to reduce water flux decline and reverse salt transport in the process these options may include uf or conventional filtration in addition the application of membrane cleaning early in the fouling process would help to maintain the process efficiency finally although the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using residual brine for the concentration of active sludge from a wwtp further work is required to develop the mathematical models that will be able to model and fit the experimental data take into account effects such as reverse solute flux polarization concentration icp and ecp and

important issue in mediterranean countries where table olives are considered important components of the mediterranean diet there is also significant consumption in other countries outside mediterranean region such as the usa russia and brazil the production of table olives is carried out in numerous industrial plants these manufacturing plants generate each year a large volume of table olive processing wastewater topw from the different production stages storage brines lye treatment brining fermentation and washing and color fixing the pollution load of these residues is considerable because the major constituent is organic matter consisting mainly of aromatic and phenolic compounds generating of enormous amounts of polluting and difficult to handle wastewater streams 1 2 3 in the case of anchovy stuffed olives processing the residual brine is the main waste stream of the process it is generated from the fermentation of brine aqueous nacl solution that is carried out in tanks where spontaneous fermentation takes place during the storage the concentration of nacl in brine is 2 10 that depending of the type of table olive processes 4 5 however the stuffed olive industry is forced to comply with the most stringent environmental regulations for the elimination of organic pollutants and the quality of their treated effluent on the other hand conventional activated sludge is the most commonly used method for municipal wastewater treatment however process produces a large amount of high water content sludge hence sludge dewatering process is obligatory for traditional wastewater treatment plant twwtp and often occurs approximately 50 60 of the total operating cost of the whole wastewater treatment plant 6 7 an appropriate control and effective management practices for the activated sludge arising from the processes of a wwtp are essential to decrease the annual volume of activated sludge residues generated in addition to optimizing operating costs 8 the process of physicochemical dehydration concentration of activated sludge is the main means for minimizing the volume of sludge generated however conventional concentration treatments performed by the processes of sedimentation in series or the addition of organic and or inorganic flocculants followed by mechanical dehydration have a limited field of action 9 forward osmosis fo membrane technology has been proposed as an alternative for the dehydration of activated sledges given its high efficiency and lower operating cost 10 forward osmosis has grown significantly in recent years for a variety of applications such as for example the concentration of fruit juices and in integrated processes with reverse osmosis desalination plants among others 11 however applications in the area of municipal and industrial wastewater treatment have developed more slowly the main advantage in the use of fo in water treatment arises from its low energy consumption as the application of external pressure is not necessary its efficiency comes from a high level of pollutant rejection and from a lower susceptibility to fouling than pressure driven membrane processes 11 as in the natural process of osmosis fo requires two solutions with different chemical potentials to promote solvent flow through a membrane the feed solution fs is usually the solution with a low chemical potential and the solution with the high chemical potential that is to say with high osmotic pressure is called the draw solution ds it is worth mentioning that the water flux in a direct osmosis process is limited by the effects of concentration polarization on the active surface of the membrane and within the membrane s porous structure this phenomenon was first described by loeb et al 12 who experimented with commercial ro membranes and concluded that the main limitation of fo occurs within the porous membrane support layer furthermore the higher the osmotic force applied in fo the greater the influence of concentration polarization that is to say the resulting flux in the fo membrane will not increase proportionally to the applied osmotic pressure difference 13 the novelty of the current work is focused on the possibility of sustainably giving value to the fermentation brine wastewater stream by using it in activated sludge concentration using a fo process for this investigation the draw solution ds consisted of residual brine from a table olive production and the feed solution fs was used sludge from biological treatment at a wwtp brine from industrial processes is a secondary product with problems for reuse and waste control however it meets the necessary conditions for it to be considered a good ds in fo processes within the logic of zero liquid discharge and by products valorization fo process performance was evaluated in terms of transmembrane flux as a function of the osmotic pressure concentration of sludge and by model to the experimental result 2 modeling of water and solute transport in fo this section describes the one dimensional mathematical modeling used to predict permeate flux through a flat sheet membrane in fo 2 1 osmotic process and mass transport in fo in fo the force for the transport of the water flux through the membrane is the osmotic pressure difference caused by the solute concentrations in the fs and ds in general without considering the effects of polarization by internal and or external concentrations the equation for the water flux in the fo membrane is defined as follows 14 1 j w a π d b π f b where jw a πd dyπ f b represent respectively the water flow through the membrane the water permeability coefficient the osmotic pressure of the draw solution and the osmotic pressure of the feed solution the osmotic pressure is determined using the modified van t hoff eq 12 2 π n i o n r g t c where nion is the ionization number rg is the ideal gas constant t is the absolute temperature and c is the concentration of the solution similarly the flux of solute js without regard to the effects of polarization by internal and or external concentrations in fo can be expressed as 3 j s b c d b c f b cd b and c f b represent the solute concentration at the membrane solution interface on the side of the draw solution and on the feed solution side respectively where b is the solute permeability coefficient the osmotically driven membrane processes are susceptible to the effect of salt reverse diffusion where a small amount of salt penetrates from the draw solution to the feed solution side this phenomenon is due to the concentration gradient across the membrane 15 the solute permeability coefficient of a semipermeable membrane can be obtained from ro experiments 16 and can be expressed by 4 b 1 r δ p δ π r r is the solute rejection of the membrane and is defined as 5 r 1 c p c f where cp is the salt concentration in the permeate solution and cf is the salt concentration in the feed solution 2 2 concentration polarization cp asymmetric forward osmosis membranes have two layers a dense active membrane layer active layer over a porous support layer as in other concentration processes the phenomenon of concentration polarization also occurs in fo it can be defined as the accumulation or decrease of solutes near the membrane surface 17 in forward osmosis separation processes concentration polarization is caused by the difference in concentrations in the bulk feed and draw solutions the concentrations at the feed membrane and draw solution membrane interfaces and the concentration at the active layer support layer interface see fig 1 for an asymmetric fo membrane the concentration polarization effects can be due to the external concentration ecp which occurs at the surface of the active layer or the internal concentration icp which occurs within the porous membrane support layer the general equation for concentration polarization in pressure driven membrane processes can be expressed as 18 6 c m c b e x p j w k where k is the mass transfer coefficient and cm and cb are the concentrations of the feed solution at the membrane surface and in the bulk respectively 2 3 external concentration polarization ecp in previous studies mccutcheon and elimelech 19 and tan and ng 20 developed concentrated and dilutive ecp models based on film theory for a fo process under different membrane orientation 7 concentrative ecp π f m π f b e x p j w k f 8 dilutive ecp π d m π d b e x p j w k d where πf m and πd m are respectively the osmotic pressure at the fs active layer interface and ds active layer interface kf is the mass transfer coefficient on the feed side and kd is the mass transfer coefficient on the draw side in the external concentration polarization model it is assumed that the membrane completely rejects the solute and that the osmotic pressure is linearly proportional to the corresponding concentration 19 21 considering only the ecp in a symmetric membrane equation 9 for the water flux in fo can be modified to include both external concentration polarization effects concentrative and dilutive 9 j w a π d b e x p j w k d π f b e x p j w k f 2 4 internal concentration polarization icp in forward osmosis separation processes the decrease in permeate flux through the membrane is predominantly caused by icp due to the fact that there is also an axial flow of a salt solution at the porous side of the asymmetric fo membrane this phenomenon can reduce the flux in the membrane by more than 80 relative to the initial flux 19 22 23 when the active membrane layer is facing the feed solution al fs orientation the water permeates through the membrane and the draw solution is diluted in the porous membrane substructure this phenomenon is called dilutive icp 12 16 19 the permeate flux in the membrane can be expressed as 10 j w 1 k l n a π d b b a π f m b j w al fs when the fo active layer is placed against the draw solution al ds orientation solutes from the feed solution fs accumulate in the porous support layer as a result of their retention by the rejection layer this phenomenon is called concentrative icp the forward osmosis water flux jw is given by 11 j w 1 k l n a π d m b j w a π f b b al ds where k is the solute resistivity layer a membrane structure parameter and a measure of the transport of the salt by diffusion within the porous support in other words it reflects the degree of icp in the membrane support when k assumes low values the polarization effect tends to decrease and this consequently results in a larger permeate flux in the membrane k is given as 16 23 12 k t s τ d ε where ts is the thickness of the porous support layer τ is the tortuosity of the membrane d is the diffusion coefficient on the side of the entrainment solution and ε is the porosity however both ecp and icp occur simultaneously and have significant impacts on the fo process as they extensively reduce the effective osmotic pressure across the membrane as has been demonstrated in several earlier studies by mccutcheon and elimelech et al 19 24 25 where the feed solution flow adjacent to the membrane active layer which is due to both concentrative ecp in the active layer and dilutive icp in the porous support layer has an effects on water flux an analytical model for the both effects on permeate flux has been developed to predict water flux in fo 14 21 13 j w a π d b e x p j w k π f b e x p j w k f on the other hand in case of the membrane support layer facing the feed solution solutes from fs accumulates in the porous support layer as a result of their retention by the rejection layer and both dilutive ecp and concentrative icp occur in pro mode 19 the corresponding model on the water flux in al ds orientation can be expressed as 14 21 14 j w a π d b e x p j w k d π f b e x p j w k 2 5 the reverse salt flux js the calculation of the reverse salt flux across the active layer of the membrane without the effects of icp and ecp can be described by equation 15 26 15 j s b c d m c f m using the classical convection diffusion equation the salt flux across the porous support is the sum of the diffusive component driven by the salt concentration gradient and the convective component as described by 16 j s d d c x d x j w c x however eq 15 and 16 present an experimental limitation as cd m and cf m are interfacial concentrations on the side of the membrane s active layer and they are therefore not experimentally accessible tiraferri et al 27 28 used experimentally measurable parameters and incorporated the phenomena of external ecp and internal icp concentration polarization 17 j s b c d b exp j w s d c f b exp j w k 1 b j w exp j w k exp j w s d thus eq 17 represents the reverse solute flux across the membrane in experimentally accessible quantifiable terms 3 materials and methods 3 1 fo membrane a commercial asymmetric cellulose triacetate cta membrane from hti osmem hydration technology inc albany or was used in the experiments with an effective area of 34 cm2 and salt rejection of 99 under manufacture test condition specifications table 1 presents some physical and chemical characteristics of the membrane 3 2 feed solution fs and draw solution ds a synthetic ds was prepared by dissolving sodium chloride nacl in deionized water di to achieve a concentration of 68 1 g l simulating a typical concentration for industrial olive brine furthermore anchovy stuffed olive brine from a factory was used with an initial conductivity of 132 5 ms cm 1 equivalent to a concentration about 93 0 5 g l a standard calibration curve was established to determine the relationship between the salt nacl concentration in the solutions and conductivity it was found to be linear over the range of 56 g l 97 g l corresponding to the initial and final draw solution concentrations in the active sludge dewatering for the feed solution samples were taken of activated sludge from the biological treatment at a wwtp located in the southern valencian autonomous region in spain the activated sludge liquor samples had an initial mixed suspended solids concentration tssi of 6198 mg l the characteristics of the brine used as the ds and of the activated sludge liquor used as the fs are presented in table 2 and table 3 3 3 experimental setup the fo experiments were conducted in a bench scale membrane system a schematic diagram illustration of the fo setup for active sludge dewatering is shown in fig 2 3 4 fo experimental procedure the pilot plant used in the experiment allows batch recirculation working with a membrane module fo using flat sheets with area of up to 34 cm2 the draw and feed solutions as illustrated in fig 2 were circulated in a closed loop and the initial volume in the fs and ds tanks was 1 0 l the draw solution reservoir was placed on a weighing balance in order to continuously monitor the weight change throughout the process this was carried out through a data acquisition system programmed in labview national instruments usa and then processed by matlab mathworks the experimental tests were carried out with the active membrane layer in contact with the feed solution under fs and ds flow rates of 2 l min 1 and 0 5 l min 1 respectively at 20 0 3 c 3 5 fo solute flux experimental procedure forward osmosis experiments were carried out in order to test the mathematical model for reverse salt flux 27 29 and verify the accuracy of the salt permeability coefficient b previously determined in ro experiments in the experiments the mass of the draw solution was monitored as a function of time in order to determine the water flux through the membrane in addition the solute concentration nacl in the feed and in the draw solution was also monitored by immersing a conductivity probe and taking measurements at 5 min intervals based on analysis of the experimental data the average time for stabilization of jw was around 50 min 10 min at which time it is assumed that the inverse flux of solute is in steady state the collected data for conductivity mass difference and water flux were used to calculate the experimental solute flux 3 6 water permeability a and salt rejection r the water permeability coefficient a and the salt rejection r of the fo membrane were determined by testing the membrane in ro mode a pressurized cross flow flat sheet module with cta membranes from hti osmem with 98 cm2 effective area was used in the experiments the water permeability coefficient was obtained from the pure water permeate flux results over a hydraulic pressure range of 0 30 bar salt rejection r was determined using a feed solution with a constant concentration of 1500 mg l nacl relative to an osmotic pressure of 2 1 bar and subsequent measurement of the conductivity of the plant permeates and feed the salt permeability coefficient b which is an intrinsic measure of a membrane s ability to retain salt was determined based on the classical solution diffusion theory 3 7 mass transfer coefficient k the mass transfer coefficient k was determined using eq 18 18 k s h d h d where sh d and d h are the sherwood number the diffusion coefficient and the hydraulic diameter of the membrane channel respectively eqs 19 and 20 were used to calculate the value of sh 19 s h 1 85 r e s c d h l 0 33 20 s h 1 85 r e 0 75 s c 0 33 where re and sc are the dimensionless reynolds and schmidt numbers respectively for cases with laminar flow re 2100 equation 19 was applied to calculate the sherwood number while in cases where re 2100 equation 20 was applied the hydraulic channel diameter of the flow channel was calculated according to equation 21 proposed by schock 30 21 d h 2 w h w h where w and h represent the width and height of the rectangular channel respectively the viscosity density and diffusivity of the solute diffusion coefficient determined at any temperature for the nacl and brine solutions were calculated following the equations described by sharqawy 2010 31 based on the nacl diffusion coefficient at 25 c 1 61 10 9 m2 s 32 4 results and discussion 4 1 water permeability coefficient a and solute permeability coefficient b fig 3 shows the water permeate flux and salt rejection as a function of the hydraulic pressure applied to the referred membrane as expected the permeate flux that crosses the membrane increases linearly as the hydraulic pressure assumes higher values in the range from 0 to 30 bar the water permeability coefficient a for the membrane was found to be around 1 094 l m 2 h bar and it can be calculated from the slope of the fitting line for the permeate flux as a function of hydraulic pressure a j w δ p δ π during the ro experiment the water flux was set at an average of 8 5 l m 2 h for a pressure of 10 bar the salt rejection r in the membrane was observed to increase as a function of the applied hydraulic pressure it was not exactly linear and the values obtained for salt rejection were between 81 38 2 bar and 95 14 30 bar the salt permeability coefficient b was determined by fitting the rejection data into equation 4 it was found to be approximately 1 21 10 7 m2 s it is worth mentioning that the values found for the membrane s structural coefficients a and b are in agreement with the values indicated in previous studies by tang and zhao 29 33 4 2 solute resistivity k and membrane structure parameter s the solute resistivity coefficient in the membrane support layer is a parameter that cannot be directly measured in experimental tests and it depends directly on the membrane structural parameter s it is defined as 34 22 s k d t s τ ε in light of the previous paragraph an alternative manner in which to obtain k with representativeness is to obtain the linearization of equations 10 and 13 as proposed by lee and mccutcheon 12 16 19 and to then adjust them using previously measured water flux experimental data k is the slope of the linearized equations with their respective input experimental data the previously measured test data were developed by taking di water as the feed solution and 1 0 m nacl as the draw solution fig 4 shows the linear relationship between the water flux jw and solute resistivity k for the methodology proposed by lee and maccutcheon it is worth noting that when k assumes low values it results in higher permeate flux in the membrane due to lower icp values and greater diffusion of the draw solution in the porous membrane layer 33 an important observation regarding the difference found in k it is due the model proposed by k l lee taking into account the possible effect of the reverse solute flux from ds to fs the mccutcheon model assumes that the membrane has a high percentage of rejection so that the solute flux js can produce without affecting the water flux 4 3 experimental water flux and solute flux using the values taken by labview and matlab for the mass change in the draw solution δm kg the time δt h membrane area a m2 and water density ρ h 2 o kg l 1 it was possible to calculate the permeate experimental flux through the membrane according to equation 23 23 j p δ m δ t a ρ h 2 o the reverse solute flux across the membrane was calculated from measurements of changes in the concentrations of feed solution and draw solution equation 24 describes the solute nacl balance in the feed solution 24 j s t c f t v f 0 j w t a m t c f 0 v f 0 a m t where c f 0 c f t v f 0 represents respectively the initial nacl concentration in the feed solution the solute concentration in the fs as a function in the time and the initial volume in the feed j w t is the water flux that cross the membrane am the membrane area and t is the elapsed time of the experiment fig 5 graphically represents the relationship between permeate water flux and solute flux with the draw concentration the experiments were carried out with a recirculation flow of 0 6 l min 1 with di water as feed and nacl solution 68 81 g l 1 as the draw solution concentration similar to the concentration of the residual brine the osmotic pressure of the draw solution decreased with time due to the water flux permeability from the feed solution to the ds and the salt flux nacl from the draw solution to the fs note that as the ds concentration decreased the water flux and the reverse solute flux also decreased gradually the results show that the water flux decreased from 14 37 0 5 l m 2 h 1 to 11 98 0 5 l m 2 h 1 with similar trends in all the tests carried out while the solute flux assumed initial values of 7 60 0 5 g m 2 h 1 decreasing to 3 77 0 5 g m 2 h 1 with the dilution of the draw solution 4 4 membrane flux decline during dewatering sludge and brine dilution as the water permeates across the fo membrane from the fs to the ds under osmotically driven pressure the weight of the fs decreases and the weight of the ds increases over time in the concentration experiment with active sludge from a wwtp the initial concentration of the total suspended solids tss was 6198 mg l and it was possible to achieve a final concentration of 16 850 mg l tss fs and ds circulated tangentially to the surface of membrane feed solution in contact with the active layer and draw solution in contact with the porous layer at a recirculation rate of 2 l min 1 active sludge and 0 5 l min 1 residual brine with respect to the permeate flux it was possible to obtain initial values around 13 5 0 5 l m 2 h 1 in the first two hours of operation however over the operation time the flux fell gradually by around 39 25 to values of 5 3 0 5 l m 2 h 1 after 24 h see fig 6 two phenomena should be highlighted that directly influenced the permeate flux decrease firstly the effect of the dilution brine concentration ds and consequently decrease in the osmotic pressure process driving force see fig 7 concentration polarization effects were also involved in this effect secondly after 24 h of fo dewatering performance a thin layer of sludge was observed to be attached to the membrane surface it was easily removed by a simple surface cleaning with di water reversible fouling layers with more than 96 of flux recovery 4 5 effects of the draw solution concentration on the permeate flux the prediction of the spatial variation in the flow rate concentration and flux profiles were numerically determined by solving the ordinary differential equations odes for the mass conservation for feed and draw in a control volume in fo processes eqs 25 to 30 in conjunction with the water flux eq 23 and salt flux eq 24 the total volumetric flow rate equations and the species mass balance equations for nacl in the feed are respectively 25 d q f d a c j w 26 d q f c f d x f j s s m f 27 c f c f 0 q f 0 q f c a c q f 0 q f 1 similarly the differential material balance on the draw solution side gives 28 d q d d a c j w 29 d q f c f d x d j s s m d 30 c d c d 0 q d 0 q d c a c q d 0 q d 1 where qf and qd are the total volumetric flow rate of feed and draw side cf and cd are the salt concentration level in the bulk streams of the feed and draw solutions ac is denotes cross sectional membrane area in the direction of the feed stream fs or ds and sm f and sm d represent the contact area between forward osmosis membrane and feed and draw solution cac is defined as the effective concentration of the active layer 12 26 29 33 c a c j s j w b a h 0 h 0 is the osmotic proportionality coefficient the initial values of the variables in the differential equations eqs 25 26 and 29 30 are presented in table 4 fig 8 shows the water flux variation as a function of the draw solution concentration with the initial value of 93 14 g l corresponding to a flux of 14 00 l m 2 h 1 diluted to a concentration 57 66 g l and water flux of 5 60 l m 2 h 1 therefore the ds concentration along the channel can be related to the permeate flux using the following interpolation equation 31 j w c d 4 66 e 07 c d 2 4 39 e 06 c d 0 000273 4 6 evaluation of the forward osmosis model this section presents the results of the mathematical modeling icp and ecp in comparison to the experimental data of the water flux across the fo membrane as a function of the osmotic pressure difference to evaluate the mathematical model proposed in this section the experimental data were divided into two stages i deionized water di as fs and nacl solution 68 81 g l 1 as ds calculated to obtain a similar conductivity to the olive brine ii active sludge liquor with an initial mixed suspension solids concentration tssi around 6 198 66 g l 1 as fs and anchovy stuffed olives brine with an initial conductivity around 132 5 ms cm 1 equivalent to a concentration of about 93 0 5 g l 1as ds recirculation rate of 0 5 l min 1 for ds and 2 l min 1 for fs were used for both experiments at a temperature of 20 c the modeling used the geometric parameters experimental conditions and membrane properties presented in table 4 the physical and chemical properties of the nacl used in the experiment were taken from the literature 25 as mentioned in section 3 4 fo experimental procedure the pilot plant operate under batch recirculation thus we can assume that the fs and ds flows were countercurrent fig 9 a b shows the mathematical modeling proposed by mccutcheon and elimelech 11 for the calculation of the water flux in comparison to the experimental data as a function of the osmotic pressure difference obtained for the fo configuration described in section 3 3 and 3 4 in fig 9 a the results show a good fit of the modeling and the experimental data mainly in the zone of the lowest osmotic pressure difference with a maximum deviation of 6 84 in zone of the highest osmotic pressure difference however in fig 9 b the results show a less precise fit one possible causes for the deviation between the model to the experimental data is that the effect of the reverse solute flux fs to the ds interfered with the osmotic pressure gradient and consequently decreasing the driving force of process another effect is that the high amount of total suspended solids tss 4100 mg l 1 high quantity of salts 17 and several phenolic compounds in residual brine may have become attached to the active layer and support layer surface of the membrane causing fouling due to concentration polarization ecp and icp in addition the high concentration of the total suspended solids tss in the active sludge 6198 mg l to 16 850 mg l may be causing reversible fouling resistances due to the effect of total suspended solids loading on the surface of the membrane these three factors reverse solute flux concentration polarization and reversible fouling by suspended solids not absorbed on membrane surface can be explain the water flux model deviation for sludge used as a fs compared with di water as fs 5 conclusions this work have demonstrated the feasibility of residual brine from stuffed olive industry as the ds for the dewatering of active sludge from a wwtp the permeate flux during concentration of the active sludge and consequently brine dilution presented initial values around 13 5 0 5 lm 2 h 1 in the first two hours of operation however over the time of the experiment the flux gradually fell by 39 25 equivalent to a water flux around 5 3 0 5 l m 2 h 1 at the end of the 24 h this was of experiment caused by membrane fouling and the reduction in the chemical osmotic pressure driven by the ds measured in terms of salt conductivity which reduced from 132 3 ms cm of experiment 1 to 81 9 ms cm 1 in the modeling of the permeate flux performance it is important to understand the role played in the water flux by the fs and ds concentrations membrane orientation membrane properties and membrane fouling the results of modeling the water flux nacl as ds with concentration of 68 81 g l 1equivalent 1 17 m and di water as fs presented a good fit to the experimental data with a maximum relative error of 6 84 for the zone with the highest osmotic potential difference however when trying to adjust the models to the experimental data for residual brine as the ds and active sludge as the fs the fit was not as accurate this could be due coupled effects of both ecp and icp and reversible fouling during sludge dewatering process pre treatment of residual brine and active sludge can be suggested as a possible way to reduce the effects of both ecp and icp and fouling phenomena in order to reduce water flux decline and reverse salt transport in the process these options may include uf or conventional filtration in addition the application of membrane cleaning early in the fouling process would help to maintain the process efficiency finally although the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of using residual brine for the concentration of active sludge from a wwtp further work is required to develop the mathematical models that will be able to model and fit the experimental data take into account effects such as reverse solute flux polarization concentration icp and ecp and

feature of a process referred to as electro peroxone also produces an enhancement in radical production but requires carbon based cathodes that are suited to h2o2 generation metal cathodes in contrast to carbon do not favor h2o2 production 34 in pathway ii decomposition of ozone is initiated by reaction with hydroxide ion oh generated at the cathode the decomposition of ozone and the start of a radical chain reaction leading to generation of ho have been studied extensively with one of the first studies dating back to 1935 35 two major pathways have been studied previously direct decomposition of ozone in water to form ho directly eq 1 and reaction between ozone and oh to initiate several propagation reactions leading to ho formation eq 2 14 35 37 ozone stability in water

process needs further investigation especially relative to other aops and traditional treatment methods such as adsorption for this process to gain traction as a viable method for removal of organic contaminants continued study is required to elucidate and confirm the reaction mechanisms reported in previously published work and determine the impact of reactor operating conditions to optimize efficiency and synergism this paper discusses the impact of combining bdd electrolysis with ozonation at various ph conditions on the rate constant reaction mechanisms and pathways of atz degradation

basi usa 2 2 reactor system the reactor system used in the current study consists of an acrylic cylinder with a total volume of 600 ml ml and working volume of 470 ml a diagram of the reactor is presented in fig 1 the reactor was stirred magnetically with a porous polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe tube with 3 μm pores used to diffuse ozone gas into the system electrodes were mounted to the lid of the reactor and suspended partially into the solution to achieve a solution contact area of 23 7 cm2 the electrodes and ozone gas diffuser were present in the system during all experiments regardless of operating mode ozone gas was produced using the ozonia lab2b ozone generator fed with 99 6 pure extra dry oxygen from a compressed gas cylinder at a rate of 2 l min the minimum recommended by the manufacturer once the ozone gas left the ozone generator the flow was split with 1 7 l min flowing to waste bypass via a potassium iodide trap and 0 3 l min flowing into the reactor a princeton applied research model 362 scanning potentiostat was used in galvanostatic mode to apply 237 ma of current to the reactor resulting in an applied anodic current density of 10 ma cm2 current density was held constant to allow for investigation of ph as the main factor in this set of experiments 2 3 reactor operation all experiments were conducted in 1 mm phosphate buffered water with a target initial atz concentration of 46 4 μm or 10 mg l addition of h2so4 and naoh were used as needed to adjust the ph after addition of the buffer the reactor was operated at ph 2 7 or 12 in one of three operating modes electrolysis only e ozonation only o or electrolysis combined with ozonation e o solution conductivity was measured using a corning checkmate ii conductivity meter and was maintained at 6 ms cm between experiments through the addition of na2so4 to facilitate a constant voltage across conditions this resulted in sulfate concentrations of 31 7 mm 4 5 g l at ph 7 and 17 6 mm 2 5 g l at ph 2 and 12 in cases where ozone was applied ozone bubbling was started at time zero tert butanol tba a hydroxyl radical scavenger studied previously 21 39 was used at a concentration of 1 35 mm 100 mg l nine experimental cases three ph levels at three operating modes respectively were run in triplicate to generate the reported data 2 4 sampling sampling was performed by drawing 1 ml of solution through the reactor lid with immediate transfer of the solution into a 2 ml glass vial preloaded with na2s2o3 for quenching oxidants and h2so4 naoh if needed to adjust the sample to ph 7 for analysis quenching and ph adjustment was made using concentrated solutions and dilution of the samples was limited to less than 1 i e 7 5 μl added per 1 ml all samples were quenched and adjusted in the same manner including calibration samples sampling intervals were determined by running a preliminary experiment and distributing 5 6 samples across the 0 90 degradation timeframe all experiments were timed to run until approximately 90 of the atz had been degraded 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 dissolved ozone residual ozone was measured using a modified version of the indigo method developed by bader and hoigné 40 and standardized as standard method 4500 o3 41 in this study the sample volume was reduced to 300 μl and the volume of indigo reagent was reduced to 2400 μl this change was made to facilitate frequent sampling from the reactor without significant loss of solution volume the results of this modified method were compared to the previously mentioned standard method and the difference in measured ozone concentration was found to be 3 2 5 2 hplc all reactor samples were analyzed and pesticides were quantified with an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a hypersil ods column from thermo scientific 150 mm long by 4 6 mm in diameter 3 μm particle size at a constant temperature of 30 c separation was performed at 1 25 ml min using the following solvent gradient of hplc grade acetonitrile acn and water 0 2 min 10 acn 90 h2o 2 6 min linear gradient from 10 acn 90 h2o to 90 acn 10 h2o 6 8 min 90 acn 10 h2o the detection wavelength was

maximum concentrations bracketing the experimental concentrations standard solutions were injected at the beginning end and after every 10 injections during runs to validate the calibration method detection limits mdls were determined using the epa method listed in 40 cfr appendix b to part 136 definition and procedure for the determination of the method detection limit revision 1 11 the mdls for atz ade adi adedi and cyn were determined to be 0 0576 μm 0 0635 μm 0 0385 μm 0 0409 μm and 0 351 μm respectively 2 5 3 lc qtof ms selected samples were analyzed for identification of unknown by products using a previously developed analytical method that has been published elsewhere 42 samples were injected into a 1290 infinity lc hyphenated to a 6540 uhd accurate mass q tof equipped with a jet stream technology electrospray from agilent chromatographic separation was attained using a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 column from agilent 2 1 mm diameter by 50 mm long 3 5 μm particle size at a constant temperature of 30 c separation was performed at 0 2 ml min using the following solvent gradient of lc grade acn and water both containing 0 1 formic acid 0 5 min linear gradient from 5 acn 95

obtained were processed using the agilent masshunter b 04 00 qualitative analysis software 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of solution ph on atrazine degradation atrazine degradation was strongly dependent on ph for all operating modes kinetic data for atz degradation and the formation of major intermediate products are shown in fig 2 the data shown in fig 2 were examined graphically to establish a first order rate of degradation of atz as the best fit for the majority of experimental cases exponential curves were fit to the experimental data using a nonlinear least squares regression in microsoft excel to generate the reported degradation rate constants with electrolysis alone e atz was degraded at similar rates for ph 7 and 12 however the rate constant was triple at ph 2 kinetic profiles for the degradation can be seen in fig 2a d and g atrazine degradation was shown previously to be enhanced at acidic ph under bdd electrolysis 16 which may be attributable to increased hydroxyl radical generation with decreasing ph implied by results from enache et al 23 that ho formation at the bdd surface generally increased with decreasing solution ph data in table 2 show that the electrochemical first order rate constant for electrolysis at ph 2 decreased from 0 0193 min 1 to 0 0093 min 1 after the addition of tba indicating generation of radical species played a role in increasing the rate addition of tba during electrolysis at ph 7 and 12 had a lesser effect supporting the claim of radical generation dependence on ph during electrolysis more details on radical scavenger use can be found in section 3 3 change in atz speciation based on a reported dissociation constant for atz e g pka 1 71 43 as modeled in fig 3 may also contribute toward the increased rate constant at ph 2 if the two forms have different degradation rates follow up research on this topic would be needed if treatment of atz at ph 2 is considered as a potential treatment approach in experiments with ozone alone o the first order degradation rate constant for atz increased from 0 0210 min 1 at ph 2 to 0 3504 min 1 at ph 12 an increase of over one order of magnitude this agrees with previous findings on the behavior of ozone in aqueous solution 8 29 decomposition of ozone through reaction with oh increases with ph because oh is more readily available the ozone residual results agree with this ozone accumulation in the reactor was not present at ph 12 see fig 2h vs fig 2b and e the amount of hydroxyl radical formed increases during ozone decomposition at higher ph and this may account for the higher rate constant up to a point staehelin and hoigne 37 reported a rate constant for eq 2 of 70 m 1s1 for the ozone consuming initiation reaction between ozone and oh five to ten orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constants for the subsequent radical propagation reactions making it the rate limiting step in the radical chain reaction see beltran et al eqs 3 7 14 for specifics on the reactions and rate constants since the generation of ho is rate limited by the availability of ozone needed for the rate limiting initiation reaction in this system the reaction rate at ph 12 is governed by ozone mass transport rather than oxidation by ho the ozone mass transport limitation is confirmed by the absence of an ozone residual in experiments at ph 12 involving the application of ozone assuming adequate ozonation and mixing oh concentration becomes the most important factor in the degradation of atz with dissolved ozone only it is this dependence on oh that creates the potential for synergism when oh is generated in situ at the cathode during electrolysis when the data for the electrolysis combined with ozone e o case is examined evidence of the synergism can be observed at ph 7 the synergistic effects seen during the e o operating mode are discussed in more detail in the following section 3 2 synergistic effects in the combined ozonation and electrolysis system combining electrolysis with ozonation has the potential to create synergism by increasing available oh in the system thus promoting the decomposition of ozone into ho the final product of the initiation reaction shown in eq 2 fig 4 shows the normalized degradation curves for atz with respect to operation mode at differing ph without a radical scavenger the dotted line represents an additive estimate from separate ozonation and electrolysis experimental data calculated from a first order exponential function with y intercept of 45 μm and k value of the sum of the estimated rate constants from the individual conditions being added data presented in fig 4 show that significant synergism is only seen at ph 7 with performance of the e o mode following the straightforward additive model more closely at ph 2 and 12 at ph 7 the observed rate constant for ozonation combined with electrolysis 0 3441 min 1 was 4 78 x the estimated additive rate constant 0 072 min 1 similar enhancement at ph 2 was not observed despite an expectation that the same mechanisms for cathodic hydroxide ion generation are applicable at both ph 2 and 7 the difference at ph 2 however is potentially attributable to the size of the local alkaline zone created at the cathode and competition for ho between dissolved organics and h hydroxyl radicals and h react quickly in solution to form water 44 it was discussed in section 3 1 that with an assumption of adequate ozonation as evidenced by the ozone residual measured at ph 2 and 7 hydroxide ion concentration is the limiting factor in initiation of the radical chain reaction that leads to the observed synergism this leads the degradation rate enhancement to be dependent on the amount of atz that is able to react with ho generated from the decomposition of ozone near the cathode the bulk concentration of h is five orders of magnitude larger at ph 2 than at ph 7 therefore the contribution of a local alkaline zone at the cathode at ph 2 is likely to be smaller enhancement at ph 12 was not observed and this is likely due to limitations in mass transport of ozone in the system rather than any limits due to oh concentration the synergism is of interest because it is transferable to a wide variety of parent compounds and system configurations due to generation of a broad spectrum reactive species ho experiments conducted in co author zhao s lab to degrade the pharmaceutical diclofenac support this claim of broader applicability synergism was observed using e o at neutral ph for which the results are presented in section s 1 of the supplementary information the transferability of this type of process has also been confirmed by recent research on e o to degrade p nitrophenol 24 acid red 18 45 and p chlorobenzoic acid 46 3 3 impact of ho on atz rate constant the use of a radical scavenger can help to elucidate the impact of ho reactions on the overall rate constant first order rate constant data for the experiments using the radical scavenger are presented in table 2 columns 5 and 6 all experiments were conducted with and without the addition of tba in table 2 δk describes the magnitude of the difference between the atz degradation rate constant without tba katz and the atz degradation rate constant with tba katz tba this difference provides a general representation of the overall effect of ho reactions on the apparent degradation rate of atz tert butanol which competes with atz for reaction with ho is in 30x excess on a molar basis to atz allowing for a reasonable assumption of near complete scavenging of generated ho by tba fig 5 below provides a visual depiction of the rate constants with and without tba at ph 2 the rate constant for the e o mode decreased by 40 with tba scavenging of ho in comparison to 83 at ph 7 and 76 at ph 12 despite 40 reduction at ph 2 the value of δk 0 0208 min 1 is over an order of magnitude smaller than under the same conditions at ph 7 and ph 12 this further confirms that ho reactions are significantly reduced at ph 2 and that the promotion of ho generation at the cathode does not lead to a large increase in degradation rate even though an ozone residual is maintained in the bulk solution the high concentration of h at ph 2 increases competition for any generated ho as described in the previous section 3 4 formation of intermediates from atrazine and reaction pathways in addition to the degradation of atz alone this study considered the by products produced during degradation important information that must be available when evaluating technology for broad application while drinking water regulations in the united states pertain to a specific set of regulated contaminants consideration should be given to other indicators like solution toxicity in the case of atz the toxicity of the major dealkylation products ade adi and adedi have toxicities that range from half as toxic to three times more toxic than atz 47 making consideration of the pathway and accumulation of intermediates important as can be seen in fig 2 differences were observed between both the quantity and pathway of intermediates generated depending on ph and operating mode 3 4 1 intermediates identified selected hplc chromatograms from all ph conditions without scavenger are shown in fig 6 below all chromatograms are from the reaction time where 20 of the initial concentration of atz remained across all three operating modes many of the same compounds were detected in varying concentrations however cyn was only accumulated during the e mode cyanuric acid is important as it is the precursor to ring cleavage and mineralization formation of cyn is also expected in all cases involving ho and ozone but the comparatively rapid rate of atz loss combined with the low hplc response factor for cyn contribute to the lack of detection in those cases several additional compounds are present at ph 7 as opposed to ph 2 and ph 12 the additional compounds at ph 7 are formed due to the difference in oxidation mechanism at ph 7 where there is a combination between the effects of ho and the dissolved ozone residual ozone will react with ho generated intermediates and ho will react with ozone generated intermediates single mechanisms dominated at ph 2 ozone and 12 ho resulting in a smaller number of products formed in addition to the formation of the quantified products atz cyn adi ade adedi of note is the formation at ph 7 of two large peaks after 6 min labeled in fig 6 as 6 and 7 these two peaks correspond to compounds that are products of reaction with molecular ozone as they were formed at similar concentrations in the experiments with the radical scavenger present data not presented review of previous studies on ozonation of atz and a consideration of lc qtof ms data from this study see table 3 led to the proposed identification of these two compounds as cdit and the infrequently reported atz imine 8 48 the structure of cdit and atz imine shown in fig 7 would likely result in hplc retention times falling between that of ade and atz a pattern confirmed for cdit under similar chromatographic conditions 8 49 3 4 2 reaction pathways four major degradation pathways for atz were identified based on observations from this study and a review of prior work these pathways are presented in fig 7 and discussed in the following paragraphs the pathways in fig 7 are represented by the roman numerals near the upper arrows table 1 contains references and unabbreviated names for the intermediate compounds shown in fig 7 the pathways are i dealkylation ii acetamide transformation iii imine transformation and iv dechlorination i dealkylation data collected in this study confirmed this commonly reported pathway degradation of atz through dealkylation of the ethyl and isopropyl groups with initial formation of ade and adi with conversion to adedi and finally cyn ring cleavage and mineralization logically follow the formation of cyn but were not measured in this study ii acetamide transformation formation of adedi and its downstream degradation products is also possible via acetamide transformation of the atz alkyl chains by reaction with ozone this pathway proceeds via formation of intermediates cdit cdet cddt and cdat 8 11 48 in this study this reaction pathway appears to be favored at ph 7 only since the peak numbered 6 in fig 6 identified as cdit is much less prominent at both ph 2 and 12 further study is needed to thoroughly understand the ph dependence of this particular reaction pathway iii amine transformation the reaction of ozone or ho with atz can result in the formation of an ethyl group imine atz imine 8 this pathway is reported less often than the first two pathways however acero et al 8 found atz imine formation to be favored over the other major degradation products ade adi and cdit results from the lc qtof ms product identification study confirm substantial generation of atz imine at ph 7 in both o and e o reactor operating modes based on volume although quantification in terms of concentration was not possible iv dechlorination a similar pathway to atz dealkylation i is also possible if atz is initially dechlorinated to hydroxyatrazine oiet hydroxyatrazine can then be degraded in a similar fashion to the ade adi and adedi forming their dechlorinated equivalents oait oaet and oaat respectively 10 50 dechlorination was confirmed in the current study through lc qtof ms analysis of the e o mode at ph 12 as seen in the last four rows of table 3 the sample for which data are presented was taken at the time where 80 of the initial atz had been degraded generation of oiet was detected as early as the first experimental sample after time zero at ph 12 but was not detected in any samples or operating modes at ph 7 this indicates that direct dechlorination of atz occurs during ho attack only the absence of oiet at ph 7 may be attributed to competition with other reaction pathways due to the dissolved ozone residual maintained at ph 7 for complete mineralization to occur dechlorination is necessary at some point most likely to form oaat then cyn dechlorination of the triazine ring is expected in reaction processes dominated by ho 51 likewise it is also theoretically possible in later stages of the pathways under these conditions the results of this study show that ethyl group attack is preferred heavily to the isopropyl group the preference for the ethyl group is confirmed by the data presented in figs 2 and 6 is it shown that ade is generated prior to and in larger quantities than adi in all experimental cases except at ph 7 where cdit and atz imine are favored over ade and adi furthermore ethyl group attack is favored in both the molecular ozone dominated environment at ph 2 and the ho dominated environment at ph 12 the phenomenon occurring at ph 7 in the presence of dissolved ozone is the conversion of the alkyl group to acetamide forming cdit and cddt rather than removal of the alkyl groups in the case of this reaction ozone first attacks the ethyl group forming cdit then proceeds to attack the methyl group forming cddt further degradation of cddt to adedi occurs through the intermediate cdat as mentioned previously the degradation of atz by ho and molecular ozone generates many more intermediates than in other cases and further study using lc qtof ms is in progress to identify them however their position at a later retention time than adedi suggests that they are less oxidized than adedi they are also likely a mixture of chlorinated and dechlorinated products as previous researchers have found dechlorinated degradation products with retention times that follow the same relationship 48 49 4 conclusions in the current study addition of electrolysis to ozonation was effective at synergistically promoting atz oxidation in aqueous solution reaction conditions however have a significant impact on the rate constant and the pathway of degradation major conclusions from the current study are the following the observed rate constant for atz degradation during e o at ph 7 was 4 78 x the estimated additive rate constant for the processes when considered separately this is especially important since ph 7 is practical to water treatment scenarios synergism at ph 7 was due to the enhanced generation of ho from the decomposition of dissolved ozone through oh generated at the electrochemical cathode the same mechanism is possible at ph 2 but is likely suppressed by the large bulk concentration of h counteracting the impact of electrochemically generated oh hydrogen ion also competes with dissolved organics for reaction with ho the reaction mechanism in e o is shared between molecular ozone and ho at ph 2 ho production at ph 2 is limited by lack of oh availability at ph 7 and 12 the mechanism is dominated by ho generated at the cathode and in the bulk solution via ozone decomposition ethyl group attack is favored during reaction with ozone and ho at ph 2 and 12 at ph 7 intermediates cdit and atz imine were also formed cyn was only detected during degradation with electrolysis alone at ph 12 dechlorination of atz to form oiet was observed dechlorination was only found to be possible through reaction with ho acknowledgements the authors thank dr

containing gas was injected at a rate of 0 3 l min into an electrolysis reactor with a boron doped diamond anode and stainless steel cathode operating with an anodic current density of 10 ma cm2 when electrolysis and ozonation were applied together the rate constant of atrazine degradation could not be explained simply from considering the processes when applied separately in particular at ph 7 the measured first order rate constant was 0 3441 min 1 a rate 4 78 times as large as the estimated additive rate 0 072 min 1 from electrolysis and ozonation separately in the same conditions across

majority of the reaction at ph 7 and 12 the increasing impact of ho was due to ozone decomposition into ho through reaction with hydroxide oh in both the bulk solution and at the cathode through lc

treatment electrolysis ozonation hydroxyl radical advanced oxidation process 1 introduction one of several pesticides of environmental concern atrazine atz is still applied heavily across the world it is one of the two most widely applied pesticides in the united states with the united states environmental protection agency usepa estimating annual domestic application at 76 5 million pounds 1 atrazine has been the subject of controversy and has been heavily studied and reviewed for its impacts as an endocrine disrupting compound 2 3 possible carcinogen 4 5 and environmentally persistent contaminant 6 the united states geological survey usgs watershed regression for pesticides warp tool predicts that for the most recent year in which data are available 2012 that substantial surface water in the us is in danger of exceeding the maximum contaminant level mcl for atz 7 in addition to the specific health risks of atrazine contamination atz shares a similar triazine structure with an entire class of pesticides making it a good candidate for study as a surrogate for related triazine pesticides chemical information for atz and major degradation products as well as a depiction of the general triazine structure can be found in table 1 below removal of atz from water has been studied extensively due to the regulation of atz concentration in drinking water by the epa with an mcl of 3

working potential window high resistance to fouling and in situ hydroxyl radical ho generation 22 24 the aop based processes are centered around the generation of ho a highly reactive and indiscriminate reactant able to effectively degrade organic compounds despite the desirability of ho as an oxidizing agent many processes require the addition of chemicals fenton s reagent peroxide

the combination of electrolysis with ozonation e o produced a synergistic effect on the degradation of aqueous 4 chlorobenzoic acid through cathodic reduction of aqueous ozone cathodic reduction of oxygen gas to form hydrogen peroxide has also been proposed as an important mechanism creating the observed synergism 27 28 zhou et al 29 and zhang et al 30 built on the combined process by adding iron electrodes to release fe2 and catalyze radical generation with the dissolved ozone the overall oxidative degradation of atz in the context of electrolysis e ozonation o and e o systems can be simplified to five main pathways based on previously published studies i direct reaction with molecular ozone 8 ii reaction with ho formed through the decomposition or reduction of ozone 8 25 31 iii

of operating mode ozone gas was produced using the ozonia lab2b ozone generator fed with 99 6 pure extra dry oxygen from a compressed gas cylinder at a rate of 2 l min the minimum recommended by the

initial atz concentration of 46 4 μm or 10 mg l addition of h2so4 and naoh were used as needed to adjust the ph after addition of the buffer the reactor was operated at ph 2 7 or 12 in one of three operating modes electrolysis only e ozonation only o or electrolysis combined with ozonation e o solution conductivity was measured using a corning checkmate ii conductivity meter and was maintained at 6 ms cm between experiments through the addition of na2so4 to facilitate a constant voltage across conditions this resulted in sulfate concentrations of 31 7 mm 4 5 g l at ph 7 and 17 6 mm 2 5 g l

analysis quenching and ph adjustment was made using concentrated solutions and dilution of the samples was limited to less than 1 i e 7 5 μl added per 1 ml all samples were quenched and adjusted in the same manner including calibration samples sampling intervals were determined by running a preliminary experiment and distributing 5 6 samples across the 0 90 degradation timeframe all experiments were timed to run until approximately 90 of the atz had been degraded 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 dissolved ozone residual ozone was measured using a modified version of the indigo method developed by bader and hoigné 40 and standardized as standard method 4500 o3 41 in this study the sample volume was reduced to 300 μl and the volume of indigo reagent was reduced to 2400 μl this change was made to facilitate frequent sampling from the reactor without significant loss of solution volume the results of this modified method were compared to the previously mentioned standard method and the difference in measured ozone concentration was found to be 3 2 5 2 hplc all reactor samples were analyzed and pesticides were quantified with an agilent 1100 high performance liquid chromatograph hplc equipped with a hypersil ods column from thermo scientific 150 mm long by 4 6 mm in diameter 3 μm particle size at a constant temperature of 30 c separation was performed at 1 25 ml min using the following solvent gradient of hplc grade acetonitrile acn and water 0 2 min 10 acn 90 h2o 2 6 min linear gradient from 10 acn 90 h2o to 90 acn 10 h2o 6 8 min 90 acn 10 h2o the detection wavelength was

obtained were processed using the agilent masshunter b 04 00 qualitative analysis software 3 results and discussion 3 1 impact of solution ph on atrazine degradation atrazine degradation was strongly dependent on ph for all operating modes kinetic data for atz degradation and the formation of major intermediate products are shown in fig 2 the data shown in fig 2 were examined graphically to establish a first order rate of degradation of atz as the best fit for the majority of experimental cases exponential curves were fit to the experimental data using a nonlinear least squares regression in microsoft excel to generate the reported degradation rate constants with electrolysis alone e atz was degraded at similar rates for ph 7 and 12 however the rate constant was triple at ph 2 kinetic profiles for the degradation can be seen in fig 2a d and g atrazine degradation was shown previously to be enhanced at acidic ph under bdd electrolysis 16 which may be attributable to increased hydroxyl radical generation with decreasing ph implied by results from enache et al 23 that ho formation at the bdd surface generally increased with decreasing solution ph data in table 2 show that the electrochemical first order rate constant for electrolysis at ph 2 decreased from 0 0193 min 1 to 0 0093 min 1 after the addition of tba indicating generation of radical species played a role in increasing the rate addition of tba during electrolysis at ph 7 and 12 had a lesser effect supporting the claim of radical generation dependence on ph during electrolysis more details on radical scavenger use can be found in section 3 3 change in atz speciation based on a reported dissociation constant for atz e g pka 1 71 43 as modeled in fig 3 may also contribute toward the increased rate constant at ph 2 if the two forms have different degradation rates follow up research on this topic would be needed if treatment of atz at ph 2 is considered as a potential treatment approach in experiments with ozone alone o the first order degradation rate constant for atz increased from 0 0210 min 1 at ph 2 to 0 3504 min 1 at ph 12 an increase of over one order of magnitude this agrees with previous findings on the behavior of ozone in aqueous solution 8 29 decomposition of ozone through reaction with oh increases with ph because oh is more readily available the ozone residual results agree with this ozone accumulation in the reactor was not present at ph 12 see fig 2h vs fig 2b and e the amount of hydroxyl radical formed increases during ozone decomposition at higher ph and this may account for the higher rate constant up to a point staehelin and hoigne 37 reported a rate constant for eq 2 of 70 m 1s1 for the ozone consuming initiation reaction between ozone and oh five to ten orders of magnitude smaller than the rate constants for the subsequent radical propagation reactions making it the rate limiting step in the radical chain reaction see beltran et al eqs 3 7 14 for specifics on the reactions and rate constants since the generation of ho is rate limited by the availability of ozone needed for the rate limiting initiation reaction in this system the reaction rate at ph 12 is governed by ozone mass transport rather than oxidation by ho the ozone mass transport limitation is confirmed by the absence of an ozone residual in experiments at ph 12 involving the application of ozone assuming adequate ozonation and mixing oh concentration becomes the most important factor in the degradation of atz with dissolved ozone only it is this dependence on oh that creates the potential for synergism when oh is generated in situ at the cathode during electrolysis when the data for the electrolysis combined with ozone e o case is examined evidence of the synergism can be observed at ph 7 the synergistic effects seen during the e o operating mode are discussed in more detail in the following section 3 2 synergistic effects in the combined ozonation and electrolysis system combining electrolysis with ozonation has the potential to create synergism by increasing available oh in the system thus promoting the decomposition of ozone into ho the final product of the initiation reaction shown in eq 2 fig 4 shows the normalized degradation curves for atz with respect to operation mode at differing ph without a radical scavenger the dotted line represents an additive estimate from separate ozonation and electrolysis experimental data calculated from a first order exponential function with y intercept of 45 μm and k value of the sum of the estimated rate constants from the individual conditions being added data presented in fig 4 show that significant synergism is only seen at ph 7 with performance of the e o mode following the straightforward additive model more closely at ph 2 and 12 at ph 7 the observed rate constant for ozonation combined with electrolysis 0 3441 min 1 was 4 78 x the estimated additive rate constant 0 072 min 1 similar enhancement at ph 2 was not observed despite an expectation that the same mechanisms for cathodic hydroxide ion generation are applicable at both ph 2 and 7 the difference at ph 2 however is potentially attributable to the size of the local alkaline zone created at the cathode and competition for ho between dissolved organics and h hydroxyl radicals and h react quickly in solution to form water 44 it was discussed in section 3 1 that with an assumption of adequate ozonation as evidenced by the ozone residual measured at ph 2 and 7 hydroxide ion concentration is the limiting factor in initiation of the radical chain reaction that leads to the observed synergism this leads the degradation rate enhancement to be dependent on the amount of atz that is able to react with ho generated from the decomposition of ozone near the cathode the bulk concentration of h is five orders of magnitude larger at ph 2 than at ph 7 therefore the contribution of a local alkaline zone at the cathode at ph 2 is likely to be smaller enhancement at ph 12 was not observed and this is likely due to limitations in mass transport of ozone in the system rather than any limits due to oh concentration the synergism is of interest because it is transferable to a wide variety of parent compounds and system configurations due to generation of a broad spectrum reactive species ho experiments conducted in co author zhao s lab to degrade the pharmaceutical diclofenac support this claim of broader applicability synergism was observed using e o at neutral ph for which the results are presented in section s 1 of the supplementary information the transferability of this type of process has also been confirmed by recent research on e o to degrade p nitrophenol 24 acid red 18 45 and p chlorobenzoic acid 46 3 3 impact of ho on atz rate constant the use of a radical scavenger can help to elucidate the impact of ho reactions on the overall rate constant first order rate constant data for the experiments using the radical scavenger are presented in table 2 columns 5 and 6 all experiments were conducted with and without the addition of tba in table 2 δk describes the magnitude of the difference between the atz degradation rate constant without tba katz and the atz degradation rate constant with tba katz tba this difference provides a general representation of the overall effect of ho reactions on the apparent degradation rate of atz tert butanol which competes with atz for reaction with ho is in 30x excess on a molar basis to atz allowing for a reasonable assumption of near complete scavenging of generated ho by tba fig 5 below provides a visual depiction of the rate constants with and without tba at ph 2 the rate constant for the e o mode decreased by 40 with tba scavenging of ho in comparison to 83 at ph 7 and 76 at ph 12 despite 40 reduction at ph 2 the value of δk 0 0208 min 1 is over an order of magnitude smaller than under the same conditions at ph 7 and ph 12 this further confirms that ho reactions are significantly reduced at ph 2 and that the promotion of ho generation at the cathode does not lead to a large increase in degradation rate even though an ozone residual is maintained in the bulk solution the high concentration of h at ph 2 increases competition for any generated ho as described in the previous section 3 4 formation of intermediates from atrazine and reaction pathways in addition to the degradation of atz alone this study considered the by products produced during degradation important information that must be available when evaluating technology for broad application while drinking water regulations in the united states pertain to a specific set of regulated contaminants consideration should be given to other indicators like solution toxicity in the case of atz the toxicity of the major dealkylation products ade adi and adedi have toxicities that range from half as toxic to three times more toxic than atz 47 making consideration of the pathway and accumulation of intermediates important as can be seen in fig 2 differences were observed between both the quantity and pathway of intermediates generated depending on ph and operating mode 3 4 1 intermediates identified selected hplc chromatograms from all ph conditions without scavenger are shown in fig 6 below all chromatograms are from the reaction time where 20 of the initial concentration of atz remained across all three operating modes many of the same compounds were detected in varying concentrations however cyn was only accumulated during the e mode cyanuric acid is important as it is the precursor to ring cleavage and mineralization formation of cyn is also expected in all cases involving ho and ozone but the comparatively rapid rate of atz loss combined with the low hplc response factor for cyn contribute to the lack of detection in those cases several additional compounds are present at ph 7 as opposed to ph 2 and ph 12 the additional compounds at ph 7 are formed due to the difference in oxidation mechanism at ph 7 where there is a combination between the effects of ho and the dissolved ozone residual ozone will react with ho generated intermediates and ho will react with ozone generated intermediates single mechanisms dominated at ph 2 ozone and 12 ho resulting in a smaller number of products formed in addition to the formation of the quantified products atz cyn adi ade adedi of note is the formation at ph 7 of two large peaks after 6 min labeled in fig 6 as 6 and 7 these two peaks correspond to compounds that are products of reaction with molecular ozone as they were formed at similar concentrations in the experiments with the radical scavenger present data not presented review of previous studies on ozonation of atz and a consideration of lc qtof ms data from this study see table 3 led to the proposed identification of these two compounds as cdit and the infrequently reported atz imine 8 48 the structure of cdit and atz imine shown in fig 7 would likely result in hplc retention times falling between that of ade and atz a pattern confirmed for cdit under similar chromatographic conditions 8 49 3 4 2 reaction pathways four major degradation pathways for atz were identified based on observations from this study and a review of prior work these pathways are presented in fig 7 and discussed in the following paragraphs the pathways in fig 7 are represented by the roman numerals near the upper arrows table 1 contains references and unabbreviated names for the intermediate compounds shown in fig 7 the pathways are i dealkylation ii acetamide transformation iii imine transformation and iv dechlorination i dealkylation data collected in this study confirmed this commonly reported pathway degradation of atz through dealkylation of the ethyl and isopropyl groups with initial formation of ade and adi with conversion to adedi and finally cyn ring cleavage and mineralization logically follow the formation of cyn but were not measured in this study ii acetamide transformation formation of adedi and its downstream degradation products is also possible via acetamide transformation of the atz alkyl chains by reaction with ozone this pathway proceeds via formation of intermediates cdit cdet cddt and cdat 8 11 48 in this study this reaction pathway appears to be favored at ph 7 only since the peak numbered 6 in fig 6 identified as cdit is much less prominent at both ph 2 and 12 further study is needed to thoroughly understand the ph dependence of this particular reaction pathway iii amine transformation the reaction of ozone or ho with atz can result in the formation of an ethyl group imine atz imine 8 this pathway is reported less often than the first two pathways however acero et al 8 found atz imine formation to be favored over the other major degradation products ade adi and cdit results from the lc qtof ms product identification study confirm substantial generation of atz imine at ph 7 in both o and e o reactor operating modes based on volume although quantification in terms of concentration was not possible iv dechlorination a similar pathway to atz dealkylation i is also possible if atz is initially dechlorinated to hydroxyatrazine oiet hydroxyatrazine can then be degraded in a similar fashion to the ade adi and adedi forming their dechlorinated equivalents oait oaet and oaat respectively 10 50 dechlorination was confirmed in the current study through lc qtof ms analysis of the e o mode at ph 12 as seen in the last four rows of table 3 the sample for which data are presented was taken at the time where 80 of the initial atz had been degraded generation of oiet was detected as early as the first experimental sample after time zero at ph 12 but was not detected in any samples or operating modes at ph 7 this indicates that direct dechlorination of atz occurs during ho attack only the absence of oiet at ph 7 may be attributed to competition with other reaction pathways due to the dissolved ozone residual maintained at ph 7 for complete mineralization to occur dechlorination is necessary at some point most likely to form oaat then cyn dechlorination of the triazine ring is expected in reaction processes dominated by ho 51 likewise it is also theoretically possible in later stages of the pathways under these conditions the results of this study show that ethyl group attack is preferred heavily to the isopropyl group the preference for the ethyl group is confirmed by the data presented in figs 2 and 6 is it shown that ade is generated prior to and in larger quantities than adi in all experimental cases except at ph 7 where cdit and atz imine are favored over ade and adi furthermore ethyl group attack is favored in both the molecular ozone dominated environment at ph 2 and the ho dominated environment at ph 12 the phenomenon occurring at ph 7 in the presence of dissolved ozone is the conversion of the alkyl group to acetamide forming cdit and cddt rather than removal of the alkyl groups in the case of this reaction ozone first attacks the ethyl group forming cdit then proceeds to attack the methyl group forming cddt further degradation of cddt to adedi occurs through the intermediate cdat as mentioned previously the degradation of atz by ho and molecular ozone generates many more intermediates than in other cases and further study using lc qtof ms is in progress to identify them however their position at a later retention time than adedi suggests that they are less oxidized than adedi they are also likely a mixture of chlorinated and dechlorinated products as previous researchers have found dechlorinated degradation products with retention times that follow the same relationship 48 49 4 conclusions in the current study addition of electrolysis to ozonation was effective at synergistically promoting atz oxidation in aqueous solution reaction conditions however have a significant impact on the rate constant and the pathway of degradation major conclusions from the current study are the following the observed rate constant for atz degradation during e o at ph 7 was 4 78 x the estimated additive rate constant for the processes when considered separately this is especially important since ph 7 is practical to water treatment scenarios synergism at ph 7 was due to the enhanced generation of ho from the decomposition of dissolved ozone through oh generated at the electrochemical cathode the same mechanism is possible at ph 2 but is likely suppressed by the large bulk concentration of h counteracting the impact of electrochemically generated oh hydrogen ion also competes with dissolved organics for reaction with ho the reaction mechanism in e o is shared between molecular ozone and ho at ph 2 ho production at ph 2 is limited by lack of oh availability at ph 7 and 12 the mechanism is dominated by ho generated at the cathode and in the bulk solution via ozone decomposition ethyl group attack is favored during reaction with ozone and ho at ph 2 and 12 at ph 7 intermediates cdit and atz imine were also formed cyn was only detected during degradation with electrolysis alone at ph 12 dechlorination of atz to form oiet was observed dechlorination was only found to be possible through reaction with ho acknowledgements the authors thank dr

14612,forward osmosis fo can aptly contribute to increased water reuse at the expense of low energy expenditure the distinctive feature for fo lies with the exploitation of the natural osmotic pressure gradient generated by a concentrated draw solution for water transport across a semi permeable membrane the selection of a suitable draw solution remains to be a grey area of commercial development of fo process the present review summarizes the importance of ionic liquid il and deep eutectic solvent des with natural product components and their potential as draw solutions in fo and their industrial applications various factors affecting performances of ils and dess as draw solutions are briefly assessed and critically compared with pertinent literature regeneration of il and des as spent solution from the process as well as pure water recovery is discussed with special reference to heat energy optimization a future pathway for research in il and des as draw solute and their economic aspects are also highlighted keywords forward osmosis draw solution ionic liquids deep eutectic solvent critical solution temperature nomenclature lle liquid liquid extraction ed extractive

nades natural deep eutectic solvent lcst lower critical solution temperature ucst upper critical solution temperature 1 introduction forward osmosis fo despite being old in its concept has spurred a renewed interest both academically and commercially in last two decades being natural clean and ecofriendly process fo has remarkable potential in substituting or complementing many conventional separation systems fo finds its increasing applications in the domains of desalination irrigation power regeneration pharmaceutical and protein concentration water reuse osmotic membrane bio reactor and enhanced oil recovery 1 2 in this process a semipermeable membrane is positioned in between two solutions of different concentrations more precisely of different osmotic pressure a concentrated solution draw solution and a dilute solution feed solution the concentration difference between the two solutions generates the required osmotic potential which provides the driving force to extract fresh water from a feed solution such as seawater brine or any wastewater dilute product solution on the other side of the membrane as a result the process can concentrate a solution of lower osmotic pressure with that of a higher osmotic pressure forward osmosis is endowed with a number of benefits to its credit these include high salt rejection less susceptibility to membrane fouling and above all the requirement of less hydraulic pressure compared to their pressure driven counterparts the selection of a safe efficient and inexpensive draw solution plays an important role in the progress of the fo process a good draw solution should not only be capable of generating high osmotic potential but also be easily recoverable however to make fo process commercially competitive with other established separation processes some of the key issues like low water flux rates reverse solute flux rsf concentration polarization cp and energy efficient recovery of draw solutes also need to be addressed adequately interestingly most of the issues related to cp and rsf are dependent on both membrane structure and draw solute properties there is a strong correlation between the choice of draw solutes and progress of fo membranes research 3 synthetic draw solutes with tailor made properties are being regularly developed and tested for their suitability as draw solutes however the results are met with limited success numerous inorganic compounds have been reported and explored in membrane literature as potential candidates for draw solutions 4 5 nonetheless many of these compounds have exhibited a high reverse draw solute flux or are expensive to recycle leave aside their toxic potency at times therefore the search for a compatible and efficient draw solution assumes paramount importance in view of the wider industrial acceptance of forward osmosis ionic liquids il and deep eutectic solvents des also referred to as bio ionic liquids are lately touted as green solvents to be used in a variety of separation processes these are a few of the latest class of draw solutes which has caught researchers attention des like choline chloride ethylene glycol ch cl eg and choline chloride glycerol ch cl glycerol has been attempted as potential draw solutes 6 they have shown to possess high osmotic potential and can be easily recovered rendering better energy efficiency of the overall process they are also economically competitive and environmentally benign although there are quite a good number of reviews on various aspects of fo in recent literature encompassing membrane development area specific applications selection of draw solutions and few more applicability of il and des in particular as draw solution have not been surveyed so far this paper focuses on the amenability of il and des as draw solution and critically analyzes their applicability in forward osmosis systems with regard to concepts and key issues various physico chemical parameters governing the fo performance synthesis and recovery of draw solutes and economic aspects are adequately reviewed in the following sections in spite of limited work reported by researchers in using il and des in fo process as draw solute the impetus for the present review was stimulated firstly by the wide application potential of il and des as new generation eco friendly solvents and secondly to obtain a further insight into the direction of basic and applied research in the area of fo 2 fo membrane and draw solution fo membranes similar to their ro counterparts generally contain two layers a selective active thin layer and a porous support layer the active layer is mainly responsible for salt rejection and the support layer provides the necessary mechanical strength to engineer the module the two major desirable properties of a successful fo membrane are high solute rejection propensity and high water flux it is very difficult to provide these two properties at the same time the other desirable properties include minimal concentration polarization long term mechanical stability and resistance to various ph environments since the pioneering development of modern fo membranes by hydration technologies inc hti albany or a lot of research work on fo has been reported in literature 1 cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes fabricated by hti inc is credited with high water flux performance but reportedly suffers from high rsf in case of smaller solutes 7 to mitigate the problem a thin film composite tfc fo membranes which exhibit reduced rsf without compromising the flux rates 8 9 could be used researchers have been working actively in developing tfc membranes for enhancing the performance of fo process further 10 draw solution has another dominant role to play in fo processes a good draw solution should be capable of generating high osmotic pressure 11 and simultaneously be easily recoverable however these two requirements are self conflicting as good osmotic potential needs strong affiliation between the draw solute and water molecules e g via hydration or ionization which subsequently makes recovery process difficult 5 on the other hand it should also have essential solvent characteristics like wide availability high solubility minimal toxicity non reactivity and above all low cost search for an ideal draw solution constitutes a major focus of fo research considering the diversity of feed streams to be treated it may not be possible for a single universal draw solution to become a panacea to treat all type of feed streams draw solutes are broadly classified into two groups compounds that are commercially available and structurally modified synthetic compounds fig 1 the commercially available compounds include inorganic salts like nacl mgso4 nahco3 khco3 k2so4 nh4 2so4 na2so4 etc organic salts like sodium acetate sodium formate magnesium acetate sodium propionate etc volatile compounds like nh3 co2 gas mixture so2 etc nutrient compounds like glucose and fructose fertilizers like urea nh4cl etc and polymers the synthetic compounds developed by carious researchers show great potential as draw solutes these include hydrophilic magnetic nanoparticles mnps polyelectrolytes like polyacrylic acid sodium paa na salts hydroacid complexes switchable polarity solvents spss like mixtures of carbon dioxide water and tertiary amines deep eutectic solvent des like choline chloride ethylene glycol choline chloride glycerol etc polymer hydrogels dual responsive polymers etc more and more synthetic compounds are being tested for application in fo as draw solutes yet another classification of draw solution can be made on the basis of the recovery methods of draw solute here the draw solutes are classified as responsive and non responsive 5 to some external stimuli the non responsive draw solutes include the commercially available compounds mentioned above while the responsive draw solutes are mostly the synthetic compounds which give response to some kind of stimuli these can be further categorized based on type of stimuli like thermal pressure magnetic field and so on despite the extensive research efforts devoted in the pursuit of identifying novel draw solutes simple dissolved inorganic and thermolytic salts e g nacl 12 14 mgcl2 15 etc are the most popular and widely used for various applications also they are probably the most effective draw solutes 16 reported so far around 40 of research work has been reported using nacl as draw solution because of its abundant availability high solubility non toxicity and being inexpensive 2 nacl generate high osmotic pressures at low solution viscosities and have high diffusivities but suffer from rsf problem researchers are still trying to improve the performance of nacl draw solutes 17 nevertheless nacl 2 m and 3 m remains to be the benchmark for the performance of draw solutes as none of the commercially available non responsive draw solutes could show satisfactory performance with respect to all the above mentioned parameters and recovery method the research focus has now been shifted to the development of synthetic draw solutes with tailored properties synthetic materials which are highly soluble in water and form homogenous solutions show better performance as draw solution however the rsf should be maintained within the acceptable limits 3 2 1 recovery of draw solute the recovery and recycle of draw solute is of prime importance as both of these require expenditure of energy this is one of the grey areas of fo research and development recovery of draw solute is necessary because of two important reasons viz loss of draw solute needs costly replenishment and in most application pure water is recovered as a product so high level of separation is an essential prerequisite of a commercial fo process this can be achieved by using thermal separation process like heating membrane process like reverse osmosis ro 18 nanofiltration nf 12 19 ultrafiltration uf 13 membrane distillation md 14 20 electrodialysis ed 21 precipitation using chemicals like ca oh 2 ba oh 2 22 external stimulus like magnetic field 23 sunlight heat combined with hydraulic pressure in addition synergic combination of two or more process like precipitation magnetic field 24 precipitation thermal hot ultrafiltration 25 integrated electric field nf system 26 etc have also been explored to optimize the overall energy consumption numerous methods for draw solute recovery have been attempted by the researchers 27 the choice of recovery methods depends largely on two major factors namely the amount of energy required and the extent of separation of draw solutes from the solution a highly efficient recovery method demands minimum energy consumption and maximum draw solute recovery which in turn ensures maximum pure water recovery all the recovery methods reported in literature could achieve fairly high degree of separation however at the expense of high energy consumption certainly the conventional separation methods would not live up to the expectation in making solute recovery energy efficient in order to make fo competitive alternative options are being suggested in the form of responsive draw solutes which may consume less direct energy 24 or less expensive form of energy like low grade heat or solar energy 27 this could be possible in industry where lot of waste heat is available the other option is to make an optimum economic balance between draw solute recovery cost replenishment cost and cost of fresh water generated in remote application like treatment of effluent generated on site during oil and gas drilling operation fo has been demonstrated to be effective in osmotic dilution mode 18 28 fo is used to recover part of water from drilling waste streams a balance is made in generating local reusable water source onsite thereby limiting fresh water and wastewater transport nacl is used as draw solute which does not need costly replenishment 29 30 in fertigation process fertilizers like urea nh4cl nh4no3 kcl nh4h2po4 etc are used as a drawing agent and the resulting dilute fertilizer can be used for irrigation instead of recovering osmotic dilution mode 31 32 in the commercial application of fo the focus is more on making fo process economically competitive by harping on the drawbacks of other technologies in most cases ro rather than improving the fo process itself also intelligent process design and optimization have enabled hybrid fo systems commercially implementable 33 researchers in fo community are convinced that a breakthrough in either membrane side or draw solute side can be made in near future thereby rendering the fo process directly competitive with other separation processes exploration of ils and dess as potential draw solutes may be a step towards that direction 2 2 concentration polarization concentration polarization cp is one of the major reasons which contribute to decrease in the net driving force osmotic pressure based on the position where cp occurs it can be classified into two categories external concentration polarization ecp and internal concentration polarization icp icp phenomenon occurs inside the porous support layer due to the opposite diffusion of water and solutes it is the most challenging phenomenon which occurs in fo processes as it cannot be easily eradicated the decline in water flux in fo process is predominantly caused by icp 7 and the flux reduction can be very high in some cases up to 80 3 icp is caused by the gradual dilution of the draw solution and the gradual concentration of the feed solution inside the membrane with solvent permeating from the feed side to the draw solution continuously and in absence of any external turbulence the draw solute concentration at the surface of membrane gradually becomes lower than its bulk concentration and correspondingly the feed concentration at the surface of membrane increasingly becomes higher than its bulk concentration this leads to net reduction in concentration difference between the two sides as the concentration difference between the draw and feed solution is the only driving force hence any reduction in the net concentration difference tends to slow down the process this effect is somewhat analogous to the reduction in available temperature difference driving force in an evaporator due to boiling point elevation of the solution to alleviate the problems of icp the support layer for fo membrane should be as thin as possible with high porosity and low tortuosity 34 a major spotlight in fo research is development of fo membranes with high permeability and high hydrophilicity combined with low structure parameter to tackle the issue of cp 35 draw solutes that have high diffusivities give rise to higher water flux thereby decreasing the effect of icp on the contrary ecp phenomenon occurs at the outer surface of the membrane active layer it merits mentioning that incorporating methods like increase of flow turbulence or calculated augmentation of water flux can substantially alleviate the effect of ecp on permeate flux 36 2 3 reverse solute flux the occurrence of rsf adversely affects the performance of fo process and lead to other problems it is one of the major parameters which determine the selection of draw solutes it not only diminishes the driving force 2 but also contaminates the feed solution e g dewatering in addition it also causes the loss of precious draw solute this in turn tends to increase the replenishment cost of the draw solute for example if fo technology is applied in dewatering of dilute proteins or pharmaceuticals using brine as draw solution the rsf phenomenon may contaminate these products salt sensitiveness could even result into denaturation of products also high rsf could lead to severe membrane fouling 37 although small molecular size draw solutes generate high water flux but these suffer from high rsf small size solutes like nacl are more prone to rsf while larger solutes like polymer and nanoparticle based draw solutions has the advantage of essentially eliminating rsf while selecting draw solutes the process designer generally should make a trade off between small solute size to limit icp and large solute size to decrease rsf 36 the advent and expected commercialization of highly selective tfc fo membranes may promote the use of small highly mobile solutes and decrease the need for exploring draw solutes with larger molecular size a major part of research in fo process constitutes exploring draw solutes with low rsf 20 38 2 4 applicability of fo fo has a remarkable potential in reclamation of complex wastewater streams generated from diverse areas of operation fo applications encompass osmotic dilution prior to desalination water recovery from wastewater fertigation emergency water supply in military space and humanitarian aid and treatment of high salinity brines fo is generally most viable in the scenarios of highly saline solutions where other methods of water recovery become operationally unsuitable or in situations where the draw solution can be directly used for beneficial purposes it could also be useful in the dilution of a high salinity feed stream with a low salinity waste stream more and more applications of osmotic dilution mode are being explored where fo is increasingly recognized as an effective technique 18 it can be used in remote areas where availability of energy is an issue here fo systems using low grade energy could be highly effective generation of potable water in portable devices using fo in water scarce areas has been already been reported 1 in industrial hubs the liquid effluents generated are often treated in common effluent treatment plant cetp these cetps often suffer from huge loads in some cases exceeding their capacity these cetp effluents are a very complex combination of effluents from various industries resulting in a mixture very difficult to treat in such cases fo could be particularly useful it has been demonstrated that in treatment and desalination of high fouling complex industrial streams and wastewater generated by mining and oil and gas exploration activities 39 fo process is proven to be beneficial 29 39 in addition fo can be used to pretreat the feed to the ro system running a closed loop draw solution re concentrated by ro in a complementary process 40 in such applications fo can protect the ro system ensuing less frequent cleaning protocols thus prolonging the ro membrane life in standalone chemical process plants concentration and dilution of process streams may occur simultaneously at different places fo could be suitable for doing both these operations in one step with very low energy consumption for example fo process could be used for dewatering of effluent streams by using a concentrated stream from the same industry which needs dilution satisfactory results could be anticipated by doing proper stream networking along with some reorientation in pumping requirements similar to energy mass integration concentration integration could become the next promising area 3 ionic liquids il ionic liquids ils are salts that have low melting point thereby making them liquid at low temperature typically less than 100 c at atmospheric pressure they have favorable properties such as negligible vapor pressure non volatile high ionic conductivity high solubility non flammability chemical and thermal stability 41 rendering them ideal candidates for numerous industrial applications being non volatile they have potential to replace many harmful traditional volatile organic compounds as solvent thus earning the tag of green solvent 42 43 some of the undesirable properties of ils like high viscosity combustible character poor biodegradability and high cost of production has been reported and discussed in literature 41 however the major advantage that made ils popular is the numerous structural possibilities that can be achieved by tweaking the alkyl chain and the anionic precursor in fact by suitable selection of cations and anions they can be tailored for specific applications ionic liquid and water can form homogenous solution and exhibits unique phase behavior there are two types of il water mixture based on the temperature at which mixture undergoes phase separation lower critical solution temperature lcst and upper critical solution temperature ucst in lcst type mixture the phase separation occurs at temperature above the lcst point while in ucst type mixture the phase separation occurs at temperature below the ucst point the phase separation generally results in an il rich phase and water rich phase ils are applied as electrolytes in battery and fuel cells 44 45 as catalytic agent in various chemical synthesis like biodiesel production 46 as solvents in extraction process 43 47 like separation of heavy metals 48 49 aromatics from pyrolytic sugars in bioethanol production 50 absorbents in gas separation 51 in membrane based separation process ils have been reportedly used as mobilizer in pervaporation membranes 52 as liquid membranes 53 for various separation processes lithium recovery from seawater using dialysis 54 and numerous other applications ils being a broad family its successful development as well as use is also marred with controversies in regard to toxicity and environmental concerns 55 hence developing new ils needs careful environment impact assessment in not doing so their industrial utilization may be restricted due to stringent environmental regulations 56 in the quest to develop green solvents which are also commercially viable a new class of ils known as deep eutectic solvents has come into limelight 3 1 deep eutectic solvents des deep eutectic solvent des s are a class of ils they cannot be strictly defined as ils as they are mixtures whereas ils are single salts they are eutectic mixture of lewis or bronsted acids and bases that can contain a variety of anionic and or cationic species having melting point significantly less than the individual components for example the melting point of pure choline chloride ch cl and urea is 302 c and 134 c respectively whereas ch cl urea mixture in 2 1 molar ratio which forms an eutectic solvent has freezing point of 12 c fig 2 which is substantially less than the individual components 57 they are obtained by the complexation of a quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt or hydrogen bond donor different categories of des are summarized in table 1 the term deep eutectic solvent was coined initially to describe type 3 eutectics but has subsequently been used to describe all of the eutectic mixtures 58 the wide array of choice of hydrogen bond donor makes it easier to develop dess with required properties the same characteristics and properties which make ils attractive for industrial application are also shared by dess dess exhibit negligible vapor pressure non volatile high ionic conductivity high solubility non flammability bio degradability chemical and thermal stability making them highly acceptable as solvents catalysts and absorbents for various applications table 3 over and above they are cheap environmentally benign and easy to manufacture making them a viable alternative for many existing commercial application 42 58 59 choline chloride ch cl is the most common quaternary ammonium organic salt used as it is cheap non toxic and bio degradable it has a choline cation with a chloride anion iupac name 2 hydroxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride it is regarded as a component of vitamin b complex and can be extracted from biomass abbott et al was the first to report des based on ch cl and urea 1 2 molar ratio in 2003 57 other salts such as imidazolium ammonium and phosphonium based ones have also been studied but to a lesser extent similarly a variety of hydrogen bond donors like ethylene glycol acetic acid glycerol oxalic acid malonic acid etc other than urea has been studied and reported in literature fig 3 presents chemical structure of some compounds that can be commonly used to form des it is to be noted that not all ratios of the individual components can form a des some of the commercially available dess are shown in table 2 a lot of dess is still being developed and reported in search of favorable properties which can be applied in suitable area 60 66 dess are used as solvents 67 76 entrainers 77 78 catalysts 79 82 in electrochemistry 83 84 as absorbents 85 and in numerous other ways to a wide variety of industries widespread application of dess is continuously being explored and reported in literature a short overview of the potential of des in various fields is presented in table 3 3 2 natural deep eutectic solvents nades when the compounds that constitute the des are primary metabolites namely amino acids organic acids sugars or choline derivatives the des are termed as natural deep eutectic solvents nades 59 dai et al 86 has demonstrated over 100 combinations of nades which has useful properties especially in terms of solubility they also demonstrated the possibility of the formation of ternary deep eutectic solvents tdes which can be explored and tweaked to improve their properties towards their targeted applications also addition of water in small quantity to some nadess exhibit favorable property change e g glycerol ch cl at 2 1 ratio has viscosity 222 cp at 25 c whereas glycerol ch cl water at 2 1 1 ratio has viscosity of 51 3 cp at 40 c 6 58 86 this shows that addition of small amounts of water to glyceline reduced viscosity still preserving its essential characteristics moreover the toxicity profile of nadess in general seems to be relatively less acute than their dess parents 87 henceforth in this paper des will include nades for discussion purpose unless otherwise mentioned 3 3 preparation of il des nades the synthesis of ionic liquids is generally a two step process the first step constitutes the formation of the desired cation which is synthesized either by the protonation of the amine by an acid or through quaternization reactions of amine with a haloalkane followed by heating in the second step anion exchange reactions are carried out by treatment of halide salts with lewis acids to form lewis acid based ionic liquids or by anion metathesis 88 the most extensively studied and used lewis acid based ionic liquids are alcl3 based salts such salts involve simple mixing of the lewis acid and the halide salt which results in the formation of more than one anionic species aletcl2 bcl3 cucl incl3 etc are other lewis acids used apart from alcl3 anion metathesis is popular choice 89 for the preparation of water and air stable ionic liquids based upon 1 3 dialkylimidazolium cations this method involves the treatment of the halide salt with the ag na k salts of no2 no3 bf4 so4 2 etc with the free acid of the appropriate anion advanced techniques like microwave irradiation and ultrasound waves are used nowadays to enhance yield and shorten reaction time recent introduction of one pot synthetic protocols reduce the cost and improve efficiency 88 the preparation method of each il is different and more complicated than des the presence of heavy metal precursors creates toxicity concerns and environmental issues in addition they may aggravate the rsf issue by contamination feed solution in dewatering applications in this aspect des has advantage synthesis of dess is almost 100 atom economic 41 easy to handle and no purification is required thus making their large scale use feasible 58 the preparation of des does not involve any complicated process and can be easily manufactured in laboratory dess can be obtained by proper mixing of a hydrogen bond acceptor hba and a hydrogen bond donor hbd at a suitable temperature a large number of different compounds have been attempted as hba and hbd for the synthetic preparation of des the most common hba is ch cl while urea glycerol citric acid and ethylene glycol are common hbds from 2003 since abott discovered the first des 57 the heating method is the most simple and popular method of preparation of des this method is not only cheaper but also safer considering that the components are usually thermally unstable similar to the case of sugars or amino acids in this method a mixture of hba and hbd is mixed with moderate heating and continuous stirring for a couple of hours till a homogenous and colorless des is formed in liquid form for example ch cl and eg in 1 2 molar ratio is mixed and heated at 80 c with continuous stirring for around 2 h to form ethaline in case of nades similar procedure can be followed at even lower temperature of 50 c with addition of small amount of water 86 an alternative and easy procedure for des preparation from aqueous solutions by freeze drying method was proposed by gutíerrez et al 90 in this method urea and ch cl at a 2 1 molar ratio with 5 solute content on weight basis was prepared by mixing separate aqueous solutions of urea and ch cl the mixed solutions were then frozen at 196 c and 20 c followed by freeze drying to produce a clear viscous des other methods of preparation of des are also reported in literature the grinding method which has been largely explored in the preparation of dess for pharmaceutical purposes consists in mixing the two components and then grinding them in a mortar with a pestle at room temperature until a homogeneous liquid is formed 91 in vacuum evaporation method the components are dissolved in water and evaporated at 50 c with a rotary evaporator the liquid obtained was put in a desiccator with silica gel till they reached a constant weight all the methods by and large show the same chemical profile for the obtained des 86 4 il des and nades as draw solute performance check performance of various draw solutions in fo process is well documented in membrane literature 3 5 a potential draw solute should primarily be able to generate high osmotic potential and should be easily recovered of late ils and dess are explored as draw solute in fo process and the results are encouraging il and des as a category fall under responsive draw solutes using heat as a stimulus for regeneration and recycle of draw solutes both lcst and ucst type ils are used as draw solute depending on whether the solution is lcst or ucst the solution is either heated or cooled beyond its critical point to form a draw solute rich and a water rich phases gravity separation techniques can be used to carry out bulk of the phase separation 11 the draw solute rich phase is recycled back to the fo system while the water rich phase is further polished by ro or nf process to generate pure water as shown in fig 4 retained osmolality of the dilute draw solution and the number of recycles that can be undertaken are the two important considerations in the ds rich phase in the water rich phase the ease of separation of draw solute from water determines the additional energy consumption and in turn cost of separation it is worth mentioning that conventional thermal recovery of draw solutes is well reported and unanimously agreed to be uneconomical thermal recovery can be only viable when it is carried out at moderate temperatures using low grade heat solar heat heat as a stimulus for responsive draw solutes has been discussed for other types of draw solutes such as volatile solutes 92 dual responsive polymer hydrogel 93 94 and water soluble polyelectrolytes 25 properties of lcst type have been exploited for regeneration and recycle in case of some polymer hydrogels 93 use of il as draw agent is briefly mentioned recently in review literature 3 5 cai et al reported the energy efficient desalination by forward osmosis using responsive ionic liquid draw solute 95 preliminary work on lcst type draw solutes has been carried out by mok et al 2013 96 97 they studied tri n butyrylated tris 2 aminoethyl amine nbu taea mw 356 and n butyrylatedpolyethylenimine nbu pei mw 1238 solutions as possible lcst type draw solute these draw solutes could display very stable phase separation behavior above lcst due to their uniform mw the nbu taea draw solutes reported osmotic flux less than 1 l m 2 h 1 up to 2 m concentration to draw water from 0 6 m nacl and the nbu pei draw solute showed osmotic flux less than 1 l m 2 h 1 at 0 49 m concentration against 0 15 m nacl both the draw solutes suffer from low osmotic flux which is hardly enough to draw water from artificial sea water solution however the residual solute concentrations in the water rich phase were low at 0 22 and 0 052 mol l 1 for nbu taea and nbu pei respectively the rejection efficiency was 98 and 99 6 for nbu taea and nbu pei respectively owing to high mw of the draw solutes the phase transition temperature was reported to be 31 32 c and was found suitable a similar type of work was reported by nakayama et al 2014 98 using various glycol ethers as lcst type draw solute a 12 m di ethylene glycol n hexyl ether deh draw solution reported osmotic flux 0 62 l m 2 h 1 to draw water from 0 6 m nacl solution which was considerably low water rich phase contained 0 081 m deh the phase transition temperature was 20 c and the whole fo process could be operated in between 10 c to 30 c cta membranes provided by hti inc were used in both the cases cai et al reported use of three ils namely tetrabutylphosphonium 2 4 dimethylbenzenesulfonate p4444dmbs tetrabutylphosphoniummesitylenesulfonate p4444tmbs and tributyloctyl phosphonium bromide p4448br as draw solution to draw water from sea water and brackish water 95 the osmolality of the ils was reported to be very high the osmolality of 70 wt solution was 5 4 osmol kg 1 for p4444dmbs and 3 6 osmol kg 1 for p4444tmbs which was 4 5 and 3 times of seawater s osmolality respectively even after dilution they could retain much of their osmolality p4444dmbs and p4444tmbs osmolality values of their 30 wt 0 95 mol kg 1 solutions were reported at 1 34 osmol kg 1 and 1 08 osmol kg 1 respectively p4448br demonstrated lower osmolality and hence could draw water only from low salinity feed solutions the 70 wt p4444dmbs draw solution could generate a water flux of 1 5 l m 2 h 1 against a feed of 1 2 m nacl at 14 1 c the draw ability has been found to increase with decreasing temperature additionally these ds demonstrated low rsf below 30 mg l 1 after fo process the diluted 50 wt draw solution underwent liquid liquid phase separation at a temperature above its lcst 30 50 c a very mild temperature stimulus of about 35 and 40 c could result in stable phase separation for p4444tmbs and p4444dmbs respectively in a wide range of il concentration between 10 and 60 at 55 c stable phase separation occurred containing 70 il rich phase and 7 5 il lean phase the lean phase contained less than 10 draw solute concentration and high quality water was obtained by nanofiltration process the retentate in nf along with the ds rich phase were recycled back without any further treatment a prepared tfc membrane was used in the process a patent application has been filed 99 zhong et al 100 used 3 2 m solution of protonated betainebis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide hbet tf2n which was a ucst type ionic liquid to extract water from a feed up to 3 0 m nacl solution a bwro type polyamide membrane ym70acsp18 from toray inc was used for the fo process the fo process was carried out at 60 c but subsequently cooled down to room temperature for phase separation at room temperature of 23 c the saturation concentration of hbet tf2n was approximately 3 2 mol l 1 88 3 wt in the il rich phase and 0 36 mol l 1 13 7 wt in water rich phase the water flux was very low 1 l m 2 h 1 which further decreased with increase in feed concentration a very low rsf 1 mmol l 1 was reported in the process increase of temperature was observed to have a positive effect on water flux the relatively high saturation concentration of hbet tf2n in water rich phase needed ro process for further purification a group of scientists from csir csmcri bhavnagar india mondal et al 2015 reported the use of des as draw solute for dewatering process to enrich low abundant dna and proteins 6 the fo process reported by the group used ch cl eg 1 2 and ch cl glycerol 1 2 as draw solution and brackish water as feed solution an indigenously developed tfc polyamide membrane was used a nominal flow rate of 1 8 lpm and feed inlet pressure of 1 atm was maintained on both sides ch cl eg and ch cl glycerol could generate very high osmotic pressure of 365 atm and 317 atm respectively the osmotic potential could be retained π 150 atm after 50 dilution and π 60 atm after 80 dilution due to retention of osmotic potential the draw solution could be recycled for a longer time both the draw solute showed high flux values of 7 85 and 3 71 l m 2 h 1 atm 1 respectively draw solute was recovered by chilling at 5 c presence of choline 2000 5000 mg l 1 was reported in the recovered water however no further polishing was carried out in another experiment the same group used the same fo system for concentration of proteins and dna they could achieve more than 6 fold protein concentration and more than 3 fold dna concentration in both cases ch cl eg 1 2 was used as draw agent an average flux of 3 10 l m 2 h 1 and 4 67 l m 2 h 1 was reported for dna concentration and protein enrichment respectively no loss of dna or protein was reported even there was no denaturation of dna signifying the absence of rsf the diluted ethaline draw solution was chilled at 5 c to recover good quality product water and draw solution which could be reused the recovered dilute ethaline 20 was reused for three times without significant reduction of flux 101 4 1 osmotic potential and water flux an overview of all the fo processes using il and des as draw solution is presented in table 4 till now limited work has been reported in literature from the studies mentioned above it is found that des has melting point much below than the individual component in some of the cases even at room temperature e g reline tm 12 c which enable them to be used as an ambient temperature draw solute des such as ethaline π 365 atm and glyceline π 317 atm and il such as p4444dmbs π 5 4 osmol kg 1 and p4444tmbs π 3 6 osmol kg 1 reported high osmotic potential 6 95 a primary requirement of fo process it is worth mentioning that osmotic potential of sea water approx 0 6 m nacl is around 50 atm osmolality 1 2 osmol kg 1 if compared to 2 m nacl solution π 104 atm which is often considered as a benchmark of draw solution des exhibits significantly higher osmotic potential the density is comparable while the viscosity is significantly high table 5 shows the properties of some common des which has potential to be applied as draw solutes the osmotic potential generated by the draw solutes is dependent on number of factors like solute concentration molecular weight mw of the solute and the solution temperature the number of species formed by dissociation in the solution affects the osmotic potential but it is not dependent on the types of species formed it has been observed that draw solutes having low mw generate more osmotic potential 4 this can be verified by van t hoff equation eq 1 4 102 1 π i c r t where i is the van t hoff factor the number of moles of species formed by the dissociation of solutes in the solution c is the solute concentration in mol l 1 of solution r is the universal gas constant r 0 082 l atm mol k and t is the absolute temperature of the solution this equation is restricted to extremely dilute solutions and is generally used for the determination of large mw 103 for more general solutions the virial equation 4 104 can be used as shown in eq 2 2 π c r t 1 b c c c 2 d c 3 where b c and d are the osmotic virial coefficients the virial coefficients can be determined empirically by fitting experimental osmotic pressure data in general the determination of b and c is enough to reproduce observed data 103 thus a low mw solute with high water solubility will be able to generate higher osmotic pressure on equal mass basis resulting in high water fluxes 105 106 the reported values of water flux in some thermally responsive ionic liquids like nbu taea mw 356 nbu pei mw 1238 glycol ethers mw 200 and hbet tf2n mw 398 were found to be very low 1 l m 2 h 1 some of the il like p4444dmbs could generate high osmotic potential 5 4 osmol kg 1 and moderate water flux of 4 l m 2 h 1 with 1 6 m nacl feed solution this can be attributed to the ionic nature of these classes of responsive draw solutes 95 des like ethaline mw 88 and glyceline mw 108 show good water flux rates 4 8 l m 2 h 1 with brackish feed water in dewatering applications water flux of 3 4 5 l m 2 h 1 could be achieved with ethaline as des water fluxes obtained using ionic liquids are low compared to inorganic draw solutes the mw of the dess as mentioned in table 5 ranges from 80 to 125 g mol 1 which can be considered as low mw they are highly soluble in water in almost any ratio hence it is possible for these dess to generate high osmotic potential and consequently higher water flux rates even after dilution it is possible to retain the osmotic potential resulting in more number of recycle 6 4 2 icp effects the mw of the dess as mentioned in table 5 ranges from 80 to 125 g mol 1 low mw draw solutes have higher diffusion coefficient compared to those with larger mw draw solutes with high diffusion coefficient encounter lower resistance and can smoothly diffuse through the membrane support layer so these dess tend to have lower icp effects 4 this can be validated by eq 3 which is conveniently used to determine solute resistivity k within the porous support layer 1 36 105 3 k t τ ε d s where t is thickness τ is tortuosity and ε is porosity of the support layer ds is the diffusion coefficient of the draw solution minimizing the k value is one of the primary objectives of membrane manufacturers to improve the performance of forward osmosis processes the term t τ ε is known as the membrane structural parameter s high viscosity of solutions reduces the diffusion coefficient 3 all the des show high viscosity at 25 c however it has been demonstrated that addition of small quantities of water exhibit drastic reduction in viscosity in some dess 58 also small increase in temperature could considerably reduce the viscosity for example glycerol ch cl 2 1 has viscosity 222 cp at 25 c whereas glycerol ch cl water at 2 1 1 ratio has viscosity of 51 3 cp at 40 c 6 58 86 87 dai et al 2015 reported a decrease in viscosity from 397 to 7 2 cp following the addition of 25 of water in the case of glucose ch cl 2 5 the viscosity decreased by 1 3 when diluted with 5 water and decreased to one tenth of the original value with the addition of 10 water the viscosity of glucose ch cl 2 5 decreased by two third when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 c 86 the viscosity change is achieved without changing other essential characteristics of the des therefore usage of des as draw solutes can give the dual benefit of small mw and low viscosity which is extremely favorable as far as icp problem is concerned moreover recycling of the dilute des can add to reduction of viscosity ambient conditions of hot countries may be beneficial in further reduction of viscosity it was demonstrated that the des draw solutes could be recycled up to 3 times without much change in the water flux rates 6 4 3 reverse solute flux effects all the il and des based draw solutes reported to have low rsf cai et al reported rsf of about 30 mg l 1 for p4444dmbs and p4444tmbs 95 high rsf leads to loss of precious draw solute and also contaminates the feed solution in general high rsf is attributed to low mw draw solutes e g nacl 0 75 g l 1 and nh4hco3 2 g l 1 ils like p4444dmbs p4444tmbs and hbet tf2n has high mw nearby 0 4 g mol 1 approx which contribute to low rsf however low rsf in dess having mws ranging between 0 08 0 125 g mol 1 may be attributed to high reverse solute flux selectivity rsfs rsfs is defined as the ratio of water flux j w to reverse salt flux js in the fo process a higher rsfs indicates the increase in membrane selectivity which in turn increases the efficiency of the fo process this parameter is determined by the selectivity of the membrane active layer rsfs is independent of the membrane support layer properties 87 and can quantitatively describe the fo membrane performance as shown in eq 4 107 109 4 r s f s j w j s n a b r t where n is the number of dissolved species created by the draw solute t is the draw solution temperature and r is the universal gas constant a and b are water and solute permeability coefficient respectively to maximize rsfs the a b ratio must be maximized slightly higher temperatures could lead to an increase in rsfs by reducing the cp resistances of fo membrane both active layer and support layer and also by increasing the wettability within the effective porosity of the sl 109 it is to be noted that high rsfs is associated with decreased water permeability 4 4 recovery of il des nades draw solute and pure water recovery in case of il des nades recovery of draw solute is generally achieved by phase separation through thermal stimulation depending on whether the eutectic point is a lcst or ucst the draw solute rich phase is recycled back and water rich phase is further treated for high quality water recovery in all the fo experiments using il des nades as draw solutes the draw solute rich phase could have approximately 70 80 concentration which helps them retain enough osmotic potential to be recycled back in almost all the cases il and des except pei derivatives and glycol ethers could retain the osmotic potential even after significant dilution leading to more number of recycle up to three recycles can be achieved in batch systems beyond which the draw solute needs to be replenished in most cases the fo process are carried out at ambient temperatures in case of ucst type draw solutes the temperature rise necessary for phase separation is moderate up to 60 c which requires low energy this can be provided by alternate energy ideas lcst type draw solutes using des 6 operated at ambient temperature and phase separation was carried out at 5 c and using il 100 operated at 55 c and phase separation was carried out at around 30 c the low freezing point behavior of glyceline and ethaline 40 c and 66 c respectively can be exploited to generate industrial grade ice the energy required for separating the water as ice is significantly less than that required to separate it by evaporation 110 this can generate pure water but it is worth highlighting that energy cost of chilling is high the system can be optimized by doing necessary energy calculations in all the above mentioned methods further polishing of water rich phase becomes a necessity for pure water recovery the factors which determine the type of polishing requirement include the end use toxicity of the draw solutes and energy cost in most of the cases this can be possible by uf nf or low pressure ro 5 bar 111 114 depending on the mw of the draw solutes all these processes are low energy intensive process where alternative energy sources can be useful in these cases less expensive form of energy like low grade heat or solar energy can be utilized this is possible in industry where lot of waste heat is available usage of low grade heat is being explored extensively for economical thermal recovery of draw solutes md involves low capital cost if it utilizes low grade heat 27 105 solar energy should be utilized effectively for the regeneration of both conventional and temperature sensitive draw solutes 27 studies have shown that the enthalpy of phase separation of these responsive ionic liquid draw solutes is in the range of 3 5 kj kg which is substantially low making them very attractive 5 5 economic aspects fo process does not need any external driving force to occur the major operating cost involves energy costs for draw solute separation with recycle along with pumping costs the operating cost also involves periodic maintenance cost incurred in fouling control replenishment of draw solute etc most of the des constituents can be derived from bio based resources and are generally available in abundance they are available in the market as well at very reasonable bulk rates ch cl 1 kg eg 1 kg glycerol 3 kg urea 0 25 kg malonic acid 10 kg the major advantage of des over il is that they are easier to prepare with high purity at a relatively low cost as mentioned above being low temperature operation energy requirement of fo process along with recovery of draw solute can be provided by low grade heat or solar energy thus replacing costly electrical energy low cost sedimentation techniques can be used to carry out majority of the phase separation in the regeneration process expensive electrical energy is only required for polishing of the water rich phase cai et al showed that the electrical energy required in fo seawater desalination using p4444dmbs draw solute is only 0 17 kwhm 3 if separation cost of 50 dilute p4444dmbs draw solution by nanofiltration is included then total electrical energy required comes around 1 8 kwhm 3 95 the theoretical thermodynamic minimum energy of desalination for seawater at 35 000 ppm salt concentration and at a typical recovery of 50 is 1 09 kwhm 3 115 thus if it is assumed that low grade energy is utilized the net electrical energy requirement is 63 more than theoretical minimum in case of ro actual theoretical minimum is 1 56 kwhm 3 and a state of the art sea water ro plants operate at around 2 kwhm 3 the actual energy requirement in ro can be as high as 3 4 kwhm 3 116 similarly zhong et al showed that upto 70 reduction in electricity consumption can be achieved by using a fo ro nf combination if renewable energy is used 100 so if low grade heat can be utilized fo could be commercially competitive in addition to this other benefits of fo process need to utilized to its full potential fo process has low fouling propensity the fouling films are loose in case of fo and normal backwashing is sufficient to reverse the fouling phenomenon 28 even biofouling of the membrane in seawater desalination is less severe in case of fo compared to ro 117 low fouling tendency may lessen or eradicate the need for pretreatment of feed and chemical cleaning protocol of membrane which can reduce costs in this area fo has a technical edge making it competitive with ro technology 118 however more long term pilot plant studies need to be undertaken to get the true picture 18 if we consider all the cases the overall temperature band of fo process and draw solute regeneration range between 5 c and 60 c the ambient temperature being almost in between keeping this in mind the prevailing local environment conditions can be also exploited for making the overall process economically competitive in hot countries the natural high temperature can be utilized to perform fo operation using ucst type ils which can be cooled or chilled using energy to get separation similarly in cold countries the fo system can be operated at elevated temperatures using ucst type ils which can be naturally cooled to get phase separation similar reverse approach can be undertaken for lcst type ils as shown in fig 5 a detailed energy calculation will be helpful in selecting the proper draw solute 6 potential application of il des in fo thermally responsive ils and dess have good potentials to be exploited as draw solutes for fo desalination these draw solutes can extract water from brine with high salinity of 1 6 m nacl however the water flux rates were reported to be less than 10 l m 2 h 1 thus providing a scope for improvement at the same time the reported rsf were also low the diluted draw solutions could undergo liquid liquid phase separation at near ambient temperatures the il rich sediment phase can be directly recycled as draw solution without further treatment while the low concentration water rich supernatant can be treated by low pressure membrane operations like uf or nf in most of the cases il and des except pei derivatives and glycol ethers could retain the osmotic potential even after significant dilution which leads to more number of recycle both the fo operating temperature and draw solute generation have been demonstrated to be operable between 5 to 60 c which are near ambient and low temperature operation the selection of draw solutes lcst or ucst must be judicious depending on the prevailing ambient conditions fig 5 in gulf countries the prevailing hot conditions can be utilized for fo process using ucst type draw solutes which can be then cooled chilled for phase separation dess are combination of an organic salt and a hydrogen bond donor ch cl is the most common halide salt of quaternary ammonium used as it is cheap non toxic and bio degradable it is extracted from biomass and is used as additives in bird and animal feed to boost productivity 119 the hydrogen bond donors which are studied and considered include ethylene glycol acetic acid glycerol oxalic acid malonic acid and so on table 2 these dess are mostly non toxic even making them suitable as food and pharmaceutical ingredients this can be observed from their usage profile like eg is an anti freezing agent glycerol a food additive malonic acid is used as a pharmaceutical ingredient to control acidity and also as natural preservative additive for foods urea apart from being a fertilizer is used as animal feed dermatological products and as additive in many products dess are considered as non volatile organic solvents and not flammable hence they can be handled and stored easily these type of dess can be used as draw solutions for dewatering process 6 they offer significant technological benefits and can be applied to product sensitive industries such as biomedical food processing and pharmaceutical 7 concluding remarks one of the significant dimensions in fo research is the selection of a draw solute which can generate high osmotic potential with minimum rsf and can be easily regenerated using minimum energy though very little work has been reported on il and des as draw solutes the results indicate that this new class of thermally responsive draw solutes can generate high osmotic potential resulting in appreciable water fluxes which can be retained even after dilution fo along with regeneration can be carried out at near ambient temperatures thereby making the process less energy extensive even inexpensive forms of energy such as low grade heat or solar energy can also be used to make the whole process economical thus fo with il des as draw solutes has immense potential to be utilized for desalination being low temperature operations they can be used for dewatering of thermal sensitive products as well however more work is needed in pilot plant scale to fine tune the operational parameters successful outcomes can be further extended for treatment of difficult to treat streams such as ro brine and other produced water including industrial waste streams or product streams from mining and oil exploration activities having lower fouling propensity and higher fouling reversibility compared to ro fo does not require extensive pretreatment of feed and frequent chemical cleaning of membrane nevertheless a more detailed and long term parametric study on the difference in mechanism and extent of fouling in fo compared to ro needs to be undertaken the economic benefits of prolonged membrane life also need to be investigated rigorously it is important to note that the first generation fo membrane i e the cta membrane by hti inc was only used initially by mok et al and nakayama et al for il based draw solutions all the other reported works thereafter find the use of second generation polyamide tfc membranes provided by hti inc or indigenously developed with better performance to reduce the viscosity of draw solutes and particularly in case of ucst draw solutes it may be necessary to operate fo at slightly higher temperatures the long term membrane stability operating at higher temperature conditions for prolonged period needs to be analyzed there is still scope of fine tuning the issue of rsf by increasing the selectivity of membrane active layer tfc membrane with modest water permeability high active layer selectivity inert surface chemistry and very low structural parameter may be the need of future recent development of inorganic membranes based on zeolite aquaporins and graphene can also be checked for potential application in fo process custom designed membranes for specific application may be also the solution especially for difficult feed solutions in case of draw solutions dess have shown distinct advantages over ils in the form of i ease of synthesis ii low price and iii low toxicity especially dess derived from ch cl and renewable chemicals dess are also environment friendly with no serious disposal problems des may be especially suitable for dewatering of sensitive products such as pharmaceutical and food products as they are non toxic des like reline maline and acetaline can be immediately taken up to check their potential as draw solutes reline has very good and favorable solvent properties reline and maline has freezing point of 12 c and 10 c which makes them suitable for ambient temperature operation for ucst type des chilling process can be used to recover the draw solute or water based on the freezing point temperature hence it can be concluded that although research in fo still has a long way to go nevertheless green shoots are already visible most of the work reported so far are preliminary laboratory scale studies showing encouraging results which needs to be carried forward in case of pilot plant studies and commercial applications prolonged operational data need to be collected and studied to check long term stability of fo process a proper combination of imagination along with intelligent economics can make this technology successful in near future 
14612,forward osmosis fo can aptly contribute to increased water reuse at the expense of low energy expenditure the distinctive feature for fo lies with the exploitation of the natural osmotic pressure gradient generated by a concentrated draw solution for water transport across a semi permeable membrane the selection of a suitable draw solution remains to be a grey area of commercial development of fo process the present review summarizes the importance of ionic liquid il and deep eutectic solvent des with natural product components and their potential as draw solutions in fo and their industrial applications various factors affecting performances of ils and dess as draw solutions are briefly assessed and critically compared with pertinent literature regeneration of il and des as spent solution from the process as well as pure water recovery is discussed with special reference to heat energy optimization a future pathway for research in il and des as draw solute and their economic aspects are also highlighted keywords forward osmosis draw solution ionic liquids deep eutectic solvent critical solution temperature nomenclature lle liquid liquid extraction ed extractive

nades natural deep eutectic solvent lcst lower critical solution temperature ucst upper critical solution temperature 1 introduction forward osmosis fo despite being old in its concept has spurred a renewed interest both academically and commercially in last two decades being natural clean and ecofriendly process fo has remarkable potential in substituting or complementing many conventional separation systems fo finds its increasing applications in the domains of desalination irrigation power regeneration pharmaceutical and protein concentration water reuse osmotic membrane bio reactor and enhanced oil recovery 1 2 in this process a semipermeable membrane is positioned in between two solutions of different concentrations more precisely of different osmotic pressure a concentrated solution draw solution and a dilute solution feed solution the concentration difference between the two solutions generates the required osmotic potential which provides the driving force to extract fresh water from a feed solution such as seawater brine or any wastewater dilute product solution on the other side of the membrane as a result the process can concentrate a solution of lower osmotic pressure with that of a higher osmotic pressure forward osmosis is endowed with a number of benefits to its credit these include high salt rejection less susceptibility to membrane fouling and above all the requirement of less hydraulic pressure compared to their pressure driven counterparts the selection of a safe efficient and inexpensive draw solution plays an important role in the progress of the fo process a good draw solution should not only be capable of generating high osmotic potential but also be easily recoverable however to make fo process commercially competitive with other established separation processes some of the key issues like low water flux rates reverse solute flux rsf concentration polarization cp and energy efficient recovery of draw solutes also need to be addressed adequately interestingly most of the issues related to cp and rsf are dependent on both membrane structure and draw solute properties there is a strong correlation between the choice of draw solutes and progress of fo membranes research 3 synthetic draw solutes with tailor made properties are being regularly developed and tested for their suitability as draw solutes however the results are met with limited success numerous inorganic compounds have been reported and explored in membrane literature as potential candidates for draw solutions 4 5 nonetheless many of these compounds have exhibited a high reverse draw solute flux or are expensive to recycle leave aside their toxic potency at times therefore the search for a compatible and efficient draw solution assumes paramount importance in view of the wider industrial acceptance of forward osmosis ionic liquids il and deep eutectic solvents des also referred to as bio ionic liquids are lately touted as green solvents to be used in a variety of separation processes these are a few of the latest class of draw solutes which has caught researchers attention des like choline chloride ethylene glycol ch cl eg and choline chloride glycerol ch cl glycerol has been attempted as potential draw solutes 6 they have shown to possess high osmotic potential and can be easily recovered rendering better energy efficiency of the overall process they are also economically competitive and environmentally benign although there are quite a good number of reviews on various aspects of fo in recent literature encompassing membrane development area specific applications selection of draw solutions and few more applicability of il and des in particular as draw solution have not been surveyed so far this paper focuses on the amenability of il and des as draw solution and critically analyzes their applicability in forward osmosis systems with regard to concepts and key issues various physico chemical parameters governing the fo performance synthesis and recovery of draw solutes and economic aspects are adequately reviewed in the following sections in spite of limited work reported by researchers in using il and des in fo process as draw solute the impetus for the present review was stimulated firstly by the wide application potential of il and des as new generation eco friendly solvents and secondly to obtain a further insight into the direction of basic and applied research in the area of fo 2 fo membrane and draw solution fo membranes similar to their ro counterparts generally contain two layers a selective active thin layer and a porous support layer the active layer is mainly responsible for salt rejection and the support layer provides the necessary mechanical strength to engineer the module the two major desirable properties of a successful fo membrane are high solute rejection propensity and high water flux it is very difficult to provide these two properties at the same time the other desirable properties include minimal concentration polarization long term mechanical stability and resistance to various ph environments since the pioneering development of modern fo membranes by hydration technologies inc hti albany or a lot of research work on fo has been reported in literature 1 cellulose triacetate cta fo membranes fabricated by hti inc is credited with high water flux performance but reportedly suffers from high rsf in case of smaller solutes 7 to mitigate the problem a thin film composite tfc fo membranes which exhibit reduced rsf without compromising the flux rates 8 9 could be used researchers have been working actively in developing tfc membranes for enhancing the performance of fo process further 10 draw solution has another dominant role to play in fo processes a good draw solution should be capable of generating high osmotic pressure 11 and simultaneously be easily recoverable however these two requirements are self conflicting as good osmotic potential needs strong affiliation between the draw solute and water molecules e g via hydration or ionization which subsequently makes recovery process difficult 5 on the other hand it should also have essential solvent characteristics like wide availability high solubility minimal toxicity non reactivity and above all low cost search for an ideal draw solution constitutes a major focus of fo research considering the diversity of feed streams to be treated it may not be possible for a single universal draw solution to become a panacea to treat all type of feed streams draw solutes are broadly classified into two groups compounds that are commercially available and structurally modified synthetic compounds fig 1 the commercially available compounds include inorganic salts like nacl mgso4 nahco3 khco3 k2so4 nh4 2so4 na2so4 etc organic salts like sodium acetate sodium formate magnesium acetate sodium propionate etc volatile compounds like nh3 co2 gas mixture so2 etc nutrient compounds like glucose and fructose fertilizers like urea nh4cl etc and polymers the synthetic compounds developed by carious researchers show great potential as draw solutes these include hydrophilic magnetic nanoparticles mnps polyelectrolytes like polyacrylic acid sodium paa na salts hydroacid complexes switchable polarity solvents spss like mixtures of carbon dioxide water and tertiary amines deep eutectic solvent des like choline chloride ethylene glycol choline chloride glycerol etc polymer hydrogels dual responsive polymers etc more and more synthetic compounds are being tested for application in fo as draw solutes yet another classification of draw solution can be made on the basis of the recovery methods of draw solute here the draw solutes are classified as responsive and non responsive 5 to some external stimuli the non responsive draw solutes include the commercially available compounds mentioned above while the responsive draw solutes are mostly the synthetic compounds which give response to some kind of stimuli these can be further categorized based on type of stimuli like thermal pressure magnetic field and so on despite the extensive research efforts devoted in the pursuit of identifying novel draw solutes simple dissolved inorganic and thermolytic salts e g nacl 12 14 mgcl2 15 etc are the most popular and widely used for various applications also they are probably the most effective draw solutes 16 reported so far around 40 of research work has been reported using nacl as draw solution because of its abundant availability high solubility non toxicity and being inexpensive 2 nacl generate high osmotic pressures at low solution viscosities and have high diffusivities but suffer from rsf problem researchers are still trying to improve the performance of nacl draw solutes 17 nevertheless nacl 2 m and 3 m remains to be the benchmark for the performance of draw solutes as none of the commercially available non responsive draw solutes could show satisfactory performance with respect to all the above mentioned parameters and recovery method the research focus has now been shifted to the development of synthetic draw solutes with tailored properties synthetic materials which are highly soluble in water and form homogenous solutions show better performance as draw solution however the rsf should be maintained within the acceptable limits 3 2 1 recovery of draw solute the recovery and recycle of draw solute is of prime importance as both of these require expenditure of energy this is one of the grey areas of fo research and development recovery of draw solute is necessary because of two important reasons viz loss of draw solute needs costly replenishment and in most application pure water is recovered as a product so high level of separation is an essential prerequisite of a commercial fo process this can be achieved by using thermal separation process like heating membrane process like reverse osmosis ro 18 nanofiltration nf 12 19 ultrafiltration uf 13 membrane distillation md 14 20 electrodialysis ed 21 precipitation using chemicals like ca oh 2 ba oh 2 22 external stimulus like magnetic field 23 sunlight heat combined with hydraulic pressure in addition synergic combination of two or more process like precipitation magnetic field 24 precipitation thermal hot ultrafiltration 25 integrated electric field nf system 26 etc have also been explored to optimize the overall energy consumption numerous methods for draw solute recovery have been attempted by the researchers 27 the choice of recovery methods depends largely on two major factors namely the amount of energy required and the extent of separation of draw solutes from the solution a highly efficient recovery method demands minimum energy consumption and maximum draw solute recovery which in turn ensures maximum pure water recovery all the recovery methods reported in literature could achieve fairly high degree of separation however at the expense of high energy consumption certainly the conventional separation methods would not live up to the expectation in making solute recovery energy efficient in order to make fo competitive alternative options are being suggested in the form of responsive draw solutes which may consume less direct energy 24 or less expensive form of energy like low grade heat or solar energy 27 this could be possible in industry where lot of waste heat is available the other option is to make an optimum economic balance between draw solute recovery cost replenishment cost and cost of fresh water generated in remote application like treatment of effluent generated on site during oil and gas drilling operation fo has been demonstrated to be effective in osmotic dilution mode 18 28 fo is used to recover part of water from drilling waste streams a balance is made in generating local reusable water source onsite thereby limiting fresh water and wastewater transport nacl is used as draw solute which does not need costly replenishment 29 30 in fertigation process fertilizers like urea nh4cl nh4no3 kcl nh4h2po4 etc are used as a drawing agent and the resulting dilute fertilizer can be used for irrigation instead of recovering osmotic dilution mode 31 32 in the commercial application of fo the focus is more on making fo process economically competitive by harping on the drawbacks of other technologies in most cases ro rather than improving the fo process itself also intelligent process design and optimization have enabled hybrid fo systems commercially implementable 33 researchers in fo community are convinced that a breakthrough in either membrane side or draw solute side can be made in near future thereby rendering the fo process directly competitive with other separation processes exploration of ils and dess as potential draw solutes may be a step towards that direction 2 2 concentration polarization concentration polarization cp is one of the major reasons which contribute to decrease in the net driving force osmotic pressure based on the position where cp occurs it can be classified into two categories external concentration polarization ecp and internal concentration polarization icp icp phenomenon occurs inside the porous support layer due to the opposite diffusion of water and solutes it is the most challenging phenomenon which occurs in fo processes as it cannot be easily eradicated the decline in water flux in fo process is predominantly caused by icp 7 and the flux reduction can be very high in some cases up to 80 3 icp is caused by the gradual dilution of the draw solution and the gradual concentration of the feed solution inside the membrane with solvent permeating from the feed side to the draw solution continuously and in absence of any external turbulence the draw solute concentration at the surface of membrane gradually becomes lower than its bulk concentration and correspondingly the feed concentration at the surface of membrane increasingly becomes higher than its bulk concentration this leads to net reduction in concentration difference between the two sides as the concentration difference between the draw and feed solution is the only driving force hence any reduction in the net concentration difference tends to slow down the process this effect is somewhat analogous to the reduction in available temperature difference driving force in an evaporator due to boiling point elevation of the solution to alleviate the problems of icp the support layer for fo membrane should be as thin as possible with high porosity and low tortuosity 34 a major spotlight in fo research is development of fo membranes with high permeability and high hydrophilicity combined with low structure parameter to tackle the issue of cp 35 draw solutes that have high diffusivities give rise to higher water flux thereby decreasing the effect of icp on the contrary ecp phenomenon occurs at the outer surface of the membrane active layer it merits mentioning that incorporating methods like increase of flow turbulence or calculated augmentation of water flux can substantially alleviate the effect of ecp on permeate flux 36 2 3 reverse solute flux the occurrence of rsf adversely affects the performance of fo process and lead to other problems it is one of the major parameters which determine the selection of draw solutes it not only diminishes the driving force 2 but also contaminates the feed solution e g dewatering in addition it also causes the loss of precious draw solute this in turn tends to increase the replenishment cost of the draw solute for example if fo technology is applied in dewatering of dilute proteins or pharmaceuticals using brine as draw solution the rsf phenomenon may contaminate these products salt sensitiveness could even result into denaturation of products also high rsf could lead to severe membrane fouling 37 although small molecular size draw solutes generate high water flux but these suffer from high rsf small size solutes like nacl are more prone to rsf while larger solutes like polymer and nanoparticle based draw solutions has the advantage of essentially eliminating rsf while selecting draw solutes the process designer generally should make a trade off between small solute size to limit icp and large solute size to decrease rsf 36 the advent and expected commercialization of highly selective tfc fo membranes may promote the use of small highly mobile solutes and decrease the need for exploring draw solutes with larger molecular size a major part of research in fo process constitutes exploring draw solutes with low rsf 20 38 2 4 applicability of fo fo has a remarkable potential in reclamation of complex wastewater streams generated from diverse areas of operation fo applications encompass osmotic dilution prior to desalination water recovery from wastewater fertigation emergency water supply in military space and humanitarian aid and treatment of high salinity brines fo is generally most viable in the scenarios of highly saline solutions where other methods of water recovery become operationally unsuitable or in situations where the draw solution can be directly used for beneficial purposes it could also be useful in the dilution of a high salinity feed stream with a low salinity waste stream more and more applications of osmotic dilution mode are being explored where fo is increasingly recognized as an effective technique 18 it can be used in remote areas where availability of energy is an issue here fo systems using low grade energy could be highly effective generation of potable water in portable devices using fo in water scarce areas has been already been reported 1 in industrial hubs the liquid effluents generated are often treated in common effluent treatment plant cetp these cetps often suffer from huge loads in some cases exceeding their capacity these cetp effluents are a very complex combination of effluents from various industries resulting in a mixture very difficult to treat in such cases fo could be particularly useful it has been demonstrated that in treatment and desalination of high fouling complex industrial streams and wastewater generated by mining and oil and gas exploration activities 39 fo process is proven to be beneficial 29 39 in addition fo can be used to pretreat the feed to the ro system running a closed loop draw solution re concentrated by ro in a complementary process 40 in such applications fo can protect the ro system ensuing less frequent cleaning protocols thus prolonging the ro membrane life in standalone chemical process plants concentration and dilution of process streams may occur simultaneously at different places fo could be suitable for doing both these operations in one step with very low energy consumption for example fo process could be used for dewatering of effluent streams by using a concentrated stream from the same industry which needs dilution satisfactory results could be anticipated by doing proper stream networking along with some reorientation in pumping requirements similar to energy mass integration concentration integration could become the next promising area 3 ionic liquids il ionic liquids ils are salts that have low melting point thereby making them liquid at low temperature typically less than 100 c at atmospheric pressure they have favorable properties such as negligible vapor pressure non volatile high ionic conductivity high solubility non flammability chemical and thermal stability 41 rendering them ideal candidates for numerous industrial applications being non volatile they have potential to replace many harmful traditional volatile organic compounds as solvent thus earning the tag of green solvent 42 43 some of the undesirable properties of ils like high viscosity combustible character poor biodegradability and high cost of production has been reported and discussed in literature 41 however the major advantage that made ils popular is the numerous structural possibilities that can be achieved by tweaking the alkyl chain and the anionic precursor in fact by suitable selection of cations and anions they can be tailored for specific applications ionic liquid and water can form homogenous solution and exhibits unique phase behavior there are two types of il water mixture based on the temperature at which mixture undergoes phase separation lower critical solution temperature lcst and upper critical solution temperature ucst in lcst type mixture the phase separation occurs at temperature above the lcst point while in ucst type mixture the phase separation occurs at temperature below the ucst point the phase separation generally results in an il rich phase and water rich phase ils are applied as electrolytes in battery and fuel cells 44 45 as catalytic agent in various chemical synthesis like biodiesel production 46 as solvents in extraction process 43 47 like separation of heavy metals 48 49 aromatics from pyrolytic sugars in bioethanol production 50 absorbents in gas separation 51 in membrane based separation process ils have been reportedly used as mobilizer in pervaporation membranes 52 as liquid membranes 53 for various separation processes lithium recovery from seawater using dialysis 54 and numerous other applications ils being a broad family its successful development as well as use is also marred with controversies in regard to toxicity and environmental concerns 55 hence developing new ils needs careful environment impact assessment in not doing so their industrial utilization may be restricted due to stringent environmental regulations 56 in the quest to develop green solvents which are also commercially viable a new class of ils known as deep eutectic solvents has come into limelight 3 1 deep eutectic solvents des deep eutectic solvent des s are a class of ils they cannot be strictly defined as ils as they are mixtures whereas ils are single salts they are eutectic mixture of lewis or bronsted acids and bases that can contain a variety of anionic and or cationic species having melting point significantly less than the individual components for example the melting point of pure choline chloride ch cl and urea is 302 c and 134 c respectively whereas ch cl urea mixture in 2 1 molar ratio which forms an eutectic solvent has freezing point of 12 c fig 2 which is substantially less than the individual components 57 they are obtained by the complexation of a quaternary ammonium salt with a metal salt or hydrogen bond donor different categories of des are summarized in table 1 the term deep eutectic solvent was coined initially to describe type 3 eutectics but has subsequently been used to describe all of the eutectic mixtures 58 the wide array of choice of hydrogen bond donor makes it easier to develop dess with required properties the same characteristics and properties which make ils attractive for industrial application are also shared by dess dess exhibit negligible vapor pressure non volatile high ionic conductivity high solubility non flammability bio degradability chemical and thermal stability making them highly acceptable as solvents catalysts and absorbents for various applications table 3 over and above they are cheap environmentally benign and easy to manufacture making them a viable alternative for many existing commercial application 42 58 59 choline chloride ch cl is the most common quaternary ammonium organic salt used as it is cheap non toxic and bio degradable it has a choline cation with a chloride anion iupac name 2 hydroxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride it is regarded as a component of vitamin b complex and can be extracted from biomass abbott et al was the first to report des based on ch cl and urea 1 2 molar ratio in 2003 57 other salts such as imidazolium ammonium and phosphonium based ones have also been studied but to a lesser extent similarly a variety of hydrogen bond donors like ethylene glycol acetic acid glycerol oxalic acid malonic acid etc other than urea has been studied and reported in literature fig 3 presents chemical structure of some compounds that can be commonly used to form des it is to be noted that not all ratios of the individual components can form a des some of the commercially available dess are shown in table 2 a lot of dess is still being developed and reported in search of favorable properties which can be applied in suitable area 60 66 dess are used as solvents 67 76 entrainers 77 78 catalysts 79 82 in electrochemistry 83 84 as absorbents 85 and in numerous other ways to a wide variety of industries widespread application of dess is continuously being explored and reported in literature a short overview of the potential of des in various fields is presented in table 3 3 2 natural deep eutectic solvents nades when the compounds that constitute the des are primary metabolites namely amino acids organic acids sugars or choline derivatives the des are termed as natural deep eutectic solvents nades 59 dai et al 86 has demonstrated over 100 combinations of nades which has useful properties especially in terms of solubility they also demonstrated the possibility of the formation of ternary deep eutectic solvents tdes which can be explored and tweaked to improve their properties towards their targeted applications also addition of water in small quantity to some nadess exhibit favorable property change e g glycerol ch cl at 2 1 ratio has viscosity 222 cp at 25 c whereas glycerol ch cl water at 2 1 1 ratio has viscosity of 51 3 cp at 40 c 6 58 86 this shows that addition of small amounts of water to glyceline reduced viscosity still preserving its essential characteristics moreover the toxicity profile of nadess in general seems to be relatively less acute than their dess parents 87 henceforth in this paper des will include nades for discussion purpose unless otherwise mentioned 3 3 preparation of il des nades the synthesis of ionic liquids is generally a two step process the first step constitutes the formation of the desired cation which is synthesized either by the protonation of the amine by an acid or through quaternization reactions of amine with a haloalkane followed by heating in the second step anion exchange reactions are carried out by treatment of halide salts with lewis acids to form lewis acid based ionic liquids or by anion metathesis 88 the most extensively studied and used lewis acid based ionic liquids are alcl3 based salts such salts involve simple mixing of the lewis acid and the halide salt which results in the formation of more than one anionic species aletcl2 bcl3 cucl incl3 etc are other lewis acids used apart from alcl3 anion metathesis is popular choice 89 for the preparation of water and air stable ionic liquids based upon 1 3 dialkylimidazolium cations this method involves the treatment of the halide salt with the ag na k salts of no2 no3 bf4 so4 2 etc with the free acid of the appropriate anion advanced techniques like microwave irradiation and ultrasound waves are used nowadays to enhance yield and shorten reaction time recent introduction of one pot synthetic protocols reduce the cost and improve efficiency 88 the preparation method of each il is different and more complicated than des the presence of heavy metal precursors creates toxicity concerns and environmental issues in addition they may aggravate the rsf issue by contamination feed solution in dewatering applications in this aspect des has advantage synthesis of dess is almost 100 atom economic 41 easy to handle and no purification is required thus making their large scale use feasible 58 the preparation of des does not involve any complicated process and can be easily manufactured in laboratory dess can be obtained by proper mixing of a hydrogen bond acceptor hba and a hydrogen bond donor hbd at a suitable temperature a large number of different compounds have been attempted as hba and hbd for the synthetic preparation of des the most common hba is ch cl while urea glycerol citric acid and ethylene glycol are common hbds from 2003 since abott discovered the first des 57 the heating method is the most simple and popular method of preparation of des this method is not only cheaper but also safer considering that the components are usually thermally unstable similar to the case of sugars or amino acids in this method a mixture of hba and hbd is mixed with moderate heating and continuous stirring for a couple of hours till a homogenous and colorless des is formed in liquid form for example ch cl and eg in 1 2 molar ratio is mixed and heated at 80 c with continuous stirring for around 2 h to form ethaline in case of nades similar procedure can be followed at even lower temperature of 50 c with addition of small amount of water 86 an alternative and easy procedure for des preparation from aqueous solutions by freeze drying method was proposed by gutíerrez et al 90 in this method urea and ch cl at a 2 1 molar ratio with 5 solute content on weight basis was prepared by mixing separate aqueous solutions of urea and ch cl the mixed solutions were then frozen at 196 c and 20 c followed by freeze drying to produce a clear viscous des other methods of preparation of des are also reported in literature the grinding method which has been largely explored in the preparation of dess for pharmaceutical purposes consists in mixing the two components and then grinding them in a mortar with a pestle at room temperature until a homogeneous liquid is formed 91 in vacuum evaporation method the components are dissolved in water and evaporated at 50 c with a rotary evaporator the liquid obtained was put in a desiccator with silica gel till they reached a constant weight all the methods by and large show the same chemical profile for the obtained des 86 4 il des and nades as draw solute performance check performance of various draw solutions in fo process is well documented in membrane literature 3 5 a potential draw solute should primarily be able to generate high osmotic potential and should be easily recovered of late ils and dess are explored as draw solute in fo process and the results are encouraging il and des as a category fall under responsive draw solutes using heat as a stimulus for regeneration and recycle of draw solutes both lcst and ucst type ils are used as draw solute depending on whether the solution is lcst or ucst the solution is either heated or cooled beyond its critical point to form a draw solute rich and a water rich phases gravity separation techniques can be used to carry out bulk of the phase separation 11 the draw solute rich phase is recycled back to the fo system while the water rich phase is further polished by ro or nf process to generate pure water as shown in fig 4 retained osmolality of the dilute draw solution and the number of recycles that can be undertaken are the two important considerations in the ds rich phase in the water rich phase the ease of separation of draw solute from water determines the additional energy consumption and in turn cost of separation it is worth mentioning that conventional thermal recovery of draw solutes is well reported and unanimously agreed to be uneconomical thermal recovery can be only viable when it is carried out at moderate temperatures using low grade heat solar heat heat as a stimulus for responsive draw solutes has been discussed for other types of draw solutes such as volatile solutes 92 dual responsive polymer hydrogel 93 94 and water soluble polyelectrolytes 25 properties of lcst type have been exploited for regeneration and recycle in case of some polymer hydrogels 93 use of il as draw agent is briefly mentioned recently in review literature 3 5 cai et al reported the energy efficient desalination by forward osmosis using responsive ionic liquid draw solute 95 preliminary work on lcst type draw solutes has been carried out by mok et al 2013 96 97 they studied tri n butyrylated tris 2 aminoethyl amine nbu taea mw 356 and n butyrylatedpolyethylenimine nbu pei mw 1238 solutions as possible lcst type draw solute these draw solutes could display very stable phase separation behavior above lcst due to their uniform mw the nbu taea draw solutes reported osmotic flux less than 1 l m 2 h 1 up to 2 m concentration to draw water from 0 6 m nacl and the nbu pei draw solute showed osmotic flux less than 1 l m 2 h 1 at 0 49 m concentration against 0 15 m nacl both the draw solutes suffer from low osmotic flux which is hardly enough to draw water from artificial sea water solution however the residual solute concentrations in the water rich phase were low at 0 22 and 0 052 mol l 1 for nbu taea and nbu pei respectively the rejection efficiency was 98 and 99 6 for nbu taea and nbu pei respectively owing to high mw of the draw solutes the phase transition temperature was reported to be 31 32 c and was found suitable a similar type of work was reported by nakayama et al 2014 98 using various glycol ethers as lcst type draw solute a 12 m di ethylene glycol n hexyl ether deh draw solution reported osmotic flux 0 62 l m 2 h 1 to draw water from 0 6 m nacl solution which was considerably low water rich phase contained 0 081 m deh the phase transition temperature was 20 c and the whole fo process could be operated in between 10 c to 30 c cta membranes provided by hti inc were used in both the cases cai et al reported use of three ils namely tetrabutylphosphonium 2 4 dimethylbenzenesulfonate p4444dmbs tetrabutylphosphoniummesitylenesulfonate p4444tmbs and tributyloctyl phosphonium bromide p4448br as draw solution to draw water from sea water and brackish water 95 the osmolality of the ils was reported to be very high the osmolality of 70 wt solution was 5 4 osmol kg 1 for p4444dmbs and 3 6 osmol kg 1 for p4444tmbs which was 4 5 and 3 times of seawater s osmolality respectively even after dilution they could retain much of their osmolality p4444dmbs and p4444tmbs osmolality values of their 30 wt 0 95 mol kg 1 solutions were reported at 1 34 osmol kg 1 and 1 08 osmol kg 1 respectively p4448br demonstrated lower osmolality and hence could draw water only from low salinity feed solutions the 70 wt p4444dmbs draw solution could generate a water flux of 1 5 l m 2 h 1 against a feed of 1 2 m nacl at 14 1 c the draw ability has been found to increase with decreasing temperature additionally these ds demonstrated low rsf below 30 mg l 1 after fo process the diluted 50 wt draw solution underwent liquid liquid phase separation at a temperature above its lcst 30 50 c a very mild temperature stimulus of about 35 and 40 c could result in stable phase separation for p4444tmbs and p4444dmbs respectively in a wide range of il concentration between 10 and 60 at 55 c stable phase separation occurred containing 70 il rich phase and 7 5 il lean phase the lean phase contained less than 10 draw solute concentration and high quality water was obtained by nanofiltration process the retentate in nf along with the ds rich phase were recycled back without any further treatment a prepared tfc membrane was used in the process a patent application has been filed 99 zhong et al 100 used 3 2 m solution of protonated betainebis trifluoromethylsulfonyl imide hbet tf2n which was a ucst type ionic liquid to extract water from a feed up to 3 0 m nacl solution a bwro type polyamide membrane ym70acsp18 from toray inc was used for the fo process the fo process was carried out at 60 c but subsequently cooled down to room temperature for phase separation at room temperature of 23 c the saturation concentration of hbet tf2n was approximately 3 2 mol l 1 88 3 wt in the il rich phase and 0 36 mol l 1 13 7 wt in water rich phase the water flux was very low 1 l m 2 h 1 which further decreased with increase in feed concentration a very low rsf 1 mmol l 1 was reported in the process increase of temperature was observed to have a positive effect on water flux the relatively high saturation concentration of hbet tf2n in water rich phase needed ro process for further purification a group of scientists from csir csmcri bhavnagar india mondal et al 2015 reported the use of des as draw solute for dewatering process to enrich low abundant dna and proteins 6 the fo process reported by the group used ch cl eg 1 2 and ch cl glycerol 1 2 as draw solution and brackish water as feed solution an indigenously developed tfc polyamide membrane was used a nominal flow rate of 1 8 lpm and feed inlet pressure of 1 atm was maintained on both sides ch cl eg and ch cl glycerol could generate very high osmotic pressure of 365 atm and 317 atm respectively the osmotic potential could be retained π 150 atm after 50 dilution and π 60 atm after 80 dilution due to retention of osmotic potential the draw solution could be recycled for a longer time both the draw solute showed high flux values of 7 85 and 3 71 l m 2 h 1 atm 1 respectively draw solute was recovered by chilling at 5 c presence of choline 2000 5000 mg l 1 was reported in the recovered water however no further polishing was carried out in another experiment the same group used the same fo system for concentration of proteins and dna they could achieve more than 6 fold protein concentration and more than 3 fold dna concentration in both cases ch cl eg 1 2 was used as draw agent an average flux of 3 10 l m 2 h 1 and 4 67 l m 2 h 1 was reported for dna concentration and protein enrichment respectively no loss of dna or protein was reported even there was no denaturation of dna signifying the absence of rsf the diluted ethaline draw solution was chilled at 5 c to recover good quality product water and draw solution which could be reused the recovered dilute ethaline 20 was reused for three times without significant reduction of flux 101 4 1 osmotic potential and water flux an overview of all the fo processes using il and des as draw solution is presented in table 4 till now limited work has been reported in literature from the studies mentioned above it is found that des has melting point much below than the individual component in some of the cases even at room temperature e g reline tm 12 c which enable them to be used as an ambient temperature draw solute des such as ethaline π 365 atm and glyceline π 317 atm and il such as p4444dmbs π 5 4 osmol kg 1 and p4444tmbs π 3 6 osmol kg 1 reported high osmotic potential 6 95 a primary requirement of fo process it is worth mentioning that osmotic potential of sea water approx 0 6 m nacl is around 50 atm osmolality 1 2 osmol kg 1 if compared to 2 m nacl solution π 104 atm which is often considered as a benchmark of draw solution des exhibits significantly higher osmotic potential the density is comparable while the viscosity is significantly high table 5 shows the properties of some common des which has potential to be applied as draw solutes the osmotic potential generated by the draw solutes is dependent on number of factors like solute concentration molecular weight mw of the solute and the solution temperature the number of species formed by dissociation in the solution affects the osmotic potential but it is not dependent on the types of species formed it has been observed that draw solutes having low mw generate more osmotic potential 4 this can be verified by van t hoff equation eq 1 4 102 1 π i c r t where i is the van t hoff factor the number of moles of species formed by the dissociation of solutes in the solution c is the solute concentration in mol l 1 of solution r is the universal gas constant r 0 082 l atm mol k and t is the absolute temperature of the solution this equation is restricted to extremely dilute solutions and is generally used for the determination of large mw 103 for more general solutions the virial equation 4 104 can be used as shown in eq 2 2 π c r t 1 b c c c 2 d c 3 where b c and d are the osmotic virial coefficients the virial coefficients can be determined empirically by fitting experimental osmotic pressure data in general the determination of b and c is enough to reproduce observed data 103 thus a low mw solute with high water solubility will be able to generate higher osmotic pressure on equal mass basis resulting in high water fluxes 105 106 the reported values of water flux in some thermally responsive ionic liquids like nbu taea mw 356 nbu pei mw 1238 glycol ethers mw 200 and hbet tf2n mw 398 were found to be very low 1 l m 2 h 1 some of the il like p4444dmbs could generate high osmotic potential 5 4 osmol kg 1 and moderate water flux of 4 l m 2 h 1 with 1 6 m nacl feed solution this can be attributed to the ionic nature of these classes of responsive draw solutes 95 des like ethaline mw 88 and glyceline mw 108 show good water flux rates 4 8 l m 2 h 1 with brackish feed water in dewatering applications water flux of 3 4 5 l m 2 h 1 could be achieved with ethaline as des water fluxes obtained using ionic liquids are low compared to inorganic draw solutes the mw of the dess as mentioned in table 5 ranges from 80 to 125 g mol 1 which can be considered as low mw they are highly soluble in water in almost any ratio hence it is possible for these dess to generate high osmotic potential and consequently higher water flux rates even after dilution it is possible to retain the osmotic potential resulting in more number of recycle 6 4 2 icp effects the mw of the dess as mentioned in table 5 ranges from 80 to 125 g mol 1 low mw draw solutes have higher diffusion coefficient compared to those with larger mw draw solutes with high diffusion coefficient encounter lower resistance and can smoothly diffuse through the membrane support layer so these dess tend to have lower icp effects 4 this can be validated by eq 3 which is conveniently used to determine solute resistivity k within the porous support layer 1 36 105 3 k t τ ε d s where t is thickness τ is tortuosity and ε is porosity of the support layer ds is the diffusion coefficient of the draw solution minimizing the k value is one of the primary objectives of membrane manufacturers to improve the performance of forward osmosis processes the term t τ ε is known as the membrane structural parameter s high viscosity of solutions reduces the diffusion coefficient 3 all the des show high viscosity at 25 c however it has been demonstrated that addition of small quantities of water exhibit drastic reduction in viscosity in some dess 58 also small increase in temperature could considerably reduce the viscosity for example glycerol ch cl 2 1 has viscosity 222 cp at 25 c whereas glycerol ch cl water at 2 1 1 ratio has viscosity of 51 3 cp at 40 c 6 58 86 87 dai et al 2015 reported a decrease in viscosity from 397 to 7 2 cp following the addition of 25 of water in the case of glucose ch cl 2 5 the viscosity decreased by 1 3 when diluted with 5 water and decreased to one tenth of the original value with the addition of 10 water the viscosity of glucose ch cl 2 5 decreased by two third when the temperature increased from 20 to 40 c 86 the viscosity change is achieved without changing other essential characteristics of the des therefore usage of des as draw solutes can give the dual benefit of small mw and low viscosity which is extremely favorable as far as icp problem is concerned moreover recycling of the dilute des can add to reduction of viscosity ambient conditions of hot countries may be beneficial in further reduction of viscosity it was demonstrated that the des draw solutes could be recycled up to 3 times without much change in the water flux rates 6 4 3 reverse solute flux effects all the il and des based draw solutes reported to have low rsf cai et al reported rsf of about 30 mg l 1 for p4444dmbs and p4444tmbs 95 high rsf leads to loss of precious draw solute and also contaminates the feed solution in general high rsf is attributed to low mw draw solutes e g nacl 0 75 g l 1 and nh4hco3 2 g l 1 ils like p4444dmbs p4444tmbs and hbet tf2n has high mw nearby 0 4 g mol 1 approx which contribute to low rsf however low rsf in dess having mws ranging between 0 08 0 125 g mol 1 may be attributed to high reverse solute flux selectivity rsfs rsfs is defined as the ratio of water flux j w to reverse salt flux js in the fo process a higher rsfs indicates the increase in membrane selectivity which in turn increases the efficiency of the fo process this parameter is determined by the selectivity of the membrane active layer rsfs is independent of the membrane support layer properties 87 and can quantitatively describe the fo membrane performance as shown in eq 4 107 109 4 r s f s j w j s n a b r t where n is the number of dissolved species created by the draw solute t is the draw solution temperature and r is the universal gas constant a and b are water and solute permeability coefficient respectively to maximize rsfs the a b ratio must be maximized slightly higher temperatures could lead to an increase in rsfs by reducing the cp resistances of fo membrane both active layer and support layer and also by increasing the wettability within the effective porosity of the sl 109 it is to be noted that high rsfs is associated with decreased water permeability 4 4 recovery of il des nades draw solute and pure water recovery in case of il des nades recovery of draw solute is generally achieved by phase separation through thermal stimulation depending on whether the eutectic point is a lcst or ucst the draw solute rich phase is recycled back and water rich phase is further treated for high quality water recovery in all the fo experiments using il des nades as draw solutes the draw solute rich phase could have approximately 70 80 concentration which helps them retain enough osmotic potential to be recycled back in almost all the cases il and des except pei derivatives and glycol ethers could retain the osmotic potential even after significant dilution leading to more number of recycle up to three recycles can be achieved in batch systems beyond which the draw solute needs to be replenished in most cases the fo process are carried out at ambient temperatures in case of ucst type draw solutes the temperature rise necessary for phase separation is moderate up to 60 c which requires low energy this can be provided by alternate energy ideas lcst type draw solutes using des 6 operated at ambient temperature and phase separation was carried out at 5 c and using il 100 operated at 55 c and phase separation was carried out at around 30 c the low freezing point behavior of glyceline and ethaline 40 c and 66 c respectively can be exploited to generate industrial grade ice the energy required for separating the water as ice is significantly less than that required to separate it by evaporation 110 this can generate pure water but it is worth highlighting that energy cost of chilling is high the system can be optimized by doing necessary energy calculations in all the above mentioned methods further polishing of water rich phase becomes a necessity for pure water recovery the factors which determine the type of polishing requirement include the end use toxicity of the draw solutes and energy cost in most of the cases this can be possible by uf nf or low pressure ro 5 bar 111 114 depending on the mw of the draw solutes all these processes are low energy intensive process where alternative energy sources can be useful in these cases less expensive form of energy like low grade heat or solar energy can be utilized this is possible in industry where lot of waste heat is available usage of low grade heat is being explored extensively for economical thermal recovery of draw solutes md involves low capital cost if it utilizes low grade heat 27 105 solar energy should be utilized effectively for the regeneration of both conventional and temperature sensitive draw solutes 27 studies have shown that the enthalpy of phase separation of these responsive ionic liquid draw solutes is in the range of 3 5 kj kg which is substantially low making them very attractive 5 5 economic aspects fo process does not need any external driving force to occur the major operating cost involves energy costs for draw solute separation with recycle along with pumping costs the operating cost also involves periodic maintenance cost incurred in fouling control replenishment of draw solute etc most of the des constituents can be derived from bio based resources and are generally available in abundance they are available in the market as well at very reasonable bulk rates ch cl 1 kg eg 1 kg glycerol 3 kg urea 0 25 kg malonic acid 10 kg the major advantage of des over il is that they are easier to prepare with high purity at a relatively low cost as mentioned above being low temperature operation energy requirement of fo process along with recovery of draw solute can be provided by low grade heat or solar energy thus replacing costly electrical energy low cost sedimentation techniques can be used to carry out majority of the phase separation in the regeneration process expensive electrical energy is only required for polishing of the water rich phase cai et al showed that the electrical energy required in fo seawater desalination using p4444dmbs draw solute is only 0 17 kwhm 3 if separation cost of 50 dilute p4444dmbs draw solution by nanofiltration is included then total electrical energy required comes around 1 8 kwhm 3 95 the theoretical thermodynamic minimum energy of desalination for seawater at 35 000 ppm salt concentration and at a typical recovery of 50 is 1 09 kwhm 3 115 thus if it is assumed that low grade energy is utilized the net electrical energy requirement is 63 more than theoretical minimum in case of ro actual theoretical minimum is 1 56 kwhm 3 and a state of the art sea water ro plants operate at around 2 kwhm 3 the actual energy requirement in ro can be as high as 3 4 kwhm 3 116 similarly zhong et al showed that upto 70 reduction in electricity consumption can be achieved by using a fo ro nf combination if renewable energy is used 100 so if low grade heat can be utilized fo could be commercially competitive in addition to this other benefits of fo process need to utilized to its full potential fo process has low fouling propensity the fouling films are loose in case of fo and normal backwashing is sufficient to reverse the fouling phenomenon 28 even biofouling of the membrane in seawater desalination is less severe in case of fo compared to ro 117 low fouling tendency may lessen or eradicate the need for pretreatment of feed and chemical cleaning protocol of membrane which can reduce costs in this area fo has a technical edge making it competitive with ro technology 118 however more long term pilot plant studies need to be undertaken to get the true picture 18 if we consider all the cases the overall temperature band of fo process and draw solute regeneration range between 5 c and 60 c the ambient temperature being almost in between keeping this in mind the prevailing local environment conditions can be also exploited for making the overall process economically competitive in hot countries the natural high temperature can be utilized to perform fo operation using ucst type ils which can be cooled or chilled using energy to get separation similarly in cold countries the fo system can be operated at elevated temperatures using ucst type ils which can be naturally cooled to get phase separation similar reverse approach can be undertaken for lcst type ils as shown in fig 5 a detailed energy calculation will be helpful in selecting the proper draw solute 6 potential application of il des in fo thermally responsive ils and dess have good potentials to be exploited as draw solutes for fo desalination these draw solutes can extract water from brine with high salinity of 1 6 m nacl however the water flux rates were reported to be less than 10 l m 2 h 1 thus providing a scope for improvement at the same time the reported rsf were also low the diluted draw solutions could undergo liquid liquid phase separation at near ambient temperatures the il rich sediment phase can be directly recycled as draw solution without further treatment while the low concentration water rich supernatant can be treated by low pressure membrane operations like uf or nf in most of the cases il and des except pei derivatives and glycol ethers could retain the osmotic potential even after significant dilution which leads to more number of recycle both the fo operating temperature and draw solute generation have been demonstrated to be operable between 5 to 60 c which are near ambient and low temperature operation the selection of draw solutes lcst or ucst must be judicious depending on the prevailing ambient conditions fig 5 in gulf countries the prevailing hot conditions can be utilized for fo process using ucst type draw solutes which can be then cooled chilled for phase separation dess are combination of an organic salt and a hydrogen bond donor ch cl is the most common halide salt of quaternary ammonium used as it is cheap non toxic and bio degradable it is extracted from biomass and is used as additives in bird and animal feed to boost productivity 119 the hydrogen bond donors which are studied and considered include ethylene glycol acetic acid glycerol oxalic acid malonic acid and so on table 2 these dess are mostly non toxic even making them suitable as food and pharmaceutical ingredients this can be observed from their usage profile like eg is an anti freezing agent glycerol a food additive malonic acid is used as a pharmaceutical ingredient to control acidity and also as natural preservative additive for foods urea apart from being a fertilizer is used as animal feed dermatological products and as additive in many products dess are considered as non volatile organic solvents and not flammable hence they can be handled and stored easily these type of dess can be used as draw solutions for dewatering process 6 they offer significant technological benefits and can be applied to product sensitive industries such as biomedical food processing and pharmaceutical 7 concluding remarks one of the significant dimensions in fo research is the selection of a draw solute which can generate high osmotic potential with minimum rsf and can be easily regenerated using minimum energy though very little work has been reported on il and des as draw solutes the results indicate that this new class of thermally responsive draw solutes can generate high osmotic potential resulting in appreciable water fluxes which can be retained even after dilution fo along with regeneration can be carried out at near ambient temperatures thereby making the process less energy extensive even inexpensive forms of energy such as low grade heat or solar energy can also be used to make the whole process economical thus fo with il des as draw solutes has immense potential to be utilized for desalination being low temperature operations they can be used for dewatering of thermal sensitive products as well however more work is needed in pilot plant scale to fine tune the operational parameters successful outcomes can be further extended for treatment of difficult to treat streams such as ro brine and other produced water including industrial waste streams or product streams from mining and oil exploration activities having lower fouling propensity and higher fouling reversibility compared to ro fo does not require extensive pretreatment of feed and frequent chemical cleaning of membrane nevertheless a more detailed and long term parametric study on the difference in mechanism and extent of fouling in fo compared to ro needs to be undertaken the economic benefits of prolonged membrane life also need to be investigated rigorously it is important to note that the first generation fo membrane i e the cta membrane by hti inc was only used initially by mok et al and nakayama et al for il based draw solutions all the other reported works thereafter find the use of second generation polyamide tfc membranes provided by hti inc or indigenously developed with better performance to reduce the viscosity of draw solutes and particularly in case of ucst draw solutes it may be necessary to operate fo at slightly higher temperatures the long term membrane stability operating at higher temperature conditions for prolonged period needs to be analyzed there is still scope of fine tuning the issue of rsf by increasing the selectivity of membrane active layer tfc membrane with modest water permeability high active layer selectivity inert surface chemistry and very low structural parameter may be the need of future recent development of inorganic membranes based on zeolite aquaporins and graphene can also be checked for potential application in fo process custom designed membranes for specific application may be also the solution especially for difficult feed solutions in case of draw solutions dess have shown distinct advantages over ils in the form of i ease of synthesis ii low price and iii low toxicity especially dess derived from ch cl and renewable chemicals dess are also environment friendly with no serious disposal problems des may be especially suitable for dewatering of sensitive products such as pharmaceutical and food products as they are non toxic des like reline maline and acetaline can be immediately taken up to check their potential as draw solutes reline has very good and favorable solvent properties reline and maline has freezing point of 12 c and 10 c which makes them suitable for ambient temperature operation for ucst type des chilling process can be used to recover the draw solute or water based on the freezing point temperature hence it can be concluded that although research in fo still has a long way to go nevertheless green shoots are already visible most of the work reported so far are preliminary laboratory scale studies showing encouraging results which needs to be carried forward in case of pilot plant studies and commercial applications prolonged operational data need to be collected and studied to check long term stability of fo process a proper combination of imagination along with intelligent economics can make this technology successful in near future 
14613,water and energy are critical components of urban metabolism however climate change induced water scarcity and elevated temperatures pose a significant threat to the adequate supply of essential human services including sanitation and space cooling particularly in coastal cities where over 40 of the population resides the water energy nexus of sanitation and space cooling is crucial for promoting sustainability and resilience in coastal cities for decades hong kong has demonstrated the effectiveness of using seawater for toilet flushing and district cooling to save water and energy which could serve as a potential solution for other coastal cities worldwide seawater is a superior alternative to other sources of toilet flushing water due to its abundant availability easy detection of cross contamination and lower treatment costs furthermore saline wastewater treatment requires fewer materials and energy inputs and produces less sludge using seawater for district cooling also saves energy without exacerbating water stress however there is a lack of comprehensive insights from hong kong on how seawater use can be adopted by other coastal cities to promote sustainable development a successful introduction of seawater into coastal cities requires a holistic water energy management framework that provides technical and policy level guidance we developed such a framework that follows four sustainability principles namely customized solutions efficient resource allocation comprehensive evaluation and optimized tradeoffs these principles are designed into contextualized location analysis urban spatial analysis integrated sustainability assessment and nexus analysis the results of these analyses can aid decision making regarding the technical and policy aspects of seawater uses in sanitation and space cooling to maximize the positive impacts on sustainable development breaking barriers between sectors and encouraging inter municipal cooperation between sectors are critical to the successful use of seawater by adopting this framework and promoting collaboration across different sectors coastal cities can enhance their sustainability and resilience providing a better quality of life for their citizens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords seawater sanitation cooling water energy nexus sustainability resilience data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction coastal cities are home to over 40 of the global population creel 2003 he et al 2014 united nations 2017 high population densities vibrant anthropogenic activities and natural climatic conditions in these regions contribute to significant demand for materials and energy and at the same time make these regions sensitive to the impacts of climate change such as increased water stress fleming et al 2018 this poses a significant challenge to improving global sanitation conditions which is recognized as a fundamental human right by the united nations and addressed in sustainable development goal 6 2 however achieving this goal will require 20 billion m3 of water and 5 10 twh of energy for water treatment united nations 2017 another serious consequence of climate change is the alteration of global temperatures which is expected to lead to a significant increase in the demand for space cooling emsd 2019 international energy agency iea 2018 liao et al 2016 while water cooled air conditioning systems are highly efficient and require less energy than conventional air cooled systems they consume a significant amount of water exacerbating water stress and jeopardizing local water security energy 2020 opportunities et al 2018 yip and ho 2013 introducing seawater into urban metabolism can offer significant advantages for building sustainability and resilience in coastal cities particularly regarding the water energy nexus of sanitation and space cooling toilet flushing is a major source of water consumption in cities accounting for 30 of household water use while also consuming energy 0 3 to 0 4 kwh m3 and emitting carbon during water treatment us epa 2022 while alternative water sources for flushing such as harvested rainwater and reclaimed greywater can achieve water savings they are prone to intermittent supply and incur high costs ng 2015 tang et al 2006 in contrast seawater is a superior alternative for toilet flushing water due to its bottomless quantity facile detection of cross contamination and cheaper treatment costs ng 2015 tang et al 2006 additionally saline wastewater is an ideal influent for the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process in wastewater treatment plants requiring 10 20 less material and energy inputs and producing 60 70 less sludge than traditional biological treatment processes wu et al 2016 space cooling can also efficiently use seawater through centralized cooling systems with a transition from air to water as a heat sink offering promising energy savings dorfner et al 2017 yik et al 2001 using seawater as a coolant for condensers can lead to energy savings of 20 40 as seawater has a lower ambient temperature and a higher heat capacity than air finnegan et al 2018 raveendran and sekhar 2017 moreover using seawater as a coolant will not exacerbate water stresses in coastal cities since the 1950s various parts of hong kong have been using seawater to deal with water stress and increasing energy demands for space cooling the seawater is passed through a 5 10 mm coarse screen and treated by electrochlorination for non potable uses in municipal services including toilet flushing and district cooling this approach offers co benefits of water energy carbon emission savings the freshwater savings from using seawater for toilet flushing alone amount to 300 million cubic meters annually leung et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the most extensive seawater district cooling system was introduced in the kai tak district in 2013 ribeiro 2014 this system has saved approximately 20 3 million kwh of electricity from 2013 to 2020 equivalent to a reduction of 14 210 tco2e hksar 2021 these successes demonstrate the potential of using seawater for toilet flushing and district cooling to promote sustainability and resilience in other coastal cities despite the significant use of seawater in hong kong to address water and energy stresses little attention has been given to its contributions to city sustainability and resilience as a result there is a lack of comprehensive insights into how seawater use can be adopted by other coastal cities to facilitate their sustainable development important questions about seawater utilization such as the necessary design considerations and the implementation of the system to achieve optimal benefits for sustainable development remain unanswered addressing these questions is essential for effectively incorporating seawater use into coastal city planning and management and for realizing its potential to enhance sustainability and resilience in urban environments therefore we have developed a water energy management framework that incorporates principles of sustainability to guide the successful introduction of seawater into coastal cities by providing a comprehensive and practical approach to seawater utilization our framework can help decision makers and practitioners implement sustainable seawater uses that promote resilience reduce water and energy consumption and enhance the overall quality of life for coastal city residents 2 sustainable water energy management framework to aid the implementation of seawater use in coastal cities to effectively introduce seawater into coastal cities a sustainable water energy management framework is necessary we argue for a more holistic and multidisciplinary approach that recognizes the interconnections between water energy carbon and other factors that contribute to urban sustainability and resilience rather than viewing seawater used as a standalone solution to water and energy stresses we contend that it should be integrated into a comprehensive framework of sustainable urban water energy management this framework should include customized system design efficient resource allocation comprehensive evaluations and optimized tradeoffs fig 1 by adopting this approach coastal cities cannot only address their immediate water and energy challenges but also enhance their overall sustainability and resilience this approach is necessary to ensure that the introduction of seawater into coastal cities is done in a way that maximizes its potential benefits while minimizing its potential risks moreover this approach can provide useful insights for other coastal cities seeking to adopt similar solutions promoting sustainable and resilient urban water management worldwide four analyses are included in the framework to facilitate design and decisions on technical and policy levels by incorporating these analyses the framework can provide a comprehensive and tailored approach to sustainable urban water energy management contributing to more efficient and effective use of seawater in coastal cities 2 1 contextualized location analysis customized system design is the primary key to the success of seawater use in coastal cities different regions should take advantage of their local conditions including urban characteristics and demographic features for example in compact coastal cities seawater can be used for toilet flushing and as a coolant for centralized district cooling systems in the presence of bathymetric features direct seawater cooling technology can be applied to maximize energy savings hunt et al 2019 however if direct seawater cooling is impractical due to the absence of bathymetric conditions indirect seawater cooling i e seawater cooled chillers can be used to save energy in cities with industries that have intensive cooling needs near urban settlements infrastructure symbiosis should be considered and the seawater returned from the district cooling system can be reused chertow et al 2019 guo et al 2022 the thermal energy carried by cooling water can be recovered to produce freshwater by low grade heat desalination datsgerdi and chua 2018 in regions close to agricultural fields human waste from sanitation can be recirculated to identify the advantageous resources and urban characteristics in a region to exploit them for sustainable development a contextualized location analysis is necessary this analysis embeds the philosophy of customization into the seawater uses in coastal cities by identifying appropriate technologies based on the economic conditions and geographic and demographic features coastal cities can tailor their approach to seawater utilization to fit their unique context promoting sustainable development and enhancing their resilience to climate change 2 2 urban spatial analysis optimal allocation of limited resources is a crucial concept in achieving sustainability population and land use in a region may be heterogeneous necessitating the clarification of the spatial and temporal distributions of the population and buildings for system planning arehart et al 2021 bouabid and louis 2021 by inputting the spatial distributions of buildings and populations into bottom up energy models or water demand models the spatial distributions of energy and water demands across a city can be clarified this approach can identify opportunities for energy savings in a city along with marginal costs and benefits helping to prioritize resource allocation and determine the optimal technology penetrations to formulate context specific strategies in the policy aspect incentives for seawater involving systems must be designed considering the interests of stakeholders the urban spatial analysis can identify the potential opportunities for technology deployment allowing policymakers to formulate policies that consider the stakeholders in the key regions to achieve greater benefits moreover knowledge regarding optimal technology penetration can help policymakers set reasonable and feasible goals 2 3 integrated sustainability analysis comprehensively quantifying the impacts of seawater uses on the 17 sustainable development goals is critical to provide holistic insights into sustainable development sdgs we concluded seven assessment dimensions that align with the 17 sdgs 1 water and energy conservation 2 greenhouse gas mitigation ghg 3 ecosystem protection 4 food supply 5 public health and 6 social and 7 economic impacts different analytical tools are available to quantify the consequences of seawater used in these dimensions for example life cycle assessment for diverse impact categories can quantify the impacts of seawater uses on water and energy conservations ghg mitigation and ecosystem protection agricultural productivity or postharvest analysis can help clarify the impacts on food supply health impact assessment can quantify the impacts of seawater uses on public health the inequality index or population coverage analysis can quantify social impacts life cycle cost assessment can indicate economic impacts it is important to note that different regions have varying needs and priorities for different dimensions ameen and mourshed 2019 therefore suitable analytical tools must be used to quantify the impacts of introducing seawater into coastal cities the results can be used to identify the priorities across the seven dimensions and guide policymakers to maximize the positive impacts in specific dimensions 2 4 nexus analysis to consider the synergies or tradeoffs that occur across dimensions the concept of nexus must be introduced many researchers have actively used the concept of nexus such as the water energy nexus robb et al 2021 wang et al 2021 water energy carbon nexus duan and chen 2016 shrestha et al 2015 and water energy food nexus el gafy et al 2017 endo et al 2018 kanakoudis and tsitsifli 2020 the scope of the nexus should be extended to cover the seven assessment dimensions furthermore multidimensional impacts can be normalized and aggregated into a joint indicator to facilitate decision making process to this end normalization and weighting are two basic techniques that can provide distinct insights for decision makers a representative example is the sustainable realization of water and energy savings assume that the water and energy demand of a city is used to normalize the water and energy savings i e water and energy savings are divided by the water and energy demand respectively to obtain dimensionless values in this case the indicator can demonstrate the effectiveness of seawater uses in relieving the local water and energy supply pressures consider another case in which engineered water desalinated or imported and imported energy are used to normalize the water and energy savings in this case the indicator shows the effectiveness of seawater use in strengthening water and energy security overall the nexus analysis clarifies the synergies and tradeoffs across dimensions and can help formulate policies to facilitate positive outcomes across the seven dimensions 3 application of the water energy management framework in case cities the water energy management framework proposed in this making wave can be adopted by other coastal cities to identify opportunities for introducing seawater for sustainable development a previous study focused on city planning of seawater toilet flushing and seawater district cooling systems in hong kong jeddah saudi arabia and miami usa and the four analyses in the framework were incorporated to guide the planning process zhang et al 2023 the contextualized location analysis identified that these coastal cities have high water and energy demands due to their level of development and natural climate conditions making seawater toilet flushing and seawater district cooling systems essential additionally the sani process should be integrated into wastewater treatment and sludge can be used to recover high value materials such as sulfated polysaccharides the previous study found that these systems could save 16 28 of annual freshwater consumption and 3 11 of annual electricity consumption in hk jeddah and miami the previous study developed the grid level quantitative water and energy demands models of the seawater incorporating systems and conducted a life cycle assessment to demonstrate the spatial variations of benefits of the systems in terms of water and energy savings and environmental impacts zhang et al 2023 policymakers can use the results of these analyses to formulate realistic and feasible goals for seawater use in municipal services for instance the percentage of the population to which seawater toilet flushing should be made available and the number of buildings that should be provided with district cooling additionally hotspots for the deployment of these systems can be identified to provide customized incentives to the key stakeholders for instance if the assessment results suggest that system deployment in commercial buildings has more positive impacts than in residential buildings policy making should be oriented to incentivize commercial estate developers to accept seawater incorporating systems nexus analysis in the previous work was achieved by normalizing the impacts of seawater incorporating systems to dimensionless indicators water saving effects energy saving effects and carbon mitigation effects zhang et al 2023 the impact ranks of seawater use across the different dimensions can be used to guide policies to maximize the positive outcomes in a specific dimension the indicators in three aspects can be integrated into a single indicator to show the overall effects of systems and used to compare with other sustainable solutions for example reclaimed wastewater for toilet flushing in this case the nexus analysis can help decision makers understand the synergies and tradeoffs across the different dimensions of using reclaimed water or seawater for flushing and select one alternative water source that maximizes the overall sustainability benefits the previous study demonstrates that hk and jeddah would achieve high city level water saving effects by using seawater incorporating systems and miami would get minimal water saving effects in contrast miami would accomplish the most energy saving effects and carbon mitigation effects jeddah would get negative carbon mitigation effects in summary the water energy management framework can be adopted to other coastal cities by tailoring the analysis to fit the specific challenges and opportunities of each city this can lead to more effective and sustainable solutions that enhance the city

analysis fig 2 the contextualized location analysis aims to design tailored systems by exploiting the local resources and conditions which requires cooperative discussions across multiple sectors however stakeholders in different sectors have fragmented opinions making it challenging to collect holistic viewpoints to make decisions lee et al 2018 riazi et al 2022 therefore breaking barriers between different sectors and encouraging inter municipal cooperation across sectors is a primary challenge the challenge for urban spatial analysis is the limited availability of high resolution spatial data regarding building floors and populations spatial population information can be obtained from existing data repositories such as socioeconomic data and application center however the input data are collected from the population census which cannot accurately capture the population changes owing to internal migration international inflows and outflows cook 2004 moreover the gridded population data are obtained by interpreting the datasets from social economic and earth science disciplines and remote sensing therefore they may not be able to provide accurate information regarding the heterogeneity of the population nasa sedac 2010 the acquisition of high resolution spatial building floor data is more challenging transparent city scale floor distribution data are typically unavailable the standard methods to estimate the distribution of building floors whether top down or bottom up are based on national scale surveys or individual building surveys which may contain implicit or explicit bias arehart et al 2021 therefore proper methods must be established to visualize the spatial distribution of floors for instance by using satellite building footprint data and digital elevation models to conduct the urban spatial analyses the contributions of using seawater to the sdgs can be quantified in terms of seven dimensions water and energy conservation ghg

14613,water and energy are critical components of urban metabolism however climate change induced water scarcity and elevated temperatures pose a significant threat to the adequate supply of essential human services including sanitation and space cooling particularly in coastal cities where over 40 of the population resides the water energy nexus of sanitation and space cooling is crucial for promoting sustainability and resilience in coastal cities for decades hong kong has demonstrated the effectiveness of using seawater for toilet flushing and district cooling to save water and energy which could serve as a potential solution for other coastal cities worldwide seawater is a superior alternative to other sources of toilet flushing water due to its abundant availability easy detection of cross contamination and lower treatment costs furthermore saline wastewater treatment requires fewer materials and energy inputs and produces less sludge using seawater for district cooling also saves energy without exacerbating water stress however there is a lack of comprehensive insights from hong kong on how seawater use can be adopted by other coastal cities to promote sustainable development a successful introduction of seawater into coastal cities requires a holistic water energy management framework that provides technical and policy level guidance we developed such a framework that follows four sustainability principles namely customized solutions efficient resource allocation comprehensive evaluation and optimized tradeoffs these principles are designed into contextualized location analysis urban spatial analysis integrated sustainability assessment and nexus analysis the results of these analyses can aid decision making regarding the technical and policy aspects of seawater uses in sanitation and space cooling to maximize the positive impacts on sustainable development breaking barriers between sectors and encouraging inter municipal cooperation between sectors are critical to the successful use of seawater by adopting this framework and promoting collaboration across different sectors coastal cities can enhance their sustainability and resilience providing a better quality of life for their citizens graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords seawater sanitation cooling water energy nexus sustainability resilience data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction coastal cities are home to over 40 of the global population creel 2003 he et al 2014 united nations 2017 high population densities vibrant anthropogenic activities and natural climatic conditions in these regions contribute to significant demand for materials and energy and at the same time make these regions sensitive to the impacts of climate change such as increased water stress fleming et al 2018 this poses a significant challenge to improving global sanitation conditions which is recognized as a fundamental human right by the united nations and addressed in sustainable development goal 6 2 however achieving this goal will require 20 billion m3 of water and 5 10 twh of energy for water treatment united nations 2017 another serious consequence of climate change is the alteration of global temperatures which is expected to lead to a significant increase in the demand for space cooling emsd 2019 international energy agency iea 2018 liao et al 2016 while water cooled air conditioning systems are highly efficient and require less energy than conventional air cooled systems they consume a significant amount of water exacerbating water stress and jeopardizing local water security energy 2020 opportunities et al 2018 yip and ho 2013 introducing seawater into urban metabolism can offer significant advantages for building sustainability and resilience in coastal cities particularly regarding the water energy nexus of sanitation and space cooling toilet flushing is a major source of water consumption in cities accounting for 30 of household water use while also consuming energy 0 3 to 0 4 kwh m3 and emitting carbon during water treatment us epa 2022 while alternative water sources for flushing such as harvested rainwater and reclaimed greywater can achieve water savings they are prone to intermittent supply and incur high costs ng 2015 tang et al 2006 in contrast seawater is a superior alternative for toilet flushing water due to its bottomless quantity facile detection of cross contamination and cheaper treatment costs ng 2015 tang et al 2006 additionally saline wastewater is an ideal influent for the sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification nitrification integrated sani process in wastewater treatment plants requiring 10 20 less material and energy inputs and producing 60 70 less sludge than traditional biological treatment processes wu et al 2016 space cooling can also efficiently use seawater through centralized cooling systems with a transition from air to water as a heat sink offering promising energy savings dorfner et al 2017 yik et al 2001 using seawater as a coolant for condensers can lead to energy savings of 20 40 as seawater has a lower ambient temperature and a higher heat capacity than air finnegan et al 2018 raveendran and sekhar 2017 moreover using seawater as a coolant will not exacerbate water stresses in coastal cities since the 1950s various parts of hong kong have been using seawater to deal with water stress and increasing energy demands for space cooling the seawater is passed through a 5 10 mm coarse screen and treated by electrochlorination for non potable uses in municipal services including toilet flushing and district cooling this approach offers co benefits of water energy carbon emission savings the freshwater savings from using seawater for toilet flushing alone amount to 300 million cubic meters annually leung et al 2012 liu et al 2019 the most extensive seawater district cooling system was introduced in the kai tak district in 2013 ribeiro 2014 this system has saved approximately 20 3 million kwh of electricity from 2013 to 2020 equivalent to a reduction of 14 210 tco2e hksar 2021 these successes demonstrate the potential of using seawater for toilet flushing and district cooling to promote sustainability and resilience in other coastal cities despite the significant use of seawater in hong kong to address water and energy stresses little attention has been given to its contributions to city sustainability and resilience as a result there is a lack of comprehensive insights into how seawater use can be adopted by other coastal cities to facilitate their sustainable development important questions about seawater utilization such as the necessary design considerations and the implementation of the system to achieve optimal benefits for sustainable development remain unanswered addressing these questions is essential for effectively incorporating seawater use into coastal city planning and management and for realizing its potential to enhance sustainability and resilience in urban environments therefore we have developed a water energy management framework that incorporates principles of sustainability to guide the successful introduction of seawater into coastal cities by providing a comprehensive and practical approach to seawater utilization our framework can help decision makers and practitioners implement sustainable seawater uses that promote resilience reduce water and energy consumption and enhance the overall quality of life for coastal city residents 2 sustainable water energy management framework to aid the implementation of seawater use in coastal cities to effectively introduce seawater into coastal cities a sustainable water energy management framework is necessary we argue for a more holistic and multidisciplinary approach that recognizes the interconnections between water energy carbon and other factors that contribute to urban sustainability and resilience rather than viewing seawater used as a standalone solution to water and energy stresses we contend that it should be integrated into a comprehensive framework of sustainable urban water energy management this framework should include customized system design efficient resource allocation comprehensive evaluations and optimized tradeoffs fig 1 by adopting this approach coastal cities cannot only address their immediate water and energy challenges but also enhance their overall sustainability and resilience this approach is necessary to ensure that the introduction of seawater into coastal cities is done in a way that maximizes its potential benefits while minimizing its potential risks moreover this approach can provide useful insights for other coastal cities seeking to adopt similar solutions promoting sustainable and resilient urban water management worldwide four analyses are included in the framework to facilitate design and decisions on technical and policy levels by incorporating these analyses the framework can provide a comprehensive and tailored approach to sustainable urban water energy management contributing to more efficient and effective use of seawater in coastal cities 2 1 contextualized location analysis customized system design is the primary key to the success of seawater use in coastal cities different regions should take advantage of their local conditions including urban characteristics and demographic features for example in compact coastal cities seawater can be used for toilet flushing and as a coolant for centralized district cooling systems in the presence of bathymetric features direct seawater cooling technology can be applied to maximize energy savings hunt et al 2019 however if direct seawater cooling is impractical due to the absence of bathymetric conditions indirect seawater cooling i e seawater cooled chillers can be used to save energy in cities with industries that have intensive cooling needs near urban settlements infrastructure symbiosis should be considered and the seawater returned from the district cooling system can be reused chertow et al 2019 guo et al 2022 the thermal energy carried by cooling water can be recovered to produce freshwater by low grade heat desalination datsgerdi and chua 2018 in regions close to agricultural fields human waste from sanitation can be recirculated to identify the advantageous resources and urban characteristics in a region to exploit them for sustainable development a contextualized location analysis is necessary this analysis embeds the philosophy of customization into the seawater uses in coastal cities by identifying appropriate technologies based on the economic conditions and geographic and demographic features coastal cities can tailor their approach to seawater utilization to fit their unique context promoting sustainable development and enhancing their resilience to climate change 2 2 urban spatial analysis optimal allocation of limited resources is a crucial concept in achieving sustainability population and land use in a region may be heterogeneous necessitating the clarification of the spatial and temporal distributions of the population and buildings for system planning arehart et al 2021 bouabid and louis 2021 by inputting the spatial distributions of buildings and populations into bottom up energy models or water demand models the spatial distributions of energy and water demands across a city can be clarified this approach can identify opportunities for energy savings in a city along with marginal costs and benefits helping to prioritize resource allocation and determine the optimal technology penetrations to formulate context specific strategies in the policy aspect incentives for seawater involving systems must be designed considering the interests of stakeholders the urban spatial analysis can identify the potential opportunities for technology deployment allowing policymakers to formulate policies that consider the stakeholders in the key regions to achieve greater benefits moreover knowledge regarding optimal technology penetration can help policymakers set reasonable and feasible goals 2 3 integrated sustainability analysis comprehensively quantifying the impacts of seawater uses on the 17 sustainable development goals is critical to provide holistic insights into sustainable development sdgs we concluded seven assessment dimensions that align with the 17 sdgs 1 water and energy conservation 2 greenhouse gas mitigation ghg 3 ecosystem protection 4 food supply 5 public health and 6 social and 7 economic impacts different analytical tools are available to quantify the consequences of seawater used in these dimensions for example life cycle assessment for diverse impact categories can quantify the impacts of seawater uses on water and energy conservations ghg mitigation and ecosystem protection agricultural productivity or postharvest analysis can help clarify the impacts on food supply health impact assessment can quantify the impacts of seawater uses on public health the inequality index or population coverage analysis can quantify social impacts life cycle cost assessment can indicate economic impacts it is important to note that different regions have varying needs and priorities for different dimensions ameen and mourshed 2019 therefore suitable analytical tools must be used to quantify the impacts of introducing seawater into coastal cities the results can be used to identify the priorities across the seven dimensions and guide policymakers to maximize the positive impacts in specific dimensions 2 4 nexus analysis to consider the synergies or tradeoffs that occur across dimensions the concept of nexus must be introduced many researchers have actively used the concept of nexus such as the water energy nexus robb et al 2021 wang et al 2021 water energy carbon nexus duan and chen 2016 shrestha et al 2015 and water energy food nexus el gafy et al 2017 endo et al 2018 kanakoudis and tsitsifli 2020 the scope of the nexus should be extended to cover the seven assessment dimensions furthermore multidimensional impacts can be normalized and aggregated into a joint indicator to facilitate decision making process to this end normalization and weighting are two basic techniques that can provide distinct insights for decision makers a representative example is the sustainable realization of water and energy savings assume that the water and energy demand of a city is used to normalize the water and energy savings i e water and energy savings are divided by the water and energy demand respectively to obtain dimensionless values in this case the indicator can demonstrate the effectiveness of seawater uses in relieving the local water and energy supply pressures consider another case in which engineered water desalinated or imported and imported energy are used to normalize the water and energy savings in this case the indicator shows the effectiveness of seawater use in strengthening water and energy security overall the nexus analysis clarifies the synergies and tradeoffs across dimensions and can help formulate policies to facilitate positive outcomes across the seven dimensions 3 application of the water energy management framework in case cities the water energy management framework proposed in this making wave can be adopted by other coastal cities to identify opportunities for introducing seawater for sustainable development a previous study focused on city planning of seawater toilet flushing and seawater district cooling systems in hong kong jeddah saudi arabia and miami usa and the four analyses in the framework were incorporated to guide the planning process zhang et al 2023 the contextualized location analysis identified that these coastal cities have high water and energy demands due to their level of development and natural climate conditions making seawater toilet flushing and seawater district cooling systems essential additionally the sani process should be integrated into wastewater treatment and sludge can be used to recover high value materials such as sulfated polysaccharides the previous study found that these systems could save 16 28 of annual freshwater consumption and 3 11 of annual electricity consumption in hk jeddah and miami the previous study developed the grid level quantitative water and energy demands models of the seawater incorporating systems and conducted a life cycle assessment to demonstrate the spatial variations of benefits of the systems in terms of water and energy savings and environmental impacts zhang et al 2023 policymakers can use the results of these analyses to formulate realistic and feasible goals for seawater use in municipal services for instance the percentage of the population to which seawater

14614,there have been significant advances in the use of biological and physical selectors for the intensification of continuously flowing biological wastewater treatment wwt processes biological selection allows for the development of large biological aggregates e g mobile biofilm aerobic granules and densified biological flocs physical selection controls the solids residence times of large biological aggregates and ordinary biological flocs and is usually accomplished using screens or hydrocyclones large biological aggregates can facilitate different biological transformations in a single reactor and enhance liquid and solids separation continuous flow wwt processes incorporating biological and physical selectors offer benefits that can include reduced footprint lower costs and improved wwt process performance thus it is expected that both interest in and application of these processes will increase significantly in the future this review provides a comprehensive summary of biological and physical selectors and their design and operation keywords biofilm granule wastewater selector intensification model data availability data in this paper was obtained from peer reviewed publications that are appropriately cited 1 introduction this review summarizes state of the art knowledge and experiences with the intensification of continuously flowing biological wastewater treatment wwt processes by forming and retaining large biological aggregates lba e g mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs and ordinary biological flocs obf these systems

mobile biofilm is defined here as a biofilm substratum that has a known mass dimensions and can move throughout a biological wwt process with or without accumulated obf the specific surface area ssa of a mobile biofilm mf 2 gc changes with biofilm thickness lf and migrating carrier dimensions and material according to boltz and daigger 2022 a migrating carrier that has a 250 kg m3 dry bulk density is described as a 500 μm diameter sphere and supports a 200 μm thick biofilm has a 0 16 mf 2 gc ssa aerobic granules do not require a migrating carrier because they are self immobilized and semi spherical biological aggregates with equivalent spherical diameters that are greater than 200 μm de kreuk et al 2007 densified biological flocs are like aerobic granules but can have equivalent spherical diameters that are less than or equal to 200 μm jin et al 2003 lbas are larger and denser than obf mass transfer resistances cause steep dissolved substrate concentration gradients in lba that are mostly perpendicular to the substratum or granule core these steep concentration gradients form different redox zones inside of lba slow growing bacteria can accumulate in these redox zones retaining lba in a biological wwt process also retains these slow growing bacteria a single bioreactor with lba and obf can facilitate multiple transformations mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs can have better settling characteristics than obf wei et al 2021 there is disparity between methods of analyzing obf mobile biofilms and aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in engineering practice and research ordinary biological flocs are analyzed in research and practice based on srt and settling characteristics mobile biofilms are analyzed in research and practice based on the biofilm area that is exposed to nutrients in the bulk of the water in research aerobic granules and densified biological flocs are analyzed as biofilms but their area that is exposed to the bulk of the water is difficult to define and can vary significantly aerobic granules sizes are widely distributed by substrate availability and local environmental conditions therefore srts of aerobic granules and densified biological flocs are often applied in engineering practice biological selection is defined here as the targeted accumulation of specific bacteria in lba a way of biological selection is to expose bacteria inside the lba to alternating cycles of substrate feast and famine and controlling lba and obf srts a goal of this type of biological selection is to accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria which are essential to forming aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in biological nutrient removal bnr and secondary wwt processes carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria grow more slowly than ordinary heterotrophic bacteria but their true biomass yields denoted as yh g codx g cods are similar de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 they accumulate when biological wwt processes cycle water and biomass through different environmental conditions and substrates concentrations that expose bacteria to simple dissolved organic substrate e g volatile fatty acids or vfa feast and famine bacteria feast when they consume simple dissolved organic substrate at a greater rate than it can be oxidized via respiration it requires a substantial readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod concentration in wastewater a sufficiently long period without rbcod or famine is needed to re establish the storage capacities of these bacteria van loosdrecht et al 1997a beun et al 2000b carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria polymerize simple dissolved organic substrate and other compounds e g orthophosphate or po4 3 into biopolymers e g glycogen polyesters and polyphosphates and store them intracellularly barnard et al 2017 therefore fermentation of complex dissolved organic substrates into simple dissolved organic substrates is essential to the formation of aerobic granules and densified biological flocs carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria produce protein and carbohydrate extracellular polymeric substances eps wilén et al 2018 while the compositions of intra and extracellular biopolymers are quite different they both can be enzymatically hydrolyzed the eps in lba is mostly proteinaceous eps which is more adhesive than carbohydrate eps mcswain et al 2005 solids detaching from lba are expected to enhance biological floc densification due to the protein eps carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria can utilize a variety of electron acceptors that include dissolved oxygen and oxidized nitrogen compounds and have a competitive advantage over ordinary heterotrophic bacteria in biological wwt processes that expose bacteria to simple dissolved organic substrate feast and famine bioreactors and liquid and solids separation units may have reduced tank volumes and significantly improved liquid and solids separations efficiency with biological and physical selectors a space reduction of up to 50 and electricity reduction by 23 may occur when aerobic granules are utilized instead of conventional activated sludge bengtsson et al 2019 biological and physical selectors result in compact and high rate biological wwt processes and are adaptable to a variety of continuously flowing biological wwt processes 2 biological selection 2 1 aerobic granulation fundamentals aerobic granules can form in a reactor over a range of wastewater compositions and operating conditions heijnen and loosdrecht

granule formation and bnr can be achieved by elongating the anaerobic feed period to a sequencing batch reactor ho et al 1996 aerobic granules were developed in such a system and retained by surface wasting van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2007 an anaerobic feeding period biologically selects for carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria that polymerize po4 3 or polyphosphate storing bacteria psb smolders et al 1994 biological aggregate morphology changes with simple dissolved organic substrate surface area loading rate salr and the shear stress that is applied to their surfaces tijhuis et al 1996 kwok et al 1998 a moderate salr and strong surface shear forces resulted in smooth and dense aerobic granules while a high salr and weak surface shear forces resulted in aerobic granules with rough surfaces the following criteria must be met to form and accumulate aerobic granules 1 grow and accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 2 maintain a sufficient

2022 strubbe et al 2022 2 2 biological selection mechanisms cycling water and biomass between anaerobic and aerobic environments can cause bacteria to experience simple dissolved organic substrate feast and famine carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria transform simple dissolved organic substrates into biopolymers while feasting psb use polyphosphate and glycogen to produce adenosine triphosphate atp and transport vfa into their cell for storage as polyesters the stored polyesters are hydrolyzed during periods of simple dissolved organic substrate famine and result in the production of atp which is used to restore polyphosphate van loosdrecht et al 1997a mino et al 1998 seviour et al 2003 the atp is used to restore intracellular polyphosphate glycogen storing bacteria gsb and psb have a similar metabolic pathways but gsb do not store polyphosphates psb and gsb compete for common electron donors and acceptors granules that are primarily comprised of gsb can form without psb when acetate is the only electron donor bin et al 2015 wastewater influent to a bioreactor with an acetate to propionate ratio that is in the range of 1 1 and 3 1 and a ph that is greater than 7 5 will favor the accumulation of psb lopez vazquez et al 2009 a system with low concentrations of simple dissolved organic substrates will have difficulties accumulating a substantial mass of carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria a fermenting bioreactor can transform complex dissolved organic substrates into simple dissolved organic substrates liang et al 2021 the accumulation of fermenting heterotrophic bacteria facilitates biological nutrient removal and minimizes competition between heterotrophic and nitrifying autotrophic bacteria for common electron acceptors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 denitrifying psb dpsb and glycogen storing bacteria dgsb reduce oxidized nitrogen compounds kuba et al 1996 ahn et al 2001 tsuneda et al 2006 polyesters such as poly β hydroxylkanoates pha are an energy source for carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria usually aerobic zone po4 3 utilization by psb is greater than po4 3 release by bacteria in an anaerobic zone consequently there is a net removal of po4 3 from water and psb can be removed from a wwt process comeau et al 1986 mino 2000 aerobic granules and densified biological flocs have formed while treating

obf and filamentous bacteria from larger denser and more rapidly settling aggregates e g lba 2 removing or wasting slow settling biological aggregates from a biological wwt process and 3 retaining larger denser and more rapidly settling aggregates over a several month period physical selection can support the development and accumulation of lba that are comprised of up to 90 mobile biofilms boltz and daigger 2022 and up to 70 aerobic granules and or densified biological flocs roche et al 2022 the lba can improve overall biomass settling characteristics table 1 summarizes peer reviewed literature describing continuous flow wwt systems that employed screens hydrocyclones or zone settlers as physical selectors 3 1 physical selectors screens and hydrocyclones have been utilized as physical selectors with laboratory pilot and full scale biological wwt processes screens separate biological aggregates by their size van winckel et al 2019 sturm et al 2020 wei et al 2021 screens

van winckel et al 2019 reported that screens were 72 and hydrocyclones were 42 efficient at retaining aerobic granules screens can retain better than 98 of mobile biofilms boltz and daigger 2022 screens and hydrocyclones are easy to operate and maintain and have the advantages of being compact and easy to integrate with an existing wwtp the retention aerobic granules and densified biological flocs by hydrocyclones depends on the existence of granule forming conditions and can change with time as aerobic granules and or densified biological flocs form and accumulate stacked two zone settlers separate biological aggregates by their settling characteristics an et al 2021 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2022 and have been utilized as physical selectors with laboratory up to 140 l an et al 2021 sun et al 2019 and pilot e g beflow france bioreactors stacked two zone settlers have a larger physical footprint and greater hydraulic head loss than screens or hydrocyclones 3 2 quantifying physical selection this approach to quantifying physical selection is a state of the art principle that was first described by boltz and daigger 2022 biological wwt processes with physical selectors

al 2021 regmi et al 2022 and roche et al 2022 reported data that pertaining to obf srts and 30 minute sludge volume indicies svi30 observed for full scale wwtps with biological and physical selectors relatively brief obf srts of 6 10 and 13 days resulted in stable svi values of 77 17 83 22 and 41 7 ml g tss respectively gemza et al 2022 reported seasonal variations in svi that ranged from 40 ml g in summer to 165 ml g in winter and changes in densified biological floc diameters when the biological wwt process had a 26 4 day srt of obf sandino et al 2016 and willoughby et al 2018 reported svi values in the range of 130 to 200 ml g while operating a wwtp with a 25 to 30 day srt of obf but observed that the biomass settling characteristics improved i e svi30 in the range of 47 to 80 ml g when the srt of obf was less than 10 days wastewater treatment plant operators can adjust obf srt and physical selector properties to maximize the accumulations of lba ordinary biological flocs and lba usually have different srts table 2 lists obf and lba srts calculated for full scale and continuously flowing wwt processes with biological and physical selection avila et al 2021 regmi et al 2022 roche et al 2022 4 implementation considerations 4 1 biological selector design the concept of configuring the initial section of a biological reactor with a low dispersion number and an adequate substrate concentration gradient to accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria and de select for filamentous microorganisms was introduced by chudoba et al 1973 the initial bioreactor section can have a relatively small volume when compared to other sections of the bioreactor receive influent wastewater and return sludge high rbcod uptake rate and nearly complete rbcod removal jenkins et al 1993 biological selection is commonly applied in engineering practice and has been used to remove nutrients from wastewater and minimize sludge bulking or the undesired accumulations of filamentous microorganisms sludge bulking can result in secondary clarifier failure and constrain the capacity of an activated sludge process jenkins et al 2004 wanner 1994 parker et al 2003 key considerations for the design and implementation of biological selectors include 1 wastewater composition 2 hydraulic retention time hrt 3 food to microorganism ratio f m and 4 classifying selector design parker et al 2005 and daigger et al 2018 described biological selectors in full scale biological wwt processes table 3 summarizes works that assessed biological selector design and operation 4 1 1 wastewater composition the quantity of contaminants that flow into a wwtp can vary the composition of wastewater and seasonal variability in this composition influence biological wwt process performance and are important to consider when designing a biological selector fig 4 presents monthly variability in the rbcod concentration in wastewater that is influent to an example municipal wwtp during one year of operation low temperatures caused reduced fermentation in the wastewater collection and conveyance system that led to this wwtp hence significantly less simple dissolved organic substrate concentrations were observed in the influent wastewater during winter months wwtps operate with a longer srt to compensate for slower biological transformation rates when the wastewater has lower temperatures which results in a f m that is too low for biological selection consequently conditions are not ideal for aerobic granule formation or biological floc densification 4 1 2 hrt and f m hrt and f m are important parameters for designing biological selectors fig 5 plots svi as a function of hrt and rbcod percent removal in a pilot scale biological selector svi reduces as the percent of rbcod transformed increases based on successful applications a hrt ranging from 45 to 60 min is usually sufficient to provide substantial rbcod removal and a high uptake rate most of the rbcod is transformed to simple dissolved organic substrate in a fermenter which prevents rbcod from entering downstream aerobic zone and de selects for filamentous microorganisms while creating conditions that are suitable for aerobic granule formation and biological floc densification shao and jenkins 1989 jenkins et al 2004 kruit et al 2002 the f m can be used to design biological selectors sturm et al 2020 parameters for the calculation of f m include the influent rbcod load kg cod d biological selector volume m3 and the ss concentration in the biological selector g ss m3 giving kg cod kg ss d from a practical and operational perspective the only variables available to change the f m ratio are the srt and the return sludge volumetric flow rate design guidelines for f m in biological selectors vary and depend on the type of biological selector i e aerobic anoxic or anaerobic research pertaining to biological selector design for biological floc densification demonstrated that anaerobic biological selectors require f m ratios ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 kg cod kg ss d multiple compartments reactors in series are required in biological selectors to ensure that a desired f m is maintained over a range of possible rbcod concentrations in the influent wastewater and minimize rbcod breakthrough to the downstream aerobic sections 4 1 3 classifying selector design foam causing microorganisms have created nuisance conditions and poor solids settling in full scale wwtps over a wide range of operating conditions classifying selectors parker et al 2003 parker et al 2014 can minimize foam causing microorganisms and prevent nuisance foams the term classifying selector refers to the mechanism by which foam causing microorganisms are de selected foam removal upon its formation can minimize the accumulation of foam causing microorganisms classifying selectors usually are designed to operate on a continuous basis parker et al 2003 summarized classifying selectors as having the following essential features 1 no foam trapping 2 biomass collected in an aerated channel or tank that provides a 10 min hrt 3 baffle the water surface and direct the surface solids to a weir 4 continuous flow over the weir 5 continuous or nearly continuous wasted solids pumping to a thickener and 6 deselect for foam causing microorganisms 4 1 4 other design considerations it is necessary to promote plug flow and eliminate uncontrolled back mixing in a biological selector the design of a biological selector should employ submerged walls to prevent floating material entrapment floating material is unsightly can be odorous and may unintentionally select for filamentous microorganisms each of the submerged baffle walls should allow for a 0 5 inch head loss at the design conditions an opening at the bottom of the baffle will allow filling and draining of the compartment and eliminate the need for the baffle walls to structurally withstand a hydraulic load 4 2 physical selector design physical selectors control the srts of lba and obf in a biological wwt process physical selector design considerations can include the type of physical selector screen orifice size and cleaning mechanism boltz and daigger 2022 and hydrocyclone pressure dimensions and underflow nozzle aperture diameter ford 2018 partin 2019 guo et al 2022 this sub section describes some physical selector design considerations 4 2 1 overflow and underflow physical selectors usually have an influent underflow and overflow screens retain lba and return them to a bioreactor in overflow with an efficiency that is described by eq 5 hydrocyclones retain lba and return them to a bioreactor in underflow with an efficiency that is described by eq 6 screens can receive solids and water by gravity or pump and usually convey lba with screen wash water hydrocyclone underflow and overflow flows by gravity because back pressure can reduce lba and obf separation efficiency obf can be removed from a biological wwt process by pumping ideally lba will flow to the bioreactor by gravity but a low head and friction pump can be utilized if underflow pumping is required 4 2 2 screens a screen with circular orifices is recommended but a wire mesh will suffice a rotary drum screen that retains lba usually has a hydraulic loading rate hlr that is in the range of 70 to 120 m3 h screen and requires a wash water volumetric flow rate up to 35 m3 day screen typically wastewater influent to a screen that is utilized for physical selection has a tss concentrations less than 6000 g tss m3 but additional experience may allow this value to be revised upward and applied to different types of screens boltz and daigger 2022 4 2 3 hydrocyclone pressure hydrocyclones target feed pressure is about 240 kgpascal kpa and has an allowable range of 220 to 255 kpa when they are utilized as physical selectors roche et al 2022 increasing operating pressure will increase the amount of lba in the underflow 4 2 4 thickening and dewatering screens that are utilized as physical selectors do not increase the hlr that is applied to waste solids thickening units hydrocyclones increase the hlr that is applied to waste solids thickening units because of a need to account for hydrocyclones under and overflows some waste solids thickening units e g daf are not hydraulically limited and provide more flexibility when they are utilized with hydrocyclones 4 2 5 raw sewage screening raw sewage screens that have openings with sizes that are in the range of 0 5 to 6 0 mm are usually utilized with physical selectors a grinder or strainer may be incorporated with the influent pipe for waste solids to minimize physical selector clogging primary clarifiers typically remove debris from wastewater that may clog hydrocyclones or screens 4 2 6 mixing and aeration bioreactors must include means of mixing water that contains lba and obf a minimum input of mixing energy is required throughout the reactor to prevent unintended settling it may be necessary to include separate diffused aeration and mixing systems in bioreactors that utilize advanced aeration control or experience periods during which there is a low air flow velocity 4 3 mobile biofilm processes mobile biofilm processes can be utilized to treat municipal and industrial wastewater with and without strong granule forming conditions migrating carriers can be comprised of different materials boltz et al 2018 boltz and daigger 2022 described three modes of mobile biofilm process operation the first mode of operation mode i has a mobile biofilm reactor and a mobile biofilm retention screen that is downstream from a bioreactor and upstream of liquid and solid separation modes ii and iii have a hybrid i e mobile biofilms and obf bioreactor and liquid and solid separation mode ii includes a mobile biofilm retention screen that is downstream from a hybrid bioreactor and upstream of liquid and solid separation mode iii includes mobile biofilm retention screen that is external to a hybrid bioreactor and liquid and solid separation receives waste solids and accumulates rapidly settling mobile biofilms mobile biofilms offer an alternative to the plastic biofilm carriers that are usually associated with integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs and to aerobic granules and densified biological flocs for continuously flowing wwt processes mobile biofilm processes are compatible with a variety of operating schemes and process configurations and minimize new infrastructure without plastic biofilm carriers or stainless steel air diffusers mobile biofilms can have settling velocities that are comparable to aerobic granules wei et al 2021 4 4 mathematical modeling mathematical modeling is an integral part of engineering practice modeling of lba is complicated because 1 they behave as biofilms and this behavior must be accounted for in the model 2 the physical characteristics of lba are variable and sometimes poorly defined and 3 lba must be modeled with obf two approaches to modeling lba are described in this section that include a migrating carrier and one dimensional 1 d biofilm model and an apparent half saturation concentration of substrate i ki model obf and lba can be simultaneously modeled in a continuously flowing stirred tank reactor cfstr or series of cfstrs this approach has been applied in engineering practice to simulate ifas processes that have biofilms retained in a bioreactor by wall screens and grow on plastic biofilm or migrating carriers from a modeling point of view a key difference between reactors that utilize plastic biofilm carriers and mobile biofilms is the movement of mobile biofilms throughout a bioreactor a migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model described by boltz et al 2017 includes a model of obf and a numerical 1 d biofilm model in a cfstr and describes mobile biofilm movement throughout a simulated wwt process that is described by more than one cfstr a simpler approach is to model separate sets of state variables that describe microorganisms in obf and lba sometimes called the apparent ks approach this method was described by baeten et al 2018 and applies greater half saturation concentrations to the rate expressions describing biofilms biomass retention in liquid and solids separation processes and physical selectors e g screens and hydrocyclones can be applied to these modeling approaches the migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model is more powerful than the apparent ks model but the apparent ks model may be useful to practitioners who have access to data that can be utilized to establish ki k values although this semi empirical modeling approach may be specific to data sources and may not be generally applicable both modeling approaches describe the portion of substrates in the bulk of the liquid that are transformed by obf and lba mathematical modeling has advanced mobile biofilms as a technology for municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment boltz et al 2017 sabba et al 2017 boltz and daigger 2022 presented a mobile biofilm reactor model that can be utilized in conjunction with the migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model numerical 1 d biofilm models that describe simultaneous diffusion and reaction and discretize the biofilm as a series of parallel layers are commonly utilized in engineering practice key 1 d biofilm model parameters are the biofilm area number of biofilm layers and mass transfer boundary layer mtbl thickness boltz et al 2011 the mtbl thickness changes in response to the extent of hydrodynamic shear forces that are applied to a biofilm surface boltz et al 2010 listed some commonly utilized mathematical expressions that describe mtbl thickness rittmann et al 2018 presented a framework for good biofilm reactor modeling practice gbrmp that provides guidance to model users who are selecting a mtbl thickness and other parameters 5 concluding remarks wastewater treatment processes that include biological and physical selectors accumulate a hybrid biomass that consists of obf and lba which include mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs substantially different redox zones can form inside the lba in which slow growing microorganisms can accumulate aerobic granules and densified biological flocs form in a continuously flowing wwt process if the wastewater composition and process configuration can sustain carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria of which psb and dpsb are particularly important hydrocyclones that receive waste solids have been utilized to retain aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in continuously flowing wwt processes on the one hand these systems usually are designed by considering the srt of each biological aggregate type k on the other hand researchers usually analyze them as biofilms a mobile biofilm consists of a migrating carrier and biofilm screens have been utilized to retain mobile biofilms and other lba the mobile biofilms in a continuously flowing wwt processes usually are retained by screens that can receive bioreactor effluent modes i and ii or waste solids mode iii properly designed screens can retain greater than 98 of mobile biofilms and other lba therefore mobile biofilm loss is marginal mobile biofilms can have settling characteristics like aerobic granules mobile biofilm processes 1 are analyzed as biofilms in engineering practice and research 2 provide a ssa that can be utilized for process analysis design and equipment specification and procurement and 3 can be utilized to meet a variety of wwt objectives continuously flowing wwt processes that incorporate biological and physical selectors can have a reduced footprint monetary costs and improve biological wwt process performance when compared to conventional activated sludge thus it is expected that both interest in and application of these processes will increase significantly in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential

14614,there have been significant advances in the use of biological and physical selectors for the intensification of continuously flowing biological wastewater treatment wwt processes biological selection allows for the development of large biological aggregates e g mobile biofilm aerobic granules and densified biological flocs physical selection controls the solids residence times of large biological aggregates and ordinary biological flocs and is usually accomplished using screens or hydrocyclones large biological aggregates can facilitate different biological transformations in a single reactor and enhance liquid and solids separation continuous flow wwt processes incorporating biological and physical selectors offer benefits that can include reduced footprint lower costs and improved wwt process performance thus it is expected that both interest in and application of these processes will increase significantly in the future this review provides a comprehensive summary of biological and physical selectors and their design and operation keywords biofilm granule wastewater selector intensification model data availability data in this paper was obtained from peer reviewed publications that are appropriately cited 1 introduction this review summarizes state of the art knowledge and experiences with the intensification of continuously flowing biological wastewater treatment wwt processes by forming and retaining large biological aggregates lba e g mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs and ordinary biological flocs obf these systems

mobile biofilm is defined here as a biofilm substratum that has a known mass dimensions and can move throughout a biological wwt process with or without accumulated obf the specific surface area ssa of a mobile biofilm mf 2 gc changes with biofilm thickness lf and migrating carrier dimensions and material according to boltz and daigger 2022 a migrating carrier that has a 250 kg m3 dry bulk density is described as a 500 μm diameter sphere and supports a 200 μm thick biofilm has a 0 16 mf 2 gc ssa aerobic granules do not require a migrating carrier because they are self immobilized and semi spherical biological aggregates with equivalent spherical diameters that are greater than 200 μm de kreuk et al 2007 densified biological flocs are like aerobic granules but can have equivalent spherical diameters that are less than or equal to 200 μm jin et al 2003 lbas are larger and denser than obf mass transfer resistances cause steep dissolved substrate concentration gradients in lba that are mostly perpendicular to the substratum or granule core these steep concentration gradients form different redox zones inside of lba slow growing bacteria can accumulate in these redox zones retaining lba in a biological wwt process also retains these slow growing bacteria a single bioreactor with lba and obf can facilitate multiple transformations mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs can have better settling characteristics than obf wei et al 2021 there is disparity between methods of analyzing obf mobile biofilms and aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in engineering practice and research ordinary biological flocs are analyzed in research and practice based on srt and settling characteristics mobile biofilms are analyzed in research and practice based on the biofilm area that is exposed to nutrients in the bulk of the water in research aerobic granules and densified biological flocs are analyzed as biofilms but their area that is exposed to the bulk of the water is difficult to define and can vary significantly aerobic granules sizes are widely distributed by substrate availability and local environmental conditions therefore srts of aerobic granules and densified biological flocs are often applied in engineering practice biological selection is defined here as the targeted accumulation of specific bacteria in lba a way of biological selection is to expose bacteria inside the lba to alternating cycles of substrate feast and famine and controlling lba and obf srts a goal of this type of biological selection is to accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria which are essential to forming aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in biological nutrient removal bnr and secondary wwt processes carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria grow more slowly than ordinary heterotrophic bacteria but their true biomass yields denoted as yh g codx g cods are similar de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 they accumulate when biological wwt processes cycle water and biomass through different environmental conditions and substrates concentrations that expose bacteria to simple dissolved organic substrate e g volatile fatty acids or vfa feast and famine bacteria feast when they consume simple dissolved organic substrate at a greater rate than it can be oxidized via respiration it requires a substantial readily biodegradable chemical oxygen demand rbcod concentration in wastewater a sufficiently long period without rbcod or famine is needed to re establish the storage capacities of these bacteria van loosdrecht et al 1997a beun et al 2000b carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria polymerize simple dissolved organic substrate and other compounds e g orthophosphate or po4 3 into biopolymers e g glycogen polyesters and polyphosphates and store them intracellularly barnard et al 2017 therefore fermentation of complex dissolved organic substrates into simple dissolved organic substrates is essential to the formation of aerobic granules and densified biological flocs carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria produce protein and carbohydrate extracellular polymeric substances eps wilén et al 2018 while the compositions of intra and extracellular biopolymers are quite different they both can be enzymatically hydrolyzed the eps in lba is mostly proteinaceous eps which is more adhesive than carbohydrate eps mcswain et al 2005 solids detaching from lba are expected to enhance biological floc densification due to the protein eps carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria can utilize a variety of electron acceptors that include dissolved oxygen and oxidized nitrogen compounds and have a competitive advantage over ordinary heterotrophic bacteria in biological wwt processes that expose bacteria to simple dissolved organic substrate feast and famine bioreactors and liquid and solids separation units may have reduced tank volumes and significantly improved liquid and solids separations efficiency with biological and physical selectors a space reduction of up to 50 and electricity reduction by 23 may occur when aerobic granules are utilized instead of conventional activated sludge bengtsson et al 2019 biological and physical selectors result in compact and high rate biological wwt processes and are adaptable to a variety of continuously flowing biological wwt processes 2 biological selection 2 1 aerobic granulation fundamentals aerobic granules can form in a reactor over a range of wastewater compositions and operating conditions heijnen and loosdrecht 1999 beun et al 1999 2000a 2001 beun et al 2002 they can be utilized to simultaneously transform cod nitrogen n and phosphorus p in wastewater biological selection for slow growing bacteria aerobic granule formation and bnr can be achieved by elongating the anaerobic feed period to a sequencing batch reactor ho et al 1996 aerobic granules were developed in such a system and retained by surface wasting van loosdrecht and de kreuk 2007 an anaerobic feeding period biologically selects for carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria that polymerize po4 3 or polyphosphate storing bacteria psb smolders et al 1994 biological aggregate morphology changes with simple dissolved organic substrate surface area loading rate salr and the shear stress that is applied to their surfaces tijhuis et al 1996 kwok et al 1998 a moderate salr and strong surface shear forces resulted in smooth and dense aerobic granules while a high salr and weak surface shear forces resulted in aerobic granules with rough surfaces the following criteria must be met to form and accumulate aerobic granules 1 grow and accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 2 maintain a sufficient simple dissolved organic substrate salr applied to aerobic granules in an anaerobic selector 3 strong surface shear forces tijhuis et al 1996 kwok et al 1998 and 4 physical selection boltz and daigger 2022 strubbe et al 2022 2 2 biological selection mechanisms cycling water and biomass between anaerobic and aerobic environments can cause bacteria to experience simple dissolved organic substrate feast and famine carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria transform simple dissolved organic substrates into biopolymers while feasting psb use polyphosphate and glycogen to produce adenosine triphosphate atp and transport vfa into their cell for storage as polyesters the stored polyesters are hydrolyzed during periods of simple dissolved organic substrate famine and result in the production of atp which is used to restore polyphosphate van loosdrecht et al 1997a mino et al 1998 seviour et al 2003 the atp is used to restore intracellular polyphosphate glycogen storing bacteria gsb and psb have a similar metabolic pathways but gsb do not store polyphosphates psb and gsb compete for common electron donors and acceptors granules that are primarily comprised of gsb can form without psb when acetate is the only electron donor bin et al 2015 wastewater influent to a bioreactor with an acetate to propionate ratio that is in the range of 1 1 and 3 1 and a ph that is greater than 7 5 will favor the accumulation of psb lopez vazquez et al 2009 a system with low concentrations of simple dissolved organic substrates will have difficulties accumulating a substantial mass of carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria a fermenting bioreactor can transform complex dissolved organic substrates into simple dissolved organic substrates liang et al 2021 the accumulation of fermenting heterotrophic bacteria facilitates biological nutrient removal and minimizes competition between heterotrophic and nitrifying autotrophic bacteria for common electron acceptors de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2004 denitrifying psb dpsb and glycogen storing bacteria dgsb reduce oxidized nitrogen compounds kuba et al 1996 ahn et al 2001 tsuneda et al 2006 polyesters such as poly β hydroxylkanoates pha are an energy source for carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria usually aerobic zone po4 3 utilization by psb is greater than po4 3 release by bacteria in an anaerobic zone consequently there is a net removal of po4 3 from water and psb can be removed from a wwt process comeau et al 1986 mino 2000 aerobic granules and densified biological flocs have formed while treating

selector is required to retain lba in a biological wwt process boltz and daigger 2022 strubbe et al 2022 physical selection consists of 1 separating smaller and slow settling biological aggregates e g obf and filamentous bacteria from larger denser and more rapidly settling aggregates e g lba 2 removing or wasting slow settling biological aggregates from a biological wwt process and 3 retaining larger denser and more rapidly settling aggregates over a several month period physical selection can support the development and accumulation of lba that are comprised of up to 90 mobile biofilms boltz and daigger 2022 and up to 70 aerobic granules and or densified biological flocs roche et al 2022 the lba can improve overall biomass settling characteristics table 1 summarizes peer reviewed literature describing continuous flow wwt systems that employed screens hydrocyclones or zone settlers as physical selectors 3 1 physical selectors screens and hydrocyclones have been utilized as physical selectors with laboratory pilot and full scale biological wwt processes screens separate biological aggregates by their size van winckel et al 2019 sturm et al 2020 wei et al 2021 screens

van winckel et al 2019 reported that screens were 72 and hydrocyclones were 42 efficient at retaining aerobic granules screens can retain better than 98 of mobile biofilms boltz and daigger 2022 screens and hydrocyclones are easy to operate and maintain and have the advantages of being compact and easy to integrate with an existing wwtp the retention aerobic granules and densified biological flocs by hydrocyclones depends on the existence of granule forming conditions and can change with time as aerobic granules and or densified biological flocs form and accumulate stacked two zone settlers separate biological aggregates by their settling characteristics an et al 2021 sun et al 2019 xu et al 2022 and have been utilized as physical selectors with laboratory up to 140 l an et al

al 2021 regmi et al 2022 and roche et al 2022 reported data that pertaining to obf srts and 30 minute sludge volume indicies svi30 observed for full scale wwtps with biological and physical selectors relatively brief obf srts of 6 10 and 13 days resulted in stable svi values of 77 17 83 22 and 41 7 ml g tss respectively gemza et al 2022 reported seasonal variations in svi that ranged from 40 ml g in summer to 165 ml g in winter and changes in densified biological floc diameters when the biological wwt process had a 26 4 day srt of obf sandino et al 2016 and willoughby et al 2018 reported svi values in the range of 130 to 200 ml g while operating a wwtp with a 25 to 30 day srt of obf but observed that the biomass settling characteristics improved i e svi30 in the range of 47 to 80 ml g when the srt of obf was less than 10 days wastewater treatment plant operators can adjust obf srt and physical selector properties to maximize the accumulations of lba ordinary biological flocs and lba usually have different srts table 2 lists obf and lba srts calculated for full scale and continuously flowing wwt processes with biological and physical selection avila et al 2021 regmi et al 2022 roche et al 2022 4 implementation considerations 4 1 biological selector design the concept of configuring the initial section of a biological reactor with a low dispersion number and an adequate substrate concentration gradient to accumulate carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria and de select for filamentous microorganisms was introduced by chudoba et al 1973 the initial bioreactor section can have a relatively small volume when compared to other sections of the bioreactor receive influent wastewater and return sludge high rbcod uptake rate and nearly complete rbcod removal jenkins et al 1993 biological selection is commonly applied in engineering practice and has been used to remove nutrients from wastewater and minimize sludge bulking or the undesired accumulations of filamentous microorganisms sludge bulking can result in secondary clarifier failure and constrain the capacity of an activated sludge process jenkins et al 2004 wanner 1994 parker et al 2003 key considerations for the design and implementation of biological selectors include 1 wastewater composition 2 hydraulic retention time hrt 3 food to microorganism ratio f m and 4 classifying selector design parker et al 2005 and daigger et al 2018 described biological selectors in full scale biological wwt processes table 3 summarizes works that assessed biological selector design and operation 4 1 1 wastewater composition the quantity of contaminants that flow into a wwtp can vary the composition of wastewater and seasonal variability in this composition influence biological wwt process performance and are important to consider when designing a biological selector fig 4 presents monthly variability in the rbcod concentration in wastewater that is influent to an example municipal wwtp during one year of operation low temperatures caused reduced fermentation in the wastewater collection and conveyance system that led to this wwtp hence significantly less simple dissolved organic substrate concentrations were observed in the influent wastewater during winter months wwtps operate with a longer srt to compensate for slower biological transformation rates when the wastewater has lower temperatures which results in a f m that is too low for biological selection consequently conditions are not ideal for aerobic granule formation or biological floc densification 4 1 2 hrt and f m hrt and f m are important parameters for designing biological selectors fig 5 plots svi as a function of hrt and rbcod percent removal in a pilot scale biological selector svi reduces as the percent of rbcod transformed increases based on successful applications a hrt ranging from 45 to 60 min is usually sufficient to provide substantial rbcod removal and a high uptake rate most of the rbcod is transformed to simple dissolved organic substrate in a fermenter which prevents rbcod from entering downstream aerobic zone and de selects for filamentous microorganisms while creating conditions that are suitable for aerobic granule formation and biological floc densification shao and jenkins 1989 jenkins et al 2004 kruit et al 2002 the f m can be used to design biological selectors sturm et al 2020 parameters for the calculation of f m include the influent rbcod load kg cod d biological selector volume m3 and the ss concentration in the biological selector g ss m3 giving kg cod kg ss d from a practical and operational perspective the only variables available to change the f m ratio are the srt and the return sludge volumetric flow rate design guidelines for f m in biological selectors vary and depend on the type of biological selector i e aerobic anoxic or anaerobic research pertaining to biological selector design for biological floc densification demonstrated that anaerobic biological selectors require f m ratios ranging from 0 5 to 1 5 kg cod kg ss d multiple compartments reactors in series are required in biological selectors to ensure that a desired f m is maintained over a range of possible rbcod concentrations in the influent wastewater and minimize rbcod breakthrough to the downstream aerobic sections 4 1 3 classifying selector design foam causing microorganisms have created nuisance conditions and poor solids settling in full scale wwtps over a wide range of operating conditions classifying selectors parker et al 2003 parker et al 2014 can minimize foam causing microorganisms and prevent nuisance foams the term classifying selector refers to the mechanism by which foam causing microorganisms are de selected foam removal upon its formation can minimize the accumulation of foam causing microorganisms classifying selectors usually are designed to operate on a continuous basis parker et al 2003 summarized classifying selectors as having the following essential features 1 no foam trapping 2 biomass collected in an aerated channel or tank that provides a 10 min hrt 3 baffle the water surface and direct the surface solids to a weir 4 continuous flow over the weir 5 continuous or nearly continuous wasted solids pumping to a thickener and 6 deselect for foam causing microorganisms 4 1 4 other design considerations it is necessary to promote plug flow and eliminate uncontrolled back mixing in a biological selector the design of a biological selector should employ submerged walls to prevent floating material entrapment floating material is unsightly can be odorous and may unintentionally select for filamentous microorganisms each of the submerged baffle walls should allow for a 0 5 inch head loss at the design conditions an opening at the bottom of the baffle will allow filling and draining of the compartment and eliminate the need for the baffle walls to structurally withstand a hydraulic load 4 2 physical selector design physical selectors control the srts of lba and obf in a biological wwt process physical selector design considerations can include the type of physical selector screen orifice size and cleaning mechanism boltz and daigger 2022 and hydrocyclone pressure dimensions and underflow nozzle aperture diameter ford 2018 partin 2019 guo et al 2022 this sub section describes some physical selector design considerations 4 2 1 overflow and underflow physical selectors usually have an influent underflow and overflow screens retain lba and return them to a bioreactor in overflow with an efficiency that is described by eq 5 hydrocyclones retain lba and return them to a bioreactor in underflow with an efficiency that is described by eq 6 screens can receive solids and water by gravity or pump and usually convey lba with screen wash water hydrocyclone underflow and overflow flows by gravity because back pressure can reduce lba and obf separation efficiency obf can be removed from a biological wwt process by pumping ideally lba will flow to the bioreactor by gravity but a low head and friction pump can be utilized if underflow pumping is required 4 2 2 screens a screen with circular orifices is recommended but a wire mesh will suffice a rotary drum screen that retains lba usually has a hydraulic loading rate hlr that is in the range of 70 to 120 m3 h screen and requires a wash water volumetric flow rate up to 35 m3 day screen typically wastewater influent to a screen that is utilized for physical selection has a tss concentrations less than 6000 g tss m3 but additional experience may allow this value to be revised upward and applied to different types of screens boltz and daigger 2022 4 2 3 hydrocyclone pressure hydrocyclones target feed pressure is about 240 kgpascal kpa and has an allowable range of 220 to 255 kpa when they are utilized as physical selectors roche et al 2022 increasing operating pressure will increase the amount of lba in the underflow 4 2 4 thickening and dewatering screens that are utilized as physical selectors do not increase the hlr that is applied to waste solids thickening units hydrocyclones increase the hlr that is applied to waste solids thickening units because of a need to account for hydrocyclones under and overflows some waste solids thickening units e g daf are not hydraulically limited and provide more flexibility when they are utilized with hydrocyclones 4 2 5 raw sewage screening raw sewage screens that have openings with sizes that are in the range of 0 5 to 6 0 mm are usually utilized with physical selectors a grinder or strainer may be incorporated with the influent pipe for waste solids to minimize physical selector clogging primary clarifiers typically remove debris from wastewater that may clog hydrocyclones or screens 4 2 6 mixing and aeration bioreactors must include means of mixing water that contains lba and obf a minimum input of mixing energy is required throughout the reactor to prevent unintended settling it may be necessary to include separate diffused aeration and mixing systems in bioreactors that utilize advanced aeration control or experience periods during which there is a low air flow velocity 4 3 mobile biofilm processes mobile biofilm processes can be utilized to treat municipal and industrial wastewater with and without strong granule forming conditions migrating carriers can be comprised of different materials boltz et al 2018 boltz and daigger 2022 described three modes of mobile biofilm process operation the first mode of operation mode i has a mobile biofilm reactor and a mobile biofilm retention screen that is downstream from a bioreactor and upstream of liquid and solid separation modes ii and iii have a hybrid i e mobile biofilms and obf bioreactor and liquid and solid separation mode ii includes a mobile biofilm retention screen that is downstream from a hybrid bioreactor and upstream of liquid and solid separation mode iii includes mobile biofilm retention screen that is external to a hybrid bioreactor and liquid and solid separation receives waste solids and accumulates rapidly settling mobile biofilms mobile biofilms offer an alternative to the plastic biofilm carriers that are usually associated with integrated fixed film activated sludge ifas and moving bed biofilm reactors mbbrs and to aerobic granules and densified biological flocs for continuously flowing wwt processes mobile biofilm processes are compatible with a variety of operating schemes and process configurations and minimize new infrastructure without plastic biofilm carriers or stainless steel air diffusers mobile biofilms can have settling velocities that are comparable to aerobic granules wei et al 2021 4 4 mathematical modeling mathematical modeling is an integral part of engineering practice modeling of lba is complicated because 1 they behave as biofilms and this behavior must be accounted for in the model 2 the physical characteristics of lba are variable and sometimes poorly defined and 3 lba must be modeled with obf two approaches to modeling lba are described in this section that include a migrating carrier and one dimensional 1 d biofilm model and an apparent half saturation concentration of substrate i ki model obf and lba can be simultaneously modeled in a continuously flowing stirred tank reactor cfstr or series of cfstrs this approach has been applied in engineering practice to simulate ifas processes that have biofilms retained in a bioreactor by wall screens and grow on plastic biofilm or migrating carriers from a modeling point of view a key difference between reactors that utilize plastic biofilm carriers and mobile biofilms is the movement of mobile biofilms throughout a bioreactor a migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model described by boltz et al 2017 includes a model of obf and a numerical 1 d biofilm model in a cfstr and describes mobile biofilm movement throughout a simulated wwt process that is described by more than one cfstr a simpler approach is to model separate sets of state variables that describe microorganisms in obf and lba sometimes called the apparent ks approach this method was described by baeten et al 2018 and applies greater half saturation concentrations to the rate expressions describing biofilms biomass retention in liquid and solids separation processes and physical selectors e g screens and hydrocyclones can be applied to these modeling approaches the migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model is more powerful than the apparent ks model but the apparent ks model may be useful to practitioners who have access to data that can be utilized to establish ki k values although this semi empirical modeling approach may be specific to data sources and may not be generally applicable both modeling approaches describe the portion of substrates in the bulk of the liquid that are transformed by obf and lba mathematical modeling has advanced mobile biofilms as a technology for municipal and or industrial wastewater treatment boltz et al 2017 sabba et al 2017 boltz and daigger 2022 presented a mobile biofilm reactor model that can be utilized in conjunction with the migrating carrier and 1 d biofilm model numerical 1 d biofilm models that describe simultaneous diffusion and reaction and discretize the biofilm as a series of parallel layers are commonly utilized in engineering practice key 1 d biofilm model parameters are the biofilm area number of biofilm layers and mass transfer boundary layer mtbl thickness boltz et al 2011 the mtbl thickness changes in response to the extent of hydrodynamic shear forces that are applied to a biofilm surface boltz et al 2010 listed some commonly utilized mathematical expressions that describe mtbl thickness rittmann et al 2018 presented a framework for good biofilm reactor modeling practice gbrmp that provides guidance to model users who are selecting a mtbl thickness and other parameters 5 concluding remarks wastewater treatment processes that include biological and physical selectors accumulate a hybrid biomass that consists of obf and lba which include mobile biofilms aerobic granules and densified biological flocs substantially different redox zones can form inside the lba in which slow growing microorganisms can accumulate aerobic granules and densified biological flocs form in a continuously flowing wwt process if the wastewater composition and process configuration can sustain carbon storing heterotrophic bacteria of which psb and dpsb are particularly important hydrocyclones that receive waste solids have been utilized to retain aerobic granules and densified biological flocs in continuously flowing wwt processes on the one hand these systems usually are designed by considering the srt of each biological aggregate type k on the other hand researchers usually analyze them as biofilms a mobile biofilm consists of a migrating carrier and biofilm screens have been utilized to retain mobile biofilms and other lba the mobile biofilms in a continuously flowing wwt processes usually are retained by screens that can receive bioreactor effluent modes i and ii or waste solids mode iii properly designed screens can retain greater than 98 of mobile biofilms and other lba therefore mobile biofilm loss is marginal mobile biofilms can have settling characteristics like aerobic granules mobile biofilm processes 1 are analyzed as biofilms in engineering practice and research 2 provide a ssa that can be utilized for process analysis design and equipment specification and procurement and 3 can be utilized to meet a variety of wwt objectives continuously flowing wwt processes that incorporate biological and physical selectors can have a reduced footprint monetary costs and improve biological wwt process performance when compared to conventional activated sludge thus it is expected that both interest in and application of these processes will increase significantly in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests personal relationships which may be considered as potential
