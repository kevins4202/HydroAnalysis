various areas of bam city kerman province iran the specific goals focused on determining the physicochemical properties of the water of each of the sampled wells the spatial distribution of three pollutants fluoride arsenic and nitrate using the gis technique in the assessed area and the assessment of cancerous and non cancerous health risks of well water the acquired results of this research can help better planning for water resources and public health in cities with such contaminants 2 material and method 2 1 description of the investigated areas bam is one of the historical cities in the kerman province iran with a population of 318 241 people this city has a warm and arid climate and is located in geographical coordination of 29 6 n and 58 21 e and an elevation of 1050 m the average annual temperature humidity and rainfall in bam are 25 c 39 5 and 68 mm halimi et al 2016 the drinking water in bam city is supplied via the ground and surface water sources fig 1 indicates the location of bam in iran and the distribution of sampling sites 2 2 sampling procedure and measurements sampling was carried out three times between july 2018 and july 2019 in this research 20 samples were taken from the drinking water of different areas of bam coded as a1 to a20 for performing this work a high density polypropylene bottle rinsed three times with the double distilled water before usage was used the samples of drinking water were pick up from the wells which are served as the bam water reservoir fig 1 the concentration of as in well water samples was determined by the varian aa240 atomic absorption spectrometer fluoride content in all samples was measured based on the spadns 4500f d method singh et al 2020 the analyses of no3 were carried out using according to the awwa method method no 4500 no3 b the analysis of no3 content in well water samples was conducted by a spectrophotometer device unico 2100 at a wavelength of 220 nm schullehner et al 2018 2 3 estimating health risks health risk assessment hra is a practical method to approximate the health impact potential of the desired contaminants at a specified concentration for humans through one or more exposure ways sohrabi et al 2020 hra is a valuable method for the quantitative determination of potential risk control and tracking of toxins in different areas of the environment therefore the well water quality and the carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic health risks of three pollutants as f and no3 were assessed through drinking of potable water for bam citizenships adults and children risk assessment was performed by applying the average values of cancerous and non cancerous contaminants in the samples of well water the suggested method by the us epa was applied for assessing the risks amiri et al 2020 khan et al 2020 based on the usepa suggestion the following formulas were used to calculate the numerical values of cdi mg kg day of the desired elements via ingestion and dermal contact routes 1 c d i i n g e s t i o n c d i e f e d b w a t 2 c d i d e r m e a l c s a k p e t e f e d b w a t table 1 displays factors descriptions and assumptions for exposure assessment of

rfding derm describes a chronic ingestion dermal reference dose used to assess a daily ingestion dermal exposure rate for the human population the rfddrem values for as f and no3 were considered as 0 000123 0 00002 and 0 000075 respectively rezaei et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 to measure the combined potential risks of the studied contaminants in the well water samples the chronic hazard index hi of the contaminants was explored this factor is the total estimates of hqing derm for the individual variable a hi value lower 1 indicates no remarkable non carcinogenic risks a numerical value 1 means the value of non carcinogenic risk has a direct relationship with hq or hi value the hi value is quantified by the following equation 4 hi hq cancerous risk cr via the oral pathway has been assessed by eq 5 5 cr cdi csf where cr displays the cancerous risk through the oral pathway and csf denotes the carcinogenic slope factor the csf value for as and no3 is 1 50 mg kg day and 10 5 mg kg day respectively ahmed et al 2004 darvishmotevalli et al 2019 if the estimated values for cr is varied from 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 it reflects an acceptable status if it is greater than 1 10 6 the risk of the studied factor explains unacceptable briki et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the content of as f and no3 in bam well water the quality and health of drinking water is an international issue the lack of proper management and financial constraints are two important problems in developing countries like iran many regions of iran country are affected by arid and semi arid climate thus water supplies and management face challenges pirsaheb et al 2013 public health and the sustainable development of society can be endangered by the scarcity of water resources in this study the samples of water were examined for factors like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds hardness value alkalinity value as f and no3 according to who guidelines jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 the maximum permissible levels of ec tds chloride total hardness were 1400 μs cm 1500 mg l 200 300 mg l and 500 mg l caco3 also the ph value and the taste thresholds of chloride are allowed in the ranges of 6 50 8 50 and 200 300 mg l for drinking purposes respectively table 2 shows the content of as f and no3 in the drinking water of bam generally based on results the mean concentrations of the studied parameters including ph alkalinity total hardness chlorine and total dissolved solid were lower than the standard values recommended by who only the average level of electrical conductivity was higher than the mentioned standard based on the results listed in table 2 all the concentrations quantity of f and no3 were less than the standard suggested by the who but the arsenic level was greater than the mentioned standard the arsenic as concentration in studied samples has been ranged from 9 26 to 14 65 μg l concentrations of as in most samples were observed more than the proposed guideline 0 01 mg l by an authorized organization like who the high quantity of as in the area can be linked to the infiltration of rainwater from arsenic containing formations or leakage of wastewater from industrial and mining activities cheung et al 2020 the arsenic concentration in natural waters is relatively low and most regions include concentrations lower than 1 μg l zhang et al 2019 reduced arsenic from iron ores and its oxidation in sulfide mines is the main reason for the increase of this element arsenic in groundwater sources guo et al 2014 furthermore anthropogenic activities like mining in the as containing deposits and the production of as laden pesticides enhance the level of groundwater arsenic zhang et al 2019 in a study the average content of as in water in the sewakht a rural part and chitral city an urban part zones were 2 and 2 μg l respectively ur rehman et al 2020 another study has reported that the level of arsenic in groundwater is 0 0012 0 0190 mg l mean 0 0054 mg l and more than 2 50 of groundwater samples surpassed the national standard value for drinking 0 01 mg l zhang et al 2019 the f content in the potable water of the studied area was detected in the span of 0 91 1 12 mg l in this work the f value in the samples of drinking water was lower than the who guideline both surface and well waters are served as the potable water sources in the bam area the feature of the land formations of each zone affects f concentration in groundwater in some iranian areas f at high concentrations has been observed in groundwater aghdasi et al 2014 have found f with a concentration of 2 35 mg l in the potable water in poldasht city aghdasi et al 2014 in another study the mean f content in potable water in the khash iran was stated to be 0 731 mg l azhdarpoor et al 2018 the content value of f in potable water in northern china the fluorosis areas was measured to be 0 01 6 30 mg l zhang et al 2020 from table 2 the mean content of no3 in potable water extracted from wells was analyzed to be 8 50 10 85 mg l for the collected samples the content of no3 was less than the who standard level such nitrate content was recorded for other parts of iran aghdasi et al 2014 rezaei et al 2019 generally water sources are divided into three groups in terms of nitrate pollution i very contaminated no 3 45 mg l ii contaminated no 3 between 20 and 45 mg l and iii marginally contaminated no 3 20 mg l rezaei et al 2019 accordingly the well water of the bam area was slightly polluted to nitrate the no3 content of the groundwater of the nanganur zone southern india was reported 25 198 mg l average 66 14 mg l adimalla and qian 2019 the spatial distribution of as f and no 3 pollutants in the studied groundwater were applied using arcgis 10 3 to predict pollutant content in the area fig 2 for geostatistical analysis the inverse distance weighted idw model interpolation was used as can see fig 2 the maximum concentrations of as f and no 3 were observed in the sampling points of a18 a6 and a5 respectively 3 2 hra the concentrations of f no3 and as measured in the surveyed area were used to assess the chronic daily intakes cdi factor via contact pathways ingestion and dermal the health risk associated with adults and children was approximated for the three mentioned contaminants the findings of the cdi factor are shown in table 3 base on the data provided in this table the oral route is the most pre eminent exposure route for studied pollutants 3 2 1 non carcinogenic risk levels potential health risks from human exposure to environmental pollutants are estimated using the parameter of hq table 4 shows the hq quantity of as f and no3 in water for adults and children for arsenic metalloid all sample points with except one case had oral hq more than unity for both groups children and adults signifying remarkable harm to humans being but dermal hq value was less than one showing no risk for the aforementioned groups the average risk of as was assessed to be 5 372 for oral hq and 1 407 for dermal hq which were more than the critical value set by the usepa ahmed et al 2004 usepa 2018 the hq values for the groundwater samples collected from the kohistan region north pakistan were smaller than 1 which reflected that the water has an acceptable level from a health point of view muhammad et al 2010 in a study the risk of arsenic metalloid exposure through the drinking of groundwater in ha nam province vietnam was assessed and based on the findings 100 and 42 of untreated and treated groundwater users were below non carcinogenic effect bang et al 2009 for f hq values for children were above one for study areas while all hq quantity for adults was below one the findings indicated that children had a higher level of hq compared to adults this is because children bw is less than adults consequently this group is a hypersensitive population yousefi et al 2018 the f exposure via water ingestion in poldasht iran revealed that children group were at severe risk of fluorosis compared to adults yousefi et al 2018 in an area in northwest china f health risk in rural residents was evaluated and infants and children were known as the most vulnerable group chen et al 2017 another study in tunisia determined that children were more vulnerable to f health risks guissouma et al 2017 from fig 3 the numerical data of oral dermal hq for both groups obtained smaller than unity for no 3 according to the results the content of no3 in bam city is smaller than in other aforementioned areas which may be corresponded to the geological formation and it may also be linked to using of fertilizer in various areas of iran the studies about the adverse impacts of no3 on adult health are little sadler et al 2016 stated that the consumption of water containing high no3 can increase the risk of birth defects in sensitive individuals during the first 3 months of the pregnancy sadler et al 2016 radfard co workers 2018 have indicated that the hq value for all studied groups infants children teenagers and adults was 1 in 96 of water samples collected from the local areas of an iranian city radfard et al 2018 annually 2300 to 12 594 cancer cases have been attributed to no3 in the us of which 54 82 are colorectal cancer cases temkin et al 2019 overall the values of the hq for the oral pathway were much more than those of the dermal one among the studied pollutants arsenic metalloid had the highest contribution fig 3 shows hi values of as metalloid f and no3 in water for children and adults for all studied wells except for a3 values of hi of as were measured above one for children and adults indicating non cancerous health risk due to intake of this pollutant in all study areas the hi values for f were above one for children and below one for adults for no 3 all groundwater samples were safe and the health risk values were lower than one for both groups the numerical values of the hazard index in groundwater resources of bihar india were determined 0 9 to 10 for the vaishali area and 10 40 to 40 47 for the bhagalpur area singh et al 2014 3 2 2 carcinogenic risk cr levels in this research the cr value of as and no 3 through oral pathway were determined for adults and children according to the approach suggested by the usepa fig 4 demonstrates carcinogenic risks values of as and no 3 in samples of well water via oral ingestion intake for adults children the cr quantity for as metalloid in potable water of all areas for children was greater than the guideline limit of the usepa risk assessment 1 10 4 usepa 2018 according to the results drinking as polluted water may cause carcinogenicity but no specific types of cancer have been documented to as in this research the common types of cancer like skin kidney and bladder cancers were created by exposure to as polluted water sadeghi et al 2018 from fig 4 nitrate cr values for all sampling points for adults were in the range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 which shows that drinking water is safe the ingestion of potable water containing a high level of no 3 may create serious health risks and toxicity in humans methemoglobinaemia in infants and pregnant women is a famous instance of no3 toxicity also no 3 causes respiratory trouble gastric cancer thyroid gland hypertrophy headache and fatigue and multiple sclerosis in adults ahada and suthar 2018 generally the results showed that the carcinogenicity ratio in children to adults is equal to 3 8 for as and 2 33 for no3 in addition to the content of elements in potable water other factors like geography the amount of water intake and residents lifestyle may cause cancer ore wastes and mine tailings include a large mass of heavy metal loid s which enter into the neighboring environment via oxidation and reduction process and then pollute the surface and ground waters concas et al 2006 in a study the as level in the cerrito blanco zone was observed 5 9 mg l which was 100 folds higher than the who guideline thus indicating a serious hygiene risk razo et al 2004 4 conclusion in this study the concentration of nitrate fluoride and arsenic and physicochemical characteristics of well water in bam city kerman province iran were explored then the distribution of pollutants and their cancerous and non cancerous risks for children and adults were studied the hra findings showed that the mean risk of as metalloid was 5 37 for oral hq and 1 40 for dermal hq which were more than the critical value established by the usepa the mean concentrations of fluoride and no3 were lower than the standards recommended by who only the average level of as was higher than the mentioned standard the non cancerous and cancerous risk values had the order of children adults among the studied pollutants only the cr values of as was more than ones health and utility departments should have more coordination and communication to solve the problem of pollution due to the high hra and cr of arsenic in the experimental samples it is suggested that in future studies diseases related to this parameter be further investigated among the population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known conflict of interest that may obscure or affect their judgment to influence the work

the value of non carcinogenic risk has a direct relationship with hq or hi value the hi value is quantified by the following equation 4 hi hq cancerous risk cr via the oral pathway has been assessed by eq 5 5 cr cdi csf where cr displays the cancerous risk through the oral pathway and csf denotes the carcinogenic slope factor the csf value for as and no3 is 1 50 mg kg day and 10 5 mg kg day respectively ahmed et al 2004 darvishmotevalli et al 2019 if the estimated values for cr is varied from 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 it reflects an acceptable status if it is greater than 1 10 6 the risk of the studied factor explains unacceptable briki et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of the content of as f and no3 in bam well water the quality and health of drinking water is an international issue the lack of proper management and financial constraints are two important problems in developing countries like iran many regions of iran country are affected by arid and semi arid climate thus water supplies and management face challenges pirsaheb et al 2013 public health and the sustainable development of society can be endangered by the scarcity of water resources in this study the samples of water were examined for factors like ph electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds hardness value alkalinity value as f and no3 according to who guidelines jamshidzadeh and mirbagheri 2011 the maximum permissible levels of ec tds chloride total hardness were 1400 μs cm 1500 mg l 200 300 mg l and 500 mg l caco3 also the ph value and the taste thresholds of chloride are allowed in the ranges of 6 50 8 50 and 200 300 mg l for drinking purposes respectively table 2 shows the content of as f and no3 in the drinking water of bam generally based on results the mean concentrations of the studied parameters including ph alkalinity total hardness chlorine and total dissolved solid were lower than the standard values recommended by who only the average level of electrical conductivity was higher than the mentioned standard based on the results listed in table 2 all the concentrations quantity of f and no3 were less than the standard suggested by the who but the arsenic level was greater than the mentioned standard the arsenic as concentration in studied samples has been ranged from 9 26 to 14 65 μg l concentrations of as in most samples were observed more than the proposed guideline 0 01 mg l by an authorized organization like who the high quantity of as in the area can be linked to the infiltration of rainwater from arsenic containing formations or leakage of wastewater from industrial and mining activities cheung et al 2020 the arsenic concentration in natural waters is relatively low and most regions include concentrations lower than 1 μg l zhang et al 2019 reduced arsenic from iron ores and its oxidation in sulfide mines is the main reason for the increase of this element arsenic in groundwater sources guo et al 2014 furthermore anthropogenic activities like mining in the as containing deposits and the production of as laden pesticides enhance the level of groundwater arsenic zhang et al 2019 in a study the average content of as in water in the sewakht a rural part and chitral city an urban part zones were 2 and 2 μg l respectively ur rehman et al 2020 another study has reported that the level of arsenic in groundwater is 0 0012 0 0190 mg l mean 0 0054 mg l and more than 2 50 of groundwater samples surpassed the national standard value for drinking 0 01 mg l zhang et al 2019 the f content in the potable water of the studied area was detected in the span of 0 91 1 12 mg l in this work the f value in the samples of drinking water was lower than the who guideline both surface and well waters are served as the potable water sources in the bam area the feature of the land formations of each zone affects f concentration in groundwater in some iranian areas f at high concentrations has been observed in groundwater aghdasi et al 2014 have found f with a concentration of 2 35 mg l in the potable water in poldasht city aghdasi et al 2014 in another study the mean f content in potable water in the khash iran was stated to be 0 731 mg l azhdarpoor et al 2018 the content value of f in potable water in northern china the fluorosis areas was measured to be 0 01 6 30 mg l zhang et al 2020 from table 2 the mean content of no3 in potable water extracted from wells was analyzed to be 8 50 10 85 mg l for the collected samples the content of no3 was less than the who standard level such nitrate content was recorded for other parts of iran aghdasi et al 2014 rezaei et al 2019 generally water sources are divided into three groups in terms of nitrate pollution i very contaminated no 3 45 mg l ii contaminated no 3 between 20 and 45 mg l and iii marginally contaminated no 3 20 mg l rezaei et al 2019 accordingly the well water of the bam area was slightly polluted to nitrate the no3 content of the groundwater of the nanganur zone southern india was reported 25 198 mg l average 66 14 mg l adimalla and qian 2019 the spatial distribution of as f and no 3 pollutants in the studied groundwater were applied using arcgis 10 3 to predict pollutant content in the area fig 2 for geostatistical analysis the inverse distance weighted idw model interpolation was used as can see fig 2 the maximum concentrations of as f and no 3 were observed in the sampling points of a18 a6 and a5 respectively 3 2 hra the concentrations of f no3 and as measured in the surveyed area were used to assess the chronic daily intakes cdi factor via contact pathways ingestion and dermal the health risk associated with adults and children was approximated for the three mentioned contaminants the findings of the cdi factor are shown in table 3 base on the data provided in this table the oral route is the most pre eminent exposure route for studied pollutants 3 2 1 non carcinogenic risk levels potential health risks from human exposure to environmental pollutants are estimated using the parameter of hq table 4 shows the hq quantity of as f and no3 in water for adults and children for arsenic metalloid all sample points with except one case had oral hq more than unity for both groups children and adults signifying remarkable harm to humans being but dermal hq value was less than one showing no risk for the aforementioned groups the average risk of as was assessed to be 5 372 for oral hq and 1 407 for dermal hq which were more than the critical value set by the usepa ahmed et al 2004 usepa 2018 the hq values for the groundwater samples collected from the kohistan region north pakistan were smaller than 1 which reflected that the water has an acceptable level from a health point of view muhammad et al 2010 in a study the risk of arsenic metalloid exposure through the drinking of groundwater in ha nam province vietnam was assessed and based on the findings 100 and 42 of untreated and treated groundwater users were below non carcinogenic effect bang et al 2009 for f hq values for children were above one for study areas while all hq quantity for adults was below one the findings indicated that children had a higher level of hq compared to adults this is because children bw is less than adults consequently this group is a hypersensitive population yousefi et al 2018 the f exposure via water ingestion in poldasht iran revealed that children group were at severe risk of fluorosis compared to adults yousefi et al 2018 in an area in northwest china f health risk in rural residents was evaluated and infants and children were known as the most vulnerable group chen et al 2017 another study in tunisia determined that children were more vulnerable to f health risks guissouma et al 2017 from fig 3 the numerical data of oral dermal hq for both groups obtained smaller than unity for no 3 according to the results the content of no3 in bam city is smaller than in other aforementioned areas which may be corresponded to the geological formation and it may also be linked to using of fertilizer in various areas of iran the studies about the adverse impacts of no3 on adult health are little sadler et al 2016 stated that the consumption of water containing high no3 can increase the risk of birth defects in sensitive individuals during the first 3 months of the pregnancy sadler et al 2016 radfard co workers 2018 have indicated that the hq value for all studied groups infants children teenagers and adults was 1 in 96 of water samples collected from the local areas of an iranian city radfard et al 2018 annually 2300 to 12 594 cancer cases have been attributed to no3 in the us of which 54 82 are colorectal cancer cases temkin et al 2019 overall the values of the hq for the oral pathway were much more than those of the dermal one among the studied pollutants arsenic metalloid had the highest contribution fig 3 shows hi values of as metalloid f and no3 in water for children and adults for all studied wells except for a3 values of hi of as were measured above one for children and adults indicating non cancerous health risk due to intake of this pollutant in all study areas the hi values for f were above one for children and below one for adults for no 3 all groundwater samples were safe and the health risk values were lower than one for both groups the numerical values of the hazard index in groundwater resources of bihar india were determined 0 9 to 10 for the vaishali area and 10 40 to 40 47 for the bhagalpur area singh et al 2014 3 2 2 carcinogenic risk cr levels in this research the cr value of as and no 3 through oral pathway were determined for adults and children according to the approach suggested by the usepa fig 4 demonstrates carcinogenic risks values of as and no 3 in samples of well water via oral ingestion intake for adults children the cr quantity for as metalloid in potable water of all areas for children was greater than the guideline limit of the usepa risk assessment 1 10 4 usepa 2018 according to the results drinking as polluted water may cause carcinogenicity but no specific types of cancer have been documented to as in this research the common types of cancer like skin kidney and bladder cancers were created by exposure to as polluted water sadeghi et al 2018 from fig 4 nitrate cr values for all sampling points for adults were in the range of 1 10 6 to 1 10 4 which shows that drinking water is safe the ingestion of potable water containing a high level of no 3 may create serious health risks and toxicity in humans methemoglobinaemia in infants and pregnant women is a famous instance of no3 toxicity also no 3 causes respiratory trouble gastric cancer thyroid gland hypertrophy headache and fatigue and multiple sclerosis in adults ahada and suthar 2018 generally the results showed that the carcinogenicity ratio in children to adults is equal to 3 8 for as and 2 33 for no3 in addition to the content of elements in potable water other factors like geography the amount of water intake and residents lifestyle may cause cancer ore wastes and mine tailings include a large mass of heavy metal loid s which enter into the neighboring environment via oxidation and reduction process and then pollute the surface and ground waters concas et al 2006 in a study the as level in the cerrito blanco zone was observed 5 9 mg l which was 100 folds higher than the who guideline thus indicating a serious hygiene risk razo et al 2004 4 conclusion in this study the concentration of nitrate fluoride and arsenic and physicochemical characteristics of well water in bam city kerman province iran were explored then the distribution of pollutants and their cancerous and non cancerous risks for children and adults were studied the hra findings showed that the mean risk of as metalloid was 5 37 for oral hq and 1 40 for dermal hq which were more than the critical value established by the usepa the mean concentrations of fluoride and no3 were lower than the standards recommended by who only the average level of as was higher than the mentioned standard the non cancerous and cancerous risk values had the order of children adults among the studied pollutants only the cr values of as was more than ones health and utility departments should have more coordination and communication to solve the problem of pollution due to the high hra and cr of arsenic in the experimental samples it is suggested that in future studies diseases related to this parameter be further investigated among the population declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known conflict of interest that may obscure or affect their judgment to influence the work

adults and children population is a positive agreement with the potential health risk chandrajith et al 2020 present the geogenic as and f contamination in sri lankan groundwater known since the past 30 years this study shows that the numerous dry regions semi arid conditions of sri lanka are affected by excessive quantities of f in the groundwater due to low precipitation and high evaporation where dental fluorosis skeletal fluorosis and chronic kidney disease are prevalent in sri lanka over 80 of the population uses groundwater for drinking purposes where 50 of wells in the dry zone regions have high f 1 0 mg l levels furthermore the f content was higher in deep wells versus shallow wells however the as in groundwater is not yet considered as a serious issue in sri lanka particularly in aquifers in the metamorphic terrain 0 06 1 9 μg l however the as levels were recorded higher 0 10 66 μg l in sedimentary terrains 3 section ii advanced arsenic removal methods arsenic contamination of drinking water soil and related to as rich food consumption has been a major threat to human health in the last decade thus as removal from water and soil is a major issue for environmental safety and human health precipitation co precipitation membrane filtration adsorption ion exchange and permeable reactive barriers were most commonly used for as removal and also adopted by united states environmental protection agency usepa epa 2002 maity et al 2020 arsenic removal mainly depends on as concentration speciation temperature water hardness interfering chemical species

darchen et al 2016 in this si many articles on aqueous f removal are included phytoremediation can be a conceivable route to remove f from water weerasooriyagedara et al 2020 fluoride uptake depends on plant sensitivity and stress tolerance mechanism the f hyper accumulator plant would be a safe secure and cost effective for removing f from soil and water in successful f remediation the diverse groups of terrestrial and aquatic plants are essential to identify which can accumulate the f more than their origin from where the plant has been collected for f removal the water hyacinth beads doped with hydrous aluminium oxide wh hao hydrous iron oxide wh hfo and hydrous aluminium oxide iron oxide mixture wh hao hfo successfully remediated aqueous f murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 the highest adsorption capacity was achieved in wh hao 4 43 mg l followed by wh hfo 4 25 mg l and wh hao hfo 4 18 mg l more than 80 f uptake on wh hao was recorded in 3 sorption desorption cycles where immobilized adsorbent shows higher removal potential in a continuous flow system thus the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth can be used as an alternative adsorbent for aqueous f immobilization it is essential to search for cheaper effective and easily available adsorbents for water defluoridation a mud pot with a cement paste layer on its inner surface successfully reduced 0 25 mg g fluoride shyamal and ghosh 2019 portland pozzolana cement layer of cement pastes on the inner side of mud pots reduces 86 and 54 15 f from synthetic water and groundwater respectively shyamal and ghosh 2019 pectin biopolymer based binary metal oxide composite pectin al fe paf was used for aqueous f adsorption this composite adsorbent surface area of 122 78 m2 g adsorbs 333 mg g f from water raghav and kumar 2019 iron impregnated activated carbons derived from waste citrus limetta peels ac clps were used for f uptake siddique et al 2020 fluoride adsorption decreased with a rise in f initial concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 95 5 0 by ac clp250 and 94 8 33 3 by ac clp500 thus ac clps can effectively be utilized for f decontamination entele and lee 2020 estimated the household willingness to pay wtp for f free water connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia where the income shares for wtp ranges at 8 16 for f free water service a cost benefit analysis shows that the f free water supply is economically feasible the f free water service connection at home is more valued versus the f free water supply at the public tap however a public private partnership model is essential to fulfill the safe water demand the distribution of safe water is increasing in developed counties but it is still challenging in developing countries due to the socioeconomic structure implementation of the existing f removal technologies requires local research as communities differ in socioeconomic status further research is required to establish the suitability and sustainability of the existing research results in the pilot and full scale operations 5 the integration arsenic and fluoride contamination of water is a huge problem on a global scale researches are being actively pursued to address the as and f contamination health risk and mitigation arsenic and f poisoning represent a serious and widespread health problem particularly in rural communities which depend on untreated as and f rich water significantly the co occurrence of as and f in groundwater and associated health risk was observed in the dharmanagar region north tripura india arsenic and f contamination has been mainly dependent on region specific geological and anthropogenic factors for example elevated f in the groundwater in shiraz iran is mainly caused by anthropogenic activities natural processes have limited influence whereas in chhattisgarh india f concentration in gw increases mainly due to the bedrock rhyolites weathering and agricultural practices enrichment of elements fe al as b cu mn pb and cd are reported to be in a mixed origin of geogenic and anthropogenic activities the geogenic contribution is much higher than anthropogenic inputs for elevated trace element concentrations in bangladesh arsenic concentrations were noted higher particularly in aquifers in sedimentary terrains compare to metamorphic terrain in sri lanka remediation of as and f contaminated water is essential the absorbent gac or fes can be applicable in aqueous as removal due to high efficiency 80 96 nanofiltration nf membrane is effective for the removal of as at 50 c temperature which can be used for as as as v contaminated geothermal waters temperature limit 50 c the absorbent pectin biopolymer based binary metal oxide composite pectin al fe paf or iron impregnated activated carbons derived from waste citrus limetta peels ac clps are potentially effective to remove aqueous f the mud pot with cement paste layer on its inner surface has also been shown to be effective in removing f from water phytoremediation is one potentially cost effective means for removing as and f from water the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth can be used as an alternative adsorbent for aqueous f immobilization to solve the as and f contamination problem will require a variety of approaches from different fields of research arsenic tolerant phenotype transgenics plants the seed priming technique can be used for as and f removal from water soil and sediment the combination of biological and chemical treatment is often efficient for as and f removal furthermore the rainwater harvesting use of as and f safe aquifer and surface water are the alternative ecofriendly options for as and f water mitigation proper monitoring is essential the governmental and non governmental organizations must work together with the researcher for proper mitigation of as and f with sustainable development goals sdg considering the framework for safe drinking water like unesco every governmental and non governmental organization should keep an agenda for sustainable development program sdp for safe drinking water 6 future perspectives the editor s take our experience with this special issue has been summarized in form of seven samurai in the field of arsenic and fluoride contamination to the groundwater in fig 2 where each challenge of this domain has been represented as a bead that is often used for removal techniques as well the key to the sustainable tackling of the problem lies in its effective integrations for which a common interface has to be there for the proper interactions among interdisciplinary scientists industrialists academicians stakeholders and policymakers while monitoring and prediction will remain in the focus for the field earth scientists environmental engineers are likely to focus on finding the remediation technique chemical engineers and industries are likely to focus on the advancement of fast analytical methods as well as in situ removal where lab to field conversion efficacy will be significantly tested biologists and medical practitioners are needed to further decode the toxicological aspects of the cumulative effect of the as f co occurrences so that proper guidelines may be put forward social scientists have to come forward to sketch out effective and curated region specific mechanisms for enhancing awareness and participation among various stakeholders above all the transboundary cooperation among the administrative boundaries national or international has to be firmly in place not only to tackle the issue but even to make a slight change in the present scenarios where co occurrences of geogenic contaminants have emerged as a new threat to the welfare of the humankind

darchen et al 2016 in this si many articles on aqueous f removal are included phytoremediation can be a conceivable route to remove f from water weerasooriyagedara et al 2020 fluoride uptake depends on plant sensitivity and stress tolerance mechanism the f hyper accumulator plant would be a safe secure and cost effective for removing f from soil and water in successful f remediation the diverse groups of terrestrial and aquatic plants are essential to identify which can accumulate the f more than their origin from where the plant has been collected for f removal the water hyacinth beads doped with hydrous aluminium oxide wh hao hydrous iron oxide wh hfo and hydrous aluminium oxide iron oxide mixture wh hao hfo successfully remediated aqueous f murambasvina and mahamadi 2020 the highest adsorption capacity was achieved in wh hao 4 43 mg l followed by wh hfo 4 25 mg l and wh hao hfo 4 18 mg l more than 80 f uptake on wh hao was recorded in 3 sorption desorption cycles where immobilized adsorbent shows higher removal potential in a continuous flow system thus the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth can be used as an alternative adsorbent for aqueous f immobilization it is essential to search for cheaper effective and easily available adsorbents for water defluoridation a mud pot with a cement paste layer on its inner surface successfully reduced 0 25 mg g

raghav and kumar 2019 iron impregnated activated carbons derived from waste citrus limetta peels ac clps were used for f uptake siddique et al 2020 fluoride adsorption decreased with a rise in f initial concentration from 5 to 30 mg l 95 5 0 by ac clp250 and 94 8 33 3 by ac clp500 thus ac clps can effectively be utilized for f decontamination entele and lee 2020 estimated the household willingness to pay wtp for f free water connection in the rift valley region of ethiopia where the income shares for wtp ranges at 8 16 for f free water service a cost benefit analysis shows that the f free water supply is economically feasible the f free water service connection at home is more valued versus the f free water supply at the public tap however a public private partnership model is essential to fulfill the safe water demand the distribution of safe water is increasing in developed counties but it is still challenging in developing countries due to the socioeconomic structure implementation of the existing f removal technologies requires local research as communities differ in socioeconomic status further research is required to establish the suitability and sustainability of the existing research results in the pilot and full scale operations 5 the integration arsenic and fluoride contamination of water is a huge problem on a global scale researches are being actively pursued to address the as and f contamination health risk and mitigation arsenic and f poisoning represent a serious and widespread health problem particularly in rural communities which depend on untreated as and f rich water significantly the co occurrence of as and f in groundwater and associated health risk was observed in the dharmanagar region north tripura india arsenic and f contamination has been mainly dependent on region specific geological and anthropogenic factors for example elevated f in the groundwater in shiraz iran is mainly caused by anthropogenic activities natural processes have limited influence whereas in chhattisgarh india f concentration in gw increases mainly due to the bedrock rhyolites weathering and agricultural practices enrichment of elements fe al as b cu mn pb and cd are reported to be in a mixed origin of geogenic and anthropogenic activities the geogenic contribution is much higher than anthropogenic inputs for elevated trace element concentrations in bangladesh arsenic concentrations were noted higher particularly in aquifers in sedimentary terrains compare to metamorphic terrain in sri lanka remediation of as and f contaminated water is essential the absorbent gac or fes can be applicable in aqueous as removal due to high efficiency 80 96 nanofiltration nf membrane is effective for the removal of as at 50 c temperature which can be used for as as as v contaminated geothermal waters temperature limit 50 c the absorbent pectin biopolymer based binary metal oxide composite pectin al fe paf or iron impregnated activated carbons derived from waste citrus limetta peels ac clps are potentially effective to remove aqueous f the mud pot with cement paste layer on its inner surface has also been shown to be effective in removing f from water phytoremediation is one potentially cost effective means for removing as and f from water the hydrous metal oxide doped water hyacinth can be used as an alternative adsorbent for aqueous f immobilization to solve the as and f contamination problem will require a variety of approaches from different fields of research arsenic tolerant phenotype transgenics plants the seed priming technique can be used for as and f removal from water soil and sediment the combination of biological and chemical treatment is often efficient for as and f removal furthermore the rainwater harvesting use of as and f safe aquifer and surface water are the alternative ecofriendly options for as and f water mitigation proper monitoring is essential the governmental and non governmental organizations must work together with the researcher for proper mitigation of as and f with sustainable development goals sdg considering the framework for safe drinking water like unesco every governmental and non governmental organization should keep an agenda for sustainable development program sdp for safe drinking water 6 future perspectives the editor s take our experience with this special issue has been summarized in form of seven samurai in the field of arsenic and fluoride contamination to the groundwater in fig 2 where each challenge of this domain has been represented as a bead that is often used for removal techniques as well the key to the sustainable tackling of the problem lies in its effective integrations for which a common interface has to be there for the proper interactions among interdisciplinary scientists industrialists academicians stakeholders and policymakers while monitoring and prediction will remain in the focus for the field earth scientists environmental engineers are likely to focus on finding the remediation technique chemical engineers and industries are likely to focus on the advancement of fast analytical methods as well as in situ removal where lab to field conversion efficacy will be significantly tested biologists and medical practitioners are needed to further decode the toxicological aspects of the cumulative effect of the as f co occurrences so that proper guidelines may be put forward social scientists have to come forward to sketch out effective and curated region specific mechanisms for enhancing awareness and participation among various stakeholders above all the transboundary cooperation among the administrative boundaries national or international has to be firmly in place not only to tackle the issue but even to make a slight change in the present scenarios where co occurrences of geogenic contaminants have emerged as a new threat to the welfare of the humankind

2013 for our study area which is rain fed entirely by south west branch of monsoon utilizable recharge is calculated from pre monsoon april may to post monsoon november water level data thus in rain fed aquifer systems of bhadar basin which is chiefly an area of basaltic flows monsoonal recharge was estimated by following the ground water level fluctuation and specific yield method figs 2 and 3 as recommended by the ground water estimation committee gec government of india equation 2 1984 chahar 2015 where normal monsoonal recharge in a specific area of recharge is function of area m2 water level fluctuation m and specific yield of aquifers under study this when stated mathematically is expressed by the relation as 2 gws a δ h s y wherein δ g w s is change in gw storage between pre and post monsoon mcm yr a is area suitable for groundwater recharge km2 δ h is rise in water level due to monsoon fluctuation between pre monsoon and post monsoon water levels in meters s y is the

soils in regard of their infiltration capacities runoff potential and permeability rates table 7 these controlling factors assess the rate at which water enters the soil from the top surface and determines the rate at which water moves within the soil interconnected voids and interstices singh et al 2009 soil map fig 2 of the study area was borrowed from icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india and was geo referenced before digitizing for soil class delineation to generate a soil type map on 1 250 000 scale ramakrishnan et al 2009 the scheme suggested by the natural resources conservation service usda of usa was adopted that distinguishes soils under four hydrologic soil groups hsgs based on the soil s runoff potential fig 2 3 3 methods of multi criteria decision evaluation mcde the present study is set to locate newer artificial water harvesting structures at favourable sites when drought or moderate to severe aridity exists few methodologies offer the chances of sustainability approach and methodologies like potential groundwater zone mapping for optimum usage delineating potential aquifers with high water recharge capacity and yield and looking for sites suitable for catering to artificial recharge units divya 2018 ochir et al 2018 such suitability is a type of goal specific task which enables selection of preferred attributes or requirements at the backdrop of a specific purpose yeh et al 2016 the various criteria are laid out in the planning process as factors affecting our aim and are assigned attributes with respect to different degrees of preferences or favors one may seek from them r w saaty 1987 it normalize the factors criterion by assigning suitability scores to multi attributes represented by thematic information provided under each factor of influence designated as thematic layers over a gis domain on a common scale of ranking by applying comparisons among themselves nyeko 2012 scores are assigned on a scale of 0 9 where 9 denote most suitable and 0 representing least suitability saaty 1987 velasquez and hester 2013 suitability scores for each attribute or sub classes within a thematic parameter may be assigned as per an earlier known criterion in previous works or followed after some stipulated and mandatory guidelines provided by an authorizing body i e government ministries teja and singh 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 the assigned suitability scores against every class under consideration for the six themes can be seen as given in table 8 3 3 1 determination of weights in ahp step second of study involves determining the weight of each factor or thematic layer in gis weights are determined basically by various methods like rating ranking or adoption of analytic hierarchy process an ahp model to develop pair wise comparison matrices and calculating the weightage factors of each parameter seejata et al 2018 siddayao et al 2014 in the rating method most suitable factors are assigned with lower numerical values while in ranking the reverse case is used i e higher the suitability higher the rank suresh et al 2015 with the increased number of criteria the distribution of weights becomes less justified under such case a pair wise comparison strategy in the form of a matrix enables to compare only two factors at a time rahmati et al 2015 oikonomidis et al 2015 among the three types of weight assignment strategies the first two methods do not have any theoretical support while the pair wise comparison method is statistically secured siddayao et al 2014 hence for the study under consideration pair wise comparison matrix approach is adopted for weight assignment this ahp method works on the technique where we obtain the weights or priority vectors of the factors or the criteria in the required direction to fulfil an aim lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 being this the objective t l saaty developed a pair wise comparison method pcm in 1980 ahp involves dividing the problem into multiple issues before starting the decision making and which may be then further divided according to prudence of the user to chalk out a clear hierarchy of issues wu et al 2018 these issues are in consideration of the aim of solving the main problem an ahp modelling includes creation of a fuzzy pair wise comparison matrix for the individual criteria factors under consideration the matrix undergoes adjustments for computation of consistency index for a most likely value affecting the consistency ratio lastly thereby then the entire matrix is retained as or readjusted for a standing value of c r 0 1 in consistency verification step the fuzziness in expert judgements is said to attenuated and consistency verification claimed if and only if c r 0 1 the pcm is then used for ascertaining weights of the individual factors as their percent influence for a final ranking towards decision making comparison among the factors is made through relative assessment to provide for every available alternative and choice by estimating the importance of each relative to the other in drawing out the finite elements of a pcm matrix by determining the importance ratios for each pair of options or alternatives a pair wise matrix shall be constructed in the outcome having all comparison ratios sahoo et al 2015 awawdeh et al 2014 the pair wise comparisons among various themes on a common scale of comparative ratings require expert judgements which ultimately results in the constitution of a square matrix of order n n represented mathematically as given in equation 3 below 3 a r ij 1 r 12 r 1 j 1 r 12 1 r 2 j 1 r 1 j 1 r 2 j 1 as per our expertise experiences and perception relative intensities of importance were imparted to each of the criteria and a judgmental value was computed these quantitative values were based on the qualitative perception of the comparisons made among different themes and drawing finally a pair wise comparison matrix of form six by six 6 6 where the comparison ratios occupy the elements of such a matrix zabihi et al 2019 matrix elements shall represent pair wise importance ratios between two themes at once forming a pair out of total six themes under discussion and where one is adjudged on the basis of how well it serves in the needful direction and with what importance it is been compared to rest others in containment and attainment of the final goal t l saaty in 1980 devised a scale of evaluation table 9 where on a regular continuum there lies the significance by which one criterion is more important than another t l saaty 1980 velasquez and hester 2013 judgements were made by strategically rationalizing on the argument that how more valuable a theme a can be to a given theme b than any other theme c among the selected criteria diagonal elements of the matrix always take values equal to 1 while the non diagonal elements are occupied table 11 by the adjudged relative scores of importance existing between two corresponding alternatives rahmati et al 2015 3 3 2 consistency ratio verification in ahp practically it is a difficult task for decision makers to construct a pair wise comparison square matrix of nth order with matrix property of exact consistency especially for the cases where sufficiently large numbers of confusing factors exist thus the square matrix of the form n n type shall generally have the property of reciprocality and consistency venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 wu et al 2018 matrices differ in degree of consistencies in them as one may lack consistency very slightly by only two or three elements while the other may not be called even close to bear consistency a simple measure for this check is the computation of the consistency ratio c r which is obtained through the equation 4 below 4 cr ci ri where the c r gives the consistency value to determine if the comparisons made are consistent or not i e how successful a matrix is in its proximity to consistency and c i is the consistency index written mathematically as given by equation 5 below 5 ci λ max n n 1 where n is the number of criteria used in the study and λ max is the biggest or principle eigenvalue vector obtained by summing the products between each element of the priority vector table 12 and column totals table 11 in the matrix of n n type this method takes into consideration the computation of normalized inputs of comparison scores in the form of priority vectors pvs which in turn determine the highest eigenvalue λ max in equation 5 to yield the weights for each criterion velasquez and hester 2013 further ri denotes the random index equation 4 also called as random inconsistency index and undertakes the average of the resulting consistency index of a randomly formed pair wise comparison matrix and it shall depend table 10 upon the order n of the matrix saaty 1987 zabihi et al 2019 if c r is found less than 0 10 a reasonable consistency is predicted and assured in the pair wise comparative taken judgements whereas a c r 0 10 reflects rather inconsistent judgements and shall tantamount to rejection of the matrix or change of its elements by reconsideration strategy rahmati et al 2015 for all practical purposes a cr equal to 0 1 or below would render higher consistency and the acceptability of results obtained by ahp t l saaty 2008 3 3 3 parameter standardization normalization of weights the column values were summed up and the cell values in the matrix were divided by their respective column totals for each column under a single thematic parameter to normalize each of these values velasquez and hester 2013 for calculating weight under each theme or factors under decision the values in each row against a single criterion under consideration are averaged out at the end venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 this gives a mean value for each row called as the priority vector pv or normalized principal eigen vector r w saaty 1987 nyeko 2012 of the respective factor under discussion table 12 3 3 4 desirable consistency verification the consistency measurements are governed by above equations 4 and 5 λ max is obtained by equation 6 through the summation of products of priority vector for a factor in table 12 with the column total of the same factor in the pair wise comparison matrix table 11 and is computed as 6 λ max 0 3821 2 2500 0 2775 3 9222 0 1975 6 5000 0 0796 16 5333 0 0363 29 5000 0 0270 33 0000 6 5099 ci λ max n n 1 for n 6 factors here 7 ci 6 5099 6 6 1 0 10198 cr ci ri ri 1 24 from table 12 8 cr 0 10198 1 24 0 08224 0 1 a c r 0 08224 thus obtained from equations 6 8 is acceptable level of consistency and substantiated that the evaluation was based on the preferences as per some specified decision rules oikonomidis et al 2015 from table 11 it is clear that ground water storage lineament density and stream orders are preferred as most influencing factors for locating sites for artificial water harvesting structures in the bhadar basin area through a normalized matrix comprised by an expert judgement for optimum site valuation standards the cumulative importance of these three factors are found to be 85 71 with ground water storage as the most influencing factor up to 38 21 while the slope occupied only 2 70 in overall influence because the area greatly covered by a lower order slope of 2 percent average rise lulc hydrologic soil groups and slope were only secondary in influence as important conditions for decision taking and policy making weights of the six criteria are computed in the form of normalized principal eigen vector as seen in table 12 and were assigned as percentage influence in the overall goal to carry a raster based spatial analysis ahead 3 3 5 gis based weighted overlay analysis woa multi criteria analysis by weighted overlay method provides best suitability analysis as it assigns weights to the thematic layers according to their significance in influencing our final goal seejata et al 2018 suresh et al 2015 selvam et al 2014 teixeira et al 2015 this information will be carried in separate rasters with different degrees of importance towards the final goal even for a single raster we prioritize values among its different attributes some values pertinent to a raster may be fittest for our purposes like in case of slopes of 1 3 for groundwater recharging while others may be favourable good moderately enough or unwanted and leaving rest as unacceptable for suitability analysis venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 some qualifying criteria carry more importance or favors than others hence during the preparation of final suitability map it is rather required that the analysis method must be able to compare several suitability factors at once al 2012 kaliraj et al 2015 for whether and how strongly they fulfill a set of criteria of varying importance keeping this concept in mind such integrated layer analysis can easily increase or decrease the number of overlays by assigning different significance level to each criterion the weighted overlay tool of spatial analysis in arcgis environment takes under consideration all these issues in a robust way p kumar et al 2016 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 each raster is reclassified according to their assigned suitability scores as provided in table 10 they were finally integrated by adding them together to generate an output raster as a spatial distribution map of best most favourable and favourable sites for water harvesting which could purposefully lead to an improved groundwater recharge ramakrishnan et al 2009 bamne et al 2014 t kumar and jhariya 2017 divya 2018 and storage within catchments falling under the bhadar basin here the weight assigned to a layer from an ahp reflected its percentage influence table 12 in the weighted overlay analysis and the total of influences of all undertaken factors should be equal to 100 percent kaliraj et al 2015 thus this method involved creation of an integrated analysis in which a common scale of values is applied to dissimilar and diverse inputs r w saaty 1987 kaliraj et al 2014 in the present exercise the six input rasters of ground water storage lineament density stream orders land use and landcover hydrologic soil groups and slope have been reclassified onto an evaluation scale of 0 9 table 8 with 0 score signifying unwanted pixels 1 score for the least wanted and a score of 9 indicating most suitable pixels before each raster is assigned an ahp obtained percentage influence ochir et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 the woa tool had worked by multiplying the cell values of each factor class by the ahp obtained respective factor percentage influence nyeko 2012 mahmoud et al 2014 and lastly summing the derived new cell values together to generate a site suitability map siddayao et al 2014 awawdeh et al 2014 sahoo et al 2015 akinlalu et al 2017 zabihi et al 2019 rajasekhar et al 2019 for constructing newer water harvesting structures at a local scale the weights linked with a polygonal class in the finally derived suitability layer used a generalized formula as indicated in the

2015 p kumar et al 2016 and was utilized in categorizing souissi et al 2018 yeh et al 2016 polygonal pixel classes into areas with diverse potentialities maina and raude 2016 akinlalu et al 2017 for optimally locating best sites for newer water harvesting civil structures 4 results and discussion the above exercise was carried out to look out for a particular location for deliberately modifying the recharge volume of water into the aquifer systems of study area an ahp based and gis guided spatial analysis in the form of weighted overlay analysis resulted into the selection of those stretches of the streams network in the study area where the transfer of surface water to the aquifers can be substantially augmented by human interference such means of artificial recharge shall augment the natural replenishment of ground water storage through individually or collectively acting efforts of construction spreading of water or changing natural conditions through a planned human deliberation cgwb goi 2007 the methodology would affect the hydraulics of ground water flow by producing both piezometric and volumetric effects when ground water storage is supplemented by a planned approach in the form of construction of water harvesting civil structures at suitable sites the weighted overlay analysis based site suitability index ssi was determined over its entire range values linked with all stream pixels and later on categorized in five priority classes table 13 maximum value of ssi reflected a more desirable pixel and hence accorded a higher priority class while clustering such maximum ssi value pixels over a continuum reflecting highest to lowest ssi pixel values out of five priority classes only i and ii classes were separated out for further analysis by designating them as most favourable and favourable respectively while priority classes iii iv and v were left out table 14 the pixel counts were detected and ascertained for the entire stretch of streams where preferences had been made at first instance through a remote sensing based preliminary enquiry the resultant map was classified into stream lengths planned for providing prospective most favourable to least favourable sites selected for artificial gw recharge fig 4 the study revealed that only 15 65 percent table 14 of total length of streams at first priority was suitable for construction of water harvesting structures and should further needed verification by being supplemented and substantiated by field level local investigation and surveys secondly next level priority sites covered 27 03 percent of stream courses seen in table 14 in meeting suitability for such minor civil structures as might be required for basaltic terrains cgwb goi 2007 with depleting or over exploited aquifers if and only if local investigations meet the desired requirements thereof a preliminary information summarized in table 16 pertaining to topography and physiographic settings geo hydrologic properties of the soil material with special reference to its infiltration and percolation rates in aeration zone are some of the pre requisites of such projects ministry of water resources goi 2000 a water harvesting site must only occupy aquifers bearing the quality and capacity of optimally storing transmitting and yielding water being located principally in the thick basaltic lava flows the bhadar basin serves an ideal area for planning water harvesting civil structures table 15 we found that the thick lineament density served as the most impactful feature and an ensuring parameter for making artificial ground water recharge a good fracture density reflected the potential areas much suitable to lay the foundation for a water harvesting structure most of the sites looked to be linearly situated along structural deformities like lineaments and joints also most of the suitable sites had a linkage with the lower order streams whereby fractures are running and dissecting stream flows such zones have been accorded priorities as per their site suitability and the probable occurrence of water holding porous media there however a structure type at local site further needed the lithological information of alluvial or hard rock confined aquifers up to 40 m depth thereat the most favourable sites as first priority areas chosen for water blockage retention and storage lie under the gw province with lowest monsoonal change in water volume whereas the second priority areas cover low to moderately low recharged gw reservoirs of the bhadar basin during monsoonal period fig 4 the barren land show close concurrence with the probable water harvesting sites in the form of best sites localized for feasibility of a newer structure the distribution of major prospective sites is uneven throughout the entire basin but being traversed and dissected more in the upper half by several weak planes involving fracturing they indicated viability of series of structures as per local stream discharge the coastal aquifers are bound to be least significant in terms of artificial recharge as they maintain proximity with the arabian sea and were assessed as having sufficient high gw recharge under rainfall the integration of layers provided scenes of non suitability in site selection at two isolated patches of land due to their high relief and steep slope triggering high surface flow and less infiltrability the girnar hills is one of them located in south interior basin where an average slope was found in the range 31 78 rise of the land for its being a prominent mountain range the other patch located south easterly of girnar hills was found unfit in planning artificial recharge as it receives a predicted annual replenishment of more than 15 m of ground water level the black cotton soil region made of extensive lava flows when thickness of the soil cover and infiltration rate plays a highly influential role offered us a viable terrain thereat for undertaking gw recharge studies a clayey loamy soil texture thereof reflected a land surface of persistent low recharge inputs from rainfall up to a level of 2 10 m above water table level wtl naturally over extensive areas out of on desk research only 12 s1 s12 civil structures table 17 are located on map in reference to their site specifications through remote sensing data and gis operations fig 4 within low to moderate gw recharge provinces the marked position of these 12 structures falls convincingly under cultivated land where increased irrigation requirements are additional in lean seasons particularly drought spells presence of good fracture density and orientation of lineaments to a stream channel are seen guiding factors for their localization seen in magnified images in fig 4 rest second and third stream orders and slope held the merit as these recommended structures represented a slope range of 1 89 7 90 for them the relief map revealed that much of the basin area has a uniform slope and this factor is least accountable for localization of newer water harvesting structures on the similar track in complete bhadar basin we witnessed a gentle to moderate steepness with less than 10 slope value covering a total of 93 02 basin area thus reducing the importance of percentage weighted influence of relief in overall multi criteria analysis on a gis platform lastly it is being said that the final recharge volume in the aquifers at above cited sites can only be estimated through evaluating thickness of the overburden inter burden stratum soil structural and textural properties and the topographic representation at these selected site locations with a well planned field based studies 5 conclusions and future direction the complex decision making task for a larger spatial extent where multiple criteria need to be considered with their varying importance is made easier by the use of gis framework it provides an easy and quick approach for reducing sample size for further ground validation and proves as a strong support system for final allocation of suitable sites with consideration of a greater number of controlling parameters and using them as thematic layers in multi criteria analysis the consistency brought about by an analytic hierarchy process reduces the risk of any erroneous outcomes resulting from faulty assignment of weightage to specific criteria weight assignment being the most important step for getting accurate result the appropriate weight assignment techniques must be wisely chosen the use of pair wise comparison matrix helps to compare the suitability of each criterion with others sequentially and provides a strong statistical support for decision making ahead convincingly site selections can be done based on remote sensing data integration and consultation of toposheets and other finer resolution satellite data products exact locations can be marked after field verifications and interpretation of prepared litho logs there these proposed structures to be seen as an appropriate measure of harvesting and optimally storing water in small reservoirs for shorter duration the augmented gw reservoirs thus developed may effectively mask the problem of dwindling gw resources of saurashtra region in western india it ensures a healthy and sustainable watershed where the nature of source water is predominantly in situ precipitation over it if advanced research in the field of hydrologic modelling simulation and validation is aspired in the future and more emphasis placed further on spatial science technology this

pradhan 2009 an effective decision making on how a particular resource should be utilized is not an easy task for a given set of conditions the mcdm offers a viable way where resources planners need to have at their disposal tools that can objectively help in prioritizing land use allocation nyeko 2012 the exercise was initiated with collection of four types of data sets pertaining to bhadar river basin viz satellite data hydrological data geological data and the collateral datasets the satellite data of dem served the purpose of obtaining the basin boundary shapefile and obtaining drainage lines and slope and aspect rasters the landsat scenes amply helped to prepare a standard lulc map with bhuvan isro india database co referencing the lineaments were extracted through digitization of already available data and used for making a lineament density map using the collateral data of soil map and closely corelating soil types with their geo hydrologic properties a hydrological soil groups map was created precipitation data for a period of 36 years 1979 2014 helped to create a mean annual rainfall map which was then studied with the ground water levels of pre and post monsoonal months in principal aquifer systems of the basin this assisted in estimating mathematically the arising change in groundwater storage due to natural recharge by rainfall the entire workflow adopted a methodology which can be divided and explained in six basic steps as a processing of datasets including digitization of raster maps b preparation of thematic layers for the study area and gis processing for reclassified maps c assignment of suitability scores to various features within each thematic layer d ahp modelling pair wise comparison matrix and consistency verification e appropriate weight assignment obtained through an analytical hierarchical process to each thematic layer for a gis guided weighted overlay analysis woa f allocation of optimum sites prioritization for water harvesting structures supported by results derived from woa as well as through visual interpretation the localization and prioritization of suitable sites was utilized and verified on a gis platform for a civil structure type according to mandatory guidelines specific to the terrain under study hence the workflow streamlined the process for locating and prioritizing water harvesting sites with a type of civil structure thereat 3 2 1 slope value map a slope map is prepared using slope tool of the 3d analyst toolbox in arcgis chaudhari 2016 the maximum change in elevation over the distance between the cell and its eight neighbors is identified as the steepest downhill slope from the cell slope can be derived in terms of degree or percent rise unit table 4 gupta and srivastava 2010 for this study slope map is prepared on the scale of percent rise unit as shown in fig 3 the slope related findings held a crucial credit in them as the pattern of ground water flow is largely controlled and governed by the fracture and jointing pattern and the depth and thickness of basalts with a vesicular structure any surface velocity checking of the streams over the study area needed a first hand enquiry of the local slope values for planning a civil structure thereat bamne et al 2014 3 2 2 drainage network and stream ordering using tools available in gis software arc hydro processing drainage networks for a large area can be delineated with much ease there are a number of steps to be followed which includes filling of sinks determination of flow direction estimation of flow accumulation and stream definition generation of drainage network and assigning orders to the streams fig 3 the direction of flow is determined by the maximum drop from each cell the distance is measured from each cell center and is calculated on gis platform as follows 1 δ z max δ z d 100 wherein δ z m a x is maximum drop in cell value δ z is change in z value and d reflects the distance from cell center for a rasterized dataset this helps to determine the slope in percentage rise sahoo et al 2015 accumulated flow into each cell from its surrounding cells can be computed by flow accumulation tool using the flow direction raster equation 1 in the output raster of flow accumulation the accumulated cell values flowing down slope into a particular cell are calculated after applying a proper threshold value to the flow accumulation through con or setnull tool stream network was delineated and the resultant streams were ordered according to the strahler scheme 3 2 3 landuse and landcover lulc mapping since the recharge potential required a more permeable soil zone with abundant granular weathering profile seeking lulc knowledge of the area formed an essential part of the study remote sensing techniques provide best and quick approach for preparation of lulc map with less efforts and time basically two classification approaches i e supervised and unsupervised are used for this purpose in the present study l8 oli tirs c1 level 1 landsat data obtained from usgs earth explorer database and then mosaiced using erdas imagine 2014 the iso cluster and maximum likelihood classification tool in arcgis are used for unsupervised classification in the first place spectral signatures are created taking training sample by visual interpretation of satellite image which is then used for identifying cluster class in supervised classification t kumar and jhariya 2017 the final lulc map fig 3 is prepared on a 1 50 000 scale which contains five representative major classes as agricultural land forest patches barren land built up areas and water bodies as per nrsc isro goi 1996 scheme 3 2 4 lineament density map lineaments are distinct surface linear features which may give insight of the subsurface condition of the area if the linear features are of geological origin then their sub surface effects can be validated on field chenini et al 2010 specifically joints fractures and faults fig 2 contribute to the ground water recharge by increasing secondary porosity they control the groundwater infiltration and acts as a medium of transmittance maina and raude 2016 lineaments are digitized from the geological map of the area which is on the scale 1 250 000 for better results and delineation of finer lineaments 1 50 000 scale lineament maps from bhuvan database are co referred it has been found that lineaments of both maps show high concurrence using lineament map as input and putting their calculated length in population field of kernel density tool a lineament density map is prepared with measurements as seen in table 5 3 2 5 preparation of principal aquifer map of basin for the construction of any artificial groundwater recharge structure in an area the recharge potential of the area must be considered hence for the preparation of groundwater recharge zones aquifer maps and water table fluctuation map has been prepared accordingly the drainable porosity or the specific porosity of unconfined aquifers depends upon the type of lithology kaliraj et al 2014 geological quadrangle maps of gujarat are borrowed from gsi and then geo referenced and mosaicked for further processing in gis the lithological map of the study area is then prepared by digitizing manually on 1 250 000 scale the assigned specific yield values for each formation litho units fig 2 were adopted by strictly adhering to the recommended guidelines of gw resource estimation committee of ministry of water resources government of india 2009 as provided in table 6 3 2 6 recharge levels during monsoon in aquifer systems depth to water table data of 186 ground stations in and around the study area are collected from india wris database central water commission govt of india and of which 101 ground stations fall within the study area these depths to water table data are available for 4 periods of each year i e post monsoon rabi january pre monsoon march may monsoon phase july september and post monsoon kharif november long term average for 21 years 1996 2016 is calculated for pre monsoon and post monsoon kharif water table depth the pre monsoonal water level is subtracted from post monsoonal water level to compute recharge received due to monsoonal rainfall between july to september months monsoonal months of a year thus giving piezometric fluctuations before and after july september months 3 2 7 groundwater resource estimation the groundwater resource estimation of the study area is evaluated using ground water level fluctuation and specific yield method equation 2 in indian agricultural practices the faster flattening limb of hydrograph is not relevant for interpreting utilizable recharge varni et al 2013 for our study area which is rain fed entirely by south west branch of monsoon utilizable recharge is calculated from pre monsoon april may to post monsoon november water level data thus in rain fed aquifer systems of bhadar basin which is chiefly an area of basaltic flows monsoonal recharge was estimated by following the ground water level fluctuation and specific yield method figs 2 and 3 as recommended by the ground water estimation committee gec government of india equation 2 1984 chahar 2015 where normal monsoonal recharge in a specific area of recharge is function of area m2 water level fluctuation m and specific yield of aquifers under study this when stated mathematically is expressed by the relation as 2 gws a δ h s y wherein δ g w s is change in gw storage between pre and post monsoon mcm yr a is area suitable for groundwater recharge km2 δ h is rise in water level due to monsoon fluctuation between pre monsoon and post monsoon water levels in meters s y is the specific yield in percentage that can be assumed in equation 2 above to be 4 22 percent for unconsolidated formations alluvium 1 15 percent for semi consolidated formations sedimentary rocks and 0 2 4 percent for consolidated formations crystalline and other hard rocks putty 2010 chahar 2015 3 2 8 hydrologic soil groups hsgs map hydrologic soil group classification eases out the classification of soils in regard of their infiltration capacities runoff potential and permeability rates table 7 these controlling factors assess the rate at which water enters the soil from the top surface and determines the rate at which water moves within the soil interconnected voids and interstices singh et al 2009 soil map fig 2 of the study area was borrowed from icar national bureau of soil survey and land use planning nagpur india and was geo referenced before digitizing for soil class delineation to generate a soil type map on 1 250 000 scale ramakrishnan et al 2009 the scheme suggested by the natural resources conservation service usda of usa was adopted that distinguishes soils under four hydrologic soil groups hsgs based on the soil s runoff potential fig 2 3 3 methods of multi criteria decision evaluation mcde the present study is set to locate newer artificial water harvesting structures at favourable sites when drought or moderate to severe aridity exists few methodologies offer the chances of sustainability approach and methodologies like potential groundwater zone mapping for optimum usage delineating potential aquifers with high water recharge capacity and yield and looking for sites suitable for catering to artificial recharge units divya 2018 ochir et al 2018 such suitability is a type of goal specific task which enables selection of preferred attributes or requirements at the backdrop of a specific purpose yeh et al 2016 the various criteria are laid out in the planning process as factors affecting our aim and are assigned attributes with respect to different degrees of preferences or favors one may seek from them r w saaty 1987 it normalize the factors criterion by assigning suitability scores to multi attributes represented by thematic information provided under each factor of influence designated as thematic layers over a gis domain on a common scale of ranking by applying comparisons among themselves nyeko 2012 scores are assigned on a scale of 0 9 where 9 denote most suitable and 0 representing least suitability saaty 1987 velasquez and hester 2013 suitability scores for each attribute or sub classes within a thematic parameter may be assigned as per an earlier known criterion in previous works or followed after some stipulated and mandatory guidelines provided by an authorizing body i e government ministries teja and singh 2019 andualem and demeke 2019 the assigned suitability scores against every class under consideration for the six themes can be seen as given in table 8 3 3 1 determination of weights in ahp step second of study involves determining the weight of each factor or thematic layer in gis weights are determined basically by various methods like rating ranking or adoption of analytic hierarchy process an ahp model to develop pair wise comparison matrices and calculating the weightage factors of each parameter seejata et al 2018 siddayao et al 2014 in the rating method most suitable factors are assigned with lower numerical values while in ranking the reverse case is used i e higher the suitability higher the rank suresh et al 2015 with the increased number of criteria the distribution of weights becomes less justified under such case a pair wise comparison strategy in the form of a matrix enables to compare only two factors at a time rahmati et al 2015 oikonomidis et al 2015 among the three types of weight assignment strategies the first two methods do not have any theoretical support while the pair wise comparison method is statistically secured siddayao et al 2014 hence for the study under consideration pair wise comparison matrix approach is adopted for weight assignment this ahp method works on the technique where we obtain the weights or priority vectors of the factors or the criteria in the required direction to fulfil an aim lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 being this the objective t l saaty developed a pair wise comparison method pcm in 1980 ahp involves dividing the problem into multiple issues before starting the decision making and which may be then further divided according to prudence of the user to chalk out a clear hierarchy of issues wu et al 2018 these issues are in consideration of the aim of solving the main problem an ahp modelling includes creation of a fuzzy pair wise comparison matrix for the individual criteria factors under consideration the matrix undergoes adjustments for computation of consistency index for a most likely value affecting the consistency ratio lastly thereby then the entire matrix is retained as or readjusted for a standing value of c r 0 1 in consistency verification step the fuzziness in expert judgements is said to attenuated and consistency verification claimed if and only if c r 0 1 the pcm is then used for ascertaining weights of the individual factors as their percent influence for a final ranking towards decision making comparison among the factors is made through relative assessment to provide for every available alternative and choice by estimating the importance of each relative to the other in drawing out the finite elements of a pcm matrix by determining the importance ratios for each pair of options or alternatives a pair wise matrix shall be constructed in the outcome having all comparison ratios sahoo et al 2015 awawdeh et al 2014 the pair wise comparisons among various themes on a common scale of comparative ratings require expert judgements which ultimately results in the constitution of a square matrix of order n n represented mathematically as given in equation 3 below 3 a r ij 1 r 12 r 1 j 1 r 12 1 r 2 j 1 r 1 j 1 r 2 j 1 as per our expertise experiences and perception relative intensities of importance were imparted to each of the criteria and a judgmental value was computed these quantitative values were based on the qualitative perception of the comparisons made among different themes and drawing finally a pair wise comparison matrix of form six by six 6 6 where the comparison ratios occupy the elements of such a matrix zabihi et al 2019 matrix elements shall represent pair wise importance ratios between two themes at once forming a pair out of total six themes under discussion and where one is adjudged on the basis of how well it serves in the needful direction and with what importance it is been compared to rest others in containment and attainment of the final goal t l saaty in 1980 devised a scale of evaluation table 9 where on a regular continuum there lies the significance by which one criterion is more important than another t l saaty 1980 velasquez and hester 2013 judgements were made by strategically rationalizing on the argument that how more valuable a theme a can be to a given theme b than any other theme c among the selected criteria diagonal elements of the matrix always take values equal to 1 while the non diagonal elements are occupied table 11 by the adjudged relative scores of importance existing between two corresponding alternatives rahmati et al 2015 3 3 2 consistency ratio verification in ahp practically it is a difficult task for decision makers to construct a pair wise comparison square matrix of nth order with matrix property of exact consistency especially for the cases where sufficiently large numbers of confusing factors exist thus the square matrix of the form n n type shall generally have the property of reciprocality and consistency venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 wu et al 2018 matrices differ in degree of consistencies in them as one may lack consistency very slightly by only two or three elements while the other may not be called even close to bear consistency a simple measure for this check is the computation of the consistency ratio c r which is obtained through the equation 4 below 4 cr ci ri where the c r gives the consistency value to determine if the comparisons made are consistent or not i e how successful a matrix is in its proximity to consistency and c i is the consistency index written mathematically as given by equation 5 below 5 ci λ max n n 1 where n is the number of criteria used in the study and λ max is the biggest or principle eigenvalue vector obtained by summing the products between each element of the priority vector table 12 and column totals table 11 in the matrix of n n type this method takes into consideration the computation of normalized inputs of comparison scores in the form of priority vectors pvs which in turn determine the highest eigenvalue λ max in equation 5 to yield the weights for each criterion velasquez and hester 2013 further ri denotes the random index equation 4 also called as random inconsistency index and undertakes the average of the resulting consistency index of a randomly formed pair wise comparison matrix and it shall depend table 10 upon the order n of the matrix saaty 1987 zabihi et al 2019 if c r is found less than 0 10 a reasonable consistency is predicted and assured in the pair wise comparative taken judgements whereas a c r 0 10 reflects rather inconsistent judgements and shall tantamount to rejection of the matrix or change of its elements by reconsideration strategy rahmati et al 2015 for all practical purposes a cr equal to 0 1 or below would render higher consistency and the acceptability of results obtained by ahp t l saaty 2008 3 3 3 parameter standardization normalization of weights the column values were summed up and the cell values in the matrix were divided by their respective column totals for each column under a single thematic parameter to normalize each of these values velasquez and hester 2013 for calculating weight under each theme or factors under decision the values in each row against a single criterion under consideration are averaged out at the end venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 this gives a mean value for each row called as the priority vector pv or normalized principal eigen vector r w saaty 1987 nyeko 2012 of the respective factor under discussion table 12 3 3 4 desirable consistency verification the consistency measurements are governed by above equations 4 and 5 λ max is obtained by equation 6 through the summation of products of priority vector for a factor in table 12 with the column total of the same factor in the pair wise comparison matrix table 11 and is computed as 6 λ max 0 3821 2 2500 0 2775 3 9222 0 1975 6 5000 0 0796 16 5333 0 0363 29 5000 0 0270 33 0000 6 5099 ci λ max n n 1 for n 6 factors here 7 ci 6 5099 6 6 1 0 10198 cr ci ri ri 1 24 from table 12 8 cr 0 10198 1 24 0 08224 0 1 a c r 0 08224 thus obtained from equations 6 8 is acceptable level of consistency and substantiated that the evaluation was based on the preferences as per some specified decision rules oikonomidis et al 2015 from table 11 it is clear that ground water storage lineament density and stream orders are preferred as most influencing factors for locating sites for artificial water harvesting structures in the bhadar basin area through a normalized matrix comprised by an expert judgement for optimum site valuation standards the cumulative importance of these three factors are found to be 85 71 with ground water storage as the most influencing factor up to 38 21 while the slope occupied only 2 70 in overall influence because the area greatly covered by a lower order slope of 2 percent average rise lulc hydrologic soil groups and slope were only secondary in influence as important conditions for decision taking and policy making weights of the six criteria are computed in the form of normalized principal eigen vector as seen in table 12 and were assigned as percentage influence in the overall goal to carry a raster based spatial analysis ahead 3 3 5 gis based weighted overlay analysis woa multi criteria analysis by weighted overlay method provides best suitability analysis as it assigns weights to the thematic layers according to their significance in influencing our final goal seejata et al 2018 suresh et al 2015 selvam et al 2014 teixeira et al 2015 this information will be carried in separate rasters with different degrees of importance towards the final goal even for a single raster we prioritize values among its different attributes some values pertinent to a raster may be fittest for our purposes like in case of slopes of 1 3 for groundwater recharging while others may be favourable good moderately enough or unwanted and leaving rest as unacceptable for suitability analysis venkatesh selvamuthukumar 2017 andualem and demeke 2019 some qualifying criteria carry more importance or favors than others hence during the preparation of final suitability map it is rather required that the analysis method must be able to compare several suitability factors at once al 2012 kaliraj et al 2015 for whether and how strongly they fulfill a set of criteria of varying importance keeping this concept in mind such integrated layer analysis can easily increase or decrease the number of overlays by assigning different significance level to each criterion the weighted overlay tool of spatial analysis in arcgis environment takes under consideration all these issues in a robust way p kumar et al 2016 lentswe and molwalefhe 2020 each raster is reclassified according to their assigned suitability scores as provided in table 10 they were finally integrated by adding them together to generate an output raster as a spatial distribution map of best most favourable and favourable sites for water harvesting which could purposefully lead to an improved groundwater recharge ramakrishnan et al 2009 bamne et al 2014 t kumar and jhariya 2017 divya 2018 and storage within catchments falling under the bhadar basin here the weight assigned to a layer from an ahp reflected its percentage influence table 12 in the weighted overlay analysis and the total of influences of all undertaken factors should be equal to 100 percent kaliraj et al 2015 thus this method involved creation of an integrated analysis in which a common scale of values is applied to dissimilar and diverse inputs r w saaty 1987 kaliraj et al 2014 in the present exercise the six input rasters of ground water storage lineament density stream orders land use and landcover hydrologic soil groups and slope have been reclassified onto an evaluation scale of 0 9 table 8 with 0 score signifying unwanted pixels 1 score for the least wanted and a score of 9 indicating most suitable pixels before each raster is assigned an ahp obtained percentage influence ochir et al 2018 andualem and demeke 2019 the woa tool had worked by multiplying the cell values of each factor class by the ahp obtained respective factor percentage influence nyeko 2012 mahmoud et al 2014 and lastly summing the derived new cell values together to generate a site suitability map siddayao et al 2014 awawdeh et al 2014 sahoo et al 2015 akinlalu et al 2017 zabihi et al 2019 rajasekhar et al 2019 for constructing newer water harvesting structures at a local scale the weights linked with a polygonal class in the finally derived suitability layer used a generalized formula as indicated in the

2015 p kumar et al 2016 and was utilized in categorizing souissi et al 2018 yeh et al 2016 polygonal pixel classes into areas with diverse potentialities maina and raude 2016 akinlalu et al 2017 for optimally locating best sites for newer water harvesting civil structures 4 results and discussion the above exercise was carried out to look out for a particular location for deliberately modifying the recharge volume of water into the aquifer systems of study area an ahp based and gis guided spatial analysis in the form of weighted overlay analysis resulted into the selection of those stretches of the streams network in the study area where the transfer of surface water to the aquifers can be substantially augmented by human interference such means of artificial recharge shall augment the natural replenishment of ground water storage through individually or collectively acting efforts of construction spreading of water or changing natural conditions through a planned human deliberation cgwb goi 2007 the methodology would affect the hydraulics of ground water flow by producing both piezometric and volumetric effects when ground water storage is supplemented by a planned approach in the form of construction of water harvesting civil structures at suitable sites the weighted overlay analysis based site suitability index ssi was determined over its entire range values linked with all stream pixels and later on categorized in five priority classes table 13 maximum value of ssi reflected a more desirable pixel and hence accorded a higher priority class while clustering such maximum ssi value pixels over a continuum reflecting highest to lowest ssi pixel values out of five priority classes only i and ii classes were separated out for further analysis by designating them as most favourable and favourable respectively while priority classes iii iv and v were left out table 14 the pixel counts were detected and ascertained for the entire stretch of streams where preferences had been made at first instance through a remote sensing based preliminary enquiry the resultant map was classified into stream lengths planned for providing prospective most favourable to least favourable sites selected for artificial gw recharge fig 4 the study revealed that only 15 65 percent table 14 of total length of streams at first priority was suitable for construction of water harvesting structures and should further needed verification by being supplemented and substantiated by field level local investigation and surveys secondly next level priority sites covered 27 03 percent of stream courses seen in table 14 in meeting suitability for such minor civil structures as might be required for basaltic terrains cgwb goi 2007 with depleting or over exploited aquifers if and only if local investigations meet the desired requirements thereof a preliminary information summarized in table 16 pertaining to topography and physiographic settings geo hydrologic properties of the soil material with special reference to its infiltration and percolation rates in aeration zone are some of the pre requisites of such projects ministry of water resources goi 2000 a water harvesting site must only occupy aquifers bearing the quality and capacity of optimally storing transmitting and yielding water being located principally in the thick basaltic lava flows the bhadar basin serves an ideal area for planning water harvesting civil structures table 15 we found that the thick lineament density served as the most impactful feature and an ensuring parameter for making artificial ground water recharge a good fracture density reflected the potential areas much suitable to lay the foundation for a water harvesting structure most of the sites looked to be linearly situated along structural deformities like lineaments and joints also most of the suitable sites had a linkage with the lower order streams whereby fractures are running and dissecting stream flows such zones have been accorded priorities as per their site suitability and the probable occurrence of water holding porous media there however a structure type at local site further needed the lithological information of alluvial or hard rock confined aquifers up to 40 m depth thereat the most favourable sites as first priority areas chosen for water blockage retention and storage lie under the gw province with lowest monsoonal change in water volume whereas the second priority areas cover low to moderately low recharged gw reservoirs of the bhadar basin during monsoonal period fig 4 the barren land show close concurrence with the probable water harvesting sites in the form of best sites localized for feasibility of a newer structure the distribution of major prospective sites is uneven throughout the entire basin but being traversed and dissected more in the upper half by several weak planes involving fracturing they indicated viability of series of structures as per local stream discharge the coastal aquifers are bound to be least significant in terms of artificial recharge as they maintain proximity with the arabian sea and were assessed as having sufficient high gw recharge under rainfall the integration of layers provided scenes of non suitability in site selection at two isolated patches of land due to their high relief and steep slope triggering high surface flow and less infiltrability the girnar hills is one of them located in south interior basin where an average slope was found in the range 31 78 rise of the land for its being a prominent mountain range the other patch located south easterly of girnar hills was found unfit in planning artificial recharge as it receives a predicted annual replenishment of more than 15 m of ground water level the black cotton soil region made of extensive lava flows when thickness of the soil cover and infiltration rate plays a highly influential role offered us a viable terrain thereat for undertaking gw recharge studies a clayey loamy soil texture thereof reflected a land surface of persistent low recharge inputs from rainfall up to a level of 2 10 m above water table level wtl naturally over extensive areas out of on desk research only 12 s1 s12 civil structures table 17 are located on map in reference to their site specifications through remote sensing data and gis operations fig 4 within low to moderate gw recharge provinces the marked position of these 12 structures falls convincingly under cultivated land where increased irrigation requirements are additional in lean seasons particularly drought spells presence of good fracture density and orientation of lineaments to a stream channel are seen guiding factors for their localization seen in magnified images in fig 4 rest second and third stream orders and slope held the merit as these recommended structures represented a slope range of 1 89 7 90 for them the relief map revealed that much of the basin area has a uniform slope and this factor is least accountable for localization of newer water harvesting structures on the similar track in complete bhadar basin we witnessed a gentle to moderate steepness with less than 10 slope value covering a total of 93 02 basin area thus reducing the importance of percentage weighted influence of relief in overall multi criteria analysis on a gis platform lastly it is being said that the final recharge volume in the aquifers at above cited sites can only be estimated through evaluating thickness of the overburden inter burden stratum soil structural and textural properties and the topographic representation at these selected site locations with a well planned field based studies 5 conclusions and future direction the complex decision making task for a larger spatial extent where multiple criteria need to be considered with their varying importance is made easier by the use of gis framework it provides an easy and quick approach for reducing sample size for further ground validation and proves as a strong support system for final allocation of suitable sites with consideration of a greater number of controlling parameters and using them as thematic layers in multi criteria analysis the consistency brought about by an analytic hierarchy process reduces the risk of any erroneous outcomes resulting from faulty assignment of weightage to specific criteria weight assignment being the most important step for getting accurate result the appropriate weight assignment techniques must be wisely chosen the use of pair wise comparison matrix helps to compare the suitability of each criterion with others sequentially and provides a strong statistical support for decision making ahead convincingly site selections can be done based on remote sensing data integration and consultation of toposheets and other finer resolution satellite data products exact locations can be marked after field verifications and interpretation of prepared litho logs there these proposed structures to be seen as an appropriate measure of harvesting and optimally storing water in small reservoirs for shorter duration the augmented gw reservoirs thus developed may effectively mask the problem of dwindling gw resources of saurashtra region in western india it ensures a healthy and sustainable watershed where the nature of source water is predominantly in situ precipitation over it if advanced research in the field of hydrologic modelling simulation and validation is aspired in the future and more emphasis placed further on spatial science technology this

arid regions most of the water used comes from groundwater due to severe climate change in these areas there is a lot of pressure on groundwater resources groundwater quality in an area is largely controlled by natural processes such as geology human activities such as agricultural production industrial growth urbanization and atmospheric inputs such as precipitation changes in groundwater quality are a prelude to the destruction of water resources directly or indirectly therefore studying and evaluating its quality in these areas can help in the proper management of water resources

taloor 2020 janardhana raju et al 2016 evaluated groundwater quality in the hard rock aquifers of andhra pradesh using geostatistical techniques they stated that excessive use of fertilizers and pesticides inputs were significantly responsible for the decline the groundwater quality and also spatio temporal changes in the groundwater chemistry adimalla et al 2019 studied the hydrogeochemical evaluation of groundwater quality in the semi arid region of central telangana using a water quality index wqi technique duraisamy et al 2018 conducted a study on hydrochemical characterization and evaluation of groundwater quality in tamil nadu india using geographical information system gis and stated that gis is an effective tool to identify the polluted and unpolluted zones furthermore groundwater quality maps may be used to assist planners managers and local officials in evaluating the potential of contamination from the various sources of pollution duraisamy et al 2018 mohamed et

dissolution of carbonate lithology honarbakhsh et al 2019 applied a geographic information systems gis based approach with the groundwater quality index gqi to analyze groundwater quality in marvdasht located in the semi arid region of iran for this purpose they used groundwater quality data that were collected in a nine year period 2010 2015 the most important parameters that exceed the maximum permissible limits for drinking water the groundwater quality of the study area is generally desirable for drinking gqi 71 the gqi map indicated that groundwater was higher quality in northern regions of the study area ostovari et al 2016 evaluated the lordegan aquifer in iran using a gis based groundwater quality assessment their results showed that the lordegan aquifer had good drinking water quality with a mean gqi of 83 the gqi map indicates that drinking water quality decreases moving north from the southwest this may be attributed to the existence of agricultural activities municipal effluent and gypsum formations present in north of the plain at the present time there are no gis based studies that look at groundwater quality assessment using the gqi in southeast iran therefore the aim of this study is to the assess groundwater quality and its spatial variations in the zahedan city groundwater is vital in this arid areas and there is a need for sustainable water resources management in these areas in this research the groundwater status of the area with gqi gibbs diagram and piper diagram were investigated then strategies for water resources conservation were presented

and latitude 29 07 north this city has a dry climate the study area is shown in fig 1 due to the dispersal of observational wells 29 wells in a significant aquifer are considered for this study area this free aquifer in alluvial sediments covers an area of about 210 km2 groundwater flow in the aquifer is from west to east and south to north and eventually flows northeast of the aquifer the average annual rainfall is 61 94 mm the highest and lowest temperatures were estimated to be 42 c and 7 20 c respectively the zahedan aquifer flows into the lar river this river is dry and when the rains are heavy and floods threaten the city eventually it leaves the northeastern border of the country the total volume of surface water storage in this area is zero because there are no dams or lakes in the area sarhadi et al 2016 this district comprises of an alluvial plain surrounded by mountains within the plain several outcrops of the basement formations are observed as individual hills the mountains and individual hills in the alluvial plain are comprised of old flysch igneous rocks and young flysch fig 2 the old flysch paleocene and eocene includes alternate layers of sandstone

prepare the gqi map in the first step concentration maps were prepared for each parameter from the points data using a kriging interpolation method as initial maps i for this purpose the arcgis version 10 6 1 software was used step two to express the data in the normalized form the measured concentration in each cell cm is presented in the initial map at the desired standard value in c who using the normalized difference index normalized maps of each component were prepared using the second equationeq 2 world health organization 2017 2 n i c c m c c m where c is the value of each pixel in the primary map of each component and cm is the maximum desired value of each component by who 2017 guideline standard mehrjardi et al 2008 the obtained map ii showed that for each cell there is a value of pollution index with a limit of between 1 and 1 step three each ni map became a rank map the next polynomial equation was used to generate rank maps eq 3 3 r 0 5 n i 2 4 5 n i 5 amounts r is

groundwater quality index gqi summary statistics of physico chemical parameters are given in table 1 which also shows the maximum allowable limits of various parameters according to who 2017 spatial variation of groundwater quality parameters of the zahedan aquifer based on the who standards for drinking water are mapped in fig 3 the ph value of groundwater varied from 6 55 to 8 01 with an average value of 6 99 table 1 this shows that the groundwater of the study area are neutral to moderately alkaline fig 3 a shows that the study area is within the desirable limit of ph 7 8 5 the ec values ranged from 3530 to 12200 μs cm with an average value of 6543 6 μs cm table 1 ec can be classified as type i if the enrichments of salts are low ec 1500 μs cm type ii if the enrichment of salts are medium ec 1500 and 3000 μs cm and type iii if the enrichments of salts are high ec 3000 μs cm subba rao et al 2012 according to the classification all of samples have shown type iii fig 3 b the mean of tds in zahedan groundwater is 4258 8 mg l table 1 and based on this value groundwater is not suitable for drinking who 2017 furthermore davis and de wiest 1966 categorized water on the basis of tds concentration into four groups which are displayed as desirable for drinking tds 500 mg l permissible for drinking tds 500 1000 mg l useful irrigation tds 1000 3000 mg l and unfit for drinking and irrigation tds 3000 mg l the results show that tds of all data is more than the permissible level for drinking and irrigation fig 3 c adimalla et al 2020 the results showed that the majority of the groundwater samples are above the allowable limit of th 500 mg l for drinking water only 3 5 of the samples are below allowable limit of th that shown in fig 3 d furthermore table 1 shows ca2 and cl concentrations varied from 73 93 to 576 62 and 451 5 1956 75 mg l with averages of 271 97 mg l and 1025 6 the results are the similar to th that shown in fig 3 e and f the concentration of mg2 ranged from 66 83 to 308 1 mg l table 1 mg2 levels represented that 65 5 of the study area is below the permissible limit 150 mg l and only the remaining 34 5 have higher than acceptable values fig 3 j the concentrations of na and k varied from 567 to 1660 and 16 4 36 8 mg l respectively table 1 both of these in the samples are above the maximum desirable limit of who 2017 fig 3 h fig 3 l illustrates that the majority of the area minimum maximum and mean of bicarbonate and sulfate concentration were 249 61 974 78 and 567 7 613 2 2522 75 and 1338 4 mg l respectively table 1 fig 3 m and n shows that 100 of the area in the study area have high concentrations of hco3 and so4 2 exceeding the maximum desirable limit 300 and 400 mg l fig 3 p shows the turbidity levels of 20 of the samples located in the center of the study area were between 1 and 5 units and the remaining 80 had turbidity below 1 unit turbidity levels represented in table 1 that 100 of the study area is below the permissible limit 5 ntu table 2 shows the statistical correlation of the hydrocarbon parameters of groundwater in the region if the correlation coefficient r is greater than 0 7 two parameters are considered to be strongly correlated whereas if the r value is between 0 5 and 0 7 it indicates a moderate correlation at a significance level p 0 05 guey shin et al 2011 parameters having high degrees of correlations are ec and tds r 0 95 because all of the dissolved components cause increased ionic concentration as well as increased ec concentration ec and tds are highly related to cl r 0 92 and na r 0 90 mg2 r 0 81 and 0 83 respectively but moderately related to so4 2 r 0 52 and 0 65 respectively and ca2 r 0 56 and 0 54 respectively the results indicated that these ions involve various physical and chemical reactions oxidation reduction reactions and ion exchange in groundwater aquifers which suggest that the same factor strongly affect them rao 2002 2003 na and cl also have high correlation r 0 89 that represented the presence of salt domes or saline formations containing gypsum and salt which has led to an increase in the salinity of groundwater equation 3 was used to calculate the ranking maps the statistical results of the ranking maps of the chemical parameters considered in table 3 are presented as can be seen the highest rank values are for na ec th so4 2 and tds these five parameters play a great role in water salinity and have a high weight of the index derakhshan et al 2015 eventually the average lowest and highest values based on the gqi index in this region are 54 14 62 6 and 48 2 which indicates that the groundwater in this region has been moderate accordingly the current situation of groundwater quality in zahedan city has decreased compared to 2011 average 75 48 some of the factors influencing the reduction of water quality in the region are lack of rainfall poor nutrition of groundwater aquifers and uncontrolled water consumption groundwater quality is affected by the surrounding environment which is the same type of rock and geology of the surrounding area as you can see in fig 2 all the wells are located in alluvial areas furthermore the water in the alluvium adjacent to the young flysch formation a marine facies has higher salt concentrations important sources that produce calcium and magnesium in the groundwaters minerals are such as pyroxenes and amphiboles in the silicate rocks and dolomite and calcite sulfate concentration is also high in location so high values of so4 2 along with ca2 suggest a possible dissolution of gypsum khazaei et al 2006 on the other hand one of the main factors in limiting the quality of groundwater in the region is the presence of evaporative heights in the margins especially in the eastern margins the predominant lithology of the region is clayey and calcareous layers which causes the destruction and reduction of the quality of its groundwater gharachelo et al 2009 3 2 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry essentially groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including rock weathering dominance evaporation dominance and precipitation dominance narsimha and sudarshan 2017 adimalla 2019 adimalla et al 2020 gibbs diagram is used for this analysis a gibbs plot of data indicates that groundwater chemistry in this area may have acquired its characteristics mainly from evaporation and mineral precipitation fig 4 precipitation and rock weathered materials derived from the underlying rocks control the groundwater chemistry of water samples evaporation greatly increases concentrations of ions formed by chemical weathering leading to higher salinity 3 3 hydro chemical evolution and groundwater facies in order to classify the groundwater type or hydrochemical facies of the hard rock aquifers of zahedan their cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl hco3 so4 2 chemical contents were plotted on piper trilinear diagram fig 5 the piper trilinear diagram shows the main factors influencing the hydrochemical properties of the aquifer system as well as the interaction between groundwater and aquifer minerals within the lithological framework the values obtained from the groundwater sample analysis and their plot on piper s trilinear diagram reveal that the dominant cation is na and the anion are cl and slightly so4 2 that it appears as a non carbonate alkali with high salinity li et al 2018 jasrotia et al 2018 2019 4 conclusions due to the fact that the rainfall in the arid and semiarid regions is very low so it is important to consider the quantity and quality of groundwater resources and their sustainability in these areas naturally little rainfall in these areas has caused a qualitative and quantitative decrease in water and soil groundwater depletion causes land subsidence decrease in the flow of wells and the presence of saline water off the coast a study of the gqi level gibbs and piper diagram in zahedan city showed that the groundwater quality of the area has been greatly reduced due to evaporative formations and high vaporization in the hot season therefore it is necessary to monitor the groundwater and provide solutions to reduce its quality these solutions are suggested to increase the quality of groundwater in the area 1 due to seasonal floods implementation of different artificial feeding systems is recommended in the southwest and west and northwest of the area 2 due to the evaporation formations in the south and southeast of the area and poor water quality it is recommended to prevent aquifer feeding in these areas 3 pay special attention to crops and adapt to water and soil conditions and change irrigation methods 4 it is recommended to use of effluents and improve water quality the effluents are transported out of the area and used for agricultural purposes after treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

92 and na r 0 90 mg2 r 0 81 and 0 83 respectively but moderately related to so4 2 r 0 52 and 0 65 respectively and ca2 r 0 56 and 0 54 respectively the results indicated that these ions involve various physical and chemical reactions oxidation reduction reactions and ion exchange in groundwater aquifers which suggest that the same factor strongly affect them rao 2002 2003 na and cl also have high correlation r 0 89 that represented the presence of salt domes or saline formations containing gypsum and salt which has led to an increase in the salinity of groundwater equation 3 was used to calculate the ranking maps the statistical results of the ranking maps of the chemical parameters considered in table 3 are presented as can be seen the highest rank values are for na ec th so4 2 and tds these five parameters play a great role in water salinity and have a high weight of the index derakhshan et al 2015 eventually the average lowest and highest values based on the gqi index in this region are 54 14 62 6 and 48 2 which indicates that the groundwater in this region has been moderate accordingly the current situation of groundwater quality in zahedan city has decreased compared to 2011 average 75 48 some of the factors influencing the reduction of water quality in the region are lack of rainfall poor nutrition of groundwater aquifers and uncontrolled water consumption groundwater quality is affected by the surrounding environment which is the same type of rock and geology of the surrounding area as you can see in fig 2 all the wells are located in alluvial areas furthermore the water in the alluvium adjacent to the young flysch formation a marine facies has higher salt concentrations important sources that produce calcium and magnesium in the groundwaters minerals are such as pyroxenes and amphiboles in the silicate rocks and dolomite and calcite sulfate concentration is also high in location so high values of so4 2 along with ca2 suggest a possible dissolution of gypsum khazaei et al 2006 on the other hand one of the main factors in limiting the quality of groundwater in the region is the presence of evaporative heights in the margins especially in the eastern margins the predominant lithology of the region is clayey and calcareous layers which causes the destruction and reduction of the quality of its groundwater gharachelo et al 2009 3 2 mechanisms controlling groundwater chemistry essentially groundwater chemistry is controlled by three dominant natural mechanisms including rock weathering dominance evaporation dominance and precipitation dominance narsimha and sudarshan 2017 adimalla 2019 adimalla et al 2020 gibbs diagram is used for this analysis a gibbs plot of data indicates that groundwater chemistry in this area may have acquired its characteristics mainly from evaporation and mineral precipitation fig 4 precipitation and rock weathered materials derived from the underlying rocks control the groundwater chemistry of water samples evaporation greatly increases concentrations of ions formed by chemical weathering leading to higher salinity 3 3 hydro chemical evolution and groundwater facies in order to classify the groundwater type or hydrochemical facies of the hard rock aquifers of zahedan their cations na k ca2 mg2 and anions cl hco3 so4 2 chemical contents were plotted on piper trilinear diagram fig 5 the piper trilinear diagram shows the main factors influencing the hydrochemical properties of the aquifer system as well as the interaction between groundwater and aquifer minerals within the lithological framework the values obtained from the groundwater sample analysis and their plot on piper s trilinear diagram reveal that the dominant cation is na and the anion are cl and slightly so4 2 that it appears as a non carbonate alkali with high salinity li et al 2018 jasrotia et al 2018 2019 4 conclusions due to the fact that the rainfall in the arid and semiarid regions is very low so it is important to consider the quantity and quality of groundwater resources and their sustainability in these areas naturally little rainfall in these areas has caused a qualitative and quantitative decrease in water and soil groundwater depletion causes land subsidence decrease in the flow of wells and the presence of saline water off the coast a study of the gqi level gibbs and piper diagram in zahedan city showed that the groundwater quality of the area has been greatly reduced due to evaporative formations and high vaporization in the hot season therefore it is necessary to monitor the groundwater and provide solutions to reduce its quality these solutions are suggested to increase the quality of groundwater in the area 1 due to seasonal floods implementation of different artificial feeding systems is recommended in the southwest and west and northwest of the area 2 due to the evaporation formations in the south and southeast of the area and poor water quality it is recommended to prevent aquifer feeding in these areas 3 pay special attention to crops and adapt to water and soil conditions and change irrigation methods 4 it is recommended to use of effluents and improve water quality the effluents are transported out of the area and used for agricultural purposes after treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11969,the region of mahdia in tunisia has experienced fast urban growth accompanied by agricultural industrial and tourism development but remains the most socio economically disadvantaged region of the tunisian littoral the main objectives of this study are to analyze hydrologic data and the juxtaposition of the aquifer management model of the mahdia region with the principles defined by ostrom for these purposes geographic information system gis remote sensing tools and the ostrom conditions for successful collective action are used data are obtained from the regional commissariat for agricultural development crda satellite imagery and literature reports results show that water scarcity is a major constraint to socio economic development it is mainly due to the climatic but also topographical conditions and improper management of water resources the shortage of water in the region has led to a situation of groundwater overexploitation moreover the current water management regime contributes to increased pressure on groundwater resources taking into consideration the unfulfilled conditions of collective action thus efficient water management policies must be applied in order to satisfy the water needs of future users and solve this unsustainable situation graphical abstract shallow groundwater exploitation in the region of mahdia in 2016 data were obtained from crda 2016 overexploitation and scarcity of water resources may lead to a situation that decreases the economic development of the mahdia region if emergency measures are not taken water policies in the region must be changed from a strategy of increasing water supply to a water demand management strategy through effective collective action and water saving measures especially in the agricultural sector image 1 keywords gis groundwater overexploitation mahdia ostrom conditions water policy water scarcity 1 introduction water represents a key element for global socio economic development the largest pressure on water resources generally occurs in developing regions central africa india northern africa middle east due to the importance of irrigation in their economies nechifor and winning 2017 as one of the most arid countries in northern africa tunisia suffers from high water scarcity with an important national blue water footprint 1 1 this is defined by the water footprint network as fresh water resources including surface and groundwater hoekstra et al 2011 of crop production amounting to 31 of the country s renewable blue water resources chouchane et al 2015 souissi et al 2019 according to pedro monzonís et al 2015 several water indexes are useful in the decision making process some of them identify the types of drought while others characterize the pressures on the water resources to justify the best allocation of water for example the water stress index falkenmark et al 1989 indicates that countries may be classified according to the renewable water resources per capita per year using the falkenmark water stress index tunisia is classified by international organizations fao ifad and unesco as experiencing water scarcity less than 1000 m³ capita year according to the tunisian institute for strategic studies institut tunisien des etudes stratégiques iets 2019 the increase in water demand will decrease the ratio of conventional resources per capita per year from 467 m³ capita year in 2010 to 359 in 2030 in addition the volume actually mobilized per capita per year will decrease from 310 m³ capita year in 2010 to 290 in 2030 tunisia has experienced several multi year droughts 3 7 years with different severities abdelmalek and nouiri 2020 drought events will generally worsen water scarcity and affect farmer behaviors delorit and block 2020 yang et al 2020 this situation is even more critical in the sahel region since the tunisian revolution in 2011 in fact a public debate on water policy has begun between different stakeholders on the one hand central decision makers that would continue resource mobilization from the interior regions for the coastal benefit as an essential condition of its development and on the other hand actors that defend the interior regions water rights drinking and irrigation water are mobilized from kairouan to the sahel region which creates pressure on surface and groundwater resources of the kairouan region and lead progressively to aquifer depletion elloumi 2016 these areas of the sahel where surface water reserves are relatively small compared to groundwater have experienced an intense exploitation of groundwater resources mahdia is a region of the tunisian sahel which clearly illustrates the problem of water scarcity and groundwater overexploitation it is characterized by its high population growth and its high rural population 54 of which 24 8 benefit from agricultural activity and irrigation ins 2014 in addition industrial and tourism sectors allow the region to integrate into the national and international economies however water has become a limiting factor for economic activities in this region particularly in the agricultural sector in this context of water scarcity and conflicts between water uses and users the state has developed plans and policies for water resources management since the beginning of the 1960s however the question is whether these water policies can contribute to an optimal allocation of resources between different users in the present in order to delineate groundwater resources to aid decision makers techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system gis have been used to spatially analyze water availability veettil and mishra 2016 singh et al 2017 haque et al 2020 khan et al 2020 this information needs to be integrated into the analysis of policies regarding natural resources frija et al 2014 frija et al 2015 and chebil et al 2018 among others highlight issues of common pool resources cpr management in tunisia evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of actual groundwater management systems should be useful for actors who wish to identify the necessary conditions for robust institutions alló and loureiro 2016 tebet et al 2018 quynh et al 2020 conditions identified in ostrom s 1990 seminal work can be used to evaluate the current mahdia aquifers management these conditions were derived based on empirical evidence from the management of commons such as fisheries forests grazing lands and irrigation waters ostrom distilled these into eight principles for the design of robust institutions that could prevent water resources depletion these principles include 1 define clear group boundaries 2 match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions 3 ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules 4 develop a system carried out by community members for monitoring members behavior 5 use graduated sanctions for rule violators 6 provide accessible low cost means for dispute resolution 7 make sure the rule making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities and 8 build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system these principles are widely considered as diagnostic baselines to evaluate and predict outcomes from management of the commons the present work consists of an analysis of water resources using gis and remote sensing tools in the mahdia region an evaluation of current water strategies adopted to prevent groundwater overexploitation and reduce socio economic threats of water scarcity and recommendations for improved management based on ostrom s design principles as well as economic theory 2 study area the study region covers 11 delegations mahdia ksour essef el jem chebba sidi alounane boumerdes malloulech souassi chorbane ouled chamekh and hbira with a total area of 2878 km2 1 9 of the area of tunisia it is located in the center east of tunisia with utm coordinates ranging between 3 882 337 and 3 939 919 to the north and 604 198 and 698 361 to the east the study region is bordered to the west by kairouan to the south by sfax to the north by monastir and sousse and to the east by the mediterranean sea fig 1 the population of mahdia has increased from 25 700 in 1975 to 410 800 inhabitants in 2014 and is expected to reach 465 800 in 2024 ins 2014 the population density is 140 000 persons km 2 2 td 0 55 usd 2014 with urban densities ranging from 463 990 in mahdia to 38 950 in hbira the urbanization rate is 45 7 the natural growth rate reached 1 7 in 2014 the increase of population is due to natural growth but also to migration to the coastal cities favored by tourism which has provided important employment opportunities the region is the most disadvantaged area of the tunisian littoral despite its location between the second and third most populous cities sfax and sousse according to the tunisian institute of competitiveness and quantitative studies institut tunisien de la compétitivité et des etudes quantitative itceq 2012 the regional development indicator rdi that covers most socioeconomic facets including wealth and employment knowledge health and population justice and equity is 0 42 for the region of mahdia the rdi is below the average compared to other coastal regions which exceed 0 6 and the rdi of mahdia is 15th compared to the other governorates of tunisia the rdi of delegations within the mahdia region is heterogeneous and varies between 0 17 for the delegation of ouled chemekh and 0 48 for the delegation of mahdia the underdevelopment occurs mostly in the southwestern part of the region of mahdia which is further from the coast mdrp 2012 fig 1 according to studies realized within a european program on the social and solidarity based economy sse iess project employability initiatives in social and solidarity based economy iess 2014 the regional economy is supported by the dynamism of sectors that contribute to national economic growth agriculture and fisheries industry tourism and handicrafts the main economic activity of the governorate is based on the textile sector which represents 70 105 companies of industrial companies in the region the agricultural sector is also important in the economy of the region despite the scarcity of water resources it generates more than 450 000 td2 of revenue per year 6 of the total national agricultural production agriculture is based on three main activities crop production 41 of agricultural production in the region olive trees contribute 75 of crop production about 10 of national production which represents about 142 771 ha 55 due to its high adaptability to the soil and local climatic conditions followed by cereals 19 market gardening 2 7 fodder 2 2 and legumes 0 2 onagri 2018 animal production 38 of agricultural production in the region 120 000 tons of milk 12 of national production 9800 tons of poultry 8 of national production and 4600 tons of red meat and fishing 21 of agricultural production in the region about 15 of the national production however the scarcity of irrigation water added to the salinity of soil and aquifers causes a major problem for the development of livestock production 50 of livestock feed is transported from other governorates which increases the production cost 3 methodology and data sets the methodology adopted in this study is based on collecting information from different sources yearbooks of the directorate of water resources the regional commissariat for agricultural development crda surveys field observations and satellite data two images of type aster gdem 3 3 advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem version 2 was obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer data portal were combined to elaborate the topographic information of the whole region these data are integrated into a geographic information system gis for creating and analyzing interactive maps as performed by ozcan et al 2003 among others aster images have been used by numerous researchers to generate topographic map contour lines essential for watershed management land use planning and infrastructure planning taufik et al 2015 pham et

overexploitation of groundwater resources in a subsequent component the ostrom 1990 conditions for collective action 4 4 in elinor ostrom s seminal book governing the commons she argues that forming institutions that follow eight principles can allow communities to avoid the tragedy of the commons and collectively manage common pool resources cpr ostrom 1990 these principles of collective action are defined in appendix a are compared to the current aquifer management model to identify which conditions need to be fulfilled for more sustainable water management ostrom and her colleagues examined natural resource management regimes across many countries and resources to develop a set of conditions that facilitate successful collective action to sustainably manage resources as discussed in section 4 3 ostrom s 1990 principles have been considered as a strong analytical tool for assessing robustness of an institution cox et al 2010 the research methods were in depth examination of local documents including a farmer survey conducted by afa crda reports iess project documents official reports and scientific publications qualitative data provides a deeper understanding of local irrigation management struggles and institutions are analyzed in order to be compared with ostrom principles yu et al 2016 sanderson et al 2020 4 results and discussion the results of this work are presented in four sections climatic geological and geomorphological factors that lead to water scarcity are indicated in the first section the second section includes water resources and their uses in the region water policies that lead to a spatial imbalance between supply and demand are analyzed in the third section 4 1 factors contributing to water scarcity 4 1 1 mediterranean climate features the analysis of an ombrothermal diagram from mahdia stations over a period of approximately 37 years from 1980 to 2017 shows that the mahdia region is under the influence of an arid climate in the interior and is semi arid near the sea the mahdia region is characterized by a mild winter and a hot summer the temperature of the region is relatively moderate with an annual average of 19 1 c august is the hottest month in the region with an average temperature of 26 c and the coldest is january at 11 c fig 2 the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1342 mm majdoub et al 2012 the annual average daily sunshine is 8 4 h d and the maximum may reach 11 7 h d between june and july the region is relatively humid in autumn and winter humidity reaches its maximum 75 in january rainfall in the region is characterized by its temporal and spatial irregularity having a trend pattern of decreasing gradually from north to south and from the coast to the interior rainfall ranges between 250 mm and 300 mm in the northeast part of the region mahdia ksour essef chebba and melloulech but in the south rainfall ranges between 140 mm and 200 mm the rainy season runs from september to may with a low number of rainy days from 30 to 50 days summer is particularly marked by dry spells temporal distribution of rains are irregular varying from year to year the annual rainfall average of 35 rainfall stations located in the region is 284 mm fig 3 as a mediterranean region mahdia is vulnerable to climate change with an expected temperature increase of 3 c to 7 c in the 21st century and a loss of 30 of annual rainfall ird 2016 sea level rise is another important component of climate change in the region according to modelling studies by medd 2015 as a coastal region mahdia is a municipality with a large potentially flooded area the 2015 estimate for a 100 year coastal flooding event 5 5 according to kopp et al 2017 estimating sea level rise slr mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt the mid range scenario projected 2 03m of slr based on different representative concentration pathways rcp defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc while the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice sheet melting estimating slr at 2 63m in 2100 medd 2015 is 56 45 km2 under a high sea level rise scenario the 100 year flooded area could grow to 124 49 km2 in 2100 in addition floods caused by torrential rains in this region have been more frequent in intensity and extent over the past 5 decades this is another climate change issue which particularly affects the coastal region especially in autumn and winter 4 1 2 small watersheds drained by temporary streams the topography of the region contains different morphological levels from mountains and hills in the west towards coastal plains in the east its reliefs do not generally exceed 200 m of altitude 150 m at the level of the south west and between 30 and 60 m for the plains of souassi and el jem below the high steppes in the region of mahdia el jem and boumerdes lie vast coastal plains these plains end in the east with cape coastlines such as rass dimas salakta chebba and mahdia they extend out to sea as a vast continental platform this relief determines the actual distribution of soils and the hydrological process of small watersheds which drain generally to sabkhas 6 6 a smooth flat often saline plain in northern africa sometimes occupied after a rain by a shallow lake sidi el hani cherita el gharra moknine or to the sea by temporary streams or wadis 7 7 a valley gully or streambed in northern africa that remains dry except during the rainy season gharraf cherichira and zrata located in the delegations mahdia souassi and boumerdes a few wadis have a continuous flow throughout the year for example the chrita wadi located in souassi delegation which links the cherita sabkha to sidi el hani sabkha fig 4 there are two types of soil salinity primary and secondary salinity 8 8 salinity can develop naturally primary salinity or be human induced secondary salinity according to belaid 2010 several factors lead to increased salinization of soils such as climate irrigation water quality soil characteristics terrain topography the presence of a shallow aquifer and socio economic factors lahlou et al 2000 louati et al 2017 cetin and krida 2003 among others show that the poor quality of water used for irrigation tds 5 g l is a prime factor in soil salinity problems several soil types are found in the region crude mineral soils occur at coastal dunes in chebba delegation and are undeveloped fertile soils occur at souassi and el jem plain a brown calcareous soil soils containing carbonate and gypsum which constitutes an obstacle to water infiltration occur in malloulech and sidi alouane isohumic soils are the most widespread in alluvial plains and finally salsodic soils are sandy and gypsum deposits of the quaternary that characterize alluvial soils surrounding the sabkhas thus soils are poor in organic matter rocky eroded and mainly suitable for olive plantations soil and water conservation techniques swct are located in areas most threatened by soil erosion and salinity near sidi el heni sabkha el gherra and el jem sabkha maher 2009 4 1 3 water infrastructure is it efficient water infrastructure is a priority policy for promoting irrigated agriculture to ensure agro industry and exports in an international context of liberalization that requires the intensification of production 4 1 3 1 areas irrigated mainly by groundwater resources the total agricultural area in the mahdia region is about 276 000 ha 2 76 of the total agricultural area in tunisia in 2014 dgeda 2017 of which 89 is arable the irrigated perimeters represent 7446 ha about 1 8 of the irrigated areas in tunisia this area is divided between irrigated public perimeters 2916 ha and private irrigated perimeters 4530 ha the irrigated public perimeters are irrigated by a flow of 10 l s from nabhana dam and 49 boreholes irrigation is usually performed by turn and water is transported by plastic pipes or in open sided pipelines maher 2009 the distribution of water is known for its disruption due to the increase in demand during the summer period and the lack of sufficient quantities of water from nebhana dam reservoir which decreased from 52 02 mm³ in 2005 to 7 5 mm³ in 2015 dgeda 2017 the private perimeters are supplied by water from 4913 surface wells and 140 deep wells due to the intensification rate 9 9 the intensification rate in irrigated perimeters is the ratio of irrigated crop area to irrigable area marhp 2015 that reaches 83 in irrigated perimeters afa 2010 fao 2011 arboriculture especially olive trees represents the majority 80 of private irrigated perimeters followed by market gardening 45 especially greenhouse crops while cereals and fodder represent only 20 this sums to more than 100 since crops are intercropped with the olive trees moreover soil salinization and overexploitation of aquifers are manifested rapidly on farms characterized by their small size 58 less than 5 ha 24 from five to 10 ha dgeda 2007 the lack of titles to land and land fragmentation remain difficulties for improving hydric infrastructure in the region due to the high cost of supplying so many parcels 4 1 3 2 small hydraulic structures for collection and recharge artificial recharge of the groundwater is carried out either through soil and water conservation techniques swct hill lakes recharge structures or through treated wastewater released in wadis a large portion of seasonal streams is mobilized by small structures ten hill lakes and two treatment stations el jem and boumerdes therefore the volumes collected are intended for local use or for shallow groundwater recharge boumerdes mahdia ksour essef souassi chreita sidi el hani and el gharra and transferrable surpluses are very limited fig 5 these swct provide water at a lower price compared to other processes since the 1990s the crda of mahdia was directed to build manual and mechanical benches three hill lakes ennadhour sidi kdhiri and mlames and recharge structures in the flow of mlames wadi which belong mainly in the mio pliocene and upper pleistocene of souassi lower steppes and discharges into sidi al hani sabkha during periods of increased precipitation this wadi is characterized by its occasional and violent flows that cause soil erosion according to photo interpretation and surveys the surface area reserved for this anti erosion technique represents 350 ha ben jmaa 2007 seasonal floods are an exceptional hydrological phenomena linked to very heavy rains that sometimes fall on the region for a few hours and increase the precipitation for the month and year in flooding years lands are plowed after they have dried up and used for late spring crops brahim 2015 the guettar hill lake with a capacity of 172 000 m³ and other recharge works augment the boumerdes aquifer in addition a volume of 185 122 m³ of treated water is discharged into zrata wadi located in boumerdes steppe most of aquifers have benefited from the recharge that allows a slight piezometric level rise nevertheless sidi el hani and cherita aquifers situated in the west of the region have not reported variations in their piezometric levels due to the rainfall deficit and the clay nature of the roof of the aquifer crda 2017 4 1 3 3 challenges facing the implementation of effective irrigation systems the demand for agricultural water depends on several factors including weather conditions the type and growth stage of the crop cultivation practices and farming intensity soil and water characteristics the degree of modernization of irrigation networks and the extent of the adoption of new techniques such as smart irrigation eprs 2019 according to poussin et al 2008 to analyze irrigation water demand at the regional level agricultural activities based on typologies of farms and cropping systems that combine the technical and economic functioning of farming systems should be represented the traditional irrigation system meskats has contributed to the conservation of thousands of olive hectares in the region of mahdia it effectively enables the maintenance of olive growing the aim of this system is to keep the water as long as possible near the roots of olive trees the impluvium runoff water catchment area allows the infiltration of a larger quantity of these runoff waters necessary for feeding the aquifer while ensuring the protection of the bench against erosion because of urbanization pressure this system remains fragile and endangered for technical and economic reasons the systems of seguias irrigation water channel and rabtas land lifts are also used for the collection of runoff the latter system is used especially in the southwestern areas currently these systems have lost much of their effectiveness and even disappeared seguias system disappeared in 1998 due to the lack of manual labor chraga 2001 young farmers are deserting these places to migrate to work in cities in the region touristic and industrial zones a modern system localized drip irrigation has spread under the influence of public incentives and technical extension but it did not exceed 10 in 2005 the most dominant irrigation system was improved surface or furrow irrigation 76 followed by traditional gravity 14 however by 2010 drip irrigation exceeded 60 which was followed by surface irrigation 35 and sprinkler 5 afa 2010 4 2 water resources and their uses water scarcity is a fundamental issue for the current and future development of the mahdia region in the face of this difficult situation the tunisian state invested in recent decades on mobilization of water from the north to other regions for example the regions of sahel and sfax management of deep wells construction of hill lakes and groundwater recharge to store water from rainy periods 4 2 1 limited resources of water the topography characteristics of the region combined with the climatic conditions from arid in the west to semi arid in the east and the inefficient hydrographic network characterized by limited surface and groundwater resources have generated significant water stress unconventional water remains until now under exploited treated wastewater produces an average of 6 5 mm³ year which is a relatively important potential resource given the agricultural water needs in the region however only 1 23 mm³ of treated wastewater are reused for groundwater recharge fig 6 desalinated groundwater is another alternative water resource in the region it produces a small volume an average of 0 41 mm³ per year and remains generally reserved for hotels and some industries in 2016 the crda has started brackish water desalination for the agriculture sector the gounat desalination plant located in sidi aloune delegation produces 81 000 m³ year with a cost of 0 821 td m³ accbat project 2015 the 76 farmers of gounat public irrigation perimeter benefit from desalinated water tds 1 5 g l instead of tds 4 6 g l from the gounat deep well with a subsidized price of 0 3 td m³ that should be revised by crda crda 2017 in addition deep aquifers have a potential of around 8 6 mm³ year however only 78 8 of these resources are actually exploited the volume of water pumped from 195 deep wells from 50 to 500 m reached 6 78 mm³ in 2016 table 1 deep groundwater exploitation depth of water in groundwater well 50m has increased compared to the previous decade in 1993 the volume used was 3 9 mm³ 45 of resources the evolution of this volume was directly related to the increase of pumping hours of zeramdine beni hassen and souassi groundwater wells pumped water of zeramdine beni hassen is used for the water supply of irrigated public perimeters in chiba ben kemla and hiboun sectors most of the souassi aquifer is reserved for agricultural use 98 and only 1 3 is used for potable water dgre 2004 water table levels in all wells continued to decline between 1997 and 2017 the average rate of water level decrease is seen particularly in souassi aquifer 2 15 m year and sahel sfax aquifer 1 83 m year due to the significant water exploitation and low recharge crda 2017 4 2 2 water use in the region of mahdia water is pumped from medjerda canal to the masri dam located in the south of grombalia in the north east of tunisia with a total production of 126 7 mm³ in 2016 surface waters are mobilized from the dam of masri to coastal areas capbon sahel mahdia and sfax and treated at belli treatment plant a portion 38 8 mm³ of this northern water is transferred to the region of mahdia which is characterized by low surface water potential 0 2 mm³ and high demand this water is used for drinking water industry and tourism as indicated earlier the nabhana dam kairouan also supplies water to the region but it is in a critical situation because of the significant decline of its water reserves the national water distribution utility sonede manages access to drinkable water and supplies industrial and tourism sectors while crda serves irrigated agricultural areas shallow groundwater groundwater is found at a maximum depth of 50m is used mainly for irrigation while the deep groundwater is used for irrigation drinking water supply and industry the desalinated groundwater is used mainly for tourism and more recently for irrigation accbat project 2015 while 19 of treated wastewater is reused for artificial recharge table 2 summarizes the water sources for the different use sectors in the region of mahdia percentages indicate how that source of water is used across sectors currently agriculture is the main consumer sector accounting for nearly 54 of the total volume of water use nevertheless the pressure exerted by non agricultural sectors on available resources is also increasing 4 2 3 overexploitation of shallow groundwater and illegal drilling demand outstrips supply according to the general directorate of water resources of tunisia groundwater exploitation has three classification levels under exploited for which the exploitation rate is less than 90 equilibrium with a rate between 90 and 110 and overexploited aquifers with exploitation rates greater than 110 the general situation of groundwater exploitation of the region of mahdia in 2016 showed that the average exploitation rate is around 106 2 this rate varies from 28 el hancha where there is under exploitation of groundwater to 191 7 mahdia ksour essef a zone of overexploitation these rates are correlated with the increased of number of wells and the transition of technology from diesel mechanical pumping to electric pumping fig 7 in 2016 the region included 8819 wells of which 57 are equipped to use electricity and gasoline for pumping crda 2017 the exploitation of the mahdia ksour essef aquifer has evolved because of the development of tourism and urbanization in recent decades overexploitation of aquifers leads to a continuous lowering of the piezometric level i e groundwater table elevation this is particularly the case of mahdia ksour essef aquifer which is located on upper pliocene and holocene recent geologic formations which make it more subject to the lowering of the piezometric level according to soula et al 2019 in dry years the piezometric level diminished from 0 5 m to 1 m in mahdia ksour essef coastal aquifer which is explained by the presence of private irrigation perimeters in these areas and the excessive and uncontrolled extraction of groundwater according to crda 2017 a risk of seawater intrusion can be detected in some aquifers located near the coastal dunes and sabkhas due to overexploitation this is the case of the ouled ali zbidi well located near the liana sabkha in which salinity has increased from tds 7 2 g l in 2015 to tds 13 4 g l in 2016 artificial recharge can alleviate the problem of lowering piezometric levels treated wastewater from el jem is used for recharging the shallow groundwater mahdia ksour essef the volume of 749 177 m³ is injected in the tributary of the layoun wadi groundwater recharge using artificial recharge structures and soil aquifer treatment sat systems equipped artificial set of lithologies through wastewater can help in minimizing the impact of climate change on water resources and agricultural yield misra 2014 nevertheless groundwater recharge is still underdeveloped in the region since 2011 this exploitation rate has become even more acute especially in the souassi delegation because of unauthorized water extraction 88 illegal wells and 66 boreholes in 2015 which cause overexploitation and shallow aquifer depletion that will certainly impose pressure on deep aquifers in addition illegal drilling deteriorates water quality such as nitrate contamination connected with intensive farming practices and saline water intrusion in general it is difficult to regulate groundwater use due to its intrinsic nature as a common pool resource each individual has an incentive to pump more water than is optimal overall because they experience only the average cost of their activity not the marginal cost resulting in inefficient use of the resource or the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 however collective action can contribute to achieve more efficient groundwater resources use de stefano and lopez gunn 2012 4 3 management of water resources is it efficient in order to prevent overexploitation and conflicts between water users several solutions have been traditionally proposed water mobilization supply augmentation and water policy options when water supply solutions have been exhausted such as water markets implementation of groundwater markets or public intervention state regulation subsidies taxes and quotas and collective action by water users afd 2015 garrick et al 2013 and mccann 2013 highlight that in practice policy instruments like water markets are difficult to implement because of transaction costs including information costs and feasibility is compromised by the lack of well defined property rights the large number of participants and the diversity of their situations moreover state management of groundwater resources does not seem to be efficient because of monitoring difficulties the lack of enforcement and poorly defined property rights petit 2004 shows the importance of taking into account water resource users in the dynamics of collective action and identifying the existence of a compromise between the coordination of the individual actions market oriented approach and forms of collective action collective action for public interest and collective action for community interest ostrom 2010 has contributed to the definition of conditions for collective action success that include user involvement the convergence of individual and collective interests and the moderation of the costs of managing and resolving conflicts stallman 2011 showed that resource characteristics of an ecosystem service is important in determining whether or not it is a suitable candidate for provision by collective management and elaborated a framework to analyze its suitability based on ostrom first we will examine previous policy interventions by the government 4 3 1 limits of state strategy in the region of mahdia 4 3 1 1 saturated mobilization policy tunisia has reached the maximum of its total water resources mobilization in fact the easiest resources to mobilize and the least expensive have been mobilized from the north future mobilizations will require more investments in hydric infrastructure and advanced technology state intervention was manifested by mobilization strategies in the short medium and long term in order to conserve water resources and improve their management and efficiency mobilization policy can be summarized in three main strategies defined and implemented during the previous decades a ten year strategy for mobilizing water resources 1990 2000 with the objective to achieve the mobilization of 85 of resources by 2000 the cost of this strategy was two billion td the actual mobilization reached 87 5 of resources at the end of 2004 compared to 60 in 1990 marh bm 2008 a complementary program of mobilizing water resources for the decade 2001 2011 with the objective to achieve the mobilization of 95 of resources in 2011 the actual mobilization reached 98 of total resources at the end of 2015 hamdane 2014 a long term water sector strategy until 2030 this strategy is based on an integrated approach to water resources balanced participation of state and users and management of water demand rather than supply management as in previous strategies this strategy aims to reduce losses protect the quality of water resources and optimize the socio economic effects of water use the main purpose of these strategies is to optimize resource use however mobilization policy was quickly confronted with problems of resource sustainability quality and public health and problems of water supply shortage in addition regional conflicts between water uses and users equity and choice in terms of allocation in time and in space have been observed in fact water is transferred from inland areas which contain sources of water where agriculture is the main engine of economic development to the sahel region for example the nabhana dam is located in the governorate of kairouan but is exploited for irrigation in the governorates of sousse monastir and mahdia regional authorities of these governorates decided on a quota as a water policy in 2017 to guarantee the effective distribution of water marhp 2017 the quota for the region of mahdia is only 0 15 mm3 which represents 20 of irrigation water demand moreover the satisfaction of the population s water needs as a strategic and social priority has not been attained during the summer period water cuts for longer durations are affecting several delegations in the region of mahdia a national commission therefore has been instructed to investigate the origins of these cuts ben boubaker 2016 thus the state has decided to pursue a mobilization policy through unconventional water resources desalination of brackish water use of treated wastewater artificial recharge and new transfers from the north west of the country unconventional water policy can play a major role in climate change mitigation misra 2014 however the modern economy continues to exert pressure on scarce water resources this implies difficult political tradeoffs accountability effective capacity building awareness campaigns applied research national water information systems and innovative technology el kharraza et al 2012 this alternative which compensates for water scarcity is still insufficiently developed in the region of mahdia 4 3 1 2 weakness in control of groundwater withdrawal the main component of the water code of 1975 regarding groundwater is the confirmation of its belonging to the state thus public authorities are able to control the access to resources and put in place the necessary legislative mechanisms the pre authorization for abstraction of deep groundwater depth 50 m and post notification for shallow groundwater depth 50m the creation of safeguarding perimeters and prohibition perimeters in the region of mahdia the access to shallow groundwater resources is not subject to any authorization a declaration is simply required once the work is finished in addition the access to deep aquifers is subject to authorization provided by the crda that indicates the location of the deep well or borehole and its flow allowed in liters per second in both cases a farmer can benefit from a subsidy for digging wells cited in the investment code and from a drilling credit from national agriculture bank bna these investment programs need to be revised or eliminated to protect aquifers from over use despite the existence of these regulations some surface wells are transformed into drilled wells and the volumes of water withdrawn are not subject to any control indeed in the absence of water meters at the level of drilling nothing obligates beneficiaries to respect the flow indicated on the authorization and nothing allows the administration to monitor the volumes actually withdrawn some experiments in jordan and turkey have confirmed that installing water meters changes farmers irrigation practice valensuela 2009 cetin et al 2020 cetin 2020 moreover deep groundwater royalty fees are not paid by most beneficiaries despite its very low level 0 002 td m³ from 1980 until 2014 and 0 005 td m³ in 2014 elloumi 2016 water policy is not accompanied by control over the expansion of irrigated area in fact the improvement of irrigation efficiency allows farmers to extend their irrigated areas and therefore to increase water consumption particularly in areas where water is collected from open access aquifers bachta and zaibet 2006 this is because water use has become cheaper due to technological change a phenomenon known more generally as jevons paradox 4 3 1 3 a non deterrent water price policy currently despite water scarcity irrigation water price is subsidized by about 30 of its real operating costs fao 1995 and represents about 2 of gross domestic product gdp ocde fao 2018 the installation of an improved irrigation system allowing the saving of irrigation water and equipment renovation are covered by the state at a rate of about 60 apia 2017 as part of a structural adjustment policy in 1989 reduction of state intervention and the transfer of its management to the crda initially then to the water users associations water price increased by 15 to cover the management costs of irrigated public perimeters thus the average water price increased from 0 040 td in 1989 to 0 100 td per m³ in 1996 and is still the same as of 2019 without any adjustment e g for inflation or applying real cost of water water price is volumetric and fixed by the regional level crda after an approximate calculation of the cost per m³ of water per region coastal intermediate and interior it is not made at the level of the gda entity that manages water in rural areas in english agricultural development group characterized by its differing performance and water costs financial problems occur mainly because of the application of water prices 0 09 in the interior and 0 13 td in the central and coastal regions independently of gda costs in addition even the low membership fees are generally not paid by farmers thus this situation contributes to water loss and leads to a budgetary imbalance of gda abdelhafidh 2018 current pricing for agricultural and industrial sectors does not contribute effectively to rationalize water use irrigation water prices have been very low and disconnected from the true water cost because of low irrigation water prices and subsidies of up to 60 for water saving equipment for small farms users consider water resources as a gift from sky farmers do not optimize their use of water resources a behavior that deteriorates the state budget thabet et al 2005 as for the domestic water distributed by the sonede it is subject to a single price system block rates for the whole country that includes seven consumption blocs according to uses and quantities consumed this pricing system is based on two principles a principle of social solidarity the prices for initial blocs are lower than the real price of the water service 0 845 td m³ of water but compensated by prices applied to subsequent blocs and the principle of accountability of water consumers by encouraging them to rationalize their consumption and fight against waste this price system does not seem to be a deterrent for consumers in fact the low price of water leads to inefficient use of water jeder et al 2019 4 3 2 unfulfilled conditions of collective action ostrom 2010 shows that the sustainable management of groundwater a common pool resource with competitive but not exclusive access requires eight conditions 10 10 principles of collective action ostrom 1990 are defined in appendix a stallman 2011 applied ostrom s conditions to evaluate the potential for collective action to produce ecosystem services in our work we directly compare ostrom conditions with the actual situation of groundwater local governance in the mahdia region to diagnosis the sustainability of groundwater resources management the ability to fulfill conditions yes able no not able partial partial ability is used for this comparison table 3 gdas that must replace the administration in the management of public irrigated perimeters are called to rationalize the demand for water particularly in over exploited aquifers however in tunisia excepting the bsissi aquifer in gabes governorate in which the gda in coordination with the local authorities has been able to ensure sustainable management it is difficult to implement this approach this situation is essentially related to the old political regime that manipulated these structures but also because the absence of training and adequate empowerment for its development elloumi 2016 table 3 shows that the gda of mahdia region does not fulfill the majority of these conditions to assure the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the mahdia region there is a need for rapid implementation of new policies unfortunately since the tunisian revolution in 2011 the local aquifer management model has not been improved 5 conclusions overexploitation and scarcity of water resources may lead to a situation that decreases the economic development of the mahdia region if emergency measures are not taken the policy of collective action decentralization has not really changed the balance of power between the different actors that remain dominated by the central administration water management strategies mobilization strategy and collective action pricing reform and legislative frameworks need to be revised to ensure water saving and guarantee its quality and sustainability a block rate price structure needs to be applied in agriculture instead of uniform water pricing to discourage excessive water use tariffs set at marginal cost such as block and volumetric are the most efficient pricing policies concerning water protection finding the pricing scheme that allows maximization of total welfare farmers and suppliers surpluses by using hydroeconomic modelling was an alternative in many countries subsidies and credits that encourage investments by digging wells and boreholes need to be eliminated subsidies for water saving irrigation technology investments about 60 need to be reduced or accompanied with other water policies such as water quotas or higher prices to prevent the jevons paradox also the lowest water requirement crops should be cultivated and controlled by the crda control agents or by remote sensing tools a transition in the current water policy from a mobilization policy to unconventional resource exploitation policy is also necessary because of water shortages and the general orientation of economic policy towards liberalization and the integration of the national economy within the world market national strategies in this region must be changed from a strategy of increasing water supply to a water demand management strategy through effective collective action and water saving measures especially in the agricultural sector which uses most of shallow groundwater and contributes most to water losses this paper represents a useful database for our next stage of research important approaches like cost benefit analysis cba and multi criteria analysis mca can be used to extend our work and evaluate different water policy options to improve government decision making voorn et al 2020 a substantial literature shows the importance of conducting cba by using monetary costs and benefits estimated from integrated hydro economic optimization modelling for improving water allocation policies dagnino and ward 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 expósito et al 2020 descriptive models of agent behaviors optimization models can be complemented with simulation methods by including diverse scenarios representing different states water availability temperature environmental and economic circumstances etc

paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the staff of the regional commissariat for agricultural development of mahdia crda mahdia for their invaluable help appendix a principles of collective action defined by ostrom 1990 1 clearly defined boundaries individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the cpr must be clearly defined as must the boundaries of the cpr itself 2 congruence between appropriation and provision and local conditions appropriation rules restricting time place technology and or quantity of resource units are related to local conditions and to provision rules requiring labor material and or money 3 collective choice arrangements most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules 4 monitoring monitors who actively audit cpr conditions and appropriator behavior are accountable to the appropriators or are the appropriators 5 graduated sanctions appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions depending on the seriousness and context of the offense by other appropriators by officials accountable or between appropriators or by both 6 conflict resolution mechanisms appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials 7 minimal recognition of rights the rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities for crps that are parts of larger systems 8 nested

11969,the region of mahdia in tunisia has experienced fast urban growth accompanied by agricultural industrial and tourism development but remains the most socio economically disadvantaged region of the tunisian littoral the main objectives of this study are to analyze hydrologic data and the juxtaposition of the aquifer management model of the mahdia region with the principles defined by ostrom for these purposes geographic information system gis remote sensing tools and the ostrom conditions for successful collective action are used data are obtained from the regional commissariat for agricultural development crda satellite imagery and literature reports results show that water scarcity is a major constraint to socio economic development it is mainly due to the climatic but also topographical conditions and improper management of water resources the shortage of water in the region has led to a situation of groundwater overexploitation moreover the current water management regime contributes to increased pressure on groundwater resources taking into consideration the unfulfilled conditions of collective action thus efficient water management policies must be applied in order to satisfy the water needs of future users and solve this unsustainable situation graphical abstract shallow groundwater exploitation in the region of mahdia in 2016 data were obtained from crda 2016 overexploitation and scarcity of water resources may lead to a situation that decreases the economic development of the mahdia region if emergency measures are not taken water policies in the region must be changed from a strategy of increasing water supply to a water demand management strategy through effective collective action and water saving measures especially in the agricultural sector image 1 keywords gis groundwater overexploitation mahdia ostrom conditions water policy water scarcity 1 introduction water represents a key element for global socio economic development the largest pressure on water resources generally occurs in developing regions central africa india northern africa middle east due to the importance of irrigation in their economies nechifor and winning 2017 as one of the most arid countries in northern africa tunisia suffers from high water scarcity with an important national blue water footprint 1 1 this is defined by the water footprint network as fresh water resources including surface and groundwater hoekstra et al 2011 of crop production amounting to 31 of the country s renewable blue water resources chouchane et al 2015 souissi et al 2019 according to pedro monzonís et al 2015 several water indexes are useful in the decision making process some of them identify the types of drought while others characterize the pressures on the water resources to justify the best allocation of water for example the water stress index falkenmark et al 1989 indicates that countries may be classified according to the renewable water resources per capita per year using the falkenmark water stress index tunisia is classified by international organizations fao ifad and unesco as experiencing water scarcity less than 1000 m³ capita year according to the tunisian institute for strategic studies institut tunisien des etudes stratégiques iets 2019 the increase in water demand will decrease the ratio of conventional resources per capita per year from 467 m³ capita year in 2010 to 359 in 2030 in addition the volume actually mobilized per capita per year will decrease from 310 m³ capita year in 2010 to 290 in 2030 tunisia has experienced several multi year droughts 3 7 years with different severities abdelmalek and nouiri 2020 drought events will generally worsen water scarcity and affect farmer behaviors delorit and block 2020 yang et al 2020 this situation is even more critical in the sahel region since the tunisian revolution in 2011 in fact a public debate on water policy has begun between different stakeholders on the one hand central decision makers that would continue resource mobilization from the interior regions for the coastal benefit as an essential condition of its development and on the other hand actors that defend the interior regions water rights drinking and irrigation water are mobilized from kairouan to the sahel region which creates pressure on surface and groundwater resources of the kairouan region and lead progressively to aquifer depletion elloumi 2016 these areas of the sahel where surface water reserves are relatively small compared to groundwater have experienced an intense exploitation of groundwater resources mahdia is a region of the tunisian sahel which clearly illustrates the problem of water scarcity and groundwater overexploitation it is characterized by its high population growth and its high rural population 54 of which 24 8 benefit from agricultural activity and irrigation ins 2014 in addition industrial and tourism sectors allow the region to integrate into the national and international economies however water has become a limiting factor for economic activities in this region particularly in the agricultural sector in this context of water scarcity and conflicts between water uses and users the state has developed plans and policies for water resources management since the beginning of the 1960s however the question is whether these water policies can contribute to an optimal allocation of resources between different users in the present in order to delineate groundwater resources to aid decision makers techniques of remote sensing and geographic information system gis have been used to spatially analyze water availability veettil and mishra 2016 singh et al 2017 haque et al 2020 khan et al 2020 this information needs to be integrated into the analysis of policies regarding natural resources frija et al 2014 frija et al 2015 and chebil et al 2018 among others highlight issues of common pool resources cpr management in

loureiro 2016 tebet et al 2018 quynh et al 2020 conditions identified in ostrom s 1990 seminal work can be used to evaluate the current mahdia aquifers management these conditions were derived based on empirical evidence from the management of commons such as fisheries forests grazing lands and irrigation waters ostrom distilled these into eight principles for the design of robust institutions that could prevent water resources depletion these principles include 1 define clear group boundaries 2 match rules governing use of common goods to local needs and conditions 3 ensure that those affected by the rules can participate in modifying the rules 4 develop a system carried out by community members for monitoring members behavior 5 use graduated sanctions for rule violators 6 provide accessible low cost means for dispute resolution 7 make sure the rule making rights of community members are respected by outside authorities and 8 build responsibility for governing the common resource in nested tiers from the lowest level up to the entire interconnected system these principles are widely considered as diagnostic baselines to evaluate and predict outcomes from management of the commons the present work consists of an analysis of water resources using gis and remote sensing tools in the mahdia region an evaluation of current water strategies adopted to prevent groundwater overexploitation and reduce socio economic threats of water scarcity and recommendations for improved management based on ostrom s design principles as well as economic theory 2 study area the study region covers 11 delegations mahdia ksour essef el jem chebba sidi alounane boumerdes malloulech souassi chorbane ouled chamekh and hbira with a total area of 2878 km2 1 9 of the area of tunisia it is located in the center east of tunisia with utm coordinates ranging between 3 882 337 and 3 939 919 to the north and 604 198 and 698 361 to the east the study region is bordered to the west by kairouan to the south by sfax to the north by monastir and sousse and to the east by the mediterranean sea fig 1 the population of mahdia has increased from 25 700 in 1975 to 410 800 inhabitants in 2014 and is expected to reach 465 800 in 2024 ins 2014 the population density is 140 000 persons km 2 2 td 0 55 usd 2014 with urban densities ranging from 463 990 in mahdia to 38 950 in hbira the urbanization rate is 45 7 the natural growth rate reached 1 7 in 2014 the increase of population is due to natural growth but also to migration to the coastal cities favored by tourism which has provided important employment opportunities the region is the most disadvantaged area of the tunisian littoral despite its location between the second and third most populous cities sfax and sousse according to the tunisian institute of competitiveness and quantitative studies institut tunisien de la compétitivité et des etudes quantitative itceq 2012 the regional development indicator rdi that covers most socioeconomic facets including wealth and employment knowledge health and population justice and equity is 0 42 for the region of mahdia the rdi is below the average compared to other coastal regions which exceed 0 6 and the rdi of mahdia is 15th compared to the other governorates of tunisia the rdi of delegations within the mahdia region is heterogeneous and varies between 0 17 for the delegation of ouled chemekh and 0 48 for the delegation of mahdia the underdevelopment occurs mostly in the southwestern part of the region of mahdia which is further from the coast mdrp 2012 fig 1 according to studies realized within a european program on the social and solidarity based economy sse iess project employability initiatives in social and solidarity based economy iess 2014 the regional economy is supported by the dynamism of sectors that contribute to national economic growth agriculture and fisheries industry tourism and handicrafts the main economic activity of the governorate is based on the textile sector which represents 70 105 companies of industrial companies in the region the agricultural sector is also important in the economy of the region despite the scarcity of water resources it generates more than 450 000 td2 of revenue per year 6 of the total national agricultural production agriculture is based on three main activities crop production 41 of agricultural production in the region olive trees contribute 75 of crop production about 10 of national production which represents about 142 771 ha 55 due to its high adaptability to the soil and local climatic conditions followed by cereals 19 market gardening 2 7 fodder 2 2 and legumes 0 2 onagri 2018 animal production 38 of agricultural production in the region 120 000 tons of milk 12 of national production 9800 tons of poultry 8 of national production and 4600 tons of red meat and fishing 21 of agricultural production in the region about 15 of the national production however the scarcity of irrigation water added to the salinity of soil and aquifers causes a major problem for the development of livestock production 50 of livestock feed is transported from other governorates which increases the production cost 3 methodology and data sets the methodology adopted in this study is based on collecting information from different sources yearbooks of the directorate of water resources the regional commissariat for agricultural development crda surveys field observations and satellite data two images of type aster gdem 3 3 advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster global digital elevation model gdem version 2 was obtained from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer data portal were combined to elaborate the topographic information of the whole region these data are integrated into a geographic information system gis for creating and analyzing interactive maps as performed by ozcan et al 2003 among others aster images have been used by numerous researchers to generate topographic map contour lines essential for watershed management land use planning and infrastructure planning taufik et al 2015 pham et

overexploitation of groundwater resources in a subsequent component the ostrom 1990 conditions for collective action 4 4 in elinor ostrom s seminal book governing the commons she argues that forming institutions that follow eight principles can allow communities to avoid the tragedy of the commons and collectively manage common pool resources cpr ostrom 1990 these principles of collective action are defined in appendix a are compared to the current aquifer management model to identify which conditions need to be fulfilled for more sustainable water management ostrom and her colleagues examined natural resource management regimes across many countries and resources to develop a set of conditions that facilitate successful collective action to sustainably manage resources as discussed in section 4 3 ostrom s 1990 principles have been considered as a strong analytical tool for assessing robustness of an institution cox et al 2010 the research methods were in depth examination of local documents including a farmer survey conducted by afa crda reports iess project documents official reports and scientific publications qualitative data provides a deeper understanding of local irrigation management struggles and institutions are analyzed in order to be compared with ostrom principles yu et al 2016 sanderson et al 2020 4 results and discussion the results of this work are presented in four sections climatic geological and geomorphological factors that lead to water scarcity are indicated in the first section the second section includes water resources and their uses in the region water policies that lead to a spatial imbalance between supply and demand are analyzed in the third section 4 1 factors contributing to water scarcity 4 1 1 mediterranean climate features the analysis of an ombrothermal diagram from mahdia stations over a period of approximately 37 years from 1980 to 2017 shows that the mahdia region is under the influence of an arid climate in the interior and is semi arid near the sea the mahdia region is characterized by a mild winter and a hot summer the temperature of the region is relatively moderate with an annual average of 19 1 c august is the hottest month in the region with an average temperature of 26 c and the coldest is january at 11 c fig 2 the annual potential evapotranspiration is 1342 mm majdoub et al 2012 the annual average daily sunshine is 8 4 h d and the maximum may reach 11 7 h d between june and july the region is relatively humid in autumn and winter humidity reaches its maximum 75 in january rainfall in the region is characterized by its temporal and spatial irregularity having a trend pattern of decreasing gradually from north to south and from the coast to the interior rainfall ranges between 250 mm and 300 mm in the northeast part of the region mahdia ksour essef chebba and melloulech but in the south rainfall ranges between 140 mm and 200 mm the rainy season runs from september to may with a low number of rainy days from 30 to 50 days summer is particularly marked by dry spells temporal distribution of rains are irregular varying from year to year the annual rainfall average of 35 rainfall stations located in the region is 284 mm fig 3 as a mediterranean region mahdia is vulnerable to climate change with an expected temperature increase of 3 c to 7 c in the 21st century and a loss of 30 of annual rainfall ird 2016 sea level rise is another important component of climate change in the region according to modelling studies by medd 2015 as a coastal region mahdia is a municipality with a large potentially flooded area the 2015 estimate for a 100 year coastal flooding event 5 5 according to kopp et al 2017 estimating sea level rise slr mainly due to ocean thermal expansion and ice melt the mid range scenario projected 2 03m of slr based on different representative concentration pathways rcp defined by the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc while the pessimistic scenario added more mechanisms of ice sheet melting estimating slr at 2 63m in 2100 medd 2015 is 56 45 km2 under a high sea level rise scenario the 100 year flooded area could grow to 124 49 km2 in 2100 in addition floods caused by torrential rains in this region have been more frequent in intensity and extent over the past 5 decades this is another climate change issue which particularly affects the coastal region especially in autumn and winter 4 1 2 small watersheds drained by temporary streams the topography of the region contains different morphological levels from mountains and hills in the west towards coastal plains in the east its reliefs do not generally exceed 200 m of altitude 150 m at the level of the south west and between 30 and 60 m for the plains of souassi and el jem below the high steppes in the region of mahdia el jem and boumerdes lie vast coastal plains these plains end in the east with cape coastlines such as rass dimas salakta chebba and mahdia they extend out to sea as a vast continental platform this relief determines the actual distribution of soils and the hydrological process of small watersheds which drain generally to sabkhas 6 6 a smooth flat often saline plain in northern africa sometimes occupied after a rain by a shallow lake sidi el hani cherita el gharra moknine or to the sea by temporary streams or wadis 7 7 a valley gully or streambed in northern africa that remains dry except during the rainy season gharraf cherichira and zrata located in the delegations mahdia souassi and boumerdes a few wadis have a continuous flow throughout the year for example the chrita wadi located in souassi delegation which links the cherita sabkha to sidi el hani sabkha fig 4 there are two types of soil salinity primary and secondary salinity 8 8 salinity can develop naturally primary salinity or be human induced secondary salinity according to belaid 2010 several factors lead to increased salinization of soils such as climate irrigation water quality soil characteristics terrain topography the presence of a shallow aquifer and socio economic factors lahlou et al 2000 louati et al 2017 cetin and krida 2003 among others show that the poor quality of water used for irrigation tds 5 g l is a prime factor in soil salinity problems several soil types are found in the region crude mineral soils occur at coastal dunes in chebba delegation and are undeveloped fertile soils occur at souassi and el jem plain a brown calcareous soil soils containing carbonate and gypsum which constitutes an obstacle to water infiltration occur in malloulech and sidi alouane isohumic soils are the most widespread in alluvial plains and finally salsodic soils are sandy and gypsum deposits of the quaternary that characterize alluvial soils surrounding the sabkhas thus soils are poor in organic matter rocky eroded and mainly suitable for olive plantations soil and water conservation techniques swct are located in areas most threatened by soil erosion and salinity near sidi el heni sabkha el gherra and el jem sabkha maher 2009 4 1 3 water infrastructure is it efficient water infrastructure is a priority policy for promoting irrigated agriculture to ensure agro industry and exports in an international context of liberalization that requires the intensification of production 4 1 3 1 areas irrigated mainly by groundwater resources the total agricultural area in the mahdia region is about 276 000 ha 2 76 of the total agricultural area in tunisia in 2014 dgeda 2017 of which 89 is arable the irrigated perimeters represent 7446 ha about 1 8 of the irrigated areas in tunisia this area is divided between irrigated public perimeters 2916 ha and private irrigated perimeters 4530 ha the irrigated public perimeters are irrigated by a flow of 10 l s from nabhana dam and 49 boreholes irrigation is usually performed by turn and water is transported by plastic pipes or in open sided pipelines maher 2009 the distribution of water is known for its disruption due to the increase in demand during the summer period and the lack of sufficient quantities of water from nebhana dam reservoir which decreased from 52 02 mm³ in 2005 to 7 5 mm³ in 2015 dgeda 2017 the private perimeters are supplied by water from 4913 surface wells and 140 deep wells due to the intensification rate 9 9 the intensification rate in irrigated perimeters is the ratio of irrigated crop area to irrigable area marhp 2015 that reaches 83 in irrigated perimeters afa 2010 fao 2011 arboriculture especially olive trees represents the majority 80 of private irrigated perimeters followed by market gardening 45 especially greenhouse crops while cereals and fodder represent only 20 this sums to more than 100 since crops are intercropped with the olive trees moreover soil salinization and overexploitation of aquifers are manifested rapidly on farms characterized by their small size 58 less than 5 ha 24 from five to 10 ha dgeda 2007 the lack of titles to land and land fragmentation remain difficulties for improving hydric infrastructure in the region due to the high cost of supplying so many parcels 4 1 3 2 small hydraulic structures for collection and recharge artificial recharge of the groundwater is carried out either through soil and water conservation techniques swct hill lakes recharge structures or through treated wastewater released in wadis a large portion of seasonal streams is mobilized by small structures ten hill lakes and two treatment stations el jem and boumerdes therefore the volumes collected are intended for local use or for shallow groundwater recharge boumerdes mahdia ksour essef souassi chreita sidi el hani and el gharra and transferrable surpluses are very limited fig 5 these swct provide water at a lower price compared to other processes since the 1990s the crda of mahdia was directed to build manual and mechanical benches three hill lakes ennadhour sidi kdhiri and mlames and recharge structures in the flow of mlames wadi which belong mainly in the mio pliocene and upper pleistocene of souassi lower steppes and discharges into sidi al hani sabkha during periods of increased precipitation this wadi is characterized by its occasional and violent flows that cause soil erosion according to photo interpretation and surveys the surface area reserved for this anti erosion technique represents 350 ha ben jmaa 2007 seasonal floods are an exceptional hydrological phenomena linked to very heavy rains that sometimes fall on the region for a few hours and increase the precipitation for the month and year in flooding years lands are plowed after they have dried up and used for late spring crops brahim 2015 the guettar hill lake with a capacity of 172 000 m³ and other recharge works augment the boumerdes aquifer in addition a volume of 185 122 m³ of treated water is discharged into zrata wadi located in boumerdes steppe most of aquifers have benefited from the recharge that allows a slight piezometric level rise nevertheless sidi el hani and cherita aquifers situated in the west of the region have not reported variations in their piezometric levels due to the rainfall deficit and the clay nature of the roof of the aquifer crda 2017 4 1 3 3 challenges facing the implementation of effective irrigation systems the demand for agricultural water depends on several factors including weather conditions the type and growth stage of the crop cultivation practices and farming intensity soil and water characteristics the degree of modernization of irrigation networks and the extent of the adoption of new techniques such as smart irrigation eprs 2019 according to poussin et al 2008 to analyze irrigation water demand at the regional level agricultural activities based on typologies of farms and cropping systems that combine the technical and economic functioning of farming systems should be represented the traditional irrigation system meskats has contributed to the conservation of thousands of olive hectares in the region of mahdia it effectively enables the maintenance of olive growing the aim of this system is to keep the water as long as possible near the roots of olive trees the impluvium runoff water catchment area allows the infiltration of a larger quantity of these runoff waters necessary for feeding the aquifer while ensuring the protection of the bench against erosion because of urbanization pressure this system remains fragile and endangered for technical and economic reasons the systems of seguias irrigation water channel and rabtas land lifts are also used for the collection of runoff the latter system is used especially in the southwestern areas currently these systems have lost much of their effectiveness and even disappeared seguias system disappeared in 1998 due to the lack of manual labor chraga 2001 young farmers are deserting these places to migrate to work in cities in the region touristic and industrial zones a modern system localized drip irrigation has spread under the influence of public incentives and technical extension but it did not exceed 10 in 2005 the most dominant irrigation system was improved surface or furrow irrigation 76 followed by traditional gravity 14 however by 2010 drip irrigation exceeded 60 which was followed by surface irrigation 35 and sprinkler 5 afa 2010 4 2 water resources and their uses water scarcity is a fundamental issue for the current and future development of the mahdia region in the face of this difficult situation the tunisian state invested in recent decades on mobilization of water from the north to other regions for example the regions of sahel and sfax management of deep wells construction of hill lakes and groundwater recharge to store water from rainy periods 4 2 1 limited resources of water the topography characteristics of the region combined with the climatic conditions from arid in the west to semi arid in the east and the inefficient hydrographic network characterized by limited surface and groundwater resources have generated significant water stress unconventional water remains until now under exploited treated wastewater produces an average of 6 5 mm³ year which is a relatively important potential resource given the agricultural water needs in the region however only 1 23 mm³ of treated wastewater are reused for groundwater recharge fig 6 desalinated groundwater is another alternative water resource in the region it produces a small volume an average of 0 41 mm³ per year and remains generally reserved for hotels and some industries in 2016 the crda has started brackish water desalination for the agriculture sector the gounat desalination plant located in sidi aloune delegation produces 81 000 m³ year with a cost of 0 821 td m³ accbat project 2015 the 76 farmers of gounat public irrigation perimeter benefit from desalinated water tds 1 5 g l instead of tds 4 6 g l from the gounat deep well with a subsidized price of 0 3 td m³ that should be revised by crda crda 2017 in addition deep aquifers have a potential of around 8 6 mm³ year however only 78 8 of these resources are actually exploited the volume of water pumped from 195 deep wells from 50 to 500 m reached 6 78 mm³ in 2016 table 1 deep groundwater exploitation depth of water in groundwater well 50m has increased compared to the previous decade in 1993 the volume used was 3 9 mm³ 45 of resources the evolution of this volume was directly related to the increase of pumping hours of zeramdine beni hassen and souassi groundwater wells pumped water of zeramdine beni hassen is used for the water supply of irrigated public perimeters in chiba ben kemla and hiboun sectors most of the souassi aquifer is reserved for agricultural use 98 and only 1 3 is used for potable water dgre 2004 water table levels in all wells continued to decline between 1997 and 2017 the average rate of water level decrease is seen particularly in souassi aquifer 2 15 m year and sahel sfax aquifer 1 83 m year due to the significant water exploitation and low recharge crda 2017 4 2 2 water use in the region of mahdia water is pumped from medjerda canal to the masri dam located in the south of grombalia in the north east of tunisia with a total production of 126 7 mm³ in 2016 surface waters are mobilized from the dam of masri to coastal areas capbon sahel mahdia and sfax and treated at belli treatment plant a portion 38 8 mm³ of this northern water is transferred to the region of mahdia which is characterized by low surface water potential 0 2 mm³ and high demand this water is used for drinking water industry and tourism as indicated earlier the nabhana dam kairouan also supplies water to the region but it is in a critical situation because of the significant decline of its water reserves the national water distribution utility sonede manages access to drinkable water and supplies industrial and tourism sectors while crda serves irrigated agricultural areas shallow groundwater groundwater is found at a maximum depth of 50m is used mainly for irrigation while the deep groundwater is used for irrigation drinking water supply and industry the desalinated groundwater is used mainly for tourism and more recently for irrigation accbat project 2015 while 19 of treated wastewater is reused for artificial recharge table 2 summarizes the water sources for the different use sectors in the region of mahdia percentages indicate how that source of water is used across sectors currently agriculture is the main consumer sector accounting for nearly 54 of the total volume of water use nevertheless the pressure exerted by non agricultural sectors on available resources is also increasing 4 2 3 overexploitation of shallow groundwater and illegal drilling demand outstrips supply according to the general directorate of water resources of tunisia groundwater exploitation has three classification levels under exploited for which the exploitation rate is less than 90 equilibrium with a rate between 90 and 110 and overexploited aquifers with exploitation rates greater than 110 the general situation of groundwater exploitation of the region of mahdia in 2016 showed that the average exploitation rate is around 106 2 this rate varies from 28 el hancha where there is under exploitation of groundwater to 191 7 mahdia ksour essef a zone of overexploitation these rates are correlated with the increased of number of wells and the transition of technology from diesel mechanical pumping to electric pumping fig 7 in 2016 the region included 8819 wells of which 57 are equipped to use electricity and gasoline for pumping crda 2017 the exploitation of the mahdia ksour essef aquifer has evolved because of the development of tourism and urbanization in recent decades overexploitation of aquifers leads to a continuous lowering of the piezometric level i e groundwater table elevation this is particularly the case of mahdia ksour essef aquifer which is located on upper pliocene and holocene recent geologic formations which make it more subject to the lowering of the piezometric level according to soula et al 2019 in dry years the piezometric level diminished from 0 5 m to 1 m in mahdia ksour essef coastal aquifer which is explained by the presence of private irrigation perimeters in these areas and the excessive and uncontrolled extraction of groundwater according to crda 2017 a risk of seawater intrusion can be detected in some aquifers located near the coastal dunes and sabkhas due to overexploitation this is the case of the ouled ali zbidi well located near the liana sabkha in which salinity has increased from tds 7 2 g l in 2015 to tds 13 4 g l in 2016 artificial recharge can alleviate the problem of lowering piezometric levels treated wastewater from el jem is used for recharging the shallow groundwater mahdia ksour essef the volume of 749 177 m³ is injected in the tributary of the layoun wadi groundwater recharge using artificial recharge structures and soil aquifer treatment sat systems equipped artificial set of lithologies through wastewater can help in minimizing the impact of climate change on water resources and agricultural yield misra 2014 nevertheless groundwater recharge is still underdeveloped in the region since 2011 this exploitation rate has become even more acute especially in the souassi delegation because of unauthorized water extraction 88 illegal wells and 66 boreholes in 2015 which cause overexploitation and shallow aquifer depletion that will certainly impose pressure on deep aquifers in addition illegal drilling deteriorates water quality such as nitrate contamination connected with intensive farming practices and saline water intrusion in general it is difficult to regulate groundwater use due to its intrinsic nature as a common pool resource each individual has an incentive to pump more water than is optimal overall because they experience only the average cost of their activity not the marginal cost resulting in inefficient use of the resource or the tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 however collective action can contribute to achieve more efficient groundwater resources use de stefano and lopez gunn 2012 4 3 management of water resources is it efficient in order to prevent overexploitation and conflicts between water users several solutions have been traditionally proposed water mobilization supply augmentation and water policy options when water supply solutions have been exhausted such as water markets implementation of groundwater markets or public intervention state regulation subsidies taxes and quotas and collective action by water users afd 2015 garrick et al 2013 and mccann 2013 highlight that in practice policy instruments like water markets are difficult to implement because of transaction costs including information costs and feasibility is compromised by the lack of well defined property rights the large number of participants and the diversity of their situations moreover state management of groundwater resources does not seem to be efficient because of monitoring difficulties the lack of enforcement and poorly defined property rights petit 2004 shows the importance of taking into account water resource users in the dynamics of collective action and identifying the existence of a compromise between the coordination of the individual actions market oriented approach and forms of collective action collective action for public interest and collective action for community interest ostrom 2010 has contributed to the definition of conditions for collective action success that include user involvement the convergence of individual and collective interests and the moderation of the costs of managing and resolving conflicts stallman 2011 showed that resource characteristics of an ecosystem service is important in determining whether or not it is a suitable candidate for provision by collective management and elaborated a framework to analyze its suitability based on ostrom first we will examine previous policy interventions by the government 4 3 1 limits of state strategy in the region of mahdia 4 3 1 1 saturated mobilization policy tunisia has reached the maximum of its total water resources mobilization in fact the easiest resources to mobilize and the least expensive have been mobilized from the north future mobilizations will require more investments in hydric infrastructure and advanced technology state intervention was manifested by mobilization strategies in the short medium and long term in order to conserve water resources and improve their management and efficiency mobilization policy can be summarized in three main strategies defined and implemented during the previous decades a ten year strategy for mobilizing water resources 1990 2000 with the objective to achieve the mobilization of 85 of resources by 2000 the cost of this strategy was two billion td the actual mobilization reached 87 5 of resources at the end of 2004 compared to 60 in 1990 marh bm 2008 a complementary program of mobilizing water resources for the decade 2001 2011 with the objective to achieve the mobilization of 95 of resources in 2011 the actual mobilization reached 98 of total resources at the end of 2015 hamdane 2014 a long term water sector strategy until 2030 this strategy is based on an integrated approach to water resources balanced participation of state and users and management of water demand rather than supply management as in previous strategies this strategy aims to reduce losses protect the quality of water resources and optimize the socio economic effects of water use the main purpose of these strategies is to optimize resource use however mobilization policy was quickly confronted with problems of resource sustainability quality and public health and problems of water supply shortage in addition regional conflicts between water uses and users equity and choice in terms of allocation in time and in space have been observed in fact water is transferred from inland areas which contain sources of water where agriculture is the main engine of economic development to the sahel region for example the nabhana dam is located in the governorate of kairouan but is exploited for irrigation in the governorates of sousse monastir and mahdia regional authorities of these governorates decided on a quota as a water policy in 2017 to guarantee the effective distribution of water marhp 2017 the quota for the region of mahdia is only 0 15 mm3 which represents 20 of irrigation water demand moreover the satisfaction of the population s water needs as a strategic and social priority has not been attained during the summer period water cuts for longer durations are affecting several delegations in the region of mahdia a national commission therefore has been instructed to investigate the origins of these cuts ben boubaker 2016 thus the state has decided to pursue a mobilization policy through unconventional water resources desalination of brackish water use of treated wastewater artificial recharge and new transfers from the north west of the country unconventional water policy can play a major role in climate change mitigation misra 2014 however the modern economy continues to exert pressure on scarce water resources this implies difficult political tradeoffs accountability effective capacity building awareness campaigns applied research national water information systems and innovative technology el kharraza et al 2012 this alternative which compensates for water scarcity is still insufficiently developed in the region of mahdia 4 3 1 2 weakness in control of groundwater withdrawal the main component of the water code of 1975 regarding groundwater is the confirmation of its belonging to the state thus public authorities are able to control the access to resources and put in place the necessary legislative mechanisms the pre authorization for abstraction of deep groundwater depth 50 m and post notification for shallow groundwater depth 50m the creation of safeguarding perimeters and prohibition perimeters in the region of mahdia the access to shallow groundwater resources is not subject to any authorization a declaration is simply required once the work is finished in addition the access to deep aquifers is subject to authorization provided by the crda that indicates the location of the deep well or borehole and its flow allowed in liters per second in both cases a farmer can benefit from a subsidy for digging wells cited in the investment code and from a drilling credit from national agriculture bank bna these investment programs need to be revised or eliminated to protect aquifers from over use despite the existence of these regulations some surface wells are transformed into drilled wells and the volumes of water withdrawn are not subject to any control indeed in the absence of water meters at the level of drilling nothing obligates beneficiaries to respect the flow indicated on the authorization and nothing allows the administration to monitor the volumes actually withdrawn some experiments in jordan and turkey have confirmed that installing water meters changes farmers irrigation practice valensuela 2009 cetin et al 2020 cetin 2020 moreover deep groundwater royalty fees are not paid by most beneficiaries despite its very low level 0 002 td m³ from 1980 until 2014 and 0 005 td m³ in 2014 elloumi 2016 water policy is not accompanied by control over the expansion of irrigated area in fact the improvement of irrigation efficiency allows farmers to extend their irrigated areas and therefore to increase water consumption particularly in areas where water is collected from open access aquifers bachta and zaibet 2006 this is because water use has become cheaper due to technological change a phenomenon known more generally as jevons paradox 4 3 1 3 a non deterrent water price policy currently despite water scarcity irrigation water price is subsidized by about 30 of its real operating costs fao 1995 and represents about 2 of gross domestic product gdp ocde fao 2018 the installation of an improved irrigation system allowing the saving of irrigation water and equipment renovation are covered by the state at a rate of about 60 apia 2017 as part of a structural adjustment policy in 1989 reduction of state intervention and the transfer of its management to the crda initially then to the water users associations water price increased by 15 to cover the management costs of irrigated public perimeters thus the average water price increased from 0 040 td in 1989 to 0 100 td per m³ in 1996 and is still the same as of 2019 without any adjustment e g for inflation or applying real cost of water water price is volumetric and fixed by the regional level crda after an approximate calculation of the cost per m³ of water per region coastal intermediate and interior it is not made at the level of the gda entity that manages water in rural areas in english agricultural development group characterized by its differing performance and water costs financial problems occur mainly because of the application of water prices 0 09 in the interior and 0 13 td in the central and coastal regions independently of gda costs in addition even the low membership fees are generally not paid by farmers thus this situation contributes to water loss and leads to a budgetary imbalance of gda abdelhafidh 2018 current pricing for agricultural and industrial sectors does not contribute effectively to rationalize water use irrigation water prices have been very low and disconnected from the true water cost because of low irrigation water prices and subsidies of up to 60 for water saving equipment for small farms users consider water resources as a gift from sky farmers do not optimize their use of water resources a behavior that deteriorates the state budget thabet et al 2005 as for the domestic water distributed by the sonede it is subject to a single price system block rates for the whole country that includes seven consumption blocs according to uses and quantities consumed this pricing system is based on two principles a principle of social solidarity the prices for initial blocs are lower than the real price of the water service 0 845 td m³ of water but compensated by prices applied to subsequent blocs and the principle of accountability of water consumers by encouraging them to rationalize their consumption and fight against waste this price system does not seem to be a deterrent for consumers in fact the low price of water leads to inefficient use of water jeder et al 2019 4 3 2 unfulfilled conditions of collective action ostrom 2010 shows that the sustainable management of groundwater a common pool resource with competitive but not exclusive access requires eight conditions 10 10 principles of collective action ostrom 1990 are defined in appendix a stallman 2011 applied ostrom s conditions to evaluate the potential for collective action to produce ecosystem services in our work we directly compare ostrom conditions with the actual situation of groundwater local governance in the mahdia region to diagnosis the sustainability of groundwater resources management the ability to fulfill conditions yes able no not able partial partial ability is used for this comparison table 3 gdas that must replace the administration in the management of public irrigated perimeters are called to rationalize the demand for water particularly in over exploited aquifers however in tunisia excepting the bsissi aquifer in gabes governorate in which the gda in coordination with the local authorities has been able to ensure sustainable management it is difficult to implement this approach this situation is essentially related to the old political regime that manipulated these structures but also because the absence of training and adequate empowerment for its development elloumi 2016 table 3 shows that the gda of mahdia region does not fulfill the majority of these conditions to assure the sustainable management of groundwater resources in the mahdia region there is a need for rapid implementation of new policies unfortunately since the tunisian revolution in 2011 the local aquifer management model has not been improved 5 conclusions overexploitation and scarcity of water resources may lead to a situation that decreases the economic development of the mahdia region if emergency measures are not taken the policy of collective action decentralization has not really changed the balance of power between the different actors that remain dominated by the central administration water management strategies mobilization strategy and collective action pricing reform and legislative frameworks need to be revised to ensure water saving and guarantee its quality and sustainability a block rate price structure needs to be applied in agriculture instead of uniform water pricing to discourage excessive water use tariffs set at marginal cost such as block and volumetric are the most efficient pricing policies concerning water protection finding the pricing scheme that allows maximization of total welfare farmers and suppliers surpluses by using hydroeconomic modelling was an alternative in many countries subsidies and credits that encourage investments by digging wells and boreholes need to be eliminated subsidies for water saving irrigation technology investments about 60 need to be reduced or accompanied with other water policies such as water quotas or higher prices to prevent the jevons paradox also the lowest water requirement crops should be cultivated and controlled by the crda control agents or by remote sensing tools a transition in the current water policy from a mobilization policy to unconventional resource exploitation policy is also necessary because of water shortages and the general orientation of economic policy towards liberalization and the integration of the national economy within the world market national strategies in this region must be changed from a strategy of increasing water supply to a water demand management strategy through effective collective action and water saving measures especially in the agricultural sector which uses most of shallow groundwater and contributes most to water losses this paper represents a useful database for our next stage of research important approaches like cost benefit analysis cba and multi criteria analysis mca can be used to extend our work and evaluate different water policy options to improve government decision making voorn et al 2020 a substantial literature shows the importance of conducting cba by using monetary costs and benefits estimated from integrated hydro economic optimization modelling for improving water allocation policies dagnino and ward 2012 esteban and albiac 2012 expósito et al 2020 descriptive models of agent behaviors optimization models can be complemented with simulation methods by including diverse scenarios representing different states water availability temperature environmental and economic circumstances etc

paper acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the staff of the regional commissariat for agricultural development of mahdia crda mahdia for their invaluable help appendix a principles of collective action defined by ostrom 1990 1 clearly defined boundaries individuals or households who have rights to withdraw resource units from the cpr must be clearly defined as must the boundaries of the cpr itself 2 congruence between appropriation and provision and local conditions appropriation rules restricting time place technology and or quantity of resource units are related to local conditions and to provision rules requiring labor material and or money 3 collective choice arrangements most individuals affected by the operational rules can participate in modifying the operational rules 4 monitoring monitors who actively audit cpr conditions and appropriator behavior are accountable to the appropriators or are the appropriators 5 graduated sanctions appropriators who violate operational rules are likely to be assessed graduated sanctions depending on the seriousness and context of the offense by other appropriators by officials accountable or between appropriators or by both 6 conflict resolution mechanisms appropriators and their officials have rapid access to low cost local arenas to resolve conflicts among appropriators or between appropriators and officials 7 minimal recognition of rights the rights of appropriators to devise their own institutions are not challenged by external governmental authorities for crps that are parts of larger systems 8 nested
