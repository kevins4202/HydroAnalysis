19100,hydrological droughts have considerable negative impacts on water quantity and quality and understanding their regional characteristics is of crucial importance this study presents a multi stage framework to detect and characterize hydrological droughts considering both streamflow and water quality changes hydrological droughts are categorized into three stages of growth persistence retreat and water quality variables i e water temperature dissolved oxygen concentration and turbidity are utilized to further investigate drought recovery the framework is applied to 400 streamflow gauges across the contiguous united states conus over the study period of 1950 2016 the method is illustrated for the 2012 us drought which affected most of the nation results reveal the duration frequency and severity of historical droughts in various regions as well as their spatial consistencies and heterogeneities furthermore duration of each stage of drought i e growth persistence and retreat is also assessed and the spatial patterns are diagnosed across the conus considering the water quality variables increased water temperature 4 c on average and reduced dissolved oxygen concentration 2 5 mg l on average were observed during drought episodes both of which impose severe consequences on ecology of natural habitats on the contrary turbidity was found to decrease during droughts and indicate a sudden increase when drought terminates due to increase in runoff varied drought recovery durations are perceived for different water quality variables and in general it takes about two more months for water quality variables to recover from a drought following the hydrological drought termination graphical abstract image 1 keywords drought drought recovery turbidity dissolved oxygen water temperature conus 1 introduction drought is among the most devastating natural disasters which imposes severe impacts on various environmental and ecological aspects of the affected region van loon and van lanen 2012 mishra et al 2017 despite its distinction as a climatic extreme event there is no unanimous definition for drought because of its different types and distinct origins ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 meteorological droughts start when precipitation drops below normal level and may lead to hydrological imbalances which disturbs the normal environmental functioning of a region van loon and laaha 2015 heudorfer and stahl 2016 crausbay et al 2017 defined ecological drought by combining drought impacts from ecologic climatic hydrologic socioeconomic and cultural aspects in ecological drought water deficit is defined such that it drives ecosystems beyond their threshold of vulnerability influencing the ecosystem services and triggering feedbacks in natural and human systems several studies have discussed that the severity and frequency of droughts have increased in many parts of the world as a consequence of the changes in rainfall and streamflow patterns which may be associated with anthropogenic activities and climate change karamouz et al 2012 ahmadalipour et al 2017a 2017b thus a systematic framework for detecting drought onset termination can mitigate drought impacts karamouz et al 2011 2013 yan et al 2017 although it is necessary to understand drought recovery mechanism and duration few studies have investigated these topics over large spatial domains pan et al 2013 dechant and moradkhani 2014 while others elaborated on restoring function in plants martorell et al 2014 secchi and zwieniecki 2014 schwalm et al 2017 stated that recovery time is the duration that an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre drought condition ecological drought recovery was presumed to coincide with hydrological drought termination anderegg et al 2015 in riverine ecosystems water quality is an important ecological factor which has been neglected in the majority of drought recovery assessments understanding drought recovery duration is essential if a region experiences a new drought episode before complete recovery from an antecedent drought event the ecosystem would experience more severe ecological impacts sawada and koike 2016 categorizing a drought episode into different stages can shed light on drought propagation and provide a better understanding of drought recovery there have been few attempts to utilize variable spatiotemporal thresholds for categorizing droughts into different stages bonsal et al 2011 parry et al 2016a 2016b most of the assessments merely focused on water availability quantity while the recovery of water quality has not been investigated more specifically the possible lag time between drought recovery in terms of water quantity and quality has not been studied the fresh water quality is correlated to streamflow biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences several studies explored water quality variations during hydrological drought episodes at different spatial scales van vliet and zwolsman 2008 hrdinka et al 2012 hellwig et al 2017 mosley 2015 outlined three driving forces for water quality changes during a drought episode explicitly 1 hydrological drivers dilution and mass balance 2 the role of increased temperature and 3 increased residence times many studies concluded on increasing water temperature during hydrological drought episodes sprague 2005 baures et al 2013 hansl√≠k et al 2016 higher water temperature intensifies biological activity leading to a higher rate of nutrient uptake and more oxygen release drought or low flow condition cause higher water temperature and less nutrient inflow to water bodies hellwig et al 2017 mosley 2015 this leads to favorable changes in physical and hydrological conditions for biological growth increasing the likelihood of eutrophication thus eutrophication will increase not only due to changes in nutrient concentration but also due to hydrological and physical conditions becoming more suitable recently sinha et al 2017 showed that the precipitation changes induced by climate change will substantially increase the riverine total nitrogen loading across the u s which will exacerbate eutrophication especially over the northeastern parts the solubility of gasses such as oxygen depends on water temperature and theoretically higher temperature causes less solubility of oxygen previous studies showed that in most cases when water temperature increases dissolved oxygen decreases indicating solubility is the dominant process for the concentration of dissolved oxygen mulholland et al 1997 mimikou et al 2000 murdoch et al 2000 additionally decreased streamflow during hydrological drought episodes causes lower velocities and longer residence times mosley 2015 therefore sedimentation and higher interaction of groundwater and surface water lead to lower turbidity during drought episodes hrdinka et al 2012 mosley et al 2012 most of the above mentioned analyses have been carried out at regional scales and there have been just few attempts for investigating water quality changes during drought episodes over the conus there are two primary groups of drought identification methods both of which require long time series of hydro meteorological data the first method is the probabilistic based approach which provides drought intensity according to the deviation from normal condition most of the standardized drought indices follow this approach which have been employed in numerous studies mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 irannezhad et al 2017 the second drought identification method is the threshold based approach drought onset happens when the variable of interest falls below a predefined threshold ko and tarhule 1994 shiau and shen 2001 wong et al 2013 moreover there are two threshold level families the constant i e a constant percentile of annual long term cumulative frequency distribution and the variable threshold level the variable threshold method is more appropriate when seasonal patterns should be taken into account and is broadly used in recent studies sung and chung 2014 van loon and laaha 2015 heudorfer and stahl 2016 since the environmental functions are related to seasonal cycles droughts are considered as deviations from seasonal cycles and the variable threshold method is implemented in this study this paper integrates hydrological drought concepts and its environmental impacts and represents a multi stage framework to detect and characterize hydrological droughts considering water quality parameters the overarching objectives of this study are to fill the following gaps which have not been adequately addressed in previous assessments 1 developing a framework for hydrological drought detection and categorizing drought episodes into different stages of growth persistence and retreat 2 investigating water quality variations during hydrological drought episodes 3 analyzing drought recovery considering both water quality and quantity criteria 4 assessing spatiotemporal and probabilistic characteristics of hydrological drought including frequency severity and recovery duration 2 materials and method in hydrological drought studies drought recovery is defined as the time when the hydrological variable of interest reverts to its normal condition mo 2011 pan et al 2013 dechant and moradkhani 2014 the ecological perspectives reveals that a complete drought recovery may require longer time and it is essential to consider more criteria in addition to water quantity for drought recovery in this study drought recovery is defined as a phase starting within the drought episode and extending beyond drought termination until the riverine ecosystem reverts to its pre drought condition to capture drought recovery duration drought episodes should be identified fig 1 presents the methodology which consists of three main steps explained in the following sections 2 1 hydrological drought threshold determination the characteristics of a region data availability and the study objectives are the factors which affect the threshold calculation method daily quantile based on the long time series is considered as the optimum value for streamflow threshold because it is capable of capturing the low flow regime of a basin heudorfer and stahl 2016 to calculate daily streamflow threshold level daily quantiles are computed for the streamflow duration curve over the entire observation period 1950 2016 kjeldsen et al 2000 suggested the range of 70th 95th percentile as the threshold level in this study the 80th percentile fleig et al 2006 heudorfer and stahl 2016 is considered as the threshold level and the time series of the 365 threshold levels are generated in other words a set of 365 80th percentile values are calculated from the available observed data for each station this threshold level is applied for all the stations to maintain the comparability of characteristics of detected droughts over the study area applying the 80th percentile threshold may result in many short periods of streamflow deficit which are not necessarily separate drought episodes therefore a centered moving average of 30 days is applied to smooth the jagged threshold curve heudorfer and stahl 2016 2 2 identifying drought stages comparing the daily observed flow with the threshold to detect hydrological droughts may cause a sequence of short drought episodes which are not separated tallaksen et al 1997 van loon and laaha 2015 many studies eliminated any drought event shorter than 15 days hisdal et al 2004 fleig et al 2006 additionally they applied a pooling method with the inter event period of 10 days to integrate separate events tallaksen et al 1997 fleig et al 2006 which was found to be not effective and failed in detecting multi seasonal drought events therefore a method is developed here to unify these discrete events by categorizing a hydrological drought episode into three stages of growth persistence and retreat combining the methods utilized by bonsal et al 2011 and parry et al 2016a the drought persistence period is the main criterion for hydrological drought assessment having identified drought persistence drought growth and retreat can then be investigated the following steps explain each hydrological drought stage see supplementary fig s1 persistence the period that streamflow remains below the normal threshold level for at least 30 consecutive days if there are more than one period fulfilling this condition during a drought episode the longest period is considered as the drought persistence stage growth moving backwards from the beginning of drought persistence drought onset is the point when streamflow falls below the threshold level for less than 15 days in a t day window explained in the drought recovery section drought growth stage starts from drought onset until the beginning of drought persistence retreat moving forward from the end of drought persistence stage drought termination is the time when streamflow falls below the threshold level for less than 15 days in a t day window explained in the drought recovery section drought retreat stage starts following the end of drought persistence until drought termination 2 3 drought recovery in this study drought recovery starts from the beginning of the retreat stage and continues until t day after drought termination the t day after drought termination when streamflow has reverted to its pre drought condition is added to drought retreat for drought recovery because the basin needs more time to meet normal water quality condition the t day period is defined as the required time for all water quality parameters to recover to revert to their normal conditions thus a river is assumed to recover from a drought when the streamflow and water quality parameters return to their normal i e pre drought condition water quality is assumed recovered when there is no significant difference between the median of variable of interest and its threshold combining methods by caruso 2001 2002 and van vliet and zwolsman 2008 the kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 as a nonparametric method is employed at 0 05 significance level to investigate such difference the historical hydrological droughts in each streamflow station were considered and the t day period is calculated in order to comply with the regional characteristics of each basin like streamflow threshold the normal water quality condition threshold is defined as the long term daily average of each water quality variable for the study period which is then smoothed by thirty day centered moving average 2 4 study area and data the contiguous united states conus is selected as the study area because of its widely variable climate which leads to the existence of perennial and ephemeral rivers in different regions there are eighteen river basins across the conus which are delineated based on the usgs 2 digit hydrologic unit codes excluding alaska hawaii and caribbean as shown in fig 2 hydrologic units hu are areas of land from which surface water drains to a particular point among all the streamflow stations across the conus a small fraction of them monitor water quality parameters we considered all the stations operated by usgs over the conus and selected the ones that meet our criteria the criteria for selecting stations are as follows 1 streamflow data availability for at least 30 consecutive years during the study period 1950 2016 2 recording at least one water quality parameter with 5 consecutive years of observed data and total duration of 10 years and 3 being least affected by anthropogenic influences i e dams abstraction and return flows assessing all stations for the above criteria we included all the active stations with over 30 years of streamflow observation that collects at least one of the water quality parameters therefore 400 usgs the us geological survey stations were selected considering the study period 1950 2016 recording at least one water quality parameter and being least affected by anthropogenic influences such as dams abstractions and return flows from irrigation systems and power plants water temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity are assessed as vital water quality parameters swamp 2010 and rest of the water quality parameters are neglected due to their short record or poor spatial coverage missing data for streamflow and water quality parameters are estimated by the usgs therefore significant gaps of observed data are filled fig 2 shows the location of the 400 selected stations all of which measure water temperature whereas some stations do not record either dissolved oxygen or water turbidity 3 results 3 1 verification of the hydrological drought detection framework the 2012 us drought the drought detection method applied in this study is verified for the historic drought event rippey 2015 an unusually dry winter in 2011 2012 coincided with warm and dry spring and summer and affected most parts of the conus it led to catastrophic drought impacts over the affected states and caused 40 billion damage mostly due to agricultural losses rippey 2015 nearly two thirds of the nation dealt with drought on september 2012 according to the us drought monitor usdm the usdm svoboda et al 2012 detected a severe to extreme drought episode affecting all over the conus with higher persistence duration in south and midwest the results of our analysis also detect a hydrological drought event in 38 states with a duration of 11 months on average ranging from 4 to 15 months the onset termination and duration of the 2012 us drought are shown in fig 3 for each of the affected states fig 3 shows that in midwestern and southeastern states the 2012 drought tended to persist longer and drought recovery took more time for these regions while drought recovery in the pacific northwest took shorter time in this study drought growth is defined as the period that the hydrological variable e g streamflow falls below threshold for at least 15 days in 60 days drought persistence is the period that streamflow remains below the threshold for over 30 consecutive days in other words drought growth focuses on capturing the onset of a drought and its initial stages whereas drought persistence is the period that drought intensifies and lasts until amelioration and then proceeds to the recovery stage therefore the persistence period of drought is generally longer than the growth stage for example in the 2012 us drought prolonged period of high air temperature in late spring resulted in soaring atmospheric evaporative demand in central us that quickly translated to severe and extreme drought conditions drying the soil moisture and substantially reducing the streamflow especially in central us hobbins et al 2016 otkin et al 2017 therefore for the 2012 drought the growth stage was very short making its detection very challenging and subsequently causing considerable impacts mcevoy et al 2016 yan et al 2017 a thorough examination of water quality changes over this drought episode is executed water temperature shows the maximum deviation from threshold occurred in the river basins that are located in lower latitude see fig s2 additionally fig 3 reveals that in the sates that are located in lower latitudes drought persistence tends to be longer dissolved oxygen shows the same pattern where california arizona texas and south carolina experienced the most deviation from the normal condition with relatively longer persistence on the other hand turbidity tends to deviate most for this drought episode in mountainous areas that are located in dry climate southeast us and generally the areas located on east coast show the least deviation of turbidity compared to other regions 3 2 spatial analysis of drought stages fig 4 top shows the number of hydrological drought episodes over the conus during the study period 1950 2016 it is worth mentioning that in order to keep the maps easier to follow all the presented results are interpolated using inverse distance weighted interpolation method the figure reveals that generally the pacific northwest mid atlantic and great lakes basins experienced droughts more frequently than other basins the upper colorado and ohio river basins also experienced relatively frequent drought episodes in general western us indicates a tendency towards more frequent hydrological drought events another drought characteristic investigated in the figure is drought duration fig 4 bottom shows the average duration of drought over the conus texas south atlantic and missouri show longer drought duration compared to other regions comparing drought frequency and drought duration the regions with more frequent droughts tend to have shorter drought episodes besides the total duration of drought shown in fig 4 the duration of each stage of drought is also assessed fig 5 illustrates the duration of drought growth persistence and recovery across the conus for the study period fig 5a shows the average duration of drought growth days as seen in this figure the south atlantic texas gulf and missouri basins indicate longer drought growth duration compared to other regions generally prolonged drought growth periods cause drought identification complex since the streamflow deviation is not significant and it usually does not get attention until it reaches the persistence period another parameter presented in the figure is duration of drought persistence fig 5b the figure illustrates that drought on average persists less than 2 months in most of the eastern us whereas in california upper colorado texas and souris red rainy basins droughts tend to persist more than three months lastly mean drought recovery duration is presented in fig 5c it can be seen that there are regions located in south atlantic mid atlantic texas and arkansas river basins with average drought recovery duration of 6 months whereas california pacific northwest great lakes and ohio river basins tend to recover from drought in less than 4 months comparing the average duration of drought stages fig 5a b and c discloses that drought recovery takes longer time than drought growth and persistence moreover the regions corresponding to longer drought growth require more time for drought recovery 3 3 drought impacts on water temperature fig 6 shows temporal changes of water temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity during three hydrological drought episodes affecting three selected stations in south carolina in 2009 kansas in 2014 and oregon in 2012 these stations are chosen since they represent the mean pattern of the river basin they are located and they provide the same length of records for water quality a statistical analysis on all stations reveals that a hydrological drought is associated with an increase in water temperature see table 1 kruskal wallis test is applied to detect whether there is a significant difference at p value 0 05 between the median of water temperature during a drought episode and the water temperature threshold level additionally fig 6 reveals that water temperature threshold follows a seasonal pattern and it tends to be higher lower in the warmer colder seasons it is worth mentioning that the same pattern is seen all over the study area results of the kruskal wallias test indicated that for most drought episodes more than 85 of all stations there is a significant difference between water temperature during drought episodes and the normal water temperature threshold additionally the mean median and the maximum water temperature in all stations were higher than the mean median and the maximum water temperature threshold respectively fig 6 first column shows that water temperature during 2 month 4 month drought episodes in south carolina and oregon kansas are mostly above the normal water temperature threshold level normal condition the figure illustrates that water temperature reverts to its normal range 42 68 and 27 days after drought termination in south carolina kansas and oregon respectively on average among all stations over the conus water temperature reverts to its pre drought normal state 52 days after drought termination the required time for water temperature to recover from a hydrological drought the spatial distribution of the average time required for water temperature to recover from a hydrological drought is presented in fig 7 a this study showed that water temperature increased during hydrological drought episodes which is in agreement with many previous assessments chessman and robinson 1987 caruso 2001 zielinski et al 2009 our analyses on all studied stations demonstrated that water temperature considerably increases from the beginning of the persistence stage of drought and it remains above the normal threshold even after drought termination if the growth stage lasts for more than 40 days water temperature may increase even during the growth stage in most cases water temperature reaches its maximum deviation when the maximum departure is happened in streamflow the minimum median and maximum deviation of water temperature from the normal threshold for each river basin are presented in table 1 the table shows that the basins located in lower latitudes experienced higher water temperature rise it is worth mentioning that the maximum water temperature increase coincided with the most severe drought episode in all river basins 3 4 drought impacts on turbidity decreased turbidity is detected during drought episodes using the kruskal wallis test fig 6 right column the test indicated that for most of the stations 90 of them the median observed turbidity during drought was significantly lower p value 0 05 than the normal turbidity threshold there were few stations that the difference between the medians was not significant however for all stations the mean and median of observed turbidity during drought episodes were lower than the mean and median of the normal turbidity threshold respectively see table 1 low turbidity is generally desired for most water consumption purposes specifically domestic demand on the other hand since drought terminations mostly coincide with a sudden increase of flow i e higher runoff causes higher turbidity the turbidity thrusts up during the drought termination this implies that more time is required for the turbidity to recover after hydrological drought termination fig 6 right column shows that after a 2 month 4 month drought episodes in south carolina and oregon kansas turbidity needs 67 and 24 40 days to recover respectively on average among all stations over the conus turbidity requires 42 days to recover after hydrological drought termination spatial distribution of turbidity recovery time reveals that it takes less than 60 days for most of the regions to recover from drought fig 7c there are some scattered areas in arkansas pacific northwest southeast missouri and great lakes river basins with recovery times more than 60 days our analysis detected that turbidity is usually lower than the normal threshold during hydrological droughts which is in agreement with the findings of several previous studies caruso 2001 2002 golladay and battle 2002 goransson et al 2013 the improvement of water turbidity can be attributed to less storm events that causes decreased runoff which is associated with less erosion of solid transports to the watercourses during drought lower streamflow during the hydrological drought also causes slower velocity which increases sedimentation and decreases turbidity table 1 showed that for the river basins located in dry climate with mountainous characteristics e g lower colorado and great basins the maximum deviation of turbidity is higher than other river basins such higher deviation implies the tendency of these basins to terminate droughts with a sudden increase in streamflow paulson et al 1985 mensing et al 2008 asadi zarch et al 2011 it has been discussed that turbidity can have various impacts on ecology and natural habitats high concentration of particulate matter during drought recovery period decreases light penetration and consequently reduces productivity and natural habitat quality it also increases sedimentation which makes siltation more likely and can result in harming the habitat for fish and aquatic life lake 2011 3 5 drought impacts on dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen alteration is investigated in all stations using the kruskal wallis test to examine if the median of observed dissolved oxygen is significantly different from the threshold the test shows that there is a significant difference between the medians of dissolved oxygen during drought episodes and the normal dissolved oxygen threshold p value 0 05 during drought the mean and median of dissolved oxygen in all stations were lower than the mean and median of dissolved oxygen threshold respectively see table 1 fig 6 middle column illustrates that after a drought episode with 2 4 months duration dissolved oxygen recovery lasts for 15 and 64 47 days in south carolina and oregon kansas respectively on average among all stations over the conus dissolved oxygen requires 51 days to recover after hydrological drought termination dissolved oxygen recovery takes more than 2 months in southeast missouri texas and south atlantic river basins see fig 7b moreover fig 6 shows that the dissolved oxygen follows a seasonal pattern and it reaches to the lowest highest level during warmer colder seasons this pattern is seen all over the study area this diagram shows the reverse relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen and explains the decreases of dissolved oxygen level during drought episodes due to the increases in temperature our analysis also identified a decline in dissolved oxygen when a hydrological drought takes place which is in agreement with findings of many studies showing a decrease in dissolved oxygen during hydrological droughts boulton and lake 1992 ylla et al 2010 hellwig et al 2017 generally in river basins with perennial rivers and higher streamflow the variability range of dissolved oxygen is limited due to the deeper flow in rivers which leads to less reaeration on the other hand most ephemeral rivers with shallow flow are located in lower latitude dissolved oxygen requires longer recovery time in these river basins because of higher water temperature and less oxygen solubility in spite of better reaeration therefore in most river basins water temperature is the dominant process rather than reaeration and biological activity that controls dissolved oxygen level during drought persistence stage dissolved oxygen shows a similar pattern to water temperature and the maximum deviation of dissolved oxygen happens in the persistence stage many aquatic species can survive only within a specific temperature range and a minimum dissolved oxygen level therefore considering dissolved oxygen and water temperature is essential for maintaining the ecology and biology of water resources systems matthews and marsh matthews 2003 lake 2011 droughts have caused flora and fauna fatalities in different parts of the world for instance in australia leigh at al 2015 southern us buskey et al 2001 and california brumbaugh et al 1994 israel and lund 1995 the reported reasons for aquatic fatalities due to droughts were decline in dissolved oxygen level vanishing the natural habitat of species loss of streams connectivity and alteration of food lake 2003 2011 leigh et al 2015 4 discussion applying the hydrological drought detection method a total of 9247 drought episodes were identified in 400 stations across the conus during 1950 2016 fig 8 shows the relationship between drought duration recovery time required time for streamflow and water quality to revert to its pre drought state and annual flow across three different river basins with diverse climate i e pacific northwest arkansas and south atlantic the figure illustrates that there is a significant inverse relationship between drought duration and the annual flow in all three river basins r2 0 5 and p value 0 05 therefore annual streamflow deficits are probably more intense during prolonged drought events compared to shorter drought episodes similar results are found for recovery time and annual flow and severe annual streamflow deficits are more likely to result in longer recovery time however recovery time is positively correlated to drought duration for these river basins r2 0 5 and p value 0 05 and similar pattern is found in all the river basins over the conus the positive correlation found between drought duration and annual flow is in agreement with the findings of spinoni et al 2014 and austin et al 2018 these studies also showed that if a drought episode lasts longer drought severity increases and the affected area deals with exacerbated water stress thomas et al 2014 investigated hydrological droughts and recovery time for south and southeastern usa and concluded that for longer and more severe hydrological droughts longer drought recovery duration should be expected these findings are in consensus with the findings of the present study indicating an inverse relationship between recovery time and annual flow and a direct relationship between drought duration and recovery time fig 9 shows hydrological drought severity over the conus for the study period severity indicates the ratio of accumulated streamflow deficit to streamflow in normal condition during drought episodes elaborated in equation 1 1 d r o u g h t s e v e r i t y i o n s e t t e r m i n a t i o n o b s e r v e d s t r e a m f l o w i t h r e s h o l d i i o n s e t t e r m i a n t i o n t h r e s h o l d i 100 i f o b s e r v e d s t r e a m f l o w i t h r e s h o l d i 0 the figure shows that california great basin and south atlantic river basins experienced more severe droughts during the study period texas and souris basins also experienced severe droughts comparing fig 9 drought severity and fig 4 number of droughts reveals an inverse relation between drought severity and frequency in areas located in the pacific northwest california great basin upper colorado texas arkansas ohio new england upper mississippi and mid atlantic river basins this inverse relationship implies that the regions affected by more frequent droughts experienced less severe droughts in general this is found in the pacific northwest upper colorado and mid atlantic river basins whereas those parts of the conus that experienced less frequent droughts e g california texas and south atlantic river basins suffered from more severe droughts griffin and anchukaitis 2014 showed that for the period of 2012 2014 california experienced the most severe drought condition in the last century our analysis also finds southern california among the regions that the most severe hydrological droughts have happened during the study period additionally california experienced a hydrological drought in 2012 which lasted for almost a year fig 3 and that drought episode was accompanied by two major hydrological droughts in the following years anderson et al 2013 and long et al 2013 showed that southern us experienced more severe drought episodes compared to northern regions during the period of 2000 2012 fig 9 also corroborates that these areas i e florida southern plains and southwestern us experienced more severe hydrological droughts compared to the rest of the us fig 10 illustrates the correlation between the deviation of water quality parameters during drought episodes and drought severity over 18 river basins in general water temperature and dissolved oxygen are more correlated with drought severity than turbidity dissolved oxygen and drought severity are highly correlated in california lower colorado texas rio grande and south atlantic river basins all of which are located in the lower latitudes turbidity and drought severity correlation is the highest in missouri and arkansas both located in arid climate comparing fig 10 with fig 7 reveals that in the river basins that require longer recovery time for dissolved oxygen the correlation between dissolved oxygen and drought severity is highest similar pattern is found for turbidity recovery time in the great lakes missouri and arkansas where the correlation between drought severity and turbidity is the highest compared to other water quality parameters fig 10 shows that the southern us regions basins 2 7 and 16 indicate higher correlation between water quality variations and drought severity with dissolved oxygen indicating the highest correlation which reveals the higher vulnerability of aquatic life to drought severity in southern us the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs are developed to probabilistically analyze drought duration in the study period fig 11 shows the cdf of drought duration for ohio missouri and south texas gulf river basins these river basins are selected as they show the lowest highest and mean drought duration respectively the figure shows that with 75 probability drought durations are 180 220 and 300 days in ohio missouri and texas river basins respectively additionally historical hydrological droughts indicated a median 50 probability duration of 110 125 and 140 days for ohio missouri and texas river basins respectively in another interpretation if a drought episode begins in these river basins it is 55 68 and 75 probable that it lasts for 200 days or less in texas missouri and ohio respectively in conclusion it is more likely for texas to experience more long term drought events compared to other river basins 5 summary and conclusions it is essential to understand drought impacts on freshwater resources quality and their recovery duration to this end this study developed a framework for hydrological drought detection in order to categorize droughts into three stages of growth persistence and retreat investigated water quality variations during droughts analyzed recovery time for each water quality parameter and finally assessed spatiotemporal and probabilistic characteristics of drought episodes the method was applied on 400 streamflow and water quality stations over the conus with daily observation the historic 2012 us drought was selected to validate the presented methodology on average drought persistence was found to last less than 2 months in most of the eastern us whereas in california upper colorado and texas river basins drought tends to persist more than three months results showed that drought frequency is negatively correlated with drought severity and duration whereas drought duration and recovery time are positively correlated in terms of water quality results showed that increased temperature decreased turbidity and lower dissolved oxygen were observed during hydrological droughts average recovery time for water temperature turbidity and dissolved oxygen were 52 42 and 51 days following hydrological drought termination respectively furthermore turbidity recovery time was found to be less than 60 days after drought termination for most of the conus whereas dissolved oxygen recovery indicated to be more than 2 months maximum 69 days in the lower

water temperature conus 1 introduction drought is among the most devastating natural disasters which imposes severe impacts on various environmental and ecological aspects of the affected region van loon and van lanen 2012 mishra et al 2017 despite its distinction as a climatic extreme event there is no unanimous definition for drought because of its different types and distinct origins ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2017 meteorological droughts start when precipitation drops below normal level and may lead to hydrological imbalances which disturbs the normal environmental functioning of a region van loon and laaha 2015 heudorfer and stahl 2016 crausbay et al 2017 defined ecological drought by combining drought impacts from ecologic climatic hydrologic socioeconomic and cultural aspects in ecological drought water deficit is defined such that it drives ecosystems beyond their threshold of vulnerability influencing the ecosystem services and triggering feedbacks in natural and human systems several studies have discussed that the severity and frequency of droughts have increased in many parts of the world as a consequence of the changes in rainfall and streamflow patterns which may be associated with anthropogenic activities and climate change karamouz et al 2012 ahmadalipour et al 2017a 2017b thus a systematic framework for detecting drought onset termination can mitigate drought impacts karamouz et al 2011 2013 yan et al 2017 although it is necessary to understand drought recovery mechanism and duration few studies have investigated these topics over large spatial domains pan et al 2013 dechant and moradkhani 2014 while others elaborated on restoring function in plants martorell et al 2014 secchi and zwieniecki 2014 schwalm et al 2017 stated that recovery time is the duration that an ecosystem requires to revert to its pre drought condition ecological drought recovery was presumed to coincide with hydrological drought termination anderegg et al 2015 in riverine ecosystems water quality is an important ecological factor which has been neglected in the majority of drought recovery assessments understanding drought recovery duration is essential if a region experiences a new drought episode before complete recovery from an antecedent drought event the ecosystem would experience more severe ecological impacts sawada and koike 2016 categorizing a drought episode into different stages can shed light on drought propagation and provide a better understanding of drought recovery there have been few attempts to utilize variable spatiotemporal thresholds for categorizing droughts into different stages bonsal et al 2011 parry et al 2016a 2016b most of the assessments merely focused on water availability quantity while the recovery of water quality has not been investigated more specifically the possible lag time between drought recovery in terms of water quantity and quality has not been studied the fresh water quality is correlated to streamflow biogeochemical and anthropogenic influences several studies explored water quality variations during hydrological drought episodes at different spatial scales van vliet and zwolsman 2008 hrdinka et al 2012 hellwig et al 2017 mosley 2015 outlined three driving forces for water quality changes during a drought episode explicitly 1 hydrological drivers dilution and mass balance 2 the role of increased temperature and 3 increased residence times many studies concluded on increasing water temperature during hydrological drought episodes sprague 2005 baures et al 2013 hansl√≠k et al 2016 higher water temperature intensifies biological activity leading to a higher rate of nutrient uptake and more oxygen release drought or low flow condition cause higher water temperature and less nutrient inflow to water bodies hellwig et al 2017 mosley 2015 this leads to favorable changes in physical and hydrological conditions for biological growth increasing the likelihood of eutrophication thus eutrophication will increase not only due to changes in nutrient concentration but also due to hydrological and physical conditions becoming more suitable recently sinha et al 2017 showed that the precipitation changes induced by climate change will substantially increase the riverine total nitrogen loading across the u s which will exacerbate eutrophication especially over the northeastern parts the solubility of gasses such as oxygen depends on water temperature and theoretically higher temperature causes less solubility of oxygen previous studies showed that in most cases when water temperature increases dissolved oxygen decreases indicating solubility is the dominant process for the concentration of dissolved oxygen mulholland et al 1997 mimikou et al 2000 murdoch et al 2000 additionally decreased streamflow during hydrological drought episodes causes lower velocities and longer residence times mosley 2015 therefore sedimentation and higher interaction of groundwater and surface water lead to lower turbidity during drought episodes hrdinka et al 2012 mosley et al 2012 most of the above mentioned analyses have been carried out at regional scales and there have been just few attempts for investigating water quality changes during drought episodes over the conus there are two primary groups of drought identification methods both of which require long time series of hydro meteorological data the first method is the probabilistic based approach which provides drought intensity according to the deviation from normal condition most of the standardized drought indices follow this approach which have been employed in numerous studies mckee et al 1993 vicente serrano et al 2010 irannezhad et al 2017 the second drought identification method is the threshold based approach drought onset happens when the variable of interest falls below a predefined threshold ko and tarhule 1994 shiau and shen 2001 wong et al 2013 moreover there are two threshold level families the constant i e a constant percentile of annual long term cumulative frequency distribution and the variable threshold level the variable threshold method is more appropriate when seasonal patterns should be taken into account and is broadly used in recent studies sung and chung 2014 van loon and laaha 2015 heudorfer and stahl 2016 since the environmental functions are related to seasonal cycles droughts are considered as deviations from seasonal cycles and the variable threshold method is implemented in this study this paper integrates hydrological drought concepts and its environmental impacts and represents a multi stage framework to detect and characterize hydrological droughts considering water quality parameters the overarching objectives of this study are to fill the following gaps which have not been adequately addressed in previous assessments 1 developing a framework for hydrological drought detection and categorizing drought episodes into different stages of growth persistence and retreat 2 investigating water quality variations during hydrological drought episodes 3 analyzing drought recovery considering both water quality and quantity criteria 4 assessing spatiotemporal and probabilistic characteristics of hydrological drought including frequency severity and recovery duration 2 materials and method in hydrological drought studies drought recovery is defined as the time when the hydrological variable of interest reverts to its normal condition mo 2011 pan et al 2013 dechant and moradkhani 2014 the ecological perspectives reveals that a complete drought recovery may require longer time and it is essential to consider more criteria in addition to water quantity for drought recovery in this study drought recovery is defined as a phase starting within the drought episode and extending beyond drought termination until the riverine ecosystem reverts to its pre drought condition to capture drought recovery duration drought episodes should be identified fig 1 presents the methodology which consists of three main steps explained in the following sections 2 1 hydrological drought threshold determination the characteristics of a region data availability and the study objectives are the factors which affect the threshold calculation method daily quantile based on the long time series is considered as the optimum value for streamflow threshold because it is capable of capturing the low flow regime of a basin heudorfer and stahl 2016 to calculate daily streamflow threshold level daily quantiles are computed for the streamflow duration curve over the entire observation period 1950 2016 kjeldsen et al 2000 suggested the range of 70th 95th percentile as the threshold level in this study the 80th percentile fleig et al 2006 heudorfer and stahl 2016 is considered as the threshold level and the time series of the 365 threshold levels are generated in other words a set of 365 80th percentile values are calculated from the available observed data for each station this threshold level is applied for all the stations to maintain the comparability of characteristics of detected droughts over the study area applying the 80th percentile threshold may result in many short periods of streamflow deficit which are not necessarily separate drought episodes therefore a centered moving average of 30 days is applied to smooth the jagged threshold curve heudorfer and stahl 2016 2 2 identifying drought stages comparing the daily observed flow with the threshold to detect hydrological droughts may cause a sequence of short drought episodes which are not separated tallaksen et al 1997 van loon and laaha 2015 many studies eliminated any drought event shorter than 15 days hisdal et al 2004 fleig et al 2006 additionally they applied a pooling method with the inter event period of 10 days to integrate separate events tallaksen et al 1997 fleig et al 2006 which was found to be not effective and failed in detecting multi seasonal drought events therefore a method is developed here to unify these discrete events by categorizing a hydrological drought episode into three stages of growth persistence and retreat combining the methods utilized by bonsal et al 2011 and parry et al 2016a the drought persistence period is the main criterion for hydrological drought assessment having identified drought persistence drought growth and retreat can then be investigated the following steps explain each hydrological drought stage see supplementary fig s1 persistence the period that streamflow remains below the normal threshold level for at least 30 consecutive days if there are more than one period fulfilling this condition during a drought episode the longest period is considered as the drought persistence stage growth moving backwards from the beginning of drought persistence drought onset is the point when streamflow falls below the threshold level for less than 15 days in a t day window explained in the drought recovery section drought growth stage starts from drought onset until the beginning of drought persistence retreat moving forward from the end of drought persistence stage drought termination is the time when streamflow falls below the threshold level for less than 15 days in a t day window explained in the drought recovery section drought retreat stage starts following the end of drought persistence until drought termination 2 3 drought recovery in this study drought recovery starts from the beginning of the retreat stage and continues until t day after drought termination the t day after drought termination when streamflow has reverted to its pre drought condition is added to drought retreat for drought recovery because the basin needs more time to meet normal water quality condition the t day period is defined as the required time for all water quality parameters to recover to revert to their normal conditions thus a river is assumed to recover from a drought when the streamflow and water quality parameters return to their normal i e pre drought condition water quality is assumed recovered when there is no significant difference between the median of variable of interest and its threshold combining methods by caruso 2001 2002 and van vliet and zwolsman 2008 the kruskal wallis test kruskal and wallis 1952 as a nonparametric method is employed at 0 05 significance level to investigate such difference the historical hydrological droughts in each streamflow station were considered and the t day period is calculated in order to comply with the regional characteristics of each basin like streamflow threshold the normal water quality condition threshold is defined as the long term daily average of each water quality variable for the study period which is then smoothed by thirty day centered moving average 2 4 study area and data the contiguous united states conus is selected as the study area because of its widely variable climate which leads to the existence of perennial and ephemeral rivers in different regions there are eighteen river basins across the conus which are delineated based on the usgs 2 digit hydrologic unit codes excluding alaska hawaii and caribbean as shown in fig 2 hydrologic units hu are areas of land from which surface water drains to a particular point among all the streamflow stations across the conus a small fraction of them monitor water quality parameters we considered all the stations operated by usgs over the conus and selected the ones that meet our criteria the criteria for selecting stations are as follows 1 streamflow data availability for at least 30 consecutive years during the study period 1950 2016 2 recording at least one water quality parameter with 5 consecutive years of observed data and total duration of 10 years and 3 being least affected by anthropogenic influences i e dams abstraction and return flows assessing all stations for the above criteria we included all the active stations with over 30 years of streamflow observation that collects at least one of the water quality parameters therefore 400 usgs the us geological survey stations were selected considering the study period 1950 2016 recording at least one water quality parameter and being least affected by anthropogenic influences such as dams abstractions and return flows from irrigation systems and power plants water temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity are assessed as vital water quality parameters swamp 2010 and rest of the water quality parameters are neglected due to their short record or poor spatial coverage missing data for streamflow and water quality parameters are estimated by the usgs therefore significant gaps of observed data are filled fig 2 shows the location of the 400 selected stations all of which measure water temperature whereas some stations do not record either dissolved oxygen or water turbidity 3 results 3 1 verification of the hydrological drought detection framework the 2012 us drought the drought detection method applied in this study is verified for the historic drought event rippey 2015 an unusually dry winter in 2011 2012 coincided with warm and dry spring and summer and affected most parts of the conus it led to catastrophic drought impacts over the affected states and caused 40 billion damage mostly due to agricultural losses rippey 2015 nearly two thirds of the nation dealt with drought on september 2012 according to the us drought monitor usdm the usdm svoboda et al 2012 detected a severe to extreme drought episode affecting all over the conus with higher persistence duration in south and midwest the results of our analysis also detect a hydrological drought event in 38 states with a duration of 11 months on average ranging from 4 to 15 months the onset termination and duration of the 2012 us drought are shown in fig 3 for each of the affected states fig 3 shows that in midwestern and southeastern states the 2012 drought tended to persist longer and drought recovery took more time for these regions while drought recovery in the pacific northwest took shorter time in this study drought growth is defined as the period that the hydrological variable e g streamflow falls below threshold for at least 15 days in 60 days drought persistence is the period that streamflow remains below the threshold for over 30 consecutive days in other words drought growth focuses on capturing the onset of a drought and its initial stages whereas drought persistence is the period that drought intensifies and lasts until amelioration and then proceeds to the recovery stage therefore the persistence period of drought is generally longer than the growth stage for example in the 2012 us drought prolonged period of high air temperature in late spring resulted in soaring atmospheric evaporative demand in central us that quickly translated to severe and extreme drought conditions drying the soil moisture and substantially reducing the streamflow especially in central us hobbins et al 2016 otkin et al 2017 therefore for the 2012 drought the growth stage was very short making its detection very challenging and subsequently causing considerable impacts mcevoy et al 2016 yan et al 2017 a thorough examination of water quality changes over this drought episode is executed water temperature shows the maximum deviation from threshold occurred in the river basins that are located in lower latitude see fig s2 additionally fig 3 reveals that in the sates that are located in lower latitudes drought persistence tends to be longer dissolved oxygen shows the same pattern where california arizona texas and south carolina experienced the most deviation from the normal condition with relatively longer persistence on the other hand turbidity tends to deviate most for this drought episode in mountainous areas that are located in dry climate southeast us and generally the areas located on east coast show the least deviation of turbidity compared to other regions 3 2 spatial analysis of drought stages fig 4 top shows the number of hydrological drought episodes over the conus during the study period 1950 2016 it is worth mentioning that in order to keep the maps easier to follow all the presented results are interpolated using inverse distance weighted interpolation method the figure reveals that generally the pacific northwest mid atlantic and great lakes basins experienced droughts more frequently than other basins the upper colorado and ohio river basins also experienced relatively frequent drought episodes in general western us indicates a tendency towards more frequent hydrological drought events another drought characteristic investigated in the figure is drought duration fig 4 bottom shows the average duration of drought over the conus texas south atlantic and missouri show longer drought duration compared to other regions comparing drought frequency and drought duration the regions with more frequent droughts tend to have shorter drought episodes besides the total duration of drought shown in fig 4 the duration of each stage of drought is also assessed fig 5 illustrates the duration of drought growth persistence and recovery across the conus for the study period fig 5a shows the average duration of drought growth days as seen in this figure the south atlantic texas gulf and missouri basins indicate longer drought growth duration compared to other regions generally prolonged drought growth periods cause drought identification complex since the streamflow deviation is not significant and it usually does not get attention until it reaches the persistence period another parameter presented in the figure is duration of drought persistence fig 5b the figure illustrates that drought on average persists less than 2 months in most of the eastern us whereas in california upper colorado texas and souris red rainy basins droughts tend to persist more than three months lastly mean drought recovery duration is presented in fig 5c it can be seen that there are regions located in south atlantic mid atlantic texas and arkansas river basins with average drought recovery duration of 6 months whereas california pacific northwest great lakes and ohio river basins tend to recover from drought in less than 4 months comparing the average duration of drought stages fig 5a b and c discloses that drought recovery takes longer time than drought growth and persistence moreover the regions corresponding to longer drought growth require more time for drought recovery 3 3 drought impacts on water temperature fig 6 shows temporal changes of water temperature dissolved oxygen and turbidity during three hydrological drought episodes affecting three selected stations in south carolina in 2009 kansas in 2014 and oregon in 2012 these stations are chosen since they represent the mean pattern of the river basin they are located and they provide the same length of records for water quality a statistical analysis on all stations reveals that a hydrological drought is associated with an increase in water temperature see table 1 kruskal wallis test is applied to detect whether there is a significant difference at p value 0 05 between the median of water temperature during a drought episode and the water temperature threshold level additionally fig 6 reveals that water temperature threshold follows a seasonal pattern and it tends to be higher lower in the warmer colder seasons it is worth mentioning that the same pattern is seen all over the study area results of the kruskal wallias test indicated that for most drought episodes more than 85 of all stations there is a significant difference between water temperature during drought episodes and the normal water temperature threshold additionally the mean median and the maximum water temperature in all stations were higher than the mean median and the maximum water temperature threshold respectively fig 6 first column shows that water temperature during 2 month 4 month drought episodes in south carolina and oregon kansas are mostly above the normal water temperature threshold level normal condition the figure illustrates that water temperature reverts to its normal range 42 68 and 27 days after drought termination in south carolina kansas and oregon respectively on average among all stations over the conus water temperature reverts to its pre drought normal state 52 days after drought termination the required time for water temperature to recover from a hydrological drought the spatial distribution of the average time required for water temperature to recover from a hydrological drought is presented in fig 7 a this study showed that water temperature increased during hydrological drought episodes which is in agreement with many previous assessments chessman and robinson 1987 caruso 2001 zielinski et al 2009 our analyses on all studied stations demonstrated that water temperature considerably increases from the beginning of the persistence stage of drought and it remains above the normal threshold even after drought termination if the growth stage lasts for more than 40 days water temperature may increase even during the growth stage in most cases water temperature reaches its maximum deviation when the maximum departure is happened in streamflow the minimum median and maximum deviation of water temperature from the normal threshold for each river basin are presented in table 1 the table shows that the basins located in lower latitudes experienced higher water temperature rise it is worth mentioning that the maximum water temperature increase coincided with the most severe drought episode in all river basins 3 4 drought impacts on turbidity decreased turbidity is detected during drought episodes using the kruskal wallis test fig 6 right column the test indicated that for most of the stations 90 of them the median observed turbidity during drought was significantly lower p value 0 05 than the normal turbidity threshold there were few stations that the difference between the medians was not significant however for all stations the mean and median of observed turbidity during drought episodes were lower than the mean and median of the normal turbidity threshold respectively see table 1 low turbidity is generally desired for most water consumption purposes specifically domestic demand on the other hand since drought terminations mostly coincide with a sudden increase of flow i e higher runoff causes higher turbidity the turbidity thrusts up during the drought termination this implies that more time is required for the turbidity to recover after hydrological drought termination fig 6 right column shows that after a 2 month 4 month drought episodes in south carolina and oregon kansas turbidity needs 67 and 24 40 days to recover respectively on average among all stations over the conus turbidity requires 42 days to recover after hydrological drought termination spatial distribution of turbidity recovery time reveals that it takes less than 60 days for most of the regions to recover from drought fig 7c there are some scattered areas in arkansas pacific northwest southeast missouri and great lakes river basins with recovery times more than 60 days our analysis detected that turbidity is usually lower than the normal threshold during hydrological droughts which is in agreement with the findings of several previous studies caruso 2001 2002 golladay and battle 2002 goransson et al 2013 the improvement of water turbidity can be attributed to less storm events that causes decreased runoff which is associated with less erosion of solid transports to the watercourses during drought lower streamflow during the hydrological drought also causes slower velocity which increases sedimentation and decreases turbidity table 1 showed that for the river basins located in dry climate with mountainous characteristics e g lower colorado and great basins the maximum deviation of turbidity is higher than other river basins such higher deviation implies the tendency of these basins to terminate droughts with a sudden increase in streamflow paulson et al 1985 mensing et al 2008 asadi zarch et al 2011 it has been discussed that turbidity can have various impacts on ecology and natural habitats high concentration of particulate matter during drought recovery period decreases light penetration and consequently reduces productivity and natural habitat quality it also increases sedimentation which makes siltation more likely and can result in harming the habitat for fish and aquatic life lake 2011 3 5 drought impacts on dissolved oxygen dissolved oxygen alteration is investigated in all stations using the kruskal wallis test to examine if the median of observed dissolved oxygen is significantly different from the threshold the test shows that there is a significant difference between the medians of dissolved oxygen during drought episodes and the normal dissolved oxygen threshold p value 0 05 during drought the mean and median of dissolved oxygen in all stations were lower than the mean and median of dissolved oxygen threshold respectively see table 1 fig 6 middle column illustrates that after a drought episode with 2 4 months duration dissolved oxygen recovery lasts for 15 and 64 47 days in south carolina and oregon kansas respectively on average among all stations over the conus dissolved oxygen requires 51 days to recover after hydrological drought termination dissolved oxygen recovery takes more than 2 months in southeast missouri texas and south atlantic river basins see fig 7b moreover fig 6 shows that the dissolved oxygen follows a seasonal pattern and it reaches to the lowest highest level during warmer colder seasons this pattern is seen all over the study area this diagram shows the reverse relationship between water temperature and dissolved oxygen and explains the decreases of dissolved oxygen level during drought episodes due to the increases in temperature our analysis also identified a decline in dissolved oxygen when a hydrological drought takes place which is in agreement with findings of many studies showing a decrease in dissolved oxygen during hydrological droughts boulton and lake 1992 ylla et al 2010 hellwig et al 2017 generally in river basins with perennial rivers and higher streamflow the variability range of dissolved oxygen is limited due to the deeper flow in rivers which leads to less reaeration on the other hand most ephemeral rivers with shallow flow are located in lower latitude dissolved oxygen requires longer recovery time in these river basins because of higher water temperature and less oxygen solubility in spite of better reaeration therefore in most river basins water temperature is the dominant process rather than reaeration and biological activity that controls dissolved oxygen level during drought persistence stage dissolved oxygen shows a similar pattern to water temperature and the maximum deviation of dissolved oxygen happens in the persistence stage many aquatic species can survive only within a specific temperature range and a minimum dissolved oxygen level therefore considering dissolved oxygen and water temperature is essential for maintaining the ecology and biology of water resources systems matthews and marsh matthews 2003 lake 2011 droughts have caused flora and fauna fatalities in different parts of the world for instance in australia leigh at al 2015 southern us buskey et al 2001 and california brumbaugh et al 1994 israel and lund 1995 the reported reasons for aquatic fatalities due to droughts were decline in dissolved oxygen level vanishing the natural habitat of species loss of streams connectivity and alteration of food lake 2003 2011 leigh et al 2015 4 discussion applying the hydrological drought detection method a total of 9247 drought episodes were identified in 400 stations across the conus during 1950 2016 fig 8 shows the relationship between drought duration recovery time required time for streamflow and water quality to revert to its pre drought state and annual flow across three different river basins with diverse climate i e pacific northwest arkansas and south atlantic the figure illustrates that there is a significant inverse relationship between drought duration and the annual flow in all three river basins r2 0 5 and p value 0 05 therefore annual streamflow deficits are probably more intense during prolonged drought events compared to shorter drought episodes similar results are found for recovery time and annual flow and severe annual streamflow deficits are more likely to result in longer recovery time however recovery time is positively correlated to drought duration for these river basins r2 0 5 and p value 0 05 and similar pattern is found in all the river basins over the conus the positive correlation found between drought duration and annual flow is in agreement with the findings of spinoni et al 2014 and austin et al 2018 these studies also showed that if a drought episode lasts longer drought severity increases and the affected area deals with exacerbated water stress thomas et al 2014 investigated hydrological droughts and recovery time for south and southeastern usa and concluded that for longer and more severe hydrological droughts longer drought recovery duration should be expected these findings are in consensus with the findings of the present study indicating an inverse relationship between recovery time and annual flow and a direct relationship between drought duration and recovery time fig 9 shows hydrological drought severity over the conus for the study period severity indicates the ratio of accumulated streamflow deficit to streamflow in normal condition during drought episodes elaborated in equation 1 1 d r o u g h t s e v e r i t y i o n s e t t e r m i n a t i o n o b s e r v e d s t r e a m f l o w i t h r e s h o l d i i o n s e t t e r m i a n t i o n t h r e s h o l d i 100 i f o b s e r v e d s t r e a m f l o w i t h r e s h o l d i 0 the figure shows that california great basin and south atlantic river basins experienced more severe droughts during the study period texas and souris basins also experienced severe droughts comparing fig 9 drought severity and fig 4 number of droughts reveals an inverse relation between drought severity and frequency in areas located in the pacific northwest california great basin upper colorado texas arkansas ohio new england upper mississippi and mid atlantic river basins this inverse relationship implies that the regions affected by more frequent droughts experienced less severe droughts in general this is found in the pacific northwest upper colorado and mid atlantic river basins whereas those parts of the conus that experienced less frequent droughts e g california texas and south atlantic river basins suffered from more severe droughts griffin and anchukaitis 2014 showed that for the period of 2012 2014 california experienced the most severe drought condition in the last century our analysis also finds southern california among the regions that the most severe hydrological droughts have happened during the study period additionally california experienced a hydrological drought in 2012 which lasted for almost a year fig 3 and that drought episode was accompanied by two major hydrological droughts in the following years anderson et al 2013 and long et al 2013 showed that southern us experienced more severe drought episodes compared to northern regions during the period of 2000 2012 fig 9 also corroborates that these areas i e florida southern plains and southwestern us experienced more severe hydrological droughts compared to the rest of the us fig 10 illustrates the correlation between the deviation of water quality parameters during drought episodes and drought severity over 18 river basins in general water temperature and dissolved oxygen are more correlated with drought severity than turbidity dissolved oxygen and drought severity are highly correlated in california lower colorado texas rio grande and south atlantic river basins all of which are located in the lower latitudes turbidity and drought severity correlation is the highest in missouri and arkansas both located in arid climate comparing fig 10 with fig 7 reveals that in the river basins that require longer recovery time for dissolved oxygen the correlation between dissolved oxygen and drought severity is highest similar pattern is found for turbidity recovery time in the great lakes missouri and arkansas where the correlation between drought severity and turbidity is the highest compared to other water quality parameters fig 10 shows that the southern us regions basins 2 7 and 16 indicate higher correlation between water quality variations and drought severity with dissolved oxygen indicating the highest correlation which reveals the higher vulnerability of aquatic life to drought severity in southern us the empirical cumulative distribution functions cdfs are developed to probabilistically analyze drought duration in the study period fig 11 shows the cdf of drought duration for ohio missouri and south texas gulf river basins these river basins are selected as they show the lowest highest and mean drought duration respectively the figure shows that with 75 probability drought durations are 180 220 and 300 days in ohio missouri and texas river basins respectively additionally historical hydrological droughts indicated a median 50 probability duration of 110 125 and 140 days for ohio missouri and texas river basins respectively in another interpretation if a drought episode begins in these river basins it is 55 68 and 75 probable that it lasts for 200 days or less in texas missouri and ohio respectively in conclusion it is more likely for texas to experience more long term drought events compared to other river basins 5 summary and conclusions it is essential to understand drought impacts on freshwater resources quality and their recovery duration to this end this study developed a framework for hydrological drought detection in order to categorize droughts into three stages of growth persistence and retreat investigated water quality variations during droughts analyzed recovery time for each water quality parameter and finally assessed spatiotemporal and probabilistic characteristics of drought episodes the method was applied on 400 streamflow and water quality stations over the conus with daily observation the historic 2012 us drought was selected to validate the presented methodology on average drought persistence was found to last less than 2 months in most of the eastern us whereas in california upper colorado and texas river basins drought tends to persist more than three months results showed that drought frequency is negatively correlated with drought severity and duration whereas drought duration and recovery time are positively correlated in terms of water quality results showed that increased temperature decreased turbidity and lower dissolved oxygen were observed during hydrological droughts average recovery time for water temperature turbidity and dissolved oxygen were 52 42 and 51 days following hydrological drought termination respectively furthermore turbidity recovery time was found to be less than 60 days after drought termination for most of the conus whereas dissolved oxygen recovery indicated to be more than 2 months maximum 69 days in the lower

19101,at contaminated sites indoor inhalation of volatile organic compounds from groundwater contamination known as vapor intrusion vi is an important exposure pathway to determine groundwater cleanup level based on empirical analysis us epa concluded that there is a low probability for vapors from fuel hydrocarbons dissolved in groundwater to induce indoor concentrations that exceed risk based standards and recommended 6 feet vertical building source separation distance as the risk screening tool for such cases in this study we examine this recommendation by performing numerical modeling to investigate the detailed effects of the capillary fringe on petroleum vapor biodegradation and attenuation first the numerical model is validated by comparison with laboratory data and field measurements in us epa s database then the verified model is used to simulate two scenarios involving the capillary fringe effect one with a groundwater source at various depth and the other with a soil gas source located above the groundwater level for a groundwater contaminant source the capillary fringe plays a significant role in vi by controlling the soil moisture content and oxygen availability thus affecting the soil gas concentration biodegradation and attenuation specifically the capillary fringe effect can significantly decrease the indoor air concentration by decreasing upward diffusion rates of hydrocarbon increasing the thickness of the aerobic zone and enhancing aerobic biodegradation as a result it is highly unlikely for sources located at groundwater level to induce unacceptable vapor intrusion risks supporting us epa s recommendation moreover the simulations suggest that the vertical smear zone of residual light non aqueous liquid contamination induced by temporal fluctuations of groundwater level may lead to a potential threat to indoor air quality for a short vertical source building separation distance and thus requires more attention the sensitivity test of the numerical model also indicates that it is the vertical separation distance between building foundation and the top of the smear zone instead of the smear zone thickness that should be given more attention during the investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater contamination petroleum vapor intrusion capillary fringe numerical simulations smear zone 1

probability for contaminant vapor concentrations to exceed the screening level of indoor air should be considered negligible unless the building foundation is in contact with groundwater later in 2015 us epa recommended 6 feet vertical source building separation distance should be sufficient to screen pvi risk from sources in dissolved phase us epa 2015a however this criterion was made majorly based on the empirical analysis of the database and there have been few theoretical studies to examine it there have been quite a few studies mostly modeling work investigating the influences of aerobic biodegradation in pvi abreu and johnson 2005 2006 developed a three dimension 3 d numerical model that was used to simulate aerobic biodegradation of benzene with different source strength foundation type source depth and reaction rate constant this numerical model is powerful in simulating complicated subsurface soil gas fate and transport as recognized by us epa but requires considerable training and knowledge which limits its application as a risk screening tool us epa 2012 2013 2015a 2015b devaull 2007 proposed a one dimensional 1 d analytical model that could simulate pvi with oxygen limited biodegradation for a subsurface gasoline source and bekele et al 2017 later modified the model by including vertical heterogeneity based on the model by devaull 2007 gsi environmental inc developed a spreadsheet tool named biovapor gsi 2010 to evaluate pvi risks subject to aerobic biodegradation the biovapor tool though very convenient to use needs some necessary inputs such as subslab oxygen conditions which are typically unavailable in common site investigation gsi 2010 and so is the model developed by bekelet et al 2017 to overcome this limitation yao et al 2016 published a two dimensional 2 d analytical solution by assuming atmosphere at the open ground surface as the oxygen source the same as the assumption adopted in the abreu and johnson model and a toolkit was then developed based on it by verginelli et al 2016a 2016b results from all these studies regarding the screening distance are generally in line with the 4 m screening distance proposed by lahvis et al 2013 which concluded that a sufficiently large vertical separation distance between building and source would allow vapor concentration to be significantly attenuated due to aerobic biodegradation according to statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database however most of the modeling work was based on cases with homogeneous medium and soil moisture and incapable of characterizing heterogeneous moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect in a technical document released by us epa 2012 nonhomogeneous soil conditions were considered by simulating the influence of low permeability soil layers that functioned as barriers to soil gas transport and the authors concluded that such barriers could either decrease the contaminant soil gas by orders of magnitude or increase the concentration by preventing oxygen entering the subsurface depending on the location and distribution of the barrier in fact heterogeneous soil moisture conditions are common in the field from the capillary fringe above the groundwater level to the unsaturated zone or due to rainfall events ong et al 1992 tillman and weaver 2007 shen et al 2013 simulated the influences of moisture content in determining one dimensional soil gas concentration profiles of non biodegradable contaminants in the steady state based on the van genuchten equation 1980 but such influences remain unknown for petroleum products which can be easily biodegraded in aerobic conditions the present work aims to examine the us epa s recommendation by providing a better understanding of the behavior of hydrocarbon soil gas vapor in the presence of heterogeneous soil moisture due to the capillary fringe effect we investigate the influences of capillary fringe in pvi using a previously developed numerical model the numerical model is validated by lab experimental and empirical field data involving the capillary fringe effect then two group of numerical cases are simulated by the validated model one with the vapor source located at the groundwater level i e groundwater contaminant source and the other with the groundwater level 1 m below the vapor source i e soil gas contaminant source in both groups vapor transport is simulated in three types of media sand soil sandy loam soil and clay soil with a constant baseline soil respiration rate to investigate the capillary effects on vapor biodegradation and attenuation 2 methods 2 1 numerical model the numerical model employed here was previously developed with comsol multiphysics and then used and validated in multiple studies yao et al 2011 2013a 2015 2017 in the present research the model is used to perform the coupled simulation of soil gas transport and reaction of hydrocarbon and oxygen assuming an equilibrium partitioning among the vapor liquid and soil phases unger et al 1996 the general form of the governing equation for soil gas transport and reaction in steady state is given as

pilot scale aquifer experiment the model is validated by the measurements from a pilot scale aquifer experiment and us epa s pvi database in simulating the soil gas transport and reaction with the presence of capillary fringe ma et al 2012 performed a pilot scale aquifer experiment to simulate the aerobic biodegradation of methane along the groundwater to soil surface pathway above a plume of dissolved ethanol in this experiment they employed a pilot scale aquifer consisting of an 8 m3 3 7 m 1 8 m 1 2 m continuous flow tank packed with fine grained sand capiro et al 2007 stafford et al 2009 the total thickness of the aquifer was 115 cm and the artificial groundwater table was located at 45 cm below the soil surface surrounding the chamber on top the ground surface is open to atmosphere so that oxygen could migrate in the subsurface during the experiment soil samples were collected from different depths in the pilot scale aquifer to assess the spatial variation of the soil gas concentration of oxygen and methane and these measurements would be used to compare with the numerical prediction 2 3 us epa s pvi database the empirical pvi database was compiled by us epa with measurements of subsurface media soil gas soil and groundwater and supporting data soil types groundwater level sample collection position and so on from 74 sites across the north america and australia usepa 2013 most sites in the database were reported to be involved with gasoline releases and the measurements include 893 benzene soil vapor records 655 oxygen soil vapor records and 829 records with paired benzene soil vapor and groundwater data the recorded vapor sources were divided into two groups lnapl or dissolved phase contamination in the present study the records of soil types soil gas measurements relative sample position compared to groundwater level for cases of dissolved phase contamination are used to reduce the temporal variability in the subsurface soil gas measurements for model validation we compared the simulated vertical hydrocarbon soil gas concentration profiles with the statistical results the probability for benzene soil vapor concentrations to be less than the threshold i e 100 Œºg m3 for different soil types coarse and fine grained 2 4 two dimensional simulation scenarios in this study only the steady state scenarios are investigated benzene is chosen as the representative petroleum hydrocarbon as in other studies abreu and johnson 2006 abreu et al 2009 four different source vapor concentrations c s o u r c e 1 10 100 and 400 g m3 are used to represent dissolved phase and liquid non aqueous phase while three source depths 3 5 and 8 m are employed in all cases the building foundation is assumed to be 2 m deep below the surface and the reaction rate constant is 0 18 h 1 other parameters used in the simulations are shown in table s1 in supporting information for darcy s law a negative pressure of 5 pa is applied at the perimeter crack of 0 005 m wide at the open ground surface surrounding the building an atmosphere pressure condition is used for the rest of the boundaries such as the foundation and the domain bottom a non flux condition is applied in the chemical transport module the source vapor concentration and zero concentration are applied at the domain bottom and the open ground surface respectively the flux boundary condition i e equation 6 is assumed at the perimeter crack and a non flux condition for the rest boundaries the details of boundary conditions are shown in fig s1 in supporting information three groups of simulations are performed in this study in the first group the moisture content is assumed to be uniform in the second the vapor source is located at the groundwater level and the vertical moisture content profile is determined by the capillary fringe effect simulated with the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the third group is similar to the second except that the vapor source is assumed to be located at 1 m above the groundwater level as shown in fig s2 in supporting information it should be noted that according to the van genuchten equation the most significant variation of moisture content occurs within a short distance above the groundwater table especially for the sand soil and as a result the vertical distance between the vapor source and groundwater table would not play a significant role in determining soil gas concentration profiles for each group three soil types sand sandy loam and clay are used to represent coarse grained median grained and fine grained soils respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with lab experiment and field measurements fig 1 shows the comparison of simulated concentration profiles with measured values in the pilot scale aquifer experiment ma et al 2012 the points are observed oxygen and methane soil gas concentrations in the experiment while the lines refer to the predicted profiles by the numerical model the results indicate that the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data in the unsaturated vadose zone above the capillary fringe 0 30 cm deep below the soil surface the oxygen decays approximately linearly with the depth suggesting little consumption of oxygen by the microbes due to low methane concentration in the capillary fringe 30 45 cm deep below the soil surface there are sharp decreases of oxygen and methane soil gas concentrations as a result of significant methanotrophic activity with the presence of both high methane and oxygen concentration below the artificial groundwater table the spatial variation of methane concentration is insignificant as in the absence of oxygen fig 2 shows the comparison between the statistical analysis results of us epa s pvi database us epa 2013 and the one dimensional simulated soil gas profiles with open ground surface the solid lines are the probabilities for benzene soil vapor concentrations to be less than the threshold for different soil types coarse and fine grained and the dashed lines are simulated soil gas concentration profiles for sand and clay soil in the vertical direction away from the building foundation the comparison indicates that the numerical simulations are in a reasonably good agreement with the statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database both show that the decay in coarse grained cases is more significant initially while at 2 feet above the groundwater level the hydrocarbon soil gas concentration in fine grained soil cases are observed to be decreased more significantly than that in coarse grained soil cases the difference in the near source zone within 2 feet above the water table can be explained by the mass balance between the oxygen and hydrocarbon diffusion rate roggemans et al 2001 8 d o e f f c o m a x c o m i n Œ¥ Œº d h e f f c h m a x l t Œ¥ where d o e f f is the total effective diffusivity of oxygen across the aerobic zone d h e f f is the total effective diffusivity of vapor transport across the anaerobic zone c o m a x is the maximum oxygen concentration in aerobic zone c o m i n is the oxygen concentration in anoxic zone c h m a x is the maximum vapor concentration in anoxic zone Œ¥ is the vertical distance from open surface to the aerobic anoxic interface Œº is the stoichiometric conversion factor l t is the distance from the upper surface to the vapor source according to the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the decline of moisture content in coarse grained soils is sharper than that in fine grained soils as shown in fig s3 in supporting information thus the ratio of d o e f f d h e f f in equation 8 would be higher in coarse grained soils based on the calculations of the millinton quirk equation millinton and quirk 1961 and it is more difficult for oxygen to reach the near source zone in fine grained soils as a result the vapor concentration in the coarse grained soils could be significantly decreased due to the natural attenuation caused by the aerobic biodegradation in the near source zone while hydrocarbon concentration could only be diluted through diffusion however when there is enough vertical separation distance 2 feet from the groundwater source to allow the presence of oxygen the aerobic biodegradation in fine grained soils is more significant than that in the coarse grained soils a possible explanation could be that the aerobic biodegradation is enhanced by the presence of higher moisture content in fine grained soils in a one dimensional analytical model developed by devaull 2007 the decay of hydrocarbon soil vapor concentration during the diffusion could be expressed as 9 c z c s exp Œ≥ Œ≤ exp Œ≥ z l Œ≤ exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ z l exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ where c z and c s are the soil vapor concentration of hydrocarbon at the height of z and source vapor concentration respectively l is the total transport length Œ≤ c z l 1 c s is the normalized soil vapor concentration at z l and Œ≥ is the square root of a damkohler number defined as 10 Œ≥ l r Œ∏ w d e f f h b by assuming Œ≤ 0 and exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ equation 10 could be approximated as 11 c z c s exp Œ≥ z l equations 3 and 9 clearly show that the increase of moisture content would cause a decrease of d e f f and the increase of Œ≥ respectively as shown in figs s3 and s4 in supporting information thereby resulting in the decrease of exp Œ≥ z l thus with the presence of oxygen a more significant decay of hydrocarbon vapor concentration caused by biodegradation could be expected in coarse grained soils with higher moisture content devaull 2007 3 2 simulations with sources located at the groundwater level fig 3 shows the simulated soil gas concentration profiles of hydrocarbon and oxygen for three soil types for all soil types the predicted indoor air concentrations in cases with heterogeneous vertical moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect are significantly lower than those with uniform soil moisture content profile by around seven orders of magnitude the heterogeneous moisture content profile caused by the capillary fringe played several roles in the vapor transport and reaction processes first the high moisture content in the vicinity of groundwater table would decrease the hydrocarbon upward diffusion rate and flux millington and quirk 1961 van genuchten 1980 and thus the indoor air concentration secondly the increased moisture content could also enhance the reaction rate during the upward diffusion process it should be noted that such different attenuation can also be observed among different soil types no matter whether the soil moisture profile is determined by the capillary effect or uniform the source to indoor air concentration attenuation is the most significant for the clay case while the least for the sand case finally as illustrated above the capillary fringe effect also plays an important role in determining the aerobic anoxic interface the soil moisture retention curve determined by the capillary fringe effect is dependent on soil types the sharpest decline of moisture content is observed for the sand cases while for clay the curve is the smoothest as shown in fig s3 in the supplemental information thus the vertical variation of effective diffusivity is the most significant for sand which allows the oxygen to easily penetrate the soil deeper than other types of soil this can be explained by the mass balance between the oxygen and hydrocarbon diffusion rate roggemans 2001 as shown in fig 3 the shapes of the aerobic zone in uniform soil moisture cases are quite similar independent of soil types while there is a significant difference in cases where the moisture content is determined by the capillary fringe effect fig 4 shows the influences of source depth in determining hydrocarbon and oxygen soil gas concentration profiles and source to indoor air concentration attenuation factors for cases where sources are located at the groundwater level the simulations are performed for the sand and clay soil and the capillary fringe effect is included in simulating the vertical soil moisture profile by employing the van genuchten equation for the clay cases the predicted indoor air concentration decreases with the increase of the source building separation distance as a result of the increased biodegradation attenuation in the vadose zone consistent with previous studies abreu and johnson 2006 abreu et al 2009 for the sand cases however opposite results are observed the most significant attenuation from source to indoor air occurs in the scenario with the source depth of 3 m below ground surface while the highest indoor air concentration occurs in the case with the source depth of 8 m in other words the predicted indoor air concentration or vi risk increases with the vertical building source separation distance in the simulated cases as discussed in the previous section the vapor concentration attenuation in the diffusive transport coupled with aerobic degradation could be approximated by equation 11 which depends on both the transport length in the aerobic zone and the moisture content profile for the clay soil the water retention curve is relatively smooth in the vertical direction so is the dimensionless factor Œ≥ as shown in fig s4 in supporting information thus the vertical building source separation distance becomes the dominant factor in determining the attenuation approximated by equation 11 the longer the distance the more significant attenuation but for the sandy soil the water retention curve is quite sharp indicating that the water content near the groundwater level is significantly higher than that at locations away from the groundwater level for shallow groundwater sources the oxygen from the atmosphere at the open ground surface can closely approach the groundwater level where the moisture content and the dimensionless factor Œ≥ are relatively high thus the hydrocarbon vapor concentration could be attenuated within a very short transport distance as shown in the 3 m sand case in fig 5 for deeper groundwater sources the distance between the aerobic anoxic interface and the vapor source increases causing decreases in the moisture content and the dimensionless factor Œ≥ as a result the soil vapor concentration attenuation caused by biodegradation decreases with the vertical separation distance see fig s5 in supporting information and so is the predicted indoor air concentration nonetheless it should be noted such phenomenon in sand soil cases is caused by the inclusion of high moisture content in the aerobic zone and for cases with source depth higher than 8 m as the moisture content is relatively uniform and low in the aerobic zone it is expected to observe that the attenuation increases with the vertical source building separation distance fig 5 shows the predicted indoor air concentration as a function of vertical source building separation distances for cases with vapor sources located at groundwater table the results indicate that in cases where the vapor sources are located at the groundwater level it is highly unlikely to induce potential pvi risks with indoor air concentration higher than the target resident air concentration of benzene in us epa s regional screening levels us epa 2017b only in the clay case where the vertical source building separation distance is 1 m i e 3 m below the ground surface and the source vapor concentration is 400 mg l the simulated indoor air concentration is higher than the target level in other words this finding is in line with the us epa s conclusion that the vi risk from contaminant source in dissolved phase is negligible unless there is direct contact between contamination and a building foundation us epa 2013 and the recommendation that 6 feet vertical source building separation distance should be sufficient to screen out pvi risk for petroleum source in the dissolved phase us epa 2015a 3 3 simulations with the source located at 1 m above the groundwater level from the above discussion we conclude that the presence of capillary fringe could effectively reduce the risk of pvi from a steady groundwater source however the groundwater level may fluctuate over weeks or months and such temporal fluctuations typically create a vertical smear zone of residual lnapl contamination both above and below the average water table elevation us epa 2015a here we perform numerical simulations to investigate scenarios with a vapor source located 1 m above the groundwater level which represents a soil gas source fig 6 shows the normalized soil gas concentration profiles of hydrocarbon and oxygen for different soil types similar to the simulations discussed above the most significant attenuation is observed in the clay case while the highest indoor air concentration is identified in the sand case about 6 orders of magnitude higher than that in the clay case compared with the cases with a uniform moisture content and sources at the groundwater level shown in fig 3 the predicted indoor air concentration for the sand case with a soil gas source is about 5 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value in the case with a groundwater source in fact the former is more similar to that of the uniform soil moisture case but for the sandy loam and clay cases the differences between the predicted indoor air concentrations shown in fig 6 and those in the corresponding cases with groundwater sources shown in fig 3 are less significant with 5 and 3 orders of magnitude difference respectively these comparisons show that the fluctuation of groundwater level can potentially induce a temporal variation in pvi risk especially for the sand soil cases where there is the sharpest decline in moisture contents in the vertical direction for the fine grained soil such as clay the variation caused by the fluctuation of groundwater level is much less significant a sensitivity test was applied to the numerical model by calculating the responses of indoor air concentrations to given variations of groundwater table soil texture source depth and strength shown on the y axis in fig 7 the test results indicate that the factor with the greatest influence on the predicted indoor air contaminant concentration is the soil texture followed by source strength and depth while the numerical results are insensitive to the relative position of vapor source to groundwater table an increase decrease in the vertical separation distance between vapor source and groundwater table by 0 5 m would result in nearly half an order magnitude variation in indoor air contaminant concentration it is because the performance of soil gas is determined by the vertical profile of the moisture content and according to the van genuchten equation the most significant variation of moisture content occurs in a short distance above the groundwater table especially for the sandy soil as a result it does not make much difference between cases with a vapor source located at 1 m above the source and those with sources located at 0 5 m or 1 5 m above in other words the thickness of the smear zone is not important compared with the vertical separation distance between the building foundation and the top of the smear zone 4 conclusion in this study we use numerical simulations to investigate the risk of pvi in cases with heterogeneous vertical moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect first the model was validated with chamber experimental results and statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database then the validated model was used to simulate two scenarios with sources located at or 1 m above the groundwater level respectively for the former scenario we find that the indoor air concentrations are significantly reduced as a result of decreased of upward diffusion rates of hydrocarbon enhanced aerobic biodegradation and expanded the aerobic zone in fact in almost all simulated cases with groundwater sources the predicted indoor air concentration would not exceed the screening level of indoor air concentration except for the clay case with 1 m building source separation distance and source vapor concentration of 400 mg l in other words the numerical simulations indicate that petroleum sources in dissolved phase defined as those with benzene concentration lower than 1 mg l would not cause unacceptable vapor intrusion risks unless the groundwater is in contact with the building foundation this finding supports the us epa s conclusion that the probability of exceeding risk based concentrations is low for dissolved contaminant sources and recommendation of 6 feet as vertical source building screening distance us epa 2013 2015a for lnapl sources however due to the fluctuation of groundwater level it is highly possible to induce an unacceptable risk when the vapor source emerges from the groundwater and approaches the building foundation when the position of groundwater table is low and below a portion of the smear zone causing a high volatilization rate our simulations with a source located 1 m above the groundwater level suggest that pvi risk can be significantly increased when the groundwater level drops especially for the sand case with a sharp decline of moisture content this warns investigators that additional attention should be given to seasonal fluctuations of groundwater table and its relative position to the smear zone in general our findings in agreement with other field measurements lahvis et al 2013 pasteris et al 2002 van stempvoort and kwong 2010 laboratory studies ma et al 2012 and other modeling work abreu and johnson 2006 reveal that the capillary fringe effect is sufficient to mitigate pvi from petroleum source in dissolved phase and the focus in site investigation should be more concentrated on the smear zone induced by the groundwater table fluctuation in cases involving the lnapl sources it should be noted that this study is limited by traditional vi pathway and in a scenario involving preferential vi pathway such as a land drain or sewer pipeline which could facilitate the migration of petroleum vapors guo et al 2015 mchugh et al 2017 also this study did not consider the possibility of methanogenesis in the absence of oxygen which could cause upward advection to increase the vi and explosion potential ma et

19101,at contaminated sites indoor inhalation of volatile organic compounds from groundwater contamination known as vapor intrusion vi is an important exposure pathway to determine groundwater cleanup level based on empirical analysis us epa concluded that there is a low probability for vapors from fuel hydrocarbons dissolved in groundwater to induce indoor concentrations that exceed risk based standards and recommended 6 feet vertical building source separation distance as the risk screening tool for such cases in this study we examine this recommendation by performing numerical modeling to investigate the detailed effects of the capillary fringe on petroleum vapor biodegradation and attenuation first the numerical model is validated by comparison with laboratory data and field measurements in us epa s database then the verified model is used to simulate two scenarios involving the capillary fringe effect one with a groundwater source at various depth and the other with a soil gas source located above the groundwater level for a groundwater contaminant source the capillary fringe plays a significant role in vi by controlling the soil moisture content and oxygen availability thus affecting the soil gas concentration biodegradation and attenuation specifically the capillary fringe effect can significantly decrease the indoor air concentration by decreasing upward diffusion rates of hydrocarbon increasing the thickness of the aerobic zone and enhancing aerobic biodegradation as a result it is highly unlikely for sources located at groundwater level to induce unacceptable vapor intrusion risks supporting us epa s recommendation moreover the simulations suggest that the vertical smear zone of residual light non aqueous liquid contamination induced by temporal fluctuations of groundwater level may lead to a potential threat to indoor air quality for a short vertical source building separation distance and thus requires more attention the sensitivity test of the numerical model also indicates that it is the vertical separation distance between building foundation and the top of the smear zone instead of the smear zone thickness that should be given more attention during the investigation graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater contamination petroleum vapor intrusion capillary fringe numerical simulations smear zone 1

us epa recommended 6 feet vertical source building separation distance should be sufficient to screen pvi risk from sources in dissolved phase us epa 2015a however this criterion was made majorly based on the empirical analysis of the database and there have been few theoretical studies to examine it there have been quite a few studies mostly modeling work investigating the influences of aerobic biodegradation in pvi abreu and johnson 2005 2006 developed a three dimension 3 d numerical model that was used to simulate aerobic biodegradation of benzene with different source strength foundation type source depth and reaction rate constant this numerical model is powerful in simulating complicated subsurface soil gas fate and transport as recognized by us epa but requires

2016 published a two dimensional 2 d analytical solution by assuming atmosphere at the open ground surface as the oxygen source the same as the assumption adopted in the abreu and johnson model and a toolkit was then developed based on it by verginelli et al 2016a 2016b results from all these studies regarding the screening distance are generally in line with the 4 m screening distance proposed by lahvis et al 2013 which concluded that a sufficiently large vertical separation distance between building and source would allow vapor concentration to be significantly attenuated due to aerobic biodegradation according to statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database however most of the modeling work was based on cases with homogeneous medium and soil moisture and incapable of characterizing heterogeneous moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect in a technical document released by us epa 2012 nonhomogeneous soil conditions were considered by simulating the influence of low permeability soil layers that functioned as barriers to soil gas transport and the authors concluded that such barriers could either decrease the contaminant soil gas by orders of magnitude or increase the concentration by preventing oxygen entering the subsurface depending on the location and distribution of the barrier in fact heterogeneous soil moisture conditions are common in the field from the capillary fringe above the groundwater level to the unsaturated zone or due to rainfall events ong et al 1992 tillman and weaver 2007 shen et al 2013 simulated the influences of moisture content in determining one dimensional soil gas concentration profiles of non biodegradable contaminants in the steady state based on the van genuchten equation

understanding of the behavior of hydrocarbon soil gas vapor in the presence of heterogeneous soil moisture due to the capillary fringe effect we investigate the influences of capillary fringe in pvi

pilot scale aquifer experiment the model is validated by the measurements from a pilot scale aquifer experiment and us epa s pvi database in simulating the soil gas transport and reaction with the presence of capillary fringe ma et al 2012 performed a pilot scale aquifer experiment to simulate the aerobic biodegradation of methane along the groundwater to soil surface pathway above a plume of dissolved ethanol in this experiment they employed a pilot scale aquifer consisting of an 8 m3 3 7 m 1 8 m 1 2 m continuous flow tank packed with fine grained sand capiro et al 2007 stafford et al 2009 the total thickness of the aquifer was 115 cm and the artificial groundwater table was located at 45 cm below the soil surface surrounding the chamber on top the ground surface is open to atmosphere so that oxygen could migrate in the subsurface during the experiment soil samples were collected from different depths in the pilot scale aquifer to assess the spatial variation of the soil gas concentration of oxygen and methane and these measurements would be used to compare with the numerical prediction 2 3 us epa s pvi database the empirical pvi database was compiled by us epa with measurements of subsurface media soil gas soil and groundwater and supporting data soil types groundwater level sample collection position and so on from 74 sites across the north america and australia usepa 2013 most sites in the database were reported to be involved with gasoline releases and the measurements include 893 benzene soil vapor records 655 oxygen soil vapor records and 829 records with paired benzene soil vapor and groundwater data the recorded vapor sources were divided into two groups lnapl or dissolved phase contamination in the present study the records of soil types soil gas measurements relative sample position compared to groundwater level for cases of dissolved phase contamination are used to reduce the temporal variability in the subsurface soil gas measurements for model validation we compared the simulated vertical hydrocarbon soil gas concentration profiles with the statistical results the probability for benzene soil vapor concentrations to be less than the threshold i e 100 Œºg m3 for different soil types coarse and fine grained 2 4 two dimensional simulation scenarios in this study only the steady state scenarios are investigated benzene is chosen as the representative petroleum hydrocarbon as in other studies abreu and johnson 2006 abreu et al 2009 four different source vapor concentrations c s o u r c e 1 10 100 and 400 g m3 are used to represent dissolved phase and liquid non aqueous phase while three source depths 3 5 and 8 m are employed in all cases the building foundation is assumed to be 2 m deep below the surface and the reaction rate constant is 0 18 h 1 other parameters used in the simulations are shown in table s1 in supporting information for darcy s law a negative pressure of 5 pa is applied at the perimeter crack of 0 005 m wide at the open ground surface surrounding the building an atmosphere pressure condition is used for the rest of the boundaries such as the foundation and the domain bottom a non flux condition is applied in the chemical transport module the source vapor concentration and zero concentration are applied at the domain bottom and the open ground surface respectively the flux boundary condition i e equation 6 is assumed at the perimeter crack and a non flux condition for the rest boundaries the details of boundary conditions are shown in fig s1 in supporting information three groups of simulations are performed in this study in the first group the moisture content is assumed to be uniform in the second the vapor source is located at the groundwater level and the vertical moisture content profile is determined by the capillary fringe effect simulated with the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the third group is similar to the second except that the vapor source is assumed to be located at 1 m above the groundwater level as shown in fig s2 in supporting information it should be noted that according to the van genuchten equation the most significant variation of moisture content occurs within a short distance above the groundwater table especially for the sand soil and as a result the vertical distance between the vapor source and groundwater table would not play a significant role in determining soil gas concentration profiles for each group three soil types sand sandy loam and clay are used to represent coarse grained median grained and fine grained soils respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 comparison with lab experiment and field measurements fig 1 shows the comparison of simulated concentration profiles with measured values in the pilot scale aquifer experiment ma et al 2012 the points are observed oxygen and methane soil gas concentrations in the experiment while the lines refer to the predicted profiles by the numerical model the results indicate that the numerical predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data in the unsaturated vadose zone above the capillary fringe 0 30 cm deep below the soil surface the oxygen decays approximately linearly with the depth suggesting little consumption of oxygen by the microbes due to low methane concentration in the capillary fringe 30 45 cm deep below the soil surface there are sharp decreases of oxygen and methane soil gas concentrations as a result of significant methanotrophic activity with the presence of both high methane and oxygen concentration below the artificial groundwater table the spatial variation of methane concentration is insignificant as in the absence of oxygen fig 2 shows the comparison between the statistical analysis results of us epa s pvi database us epa 2013 and the one dimensional simulated soil gas profiles with open ground surface the solid lines are the probabilities for benzene soil vapor concentrations to be less than the threshold for different soil types coarse and fine grained and the dashed lines are simulated soil gas concentration profiles for sand and clay soil in the vertical direction away from the building foundation the comparison indicates that the numerical simulations are in a reasonably good agreement with the statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database both show that the decay in coarse grained cases is more significant initially while at 2 feet above the groundwater level the hydrocarbon soil gas concentration in fine grained soil cases are observed to be decreased more significantly than that in coarse grained soil cases the difference in the near source zone within 2 feet above the water table can be explained by the mass balance between the oxygen and hydrocarbon diffusion rate roggemans et al 2001 8 d o e f f c o m a x c o m i n Œ¥ Œº d h e f f c h m a x l t Œ¥ where d o e f f is the total effective diffusivity of oxygen across the aerobic zone d h e f f is the total effective diffusivity of vapor transport across the anaerobic zone c o m a x is the maximum oxygen concentration in aerobic zone c o m i n is the oxygen concentration in anoxic zone c h m a x is the maximum vapor concentration in anoxic zone Œ¥ is the vertical distance from open surface to the aerobic anoxic interface Œº is the stoichiometric conversion factor l t is the distance from the upper surface to the vapor source according to the van genuchten equation van genuchten 1980 the decline of moisture content in coarse grained soils is sharper than that in fine grained soils as shown in fig s3 in supporting information thus the ratio of d o e f f d h e f f in equation 8 would be higher in coarse grained soils based on the calculations of the millinton quirk equation millinton and quirk 1961 and it is more difficult for oxygen to reach the near source zone in fine grained soils as a result the vapor concentration in the coarse grained soils could be significantly decreased due to the natural attenuation caused by the aerobic biodegradation in the near source zone while hydrocarbon concentration could only be diluted through diffusion however when there is enough vertical separation distance 2 feet from the groundwater source to allow the presence of oxygen the aerobic biodegradation in fine grained soils is more significant than that in the coarse grained soils a possible explanation could be that the aerobic biodegradation is enhanced by the presence of higher moisture content in fine grained soils in a one dimensional analytical model developed by devaull 2007 the decay of hydrocarbon soil vapor concentration during the diffusion could be expressed as 9 c z c s exp Œ≥ Œ≤ exp Œ≥ z l Œ≤ exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ z l exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ where c z and c s are the soil vapor concentration of hydrocarbon at the height of z and source vapor concentration respectively l is the total transport length Œ≤ c z l 1 c s is the normalized soil vapor concentration at z l and Œ≥ is the square root of a damkohler number defined as 10 Œ≥ l r Œ∏ w d e f f h b by assuming Œ≤ 0 and exp Œ≥ exp Œ≥ equation 10 could be approximated as 11 c z c s exp Œ≥ z l equations 3 and 9 clearly show that the increase of moisture content would cause a decrease of d e f f and the increase of Œ≥ respectively as shown in figs s3 and s4 in supporting information thereby resulting in the decrease of exp Œ≥ z l thus with the presence of oxygen a more significant decay of hydrocarbon vapor concentration caused by biodegradation could be expected in coarse grained soils with higher moisture content devaull 2007 3 2 simulations with sources located at the groundwater level fig 3 shows the simulated soil gas concentration profiles of hydrocarbon and oxygen for three soil types for all soil types the predicted indoor air concentrations in cases with heterogeneous vertical moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect are significantly lower than those with uniform soil moisture content profile by around seven orders of magnitude the heterogeneous moisture content profile caused by the capillary fringe played several roles in the vapor transport and reaction processes first the high moisture content in the vicinity of groundwater table would decrease the hydrocarbon upward diffusion rate and flux millington and quirk 1961 van genuchten 1980 and thus the indoor air concentration secondly the increased moisture content could also enhance the reaction rate during the upward diffusion process it should be noted that such different attenuation can also be observed among different soil types no matter whether the soil moisture profile is determined by the capillary effect or uniform the source to indoor air concentration attenuation is the most significant for the clay case while the least for the sand case finally as illustrated above the capillary fringe effect also plays an important role in determining the aerobic anoxic interface the soil moisture retention curve determined by the capillary fringe effect is dependent on soil types the sharpest decline of moisture content is observed for the sand cases while for clay the curve is the smoothest as shown in fig s3 in the supplemental information thus the vertical variation of effective diffusivity is the most significant for sand which allows the oxygen to easily penetrate the soil deeper than other types of soil this can be explained by the mass balance between the oxygen and hydrocarbon diffusion rate roggemans 2001 as shown in fig 3 the shapes of the aerobic zone in uniform soil moisture cases are quite similar independent of soil types while there is a significant difference in cases where the moisture content is determined by the capillary fringe effect fig 4 shows the influences of source depth in determining hydrocarbon and oxygen soil gas concentration profiles and source to indoor air concentration attenuation factors for cases where sources are located at the groundwater level the simulations are performed for the sand and clay soil and the capillary fringe effect is included in simulating the vertical soil moisture profile by employing the van genuchten equation for the clay cases the predicted indoor air concentration decreases with the increase of the source building separation distance as a result of the increased biodegradation attenuation in the vadose zone consistent with previous studies abreu and johnson 2006 abreu et al 2009 for the sand cases however opposite results are observed the most significant attenuation from source to indoor air occurs in the scenario with the source depth of 3 m below ground surface while the highest indoor air concentration occurs in the case with the source depth of 8 m in other words the predicted indoor air concentration or vi risk increases with the vertical building source separation distance in the simulated cases as discussed in the previous section the vapor concentration attenuation in the diffusive transport coupled with aerobic degradation could be approximated by equation 11 which depends on both the transport length in the aerobic zone and the moisture content profile for the clay soil the water retention curve is relatively smooth in the vertical direction so is the dimensionless factor Œ≥ as shown in fig s4 in supporting information thus the vertical building source separation distance becomes the dominant factor in determining the attenuation approximated by equation 11 the longer the distance the more significant attenuation but for the sandy soil the water retention curve is quite sharp indicating that the water content near the groundwater level is significantly higher than that at locations away from the groundwater level for shallow groundwater sources the oxygen from the atmosphere at the open ground surface can closely approach the groundwater level where the moisture content and the dimensionless factor Œ≥ are relatively high thus the hydrocarbon vapor concentration could be attenuated within a very short transport distance as shown in the 3 m sand case in fig 5 for deeper groundwater sources the distance between the aerobic anoxic interface and the vapor source increases causing decreases in the moisture content and the dimensionless factor Œ≥ as a result the soil vapor concentration attenuation caused by biodegradation decreases with the vertical separation distance see fig s5 in supporting information and so is the predicted indoor air concentration nonetheless it should be noted such phenomenon in sand soil cases is caused by the inclusion of high moisture content in the aerobic zone and for cases with source depth higher than 8 m as the moisture content is relatively uniform and low in the aerobic zone it is expected to observe that the attenuation increases with the vertical source building separation distance fig 5 shows the predicted indoor air concentration as a function of vertical source building separation distances for cases with vapor sources located at groundwater table the results indicate that in cases where the vapor sources are located at the groundwater level it is highly unlikely to induce potential pvi risks with indoor air concentration higher than the target resident air concentration of benzene in us epa s regional screening levels us epa 2017b only in the clay case where the vertical source building separation distance is 1 m i e 3 m below the ground surface and the source vapor concentration is 400 mg l the simulated indoor air concentration is higher than the target level in other words this finding is in line with the us epa s conclusion that the vi risk from contaminant source in dissolved phase is negligible unless there is direct contact between contamination and a building foundation us epa 2013 and the recommendation that 6 feet vertical source building separation distance should be sufficient to screen out pvi risk for petroleum source in the dissolved phase us epa 2015a 3 3 simulations with the source located at 1 m above the groundwater level from the above discussion we conclude that the presence of capillary fringe could effectively reduce the risk of pvi from a steady groundwater source however the groundwater level may fluctuate over weeks or months and such temporal fluctuations typically create a vertical smear zone of residual lnapl contamination both above and below the average water table elevation us epa 2015a here we perform numerical simulations to investigate scenarios with a vapor source located 1 m above the groundwater level which represents a soil gas source fig 6 shows the normalized soil gas concentration profiles of hydrocarbon and oxygen for different soil types similar to the simulations discussed above the most significant attenuation is observed in the clay case while the highest indoor air concentration is identified in the sand case about 6 orders of magnitude higher than that in the clay case compared with the cases with a uniform moisture content and sources at the groundwater level shown in fig 3 the predicted indoor air concentration for the sand case with a soil gas source is about 5 orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding value in the case with a groundwater source in fact the former is more similar to that of the uniform soil moisture case but for the sandy loam and clay cases the differences between the predicted indoor air concentrations shown in fig 6 and those in the corresponding cases with groundwater sources shown in fig 3 are less significant with 5 and 3 orders of magnitude difference respectively these comparisons show that the fluctuation of groundwater level can potentially induce a temporal variation in pvi risk especially for the sand soil cases where there is the sharpest decline in moisture contents in the vertical direction for the fine grained soil such as clay the variation caused by the fluctuation of groundwater level is much less significant a sensitivity test was applied to the numerical model by calculating the responses of indoor air concentrations to given variations of groundwater table soil texture source depth and strength shown on the y axis in fig 7 the test results indicate that the factor with the greatest influence on the predicted indoor air contaminant concentration is the soil texture followed by source strength and depth while the numerical results are insensitive to the relative position of vapor source to groundwater table an increase decrease in the vertical separation distance between vapor source and groundwater table by 0 5 m would result in nearly half an order magnitude variation in indoor air contaminant concentration it is because the performance of soil gas is determined by the vertical profile of the moisture content and according to the van genuchten equation the most significant variation of moisture content occurs in a short distance above the groundwater table especially for the sandy soil as a result it does not make much difference between cases with a vapor source located at 1 m above the source and those with sources located at 0 5 m or 1 5 m above in other words the thickness of the smear zone is not important compared with the vertical separation distance between the building foundation and the top of the smear zone 4 conclusion in this study we use numerical simulations to investigate the risk of pvi in cases with heterogeneous vertical moisture content profiles determined by the capillary fringe effect first the model was validated with chamber experimental results and statistical analysis of the us epa s pvi database then the validated model was used to simulate two scenarios with sources located at or 1 m above the groundwater level respectively for the former scenario we find that the indoor air concentrations are significantly reduced as a result of decreased of upward diffusion rates of hydrocarbon enhanced aerobic biodegradation and expanded the aerobic zone in fact in almost all simulated cases with groundwater sources the predicted indoor air concentration would not exceed the screening level of indoor air concentration except for the clay case with 1 m building source separation distance and source vapor concentration of 400 mg l in other words the numerical simulations indicate that petroleum sources in dissolved phase defined as those with benzene concentration lower than 1 mg l would not cause unacceptable vapor intrusion risks unless the groundwater is in contact with the building foundation this finding supports the us epa s conclusion that the probability of exceeding risk based concentrations is low for dissolved contaminant sources and recommendation of 6 feet as vertical source building screening distance us epa 2013 2015a for lnapl sources however due to the fluctuation of groundwater level it is highly possible to induce an unacceptable risk when the vapor source emerges from the groundwater and approaches the building foundation when the position of groundwater table is low and below a portion of the smear zone causing a high volatilization rate our simulations with a source located 1 m above the groundwater level suggest that pvi risk can be significantly increased when the groundwater level drops especially for the sand case with a sharp decline of moisture content this warns investigators that additional attention should be given to seasonal fluctuations of groundwater table and its relative position to the smear zone in general our findings in agreement with other field measurements lahvis et al 2013 pasteris et al 2002 van stempvoort and kwong 2010 laboratory studies ma et al 2012 and other modeling work abreu and johnson 2006 reveal that the capillary fringe effect is sufficient to mitigate pvi from petroleum source in dissolved phase and the focus in site investigation should be more concentrated on the smear zone induced by the groundwater table fluctuation in cases involving the lnapl sources it should be noted that this study is limited by traditional vi pathway and in a scenario involving preferential vi pathway such as a land drain or sewer pipeline which could facilitate the migration of petroleum vapors guo et al 2015 mchugh et al 2017 also this study did not consider the possibility of methanogenesis in the absence of oxygen which could cause upward advection to increase the vi and explosion potential ma et

also facilitates the identification and elimination of functional microbial groups from decayed sludge in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity separated sludge functional identification aggregation apoptosis like decay microbial community 1 introduction activated sludge is among the most widely used methods to treat wastewater for more than 100 years in the conventional activated sludge process organic matter is biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide with the production of new biomass it has been known that activated sludge a mixed culture of various microbial species undergo the concurrent growth and decay during biological treatment of wastewater van loosdrecht and henze 1999 hao et al 2010a wang et al 2018 therefore a balance between microbial growth and decay is critical towards high efficiency treatment of industrial wastewater with a strong inhibitory nature it has been well known that many factors may trigger sludge decay under various conditions including maintenance energy requirements decay of cells endogenous respiration cryptic growth autolysis predation and so on van loosdrecht and henze 1999 hao et al 2010a for example sludge decay had been classified into cell death and activity decay for polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos accounting for 20 42 and 58 80 of the observed biomass decay respectively hao et al 2010b similar phenomena had also been reported for methanogens hao et al 2012 anammox bacteria wang et al 2018 these clearly indicate that activity decay may be considered as the main contributor of the observed sludge decay apoptosis of eukaryotic cells is known as a way of programmed cell death pcd which is considered as altruistic death for community survival tanouchi et al 2012 similar to eukaryotic cells some apoptosis like phenomena have also been reported for prokaryotic lives bayles 2013 carmona gutierrez et al 2012 dwyer et al 2012 erental et al 2012 the present evidences imply that apoptosis in eukaryotic cells both biochemically and physically was analogous to some prokaryotic cells and even might have been evolved from prokaryotic cells bayles 2013 rice and bayles 2008 wang and bayles 2013 thus it is reasonable to consider that apoptosis like decay ald of bacteria might also exist in bio sludges such as activated sludge granular sludge and biofilms so far little information is currently available for apoptosis like phenomenon in sludge and limited attention has been dedicated to use phospholipid on cell membrane to characterize sludge decay meanwhile different functional groups microbial communities may arise from a homogenous sludge due to microbial decay identification and separation of different functional sludge will improve efficiency of wastewater bio treatment it was found that larger granules were mainly consisted of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria while smaller granules were dominant by nitrite oxidizing bacteria in a cyclic anaerobic aerobic reactor suggesting preference of microbial functional groups over granules of various sizes pennisi 2012 winkler et al 2011a in addition paos and gaos dominated high and low settling velocity sludge respectively and elimination of the looser sludge gaos enhanced biological phosphate removal winkler et al 2011b similarly li and pagilla proposed a density based selector for sludge for enrichment of functional bacteria in sludge such as paos li and pagilla 2017 despite of these valuable studies functional differentiation of heterotrophic bacteria in decayed sludge has been rarely investigated and its biological and mechanical mechanisms are far from fully understood technically the excess sludge formed during wastewater treatment can be removed in a variety of ways gravity separation is the best proven and widely used method in separating components when applied to sludge separation it is influenced by many factors such as svi mean floc size density and extracellular polymers substance eps of sludge while eps of sludge was generally considered to play a crucial role on surface properties with influence on aggregation between cells in flocs liao et al 2001 2011 li et al 2014 basuvaraj et al 2015 qiu et al 2016 additionally the influence of inner force among cell surfaces could be calculated by xdlvo extended derjguin landau verwey and overbeek model to describe interactions between macromolecules or particles in collochemistry the xdlvo theory stated that total interaction potential energy between particles is a function of separation distance and consists of energies associated with van der waals electrostatic and acid base interactions it has been shown that the extended theory achieves great success in explaining bio aggregation process especially for sludge liu et al 2010 ali et al 2018 this study aims to demonstrate that the un even distributions of svi floc size eps contents microbial activity aldcd and microbial community in gravity separated sludge treating coking wastewater to our best knowledge this is the first study that reports apoptosis like decay in sludge and uses this to quantify the extent of cell decay it s hypothesized that sludge decay may be associated with sludge settling velocity in practice selective discharge of decayed sludge would expect to improve the performance of biological process 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental process activated sludge used in this study was collected from an aerobic tank in a full scale coking

suspended in 30 ml pbs the cell suspension was filtered using a 200 mesh nylon net to remove cell aggregates before fcm to detect cell count and physiology an annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit sangon biotech china containing propidium iodide pi and annexin v fitc was used for cell staining pi is impermeable to normal cells and only combined with dna in dead cells while annexin v fitc can combined with phosphatidylserine which exposed on the surface of cell from inner leaflet of membrane when cell is undergoing apoptosis then phosphatidylserine becomes and susceptible to staining by annexin v fitc this two dyes conjugate could emit red and green fluorescence excited by 488 nm wavelength and could be detected by fluorescence detector of flow cytometer vermes et al 1995 2 2 7 microbial community analysis samples were collected from each fraction of the gravity separated sludge in triplicates for microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the sludge samples were first freeze dried in a lyophilizer lgj 10 beijing songyuanhuaxing technologies china the dna extraction was carried out from the freeze dried sludge samples using a mobio powersoil dna isolation kit qbiogene inc usa concentrations of dna were measured using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies usa bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with primer set 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 for the v4v5 region more details about the pcr reaction establishment of dna library can be found in our previous study pan et al 2018 the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the accession code srp149102 the low quality sequences and chimeras was removed using mothur v1 35 1 the generation and identification of operational taxonomic unit otu were performed with qiime otus were generated using the cd hit clustering method with a threshold of 0 97 the taxonomic assignment was performed with the rdp classifier at the same time phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust v1 0 0 6 langille et al 2013 analysis was conducted to determine the predicted metabolic functions of the microbial communities in different gravity separated sludge 2 3 statistical analysis all the assays were conducted at least in triplicate meanwhile all the results were expressed as mean standard deviation analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results by the software spss 20 for windows and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 comprehensive sludge properties all the sludge samples were in the forms of pin flocs and no visible granular sludge was observed the fractions of sludge s m and f were 2 7 17 9 and 79 4 in the separated sludges the properties of different sludges before and after separation were listed in table 1 the sludges were found to be largely different in svi mlss and mlvss but all had good settleability sludge f had the lowest svi with the mlss of 29 9 higher than sludge s indicating a compact structure of sludge f sludge f also showed higher viscous than sludge m and s the ratios of vss to tss were comparable for the three kinds of sludges at the level of around 85 8 the mean floc size of sludge f was the largest followed by sludge m and sludge s was the lowest these results demonstrated that the sludge with different settling velocity had been separated by previous settling column fig s1 it seems that sludge f have a more compact structure than sludge s and m while sludge s was more dispersive than sludge f and m 3 2 activity of gravity separated sludges fig 1 showed the dehydrogenase activity and sour of the three kinds of sludges the dehydrogenase activities of sludge s m and f fell into the range of 21 21 2 50 mg tf g vs h to 28 86 1 59 mg tf g vs h with the maximum difference of 36 similar phenomena were also observed for sour fig 1b since activated sludge with high activity but less volume is highly desirable in biological wastewater treatment systems the evaluation of activity was also calculated by activity svi for exploring the activity in unit sludge volume the same trends of activity svi in three fractions of sludge were also observed these results suggest that sludge f possessed the highest microbial activity in terms of dehydrogenase activity and sour activated sludge with high activity settleability and compressibility is highly desirable in biological wastewater treatment systems moreover strong positive correlations were observed between the activity and the floc size fig 2 however it had been reported that sludge with smaller floc size had higher activity andreadakis 1993 although the mechanism of the size dependent microbial activity remains unclear 3 3 aggregation of gravity separated sludge 3 3 1 eps content fig 3 a shows eps in different separated sludges in terms of protein pn and polysaccharide ps total eps content of this industrial wastewater sludge was generally lower than that in activated sludge treating municipal wastewater basuvaraj et al 2015 li et al 2014 qiu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in loosely bound eps lb eps pn was more abundant than ps with the respective contents of 2 68 3 02 mg g vss and 1 93 2 80 mg g vss the content of tightly bound eps tb eps was significantly lower than that in lb eps it was speculated that low eps content resulted in the floc morphology of the sludge the low eps content also benefits a high oxygen transfer rate fan et al 2017 meanwhile component of pn and ps of eps often played more important role in many investigation of sludge settleability li et al 2014 li and yang 2007 liao et al 2001 yang and li 2009 interestingly lb ps of sludge s was found to be 40 7 and 45 1 higher than ps in sludge m and sludge f fig 3b additionally the pn ps of both lb eps and total eps showed opposite trends in sludge s and f fig 3c it s has been shown that loose sludge had low ratio of pn ps and high lb ps content it was found that ps and uronic acids always play a role in gel net capturing to facilitate cells attachment in anammox aggregation jia et al 2017 liao et al 2006 found that floc size had no obvious relationship with srt or organic substance loading but was negatively related to the total eps content in this study sludge s with the lower pn ps ratio had a looser structure compared to sludge f those observations are consistent with those reported by basuvaraj et al 2015 i e poorly settling sludge svi 199 0 ml g had lower of total pn ps ratio while high pn ps ratio in good settling sludge svi 81 0 ml g the low pn ps ratio in loose floc may be attributed to high ps as ps had abundant oh groups which facilitated the formation of hydrogen bond with water molecule while pn were macro biomolecules with long chain of hydrophobic amino acids which tended to aggregate resulted from the hydrophobic force low pn ps generally meant high water content in sludge and cells would likely to detach from each other these results explained the variation of svi of three sludge fractions 3 3 2 sludge interaction energies calculated by xdlvo theory to estimate the interaction energies between sludge cells especially the main force contributing to flocs aggregation the energy potentials of different sludge were calculated with the xdlvo model liu et al 2010 contact angles of sludge with liquids showed different hydrophobicity of sludge table s1 w tot indicated total energy potential of sludge and each potential curve had an energy barrier eb and potential well of a secondary minimum value smv in fact a higher eb implied a more stable sludge suspension and a lower potential well of smv suggested a strong aggregation of floc li et al 2014 liu et al 2004 2010 it was found in fig 4 that three fractions of separated sludges exhibited significant differences in energy barrier which was in the sequence of ebs ebm ebf these indicated that sludge s was more stable than the others the similar trends were observed for smv according to these results it is reasonable to consider that sludge s with smaller aggregation force would have a looser floc structure while a more compact floc structure for sludge f these results corresponded to the mean floc size of three fractions of sludge 3 4 aldcd in gravity separated sludge the aldcd of microbial cells by fcm of different sludge fractions were showed in fig 5 negative and positive control for normal cells apoptosis like decayed and dead cells were presented in 2d fluorescence cytograms fig s2 in fl1 fl2 cytogram it was divided into four parts of whole coordinate f1 f2 f3 f4 points in f3 represented normal cells which were not stained by any dyes points in f4 represented apoptotic cells with externalization of phosphatidylserine on cell membrane which were stained by annexin v fitc points in f2 represented late apoptotic cells which could be stained by both annexin v fitc and pi points in f1 represented dead cells which were stained by pi the results revealed that there was significant variation of aldcd among different sludge fractions fig 5 it was found that sludge s had more apoptosis like decayed cells and dead cells while in sludge f had less aldcd of sludge f were 6 64 and 13 5 lower than sludge m and s respectively however no clear trend was observed for dead cells the apoptosis characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization had been investigated in eukaryocyte but not in bacteria in eukaryocyte the cell membrane maintained a balance of phosphatidylserine in inner leaflet by phospholipid transferase and scramblase the phospholipid transferase which could be inhibited by ca2 transfers phosphatidylserine from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet and the scramblase which could be activated by ca2 transfer phosphatidylserine from inner leaflet to the outer leaflet when cell apoptosis starts the intracellular ca2 increases which activates the scramblase to transfer phosphatidylserine to outer leaflet but inactivates phospholipid transferase from transferring phosphatidylserine to inner leaflet fadok et al 1998 the externalization of phosphatidylserine of cell membrane indicated stability of the cell membrane get deteriorated previous studies found that pcd might lead to microbiological endogenous process in activated sludge hao et al 2010a and apoptosis like decay had been considered as an important kind of pcd in eukaryote in this work the aldcd of three fractions of gravity separated sludge showed remarkable difference a positive correlation of aldcd and sludge activity was observed among different sludge fractions fig s3 thus it appears that aldcd can be considered as a new parameter for determination of sludge decay 3 5 microbial community variation of gravity separated sludge the Œ± diversity of three different sludge fractions was characterized by shannon indexes h chao1 and simpson indexes for each community table s2 the diversity and richness of these sludge were lower than municipal sludge bray curtis distance and weighted unifrac distance were calculated to compare Œ≤ diversity among different sludges heatmap of diversity distances and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa of three different sludge fractions implied that Œ≤ diversity of three fractions of sludge had far distances from each other with the Œ≤ diversity of sludge m fell between sludge f and sludge s fig 6 which correspond to relationship of svi and floc size among three fractions of sludge analysis of difference among sample groups was tested by statistical methods based on distance matrix analysis of similarities anosim and adonis analysis indicated significant differences among three gravity separated sludge fractions anosim p 0 004 r 1 adonis p 0 006 r2 0 884 these results again suggested that the microbial community of sludge f sludge m and sludge s were significantly different from each other which were in accordance with the results of the sludge characteristics the community structures of these sludge fractions were characterized at phylum and genus levels fig s4 fig 7 significant difference was observed in community compositions among sludge f m and s at the genus level fig s5 the relative abundance of three functional bacteria genus were found to decrease from sludge f to sludge s including thiobacillus 6 05 10 75 known for its sulfur metabolism and denitrifying ability which are considered to be related to the high scn in coking wastewater treatment system cwts comamonas 4 47 5 85 related to high phenol and polycyclic aromatics and ammonia in cwts and ignavibacteriaceae 7 94 11 36 which had also been reported in cwts these three genera were commonly reported as domain functional bacteria in cwts ma et al 2015 pan et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 however some other functional bacteria seemed prefer to be present in sludge m thauera 2 16 5 61 a bacteria genus known for its denitrification ability ma et al 2015 appeared to have relative higher abundance in sludge m than f and s revealing that sludge m might have the highest denitrification ability than others in general most of the dominant functional bacteria related to treating coking wastewater had high abundance in sludge f moderate relative abundance in sludge m and low relative abundance in sludge s this distribution contributed to higher ability of pollutants removal in sludge f or m than in sludge s interestingly abundance of some other microbes were found to show an increasing trend from sludge f to sludge s these microbes included chitinophagaceae 7 65 14 20 a genus had been found in rhizosphere soil roots vermicompost and other oligotrophic environment proen√ßa et al 2014 chloracidobacteria 3 38 7 61 a member of photoheterotrophic bacteria which had been discovered in poor nutritional environment bryant et al 2007 and weeksellaceae 2 25 5 90 an aerobic chemoorganotrophic pathogenic genus mostly had been isolated from humankind holmes et al 2015 these results might indicate that sludge with large size tended to adapt to high organic substance environment of cwts and sludge with small size tended to be unaccommodated to environment of cwts and turned to adapt to oligotrophic environment overall these interesting results could be related to sludge decay process the sludge s was highly suspected to be decayed from sludge f or sludge m which corresponding to our previous analysis of section 3 4 3 6 predicted functional otus of gravity separated sludge a kegg prediction of functional otus was completed by comparing with green gene database with picrust 286 predicted functions were obtained for each separated sludge the top thirty variation of environmental functions were presented in fig 8 it was found that the relative abundances of carbohydrate digestion and absorption cytochrome p450 and basal transcription factors were 31 6 and 70 8 23 5 and 37 3 43 5 and 61 3 higher in sludge f than those in m and s moreover the relative abundance of citrate cycle energy metabolism pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were 2 2 and 3 2 1 0 and 3 3 0 6 and 2 0 2 4 and 3 0 higher in sludge f than those in sludge m and s these functional otus were highly related to the biodegradation of organic substrates whereas the relative abundance of ion channel abc transporters and transporters in sludge f were 16 5 and 25 7 2 4 and 4 4 2 2 and 5 0 lower than in sludge m and s theses functional otus relay more on the transportation and exchange of macromolecular or ions on cell membrane the otus of nitrogen metabolism showed the highest relative abundances in sludge m and the lowest in sludge s indicating that sludge m had the highest nitrogen metabolism potential which is in agreement with previous discussion in section 3 5 these functional otus further implied that sludge f had the highest organic substance removal potential and sludge m had the highest nitrogen metabolism potential sludge s showed the lowest organic substance removal and nitrogen metabolism potentail revealing that the slow settling sludge had deteriorative activity among three gravity separated sludge fractions according to abovementioned results sludges with different floc size and density were found to be distributed in mixed liquid indicating that several fractions of sludge with different velocities could be separated by gravity these results implied correlations between the sludge properties e g svi mean floc size microbial activity and aldcd and fractions of sludge there is a potential to separate decayed sludge in mixed liquid preferentially based on these correlations which could provide some judgments for building operation standard of selective discharge of sludge 4 conclusions this work demonstrated the distribution of microbial functions and decay in gravity separated sludges for the treatment of high strength coking wastewater aldcd together with the other parameters e g svi eps content xdlvo calculation and microbial community could effectively describe sludge decay in different fractions of sludges the following conclusions were drawn in this study sludge s showed the worst aggregation and sludge f showed the best the highest svi and lb ps content of sludge s suggested a high water content in sludge s leading to its dispersive structure as compared to sludge f the smaller mean floc size of sludge s was related to higher eb and smv of interaction potential energy calculated by xdlvo theory aldcd can be considered as a useful indicator for the quantification of sludge decay sludge s showed the highest aldcd of 19 52 while the lowest aldcd was observed for sludge f 16 88 the apoptosis like decay in sludges was confirmed by the dehydrogenase activity sour and microbial community analysis it seemed that the distribution of decayed sludge was associated with sludge settelabiity and the floc structure the lowest presence of predicted functional otus relating to organic oxidation and nitrogen transformation was found in sludge s suggesting its lower activity in cod and nitrogen removal consequently this work may lead to the development of a novel operation strategy for enhancing the performance of biological wastewater treatment processes and optimizing the sludge management declaration of interests none acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge financial support

activity specific oxygen uptake rate sour extracellular polymeric substances eps content and aggregation interaction were investigated in the fractionated sludges apoptosis like decayed cell distribution aldcd a novel property of sludge was proposed to describe sludge decay based on cell membrane variation aldcd of sludge f was 6 64 and 13 5 lower than sludge m and s respectively microbial community and functional prediction revealed that sludge f exhibited the highest microbial potential for organic removal and sludge m had the highest potential for nitrogen metabolism while sludge s had the lowest potential for both our analysis suggests that the treatment efficiency might be enhanced by retaining compact sludge flocs while eliminating dispersive sludge flocs this study also facilitates the identification and elimination of functional microbial groups from decayed sludge in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity separated sludge functional identification aggregation apoptosis like decay microbial community 1 introduction activated sludge is among the most widely used methods to treat wastewater for more than 100 years in the conventional activated sludge process organic matter is biologically oxidized to carbon dioxide with the production of new biomass it has been known that activated sludge a mixed culture of various microbial species undergo the concurrent growth and decay during biological treatment of wastewater van loosdrecht and henze 1999 hao et al 2010a wang et al 2018 therefore a balance between microbial growth and decay is critical towards high efficiency treatment of industrial wastewater with a strong inhibitory nature it has been well known that many factors may trigger sludge decay under various conditions including maintenance energy requirements decay of cells endogenous respiration cryptic growth autolysis predation and so on van loosdrecht and henze 1999 hao et al 2010a for example sludge decay had been classified into cell death and activity decay for polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos and glycogen accumulating organisms gaos accounting for 20 42 and 58 80 of the observed biomass decay respectively hao et al 2010b similar phenomena had also been reported for methanogens hao et al 2012 anammox bacteria wang et al 2018 these clearly indicate that activity decay may be considered as the main contributor of the observed sludge decay apoptosis of eukaryotic cells is known as a way of programmed cell death pcd which is considered as altruistic death for community survival tanouchi et al 2012 similar to eukaryotic cells some apoptosis like phenomena have also been reported for prokaryotic lives bayles 2013 carmona gutierrez et al 2012 dwyer et al 2012 erental et al 2012 the present evidences imply that apoptosis in eukaryotic cells both biochemically and physically was analogous to some prokaryotic cells and even might have been evolved from prokaryotic cells bayles 2013 rice and bayles 2008 wang and bayles 2013 thus it is reasonable to consider that apoptosis like decay ald of bacteria might also exist in bio sludges such as activated sludge granular sludge and biofilms so far little information is currently available for apoptosis like phenomenon in sludge and limited attention has been dedicated to use phospholipid on cell membrane to characterize sludge decay meanwhile different functional groups microbial communities may arise from a homogenous sludge due to microbial decay identification and separation of different functional sludge will improve efficiency of wastewater bio treatment it was found that larger granules were mainly consisted of anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox bacteria while smaller granules were dominant by nitrite oxidizing bacteria in a cyclic anaerobic aerobic reactor suggesting preference of microbial functional groups over granules of various sizes pennisi 2012 winkler et al 2011a in addition paos and gaos dominated high and low settling velocity sludge respectively and elimination of the looser sludge gaos enhanced biological phosphate removal winkler et al 2011b similarly li and pagilla proposed a density based selector for sludge for enrichment of functional bacteria in sludge such as paos li and pagilla 2017 despite of these valuable studies functional differentiation of heterotrophic bacteria in decayed sludge has been rarely investigated and its biological and mechanical mechanisms are far from fully understood technically the excess sludge formed during wastewater treatment can be removed in a variety of ways gravity separation is the best proven and widely used method in separating components when applied to sludge separation it is influenced by many factors such as svi mean floc size density and extracellular polymers substance eps of sludge while eps of sludge was generally considered to play a crucial role on surface properties with influence on aggregation between cells in flocs liao et al 2001 2011 li et al 2014 basuvaraj et al 2015 qiu et al 2016 additionally the influence of inner force among cell surfaces could be calculated by xdlvo extended derjguin landau verwey and overbeek model to describe interactions between macromolecules or particles in collochemistry the xdlvo theory stated that total interaction potential energy between particles is a function of separation distance and consists of energies associated with van der waals electrostatic and acid base interactions it has been shown that the extended theory achieves great success in explaining bio aggregation process especially for sludge liu et al 2010 ali et al 2018 this study aims to demonstrate that the un even distributions of svi floc size eps contents microbial activity aldcd and microbial community in gravity separated sludge treating coking wastewater to our best knowledge this is the first study that reports apoptosis like decay in sludge and uses this to quantify the extent of cell decay it s hypothesized that sludge decay may be associated with sludge settling velocity in practice selective discharge of decayed sludge would expect to improve the performance of biological process 2 methods and materials 2 1 experimental process activated sludge used in this study was collected from an aerobic tank in a full scale coking wastewater treatment plant songshan iron and steel corporation shaoguan guangdong province of china the influent cod and the organic loading rate of the aerobic tank were controlled at 3500 4000 mg l and 2 2 kg cod m3 d respectively the collected sludge was separated into three fractions according to their different settling velocities supplementary material fig s1 the sludges with different settling velocities v were sampled after 6 min settling the sludge with v 5 m h was sampled as sludge s the sludge with v 10 m h was sampled as sludge m and the sludge with v 10 m h few fraction of sludge with v 10 m h was sampled as sludge f the separated sludge samples were brought back to lab within 6 h after removing the supernatant the mlss mlvss of the settled sludge was determined according to standard methods apha 2006 afterwards all the sludge samples were stored at 4 c for subsequent experiments conducted within 7 days at room temperature 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 svi and floc size measurement 50 ml of separated sludge was used to measure sv30 tss and vss the svi was calculated as follows 1 svi s v 30 m l s s for the measurement of floc size the sludge sample was diluted with distilled water to a mlss concentration of 200 mg l which was further used for size determination by a laser particle analyzer eyetech ankersmid netherlands 2 2 2 dehydrogenase activity dehydrogenase activity was determined by 2 3 5 triphenyltetrazolium chloride ttc method the reaction solution contained 2 ml sludge liquor 1 ml ttc solution 1 w w 0 5 ml na2so3 0 5 w w and 0 5 ml double distilled water h2o the reaction was performed in water bath for 2 h at 37 c after reaction was completed 5 ml of methylbenzene was added and shook violently to dissolve the reaction product triphenyl formazan tf finally the reaction solution was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 3 min and the methylbenzene was sampled to measure absorbance at 560 nm dehydrogenase activity was defined as tf production mg catalyzed by dehydrogenase in 1 g volatile solid vs in 1 h 2 dehydrogenase activity Œ¥ t f m l v s s Œ¥ t 2 2 3 specific oxygen uptake rates measurement sour a conventional respirometer device was consisted of dissolved oxygen do probe water bath with magnetic stirring and brown sealed bottle oxygen uptake rates measurement our was determined by measuring the decreasing rate of do in the bottle as according to surmacz et al 1996 20 ml of sludge sample was displaced in the bottle previously then 80 ml 50 diluted wastewater were used as matrix magnetic stirrer was used to supply oxygen to make sure the mixed liquor was saturated with oxygen the sour was calculated by equation 3 3 sour Œ¥ d o m l v s s Œ¥ t mlvss the concentration of mixed liquor volatile suspended solid in sealed bottle 2 2 4 extracellular polymeric substance eps zeta potential and contact angle the extraction of bound eps was performed using the heating extraction method li et al 2014 the eps was normalized as the sum of polysaccharide and protein which were measured by the colorimetrical methods basuvaraj et al 2015 zeta potential was measured by an electrokinetic analyzer surpass anton parr gmbh co ltd austria contact angles of sludge flocs to three different liquids water 1 bromonaphthalene and formamide were measured by standard sessile drop approach on a drop shape analyzer dsa25 kr√ºss devices germany treatments of sludge flocs before measurement were performed as described by liu et al 2010 2 2 5 interaction in floc sludge calculated by xdlvo theory in the xdlvo theory the interaction of particles is reflected by potential energy total potential energies w tot is calculated as a sum of repulsion potential energy of electric double layer w r potential energy of van der waals w a and the acid base interaction w ab the total interaction energy is expressed as a function of the separation distance h the calculation of three parts of energy in xdlvo theory is based on the surface thermodynamic calculation approach liu et al 2010 detailed process of calculation and equations are presented in supplementary material 2 2 6 microbial aldcd analysis the phosphatidylserine on outer leaflet membrane is a unique feature of apoptosis and can be labelled by a fluorescent probe dye annexin v fitc aldcd was proposed to measure the proportion of cells with phosphatidylserine on membrane outer leaflet therefore it appears very promising to observe and quantify the extent of sludge decay using fluorescence microbial or flow cytometer the microbial aldcd of different sludges were determined by bacterial cell fluorescent staining and flow cytometry fcm on a flow cytometer epics xl mcl beckman coulter usa to make cell dispersion of sludge for fcm analysis 30 ml of sludge mixed liquor mlss 500 mg l was separated by a homogenizer fj200 sh biaomo shanghai china at 12000 rpm for 10 min followed by ultrasonic dispersion for 60 s at 40 w edta 500 mg l was used to remove divalent cations which combined cells with each other then the liquor was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min tg 16 yingtai china the pellet was digested using lysozyme 0 05 w w for 15 min at 37 c in waterbath to break cell wall followed by a further centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min the precipitates were washed with phosphate buffered saline pbs ph 7 6 0 01 m twice and suspended in 30 ml pbs the cell suspension was filtered using a 200 mesh nylon net to remove cell aggregates before fcm to detect cell count and physiology an annexin v fitc apoptosis detection kit sangon biotech china containing propidium iodide pi and annexin v fitc was used for cell staining pi is impermeable to normal cells and only combined with dna in dead cells while annexin v fitc can combined with phosphatidylserine which exposed on the surface of cell from inner leaflet of membrane when cell is undergoing apoptosis then phosphatidylserine becomes and susceptible to staining by annexin v fitc this two dyes conjugate could emit red and green fluorescence excited by 488 nm wavelength and could be detected by fluorescence detector of flow cytometer vermes et al 1995 2 2 7 microbial community analysis samples were collected from each fraction of the gravity separated sludge in triplicates for microbial community analysis using 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing the sludge samples were first freeze dried in a lyophilizer lgj 10 beijing songyuanhuaxing technologies china the dna extraction was carried out from the freeze dried sludge samples using a mobio powersoil dna isolation kit qbiogene inc usa concentrations of dna were measured using a nanodrop 2000 spectrophotometer nanodrop technologies usa bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr with primer set 515f 5 gtgccagcmgccgcggtaa 3 and 806r 5 ggactacvsgggtatctaat 3 for the v4v5 region more details about the pcr reaction establishment of dna library can be found in our previous study pan et al 2018 the sequencing data have been deposited in the ncbi sequence read archive sra database under the accession code srp149102 the low quality sequences and chimeras was removed using mothur v1 35 1 the generation and identification of operational taxonomic unit otu were performed with qiime otus were generated using the cd hit clustering method with a threshold of 0 97 the taxonomic assignment was performed with the rdp classifier at the same time phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states picrust v1 0 0 6 langille et al 2013 analysis was conducted to determine the predicted metabolic functions of the microbial communities in different gravity separated sludge 2 3 statistical analysis all the assays were conducted at least in triplicate meanwhile all the results were expressed as mean standard deviation analysis of variance anova was used to test the significance of results by the software spss 20 for windows and p 0 05 was considered statistically significant 3 results and discussion 3 1 comprehensive sludge properties all the sludge samples were in the forms of pin flocs and no visible granular sludge was observed the fractions of sludge s m and f were 2 7 17 9 and 79 4 in the separated sludges the properties of different sludges before and after separation were listed in table 1 the sludges were found to be largely different in svi mlss and mlvss but all had good settleability sludge f had the lowest svi with the mlss of 29 9 higher than sludge s indicating a compact structure of sludge f sludge f also showed higher viscous than sludge m and s the ratios of vss to tss were comparable for the three kinds of sludges at the level of around 85 8 the mean floc size of sludge f was the largest followed by sludge m and sludge s was the lowest these results demonstrated that the sludge with different settling velocity had been separated by previous settling column fig s1 it seems that sludge f have a more compact structure than sludge s and m while sludge s was more dispersive than sludge f and m 3 2 activity of gravity separated sludges fig 1 showed the dehydrogenase activity and sour of the three kinds of sludges the dehydrogenase activities of sludge s m and f fell into the range of 21 21 2 50 mg tf g vs h to 28 86 1 59 mg tf g vs h with the maximum difference of 36 similar phenomena were also observed for sour fig 1b since activated sludge with high activity but less volume is highly desirable in biological wastewater treatment systems the evaluation of activity was also calculated by activity svi for exploring the activity in unit sludge volume the same trends of activity svi in three fractions of sludge were also observed these results suggest that sludge f possessed the highest microbial activity in terms of dehydrogenase activity and sour activated sludge with high activity settleability and compressibility is highly desirable in biological wastewater treatment systems moreover strong positive correlations were observed between the activity and the floc size fig 2 however it had been reported that sludge with smaller floc size had higher activity andreadakis 1993 although the mechanism of the size dependent microbial activity remains unclear 3 3 aggregation of gravity separated sludge 3 3 1 eps content fig 3 a shows eps in different separated sludges in terms of protein pn and polysaccharide ps total eps content of this industrial wastewater sludge was generally lower than that in activated sludge treating municipal wastewater basuvaraj et al 2015 li et al 2014 qiu et al 2016 zhao et al 2017 in loosely bound eps lb eps pn was more abundant than ps with the respective contents of 2 68 3 02 mg g vss and 1 93 2 80 mg g vss the content of tightly bound eps tb eps was significantly lower than that in lb eps it was speculated that low eps content resulted in the floc morphology of the sludge the low eps content also benefits a high oxygen transfer rate fan et al 2017 meanwhile component of pn and ps of eps often played more important role in many investigation of sludge settleability li et al 2014 li and yang 2007 liao et al 2001 yang and li 2009 interestingly lb ps of sludge s was found to be 40 7 and 45 1 higher than ps in sludge m and sludge f fig 3b additionally the pn ps of both lb eps and total eps showed opposite trends in sludge s and f fig 3c it s has been shown that loose sludge had low ratio of pn ps and high lb ps content it was found that ps and uronic acids always play a role in gel net capturing to facilitate cells attachment in anammox aggregation jia et al 2017 liao et al 2006 found that floc size had no obvious relationship with srt or organic substance loading but was negatively related to the total eps content in this study sludge s with the lower pn ps ratio had a looser structure compared to sludge f those observations are consistent with those reported by basuvaraj et al 2015 i e poorly settling sludge svi 199 0 ml g had lower of total pn ps ratio while high pn ps ratio in good settling sludge svi 81 0 ml g the low pn ps ratio in loose floc may be attributed to high ps as ps had abundant oh groups which facilitated the formation of hydrogen bond with water molecule while pn were macro biomolecules with long chain of hydrophobic amino acids which tended to aggregate resulted from the hydrophobic force low pn ps generally meant high water content in sludge and cells would likely to detach from each other these results explained the variation of svi of three sludge fractions 3 3 2 sludge interaction energies calculated by xdlvo theory to estimate the interaction energies between sludge cells especially the main force contributing to flocs aggregation the energy potentials of different sludge were calculated with the xdlvo model liu et al 2010 contact angles of sludge with liquids showed different hydrophobicity of sludge table s1 w tot indicated total energy potential of sludge and each potential curve had an energy barrier eb and potential well of a secondary minimum value smv in fact a higher eb implied a more stable sludge suspension and a lower potential well of smv suggested a strong aggregation of floc li et al 2014 liu et al 2004 2010 it was found in fig 4 that three fractions of separated sludges exhibited significant differences in energy barrier which was in the sequence of ebs ebm ebf these indicated that sludge s was more stable than the others the similar trends were observed for smv according to these results it is reasonable to consider that sludge s with smaller aggregation force would have a looser floc structure while a more compact floc structure for sludge f these results corresponded to the mean floc size of three fractions of sludge 3 4 aldcd in gravity separated sludge the aldcd of microbial cells by fcm of different sludge fractions were showed in fig 5 negative and positive control for normal cells apoptosis like decayed and dead cells were presented in 2d fluorescence cytograms fig s2 in fl1 fl2 cytogram it was divided into four parts of whole coordinate f1 f2 f3 f4 points in f3 represented normal cells which were not stained by any dyes points in f4 represented apoptotic cells with externalization of phosphatidylserine on cell membrane which were stained by annexin v fitc points in f2 represented late apoptotic cells which could be stained by both annexin v fitc and pi points in f1 represented dead cells which were stained by pi the results revealed that there was significant variation of aldcd among different sludge fractions fig 5 it was found that sludge s had more apoptosis like decayed cells and dead cells while in sludge f had less aldcd of sludge f were 6 64 and 13 5 lower than sludge m and s respectively however no clear trend was observed for dead cells the apoptosis characterized by phosphatidylserine externalization had been investigated in eukaryocyte but not in bacteria in eukaryocyte the cell membrane maintained a balance of phosphatidylserine in inner leaflet by phospholipid transferase and scramblase the phospholipid transferase which could be inhibited by ca2 transfers phosphatidylserine from the outer leaflet to the inner leaflet and the scramblase which could be activated by ca2 transfer phosphatidylserine from inner leaflet to the outer leaflet when cell apoptosis starts the intracellular ca2 increases which activates the scramblase to transfer phosphatidylserine to outer leaflet but inactivates phospholipid transferase from transferring phosphatidylserine to inner leaflet fadok et al 1998 the externalization of phosphatidylserine of cell membrane indicated stability of the cell membrane get deteriorated previous studies found that pcd might lead to microbiological endogenous process in activated sludge hao et al 2010a and apoptosis like decay had been considered as an important kind of pcd in eukaryote in this work the aldcd of three fractions of gravity separated sludge showed remarkable difference a positive correlation of aldcd and sludge activity was observed among different sludge fractions fig s3 thus it appears that aldcd can be considered as a new parameter for determination of sludge decay 3 5 microbial community variation of gravity separated sludge the Œ± diversity of three different sludge fractions was characterized by shannon indexes h chao1 and simpson indexes for each community table s2 the diversity and richness of these sludge were lower than municipal sludge bray curtis distance and weighted unifrac distance were calculated to compare Œ≤ diversity among different sludges heatmap of diversity distances and principal co ordinates analysis pcoa of three different sludge fractions implied that Œ≤ diversity of three fractions of sludge had far distances from each other with the Œ≤ diversity of sludge m fell between sludge f and sludge s fig 6 which correspond to relationship of svi and floc size among three fractions of sludge analysis of difference among sample groups was tested by statistical methods based on distance matrix analysis of similarities anosim and adonis analysis indicated significant differences among three gravity separated sludge fractions anosim p 0 004 r 1 adonis p 0 006 r2 0 884 these results again suggested that the microbial community of sludge f sludge m and sludge s were significantly different from each other which were in accordance with the results of the sludge characteristics the community structures of these sludge fractions were characterized at phylum and genus levels fig s4 fig 7 significant difference was observed in community compositions among sludge f m and s at the genus level fig s5 the relative abundance of three functional bacteria genus were found to decrease from sludge f to sludge s including thiobacillus 6 05 10 75 known for its sulfur metabolism and denitrifying ability which are considered to be related to the high scn in coking wastewater treatment system cwts comamonas 4 47 5 85 related to high phenol and polycyclic aromatics and ammonia in cwts and ignavibacteriaceae 7 94 11 36 which had also been reported in cwts these three genera were commonly reported as domain functional bacteria in cwts ma et al 2015 pan et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 however some other functional bacteria seemed prefer to be present in sludge m thauera 2 16 5 61 a bacteria genus known for its denitrification ability ma et al 2015 appeared to have relative higher abundance in sludge m than f and s revealing that sludge m might have the highest denitrification ability than others in general most of the dominant functional bacteria related to treating coking wastewater had high abundance in sludge f moderate relative abundance in sludge m and low relative abundance in sludge s this distribution contributed to higher ability of pollutants removal in sludge f or m than in sludge s interestingly abundance of some other microbes were found to show an increasing trend from sludge f to sludge s these microbes included chitinophagaceae 7 65 14 20 a genus had been found in rhizosphere soil roots vermicompost and other oligotrophic environment proen√ßa et al 2014 chloracidobacteria 3 38 7 61 a member of photoheterotrophic bacteria which had been discovered in poor nutritional environment bryant et al 2007 and weeksellaceae 2 25 5 90 an aerobic chemoorganotrophic pathogenic genus mostly had been isolated from humankind holmes et al 2015 these results might indicate that sludge with large size tended to adapt to high organic substance environment of cwts and sludge with small size tended to be unaccommodated to environment of cwts and turned to adapt to oligotrophic environment overall these interesting results could be related to sludge decay process the sludge s was highly suspected to be decayed from sludge f or sludge m which corresponding to our previous analysis of section 3 4 3 6 predicted functional otus of gravity separated sludge a kegg prediction of functional otus was completed by comparing with green gene database with picrust 286 predicted functions were obtained for each separated sludge the top thirty variation of environmental functions were presented in fig 8 it was found that the relative abundances of carbohydrate digestion and absorption cytochrome p450 and basal transcription factors were 31 6 and 70 8 23 5 and 37 3 43 5 and 61 3 higher in sludge f than those in m and s moreover the relative abundance of citrate cycle energy metabolism pyruvate metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation were 2 2 and 3 2 1 0 and 3 3 0 6 and 2 0 2 4 and 3 0 higher in sludge f than those in sludge m and s these functional otus were highly related to the biodegradation of organic substrates whereas the relative abundance of ion channel abc transporters and transporters in sludge f were 16 5 and 25 7 2 4 and 4 4 2 2 and 5 0 lower than in sludge m and s theses functional otus relay more on the transportation and exchange of macromolecular or ions on cell membrane the otus of nitrogen metabolism showed the highest relative abundances in sludge m and the lowest in sludge s indicating that sludge m had the highest nitrogen metabolism potential which is in agreement with previous discussion in section 3 5 these functional otus further implied that sludge f had the highest organic substance removal potential and sludge m had the highest nitrogen metabolism potential sludge s showed the lowest organic substance removal and nitrogen metabolism potentail revealing that the slow settling sludge had deteriorative activity among three gravity separated sludge fractions according to abovementioned results sludges with different floc size and density were found to be distributed in mixed liquid indicating that several fractions of sludge with different velocities could be separated by gravity these results implied correlations between the sludge properties e g svi mean floc size microbial activity and aldcd and fractions of sludge there is a potential to separate decayed sludge in mixed liquid preferentially based on these correlations which could provide some judgments for building operation standard of selective discharge of sludge 4 conclusions this work demonstrated the distribution of microbial functions and decay in gravity separated sludges for the treatment of high strength coking wastewater aldcd together with the other parameters e g svi eps content xdlvo calculation and microbial community could effectively describe sludge decay in different fractions of sludges the following conclusions were drawn in this study sludge s showed the worst aggregation and sludge f showed the best the highest svi and lb ps content of sludge s suggested a high water content in sludge s leading to its dispersive structure as compared to sludge f the smaller mean floc size of sludge s was related to higher eb and smv of interaction potential energy calculated by xdlvo theory aldcd can be considered as a useful indicator for the quantification of sludge decay sludge s showed the highest aldcd of 19 52 while the lowest aldcd was observed for sludge f 16 88 the apoptosis like decay in sludges was confirmed by the dehydrogenase activity sour and microbial community analysis it seemed that the distribution of decayed sludge was associated with sludge settelabiity and the floc structure the lowest presence of predicted functional otus relating to organic oxidation and nitrogen transformation was found in sludge s suggesting its lower activity in cod and nitrogen removal consequently this work may lead to the development of a novel operation strategy for enhancing the performance of biological wastewater treatment processes and optimizing the sludge management declaration of interests none acknowledgements we gratefully acknowledge financial support

19103,clean water is one of the main resources for key activities such as agriculture power generation and public and industrial supplies however once wastewater generated by these activities is released into the environment it may represent a potential risk to ecosystems and even human health depending on the presence of certain types and levels of contaminants this study is focused on personal care products pcps a class of contaminants of emerging concern cecs which includes commonly used cosmetic and personal hygiene products e g fragrances uv filters antimicrobials surfactants among others and their comparison with legacy contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs we have monitored the concentrations of up to 66 target compounds in influent and effluent wastewater sludge and compost samples from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp at jerez de la frontera sw spain over a 1 year period almost half of the target compounds 44 were frequently detected in influent wastewater samples with prevalence of synthetic fragrances and higher abundance of uv filters during warmer periods due to their relatively poor removal efficiencies 70 30 target compounds were always detected in the final effluent the highest levels here were observed for an uv filter octocrylene and three synthetic fragrances traseolide otne and galaxolide showing maximum concentrations of 4 7 Œºg l 1 and 12 95 Œºg g 1 in the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively concentrations of these compounds increased in sludge being up to 365 Œºg g 1 for some fragrances and showing negligible decrease after anaerobic digestion windrow composting of this sludge however resulted in an efficient removal up to 100 for most analytes on the other hand levels between 1 and 651 ng g 1 were measured in soils columns 0 150 cm at the wwtp gardens irrigated with effluent wastewater the occurrence of pcps in these soils seemed to be heavily influenced by temperature as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months indicating a higher rate of microbial activity degradation and or volatilization during warmer months keywords personal care products persistent organic pollutants sludge composting wastewater soil 1 introduction since the second half of the 20th century synthesis of new organic chemical products has experienced an exponential growth negative effects of some synthetic chemicals on the environment and human health started to become apparent soon after their widespread release into the environment during the 1960 70s since then the assessment of the impact of chemical pollution has mainly focused on those compounds that are toxic and or persistent in the environment examples are organic pollutants pops including organochlorine pesticides such as ddt polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds and polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs included in the stockholm convention 2001 and legislations such as the regulation 850 2004 ec of the european parliament and the eu list of carcinogenic substances iarc 1983 international agency for research on cancer over the last decade there has also been a growing interest on the identification of new chemicals that are not included in current environmental legislation and regulatory programs known as contaminants of emerging concern cecs these substances may have very different chemical structures and uses many of them are ingredients in personal care products pcps including fragrances uv filters insect repellents and antimicrobials balmer et al 2005 whereas others are substitutes of previously banned or restricted compounds such as organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs a new alternative to brominated chemicals pintado herrera et al 2016 although the information on their environmental concentrations and fate is still mostly unknown some of these cecs have potential for bioaccumulation and or are bioactive substances that may jeopardize living organisms as an example some uv filters such as 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4 mbc are suspected to present estrogenic activity schlumpf et al 2004 the incomplete removal of organic compounds during sewage treatment represents one of the main routes of input of both regulated compounds and cecs into the environment some recent studies have focused on the different mechanisms involved in the elimination of pcps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps balmer et al 2005 klaschka et al 2013 kupper et al 2006 liu et al 2012a montes grajales et al 2017 so far the most frequently reported compounds in wastewater were two fragrances galaxolide up to 595 Œºg l 1 in influents and 108 Œºg l 1 in effluents chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 and tonalide for which maximum concentrations of 92 Œºg l 1 have been measured balmer et al 2005 chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 other compounds detected in wwtp effluents were the antimicrobial triclosan which was found at concentrations between 19 and 97 ng l 1 in spain d√≠az gardu√±o et al 2017 the insect repellent deet detected at average concentrations ranging from 6 to 2100 ng l 1 in california loraine and pettigrove 2006 and south korea kim et al 2007 and the sunscreen benzophenone 3 identified in wwtps from uk and united states kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 trenholm et al 2008 at several Œºg l 1 many of these works however did not consider the fraction of these contaminants occurring in the particulate phase e g suspended solids and sludge in part due to challenges associated to analyze such complex matrices this is critical because a significant number of cecs including several classes of pcps such as fragrances and uv filters are hydrophobic substances log kow 4 and their elimination in wwtps must be strongly influenced by sorption processes baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 carballa et al 2004 harrison et al 2006 once in the sludge anaerobic digestion and or composting processes may be employed to accelerate their biodegradation thanks to a combination of high microbial diversity and activity mainly thermophilic organisms abundant substrates and changing ph and redox conditions aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments xia et al 2005 the presence of pcps and other cecs in the environment has been recently reported in different matrices such as surface water balmer et al 2005 giger et al 2006 pintado herrera et al 2014 poiger et al 2004 groundwater cancilla et al 2003 sediments pintado herrera et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 sewage sludge nieto et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and fish gago ferrero et al 2015 the most significant entry routes of pcps into soils are related with their release from conventional wwtps via application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer and or re use of reclaimed water for irrigation of agricultural soils biel maeso et al 2017 for many hydrophobic organic chemicals if they are not degraded during sludge digestion land application of biosolids may result in their accumulation in the top layers verlicchi and zambello 2015 providing a reservoir of pollutants that could eventually enter waterways through leaching and runoff for instance difrancesco et al 2004 reported the dissipation of 22 fragrances in sludge amended soils after 1 year finding that musk ketone and ahtn tonalide remained in another study chase et al 2012 some of these synthetic musks were also detected at trace levels in agricultural soils concentrations of other pcps have been reported by ternes et al 2007 and karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 on arable land irrigated with treated municipal wastewater in germany and united states respectively available data also suggest that a wide number of the cecs in soils will be transported both vertically and horizontally and those with higher mobility may eventually reach groundwater corada fern√°ndez et al 2017 further research including monitoring and detailed toxicological tests at environmentally relevant concentrations are however still required for a better assessment of the potential ecological risk of most of these chemicals especially in the terrestrial environment where there is less information available one of the main goals of this study was to obtain for the first time extensive field data that can be used for further assessment on the exposure concentrations of pcps in aquatic and terrestrial environments in comparison to better known regulated compounds more specifically we determined the levels of a wide number n 66 of pcps and regulated contaminants pcbs and pahs in influent effluent and sludge from a wwtp in sw spain their concentrations were measured over one year in both water and sludge lines including dissolved and particulate fractions a second goal was to establish the removal of these target compounds during wastewater treatment using activated sludge as well as in sludge subjected to anaerobic digestion followed by composting as a fraction of the effluent is reused a third goal was to monitor the occurrence and spatiotemporal variations of pcps in the soils adjacent to the wwtp which are irrigated with reclaimed water and the transfer potential and persistence of these compounds in the terrestrial environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples this study was conducted at the wwtp serving jerez de la frontera 215 000 inhabitants and its industrial activities e g wineries laundry services food processing auto repair shops etc the plant is designed to receive the impact of 103 000 cubic meters of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater per day briefly the wwtp consists of a pretreatment for solid and grit removal and three main treatment steps a primary physicochemical treatment followed by a secondary biological treatment comprising nitrification and denitrification zones and finally an optional elimination step by disinfection through ultra violet radiation after filtration most of the jerez de la frontera sewage between 50 000 65 000 m3 day 1 or approximately 20 million m3 year 1 is treated at the wwtp and after undergoing secondary treatment discharged into the guadalete river and also used for irrigation of the wwtp gardens a small fraction of the wwtp effluent 60 000 70 000 m3 year 1 not analyzed in this work undergoes tertiary treatment and its transferred to a pond for later use in the local golf course a schematic diagram of the different treatment processes in the wwtp involving wastewater and sludge lines is shown in fig s1 supporting information on weekdays all wastewater samples influent consisting on wastewater after pretreatment and effluent after secondary treatment and sludge samples before and after anaerobic digestion were collected monthly in both ten sampling campaigns from july 2014 to june 2015 at jerez de la frontera wwtp daily composite wastewater samples were obtained by mixing sample volumes collected every hour during 24 h by an automatic device the hydraulic retention time in the wwtp 24 h was considered when taking influent and effluent samples one liter aliquots of the total sample volume collected were transferred to amber glass bottles rinsed prior to sampling and extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction sbse within 24 h after collection all the wastewater samples were previously filtered through whatman glass fiber filters 1 Œºm pore size which were combusted at 450 c for 4 h in an oven prior use the influent and effluent particulate fractions were preserved at 20 c after liofilization for further extraction of target contaminants mass balance was performed for each target compound equation 1 by adding the mass load in the dissolved fraction mdf equation 2 to the mass load in the particulate fraction mpf equation 3 1 m m d f m p f 2 m d f c d f v w 3 m p f c p f m w s where m is the total load for a contaminant ng cdf is the concentration measured in the dissolved fraction ng l 1 vw is the volume of wastewater treated l cpf is the concentration measured in the particulate fraction ng g 1 and mws is the mass of the particulate faction g corresponding to vw removal rates of individual compounds were calculated using the following equation 4 4 r m i n f m e f f m i n f 100 where minf is the total load in the influent wastewater and meff is the total load measured in the effluent wastewater 2 2 sludge and compost samples sewage sludge was also sampled at jerez de la frontera wwtp here the primary sludge is obtained by settling fresh sludge from the primary clarifier whereas secondary sludge is obtained by flotation of fresh sludge from the biological reactor afterwards digested sludge is obtained by anaerobic digestion of the mixture of both primary and secondary sludges the sludge retention time in the anaerobic digester is 30 days a fraction of the digested sludge produced 4500 out of 15 000 tons per year is composted and used in agricultural soils by local farmers as fertilizer covering a surface of up to 10 km2 the process followed to reuse the sewage sludge as fertilizer is windrow composting this is an open system where the receiving sludge 80 moisture from the outlet of the anaerobic digester is stacked in discharge springs step 1 then the sludge is spread out to form a thin layer on the ground in order to reduce the moisture content to approximately 50 step 2 step 3 consists on an 8 week fermentation process where the material to be composted is placed into rows of long piles called windrows dimensions 3 m height 3 m wide 10 m length in this step the temperature rises to 50 70 c step 4 consists of periodical aeration of the sludge by either manually or mechanically turning the piles windrows are turned four times twice per week to make sure there is enough oxygen for the microbes to undergo aerobic metabolism finally when the temperature is about 30 40 c the last step step 5 is the screening process using a 12 mm sieve to remove non compostable material from the generated compost and to produce a finer product suitable to be applied to the land as fertilizer overall the whole windrow composting process lasts approximately three months during a sampling period of one year from july 2014 to june 2015 ten sludge samples from the inlet and outlet of the anaerobic digester tank at jerez de la frontera wwtp were collected monthly additionally five samples from each step of the composting process were collected during the summer months when the composting plant operates all the sludge and compost samples were collected in 0 5 l amber jars stored on ice during transport to the laboratory dehydrated by centrifugation and finally lyophilized to dryness before extraction removal rates of individual compounds were calculated for both the anaerobic digestion and the composting process using the following equation 5 5 r c i n i t i a l c f i n a l c i n i t i a l 100 where cinitial is the concentration measured in sludge and or compost samples before undergoing treatment and cfinal is the resulting concentration 2 3 soil sample collection and characterization soil samples were collected at jerez de la frontera wwtp gardens which are regularly irrigated with effluent wastewater from the plant after undergoing physico chemical and biological treatments the irrigation rate was of 9 17 l min 1 according to the local gardener practices the wwtp gardens are irrigated roughly five times per week during summer months whereas during the rest of the year the irrigation frequency decreases at approximately twice per week this irrigation pattern is justified by the rain frequency in the region see fig s2 supporting information dominated by mediterranean climate with high and occasional rain events occurring during the spring and autumn regarding temperature oscillations they are mild due to the proximity of jerez de la frontera wwtp to the ocean resulting on average values of 10 7 c in winter and 25 7 c in summer spanish national meteorological agency aemet soil samples were vertically collected using hand auger drilling equipment eijkelkamp and stainless steel rings 5 cm length 5 cm inner diameter inserted by percussion with a hammer in the second half of summer 2014 and 2015 and winter 2015 at 6 specific depths 20 40 60 90 120 and 150 cm to determine the concentration of target compounds in the soil all the samples were transported at 4 c to the laboratory where they were frozen at 20 c later soil samples were freeze dried milled using a zirconium oxide ball mill and stored until analysis the main physical and chemical properties of the soils analyzed are shown in table s1 supporting information 2 4 analysis of pcps and regulated compounds extraction identification and quantification of 66 target compounds table s2 was performed following analytical protocols developed by pintado herrera et al 2014 2016 briefly effluent and influent water samples n 20 were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction sbse whereas extraction of contaminants from solid matrices suspended solids n 20 sludge n 20 compost n 5 and soil samples n 18 was achieved by pressurized liquid extraction ple the extraction and analysis of all the samples were performed in duplicate determination of analytes was achieved using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms further information on the analytical standards and methods used can be found both in the aforementioned references as well as in the section analytical methodology in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of pcps in wastewater table 1 shows the concentration ranges in dissolved and particulate fractions of wastewater samples and detection frequencies for all the detected compounds considered in this study for further details on concentrations of each contaminant within a specific month see tables s4 s5 and s6 supporting information the total concentrations ranged between 5 9 and 28 3 Œºg l 1 in the dissolved phase and between 36 7 and 335 Œºg g 1 in the particulate phase in influent wastewater whereas they were significantly lower in the effluent up to 17 3 Œºg l 1 and 204 Œºg g 1 respectively in total 30 and 32 out of 66 target compounds were found in the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively the hydrophobic nature of the target contaminants enhanced their sorption to the organic matter in the particulate phase where they were more frequently detected thus 69 and 53 of the detected compounds in influents and effluents respectively were found at detection frequencies 80 in the particulate fraction the number of compounds decreased to 43 and 37 in the dissolved phase in influent and effluents respectively six contaminants showed a frequency of detection of 100 in all analyzed samples 4 fragrances galaxolide tonalide musk ketone and otne and 2 pahs acenaphthene and phenanthrene focusing on the contaminants detected in influent samples the classes of compounds with the highest concentrations in the dissolved fraction were fragrances especially galaxolide traseolide and otne with values over 10 Œºg l 1 on average followed by uv filters 4 Œºg l 1 which is in agreement with previous studies performed in other wwtps balmer et al 2005 chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 kupper et al 2006 for individual compounds the uv filter octocrylene oc was found at the highest concentration in the dissolved fraction up to 13 Œºg l 1 in june 2015 and 5 2 Œºg l 1 on average whereas up to 240 Œºg g 1 were measured in the particulate fraction making it the most abundant target contaminant in influent samples fig 1 a the higher relative amount of oc in the suspended solids 86 table 1 was attributed to its very high octanol water partition coefficient log kow 6 88 see table s7 at supporting information resulting in a very high affinity towards the organic matter in the particulate phase on the contrary bp 3 the most frequently detected uv filter in sewage present in 90 of the samples had a maximum concentration of 2 6 Œºg l 1 in the dissolved fraction and 0 1 Œºg g 1 in the particulate fraction in influent samples this preferential distribution in the aqueous phase was influenced by bp 3 relatively low kow 3 52 and was also observed for other substances such as the insect repellent deet log kow 2 02 the concentrations reported here for dissolved bp 3 were similar to those reported by liu et al 2012a which were around 2 1 Œºg l 1 synthetic fragrances such as traseolide otne and galaxolide were also detected at relatively high values in both particulate and dissolved fractions showing mean concentrations of 3 9 3 6 and 2 0 Œºg l 1 in the latter respectively fig 1a the predominance of both uv filters and fragrances was directly related to their wide usage in the formulation of pcps on the contrary chemicals with restricted production and application such as pcbs were always at concentrations below the limits of quantification among the different regulated compounds considered in this study pahs were the most abundant and their distribution between the dissolved and particulate fractions varied greatly depending on their molecular weight and hence hydrophobicity liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 thus acenaphthene log kow 3 92 was only quantified in the dissolved fraction whereas heavier components such as benzo a anthracene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene and chrysene were completely adsorbed onto the suspended solids log kow 5 7 in wastewater effluent samples a significant decrease in the dissolved concentrations of most target contaminants during wastewater treatment could be observed that is 25 out of 30 detected compounds had average concentrations 0 5 Œºg l 1 however traseolide galaxolide and otne were still identified as the predominant pcps in both particulate and dissolved fractions with mean concentrations of 3 6 3 0 and 2 7 Œºg l 1 respectively fig 1b oc which was the most abundant chemical in the influent was displaced to the fourth position the aqueous concentrations of other uv filters such as 4 mbc were quite similar to those in a previous study conducted in april and october of 2010 by liu et al 2012a in a wwtp from south australia however these authors found lower levels for oc below 0 5 Œºg l 1 some of the aforementioned publications on the occurrence of fragrances uv filters and other pcps did not report their concentrations in suspended solids as we can see from data in table 1 this is of great importance to assess the removal efficiencies of wwtps as a high percentage of these chemicals might leave the plant in association with the particulate matter andersen et al 2005 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 to account for this the removal efficiencies of jerez de la frontera wwtp were calculated for each compound by performing a mass balance that considered the concentrations in both dissolved and particulate phases equation 4 table 2 shows the mass load ng of the different classes of pcps and regulated compounds in the influent and effluent of this plant as well as their removal efficiencies the removal of fragrances the insect repellent deet and the antimicrobial triclosan tcs was poor 50 on average on the other hand most of the uv filters e g ehs hms 4 mbc ehmc etc were very efficiently removed 87 98 in agreement with previous reports balmer et al 2005 liu et al 2012a differential removal efficiencies for fragrances and uv filters the two most abundant components in wastewater explain the changes in the composition of effluents fig 1b compared to influents fig 1a other target compounds such as opfrs 71 and pahs 64 showed intermediate removal efficiencies a seasonal variation in the concentrations and or removal percentages of some classes of target pcps and regulated contaminants could be observed during the sampling campaign as shown in table 2 the highest influent loads for uv filters were found during the warmer months 1980 ng in summer and 3100 ng in spring in comparison with winter 652 ng and autumn 571 ng as an example the average mass load for oc in the first period was 3 4 times higher than in the second similarly the mass of the insect repellent deet in influent wastewater fluctuated between 57 ng in summer and negligible in winter the seasonal variation of both uv filters and deet was thus directly correlated to their consumption patterns as these chemicals are mostly applied in warmer periods due to the higher incidences of exposure to sunlight and to mosquito bites respectively fig s3a the loads of other target compounds such as fragrances between 1170 and 1790 ng were fairly constant during the sampling period reflecting a constant input as a consequence of their year round usage in laundry products and cosmetics fig s3b there were however changes in their average removal efficiencies between cold 0 4 and warm months 29 41 which suggests that their biological removal during wastewater treatment must be influenced by the temperature we hypothesize that due to the relatively high henry s law constants in the order of 10 4 atm m3 mol 1 of most synthetic fragrances volatilization might also play an important role in their removal during warmer periods 3 2 inefficient removal of target compounds in sludge during anaerobic digestion the concentrations of the detected compounds in sludge samples collected at the inlet and outlet of anaerobic digester at jerez de la frontera wwtp and their removal efficiencies are summarized in table 3 more detailed information is presented in tables s8 and s9 supporting information we found the same compounds in the sludge samples as in dissolved and particulate fractions of the wastewater samples except for deet which was not detected in any samples from the anaerobic digester possibly due to its relatively hydrophilic character log kow 2 02 on the contrary two other contaminants were found in sludge samples and not in wastewater samples indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and tehp both have the highest values for log kow 6 70 and 9 49 respectively among all the target contaminants the measured total concentrations of target compounds in sludge samples at the inlet were 41 2 Œºg g 1 on average with predominance of the synthetic fragrances up to 43 9 Œºg g 1 in february and at an average concentration of 26 1 Œºg g 1 followed by uv filters up to 19 4 Œºg g 1 in june and at an average concentration of 9 4 Œºg g 1 the remaining classes of target contaminants were always at levels below 2 Œºg g 1 on average regarding specific compounds galaxolide traseolide tonalide otne and oc were detected at higher concentrations than other pcps 13 2 3 4 2 5 6 0 and 3 9 Œºg g 1 on average respectively at the inlet of the anaerobic digester fig 1c in agreement with the results found in wastewater samples fig 1a and b tcs ehmc ehs and hms were present at intermediate concentrations between 1 and 2 Œºg g 1 and the rest of the detected compounds were found at levels below 1 Œºg g 1 on average the removal of target compounds during the anaerobic digestion of the sludge was poor as the total concentration in sludge samples ranged from 19 to 60 Œºg g 1 at the inlet and from 19 to 52 Œºg g 1 at the outlet the levels of most of the pcps and regulated compounds were similar before and after anaerobic digestion table 3 as a consequence the sludge samples at the outlet presented a similar composition compared to those at the inlet with galaxolide tonalide traseolide otne and oc identified as the predominant pcps with average concentrations between 2 3 and 12 0 Œºg g 1 fig 1d similar results were found by verlicchi and zambello 2015 where the highest levels up to 10 ng g 1 of galaxolide traseolide and tonalide were found in sludge before digestion only 4 out of the 32 compounds detected in sludge were efficiently eliminated 70 three uv filters ehs ehmc and bp 3 and one fragrance musk ketone or mk the information available on the anaerobic removal of pcps in sludge is still scarce and mostly related to fragrances but in general terms the removal efficiencies reported in table 3 are somewhat below those measured by other researchers for instance kupper et al 2006 reported that galaxolide tonalide celestolide phantolide and cashmeran were removed by 50 during sludge anaerobic digestion and slightly higher values 60 70 were reported by carballa et al 2006 during mesophilic and thermophilic digestion on the contrary and more in line with our findings clara et al 2011 observed very low or negligible degradation for galaxolide tonalide cashmerane celestolide phantolide and traesolide we also detected no removal for some other compounds such as celestolide fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene chrysene and pcbs all of them highly hydrophobic table s7 tcs at 1980 ng g 1 and 1500 ng g 1 at the inlet and outlet of anaerobic digester respectively was also persistent in agreement with previous studies mcavoy et al 2002 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 the strong sorption capacity of many of the studied contaminants and hence low bioavailability must also influence the biodegradation process some of the compounds that were effectively removed during anaerobic digestion such as bp 3 79 had the lowest log kow values 3 52 and their disappearance has been shown to occur under different reducing conditions liu et al 2012b similar to our findings in the wastewater treatment line a seasonal variation was observed for some classes of compounds during the 1 year sampling campaign in the anaerobic digester table 4 while opfrs and pahs showed similar levels throughout the year fragrances occurred at highest concentrations in winter fig s3b given that their concentration in wastewater samples was fairly stable within the sampling period table 2 maximum levels in sludge during colder months may be attributed to slower degradation processes by microbial activity on the other hand concentrations of uv filters in the sludge samples peaked during the warmest months summer and spring fig s3a for instance levels of individual compounds such as 4 mbc and ehs changed drastically in the inlet where they were found at 10 6 and 8 8 times higher in summer than in winter respectively see table s8 supporting information a similar seasonal pattern was previously discussed by nieto et al 2009 for oc for which they reported up to 0 7 Œºg g 1 in winter and 1 8 Œºg g 1 in summer as we stated previously these differences in concentrations from one season to another are directly related to their higher use during warm months 3 3 composting as an effective process to remove pcps from sludge fig 2 shows the concentrations of different classes of target compounds at five stages during the composting process more detailed information on individual contaminants can be found in table s10 supporting information overall all the detected compounds decreased their concentrations throughout the windrow composting resulting in a reduction of 97 at the end of the process 90 days windrow composting was thus much more efficient than anaerobic digestion in the wwtp for elimination of pcps and regulated contaminants the removal efficiencies for most classes of target compounds were virtually 100 except for fragrances 96 and pahs 99 the most recalcitrant substances were tonalide and benzo b fluoranthene having a removal efficiency of 87 other contaminants such as bp 3 were totally degraded during the spreading stage in step 2 or during the fermentation process in step 3 e g ehs hms 2 ehdp and tnbp were eliminated in the last step screening stage in total 23 out of 32 detected compounds were either not detected or found at concentrations below the limits of quantification of the method after the composting process and therefore were considered to be totally removed so far there are only a few studies such as those performed by poulsen and bester 2010 and sadef et al 2014 investigating the effect of composting on pcps and other emerging contaminants they are however limited to monitoring a few common organic micropollutants in sewage sludge e g bactericides flame retardants fragrances vulcanizers and plasticizers at the beginning and the end of the process the concentrations of all these micropollutants decreased during the composting process and degradation was higher than 75 for most of them after 24 days poulsen and bester 2010 regarding regulated compounds br√§ndli et al 2007 had previously reported that some congeners of pcbs and pahs were also removed during open windrow composting their results also revealed that degradation of persistent compounds or their transformation to different metabolites occurred faster under aerobic conditions more recently chen et al 2011 have confirmed the same fact by measuring conversion rates of tcs into methyl triclosan in sludge incubated in presence of oxygen poulsen and bester 2010 also identified the occurrence of the metabolite galaxolidone from galaxolide during composting therefore indicating microbial degradation overall the reduction in the concentrations of most of the parent pcps and regulated contaminants to levels below the limits of detection ensures their safe application in agricultural practices in our sampling area the identification possible persistence and ecotoxicity assessment of their transformation products however is still pending 3 4 occurrence of pcps in soils irrigated with treated wastewater fig 3 shows the vertical distribution profiles for total concentrations of target compounds in soils from jerez de la frontera wwtp taken in summer 2014 and winter and summer 2015 more detailed information on the concentrations of individual contaminants can be found in tables s11 s12 and s13 supporting information the measured total concentrations of pcps and regulated compounds in soil samples were between 172 and 1680 ng g 1 and fragrances were the predominant class reaching maximum concentrations of up to 1290 ng g 1 they were followed in abundance by uv filters maximum concentration 214 ng g 1 and pahs maximum concentration 281 ng g 1 while the insect repellent deet the antibacterial tcs and pcbs were present at lower concentrations from 0 1 to 2 5 ng g 1 regarding individual compounds we detected 30 out of 66 target chemicals belonging to different classes galaxolide otne and ehs were measured at relatively higher concentrations than other compounds 220 103 and 28 ng g 1 on average respectively the remaining target compounds detected were found at 10 ng g 1 on average all those pcps and regulated compounds detected in the receiving soils were also present in effluent wastewater confirming the direct influence of the treated wastewater used for irrigation on soil pollution their occurrence in soils was not only a consequence of them being relatively abundant in effluent wastewater e g fragrances but also related to their physico chemical properties e g high log kow values table s7 and those in the receiving soils e g organic carbon content table s1 enhancing the retention and or persistence of these contaminants in general terms the highest concentrations of all target compounds were found at the surface layer of the soil 20 cm except for tcs and deet which peaked at 40 cm depth in winter 2015 the prevalence of contaminants in the top of the soil was related to the direct contact of surface soil and wastewater during irrigation in addition the first soil layer 20 cm has the highest percentage of organic matter 0 9 which would enhance the sorption of organic chemicals as the soil column is not entirely homogeneous see table s1 for changes in texture and organic carbon content at every depth soil properties might also influence the transport of contaminants and their resulting vertical concentration profiles for instance fragrances were measured at the highest concentrations in the surface layer in both seasons winter and summer but a secondary maximum was detected at 60 cm in winter and summer 2015 this is the soil layer having higher content in silt clay 90 which might increase retardation of these compounds as they are transported towards deeper layers the leaching potential of these substances and other pcps is evident in fig 3 as all target compounds that were detected in soils except for acenaphthene were measured in samples up to 150 cm this is in agreement with previous results on the vertical distribution of pharmaceuticals in same sampling area which are more polar substances and therefore have a presumably higher leaching potential biel maeso et al 2018 corada fern√°ndez et al 2015 as with wastewater and sludge samples seasonal variation of concentration of different classes of contaminants was observed in soils regarding although it was not always in agreement with the data obtained from the wwtp overall and in spite of undergoing less irrigation using recycled wastewater during winter the highest concentrations for most target compounds in surface soil were found during the cold months average soil mean temperature 12 c see table s14 being between 697 and 1680 ng g 1 table s12 some contaminants such as musk ketone were only found in the winter period one possible explanation is that lower temperatures might minimize biodegradation processes compared to summer months when mean values of 24 c are often measured in the sampling site biel maeso et al 2018 highest concentrations during colder months and lowest values in summer were not only observed in the surface layer but also deeper in the soil column fig 3 these results suggest that removal of contaminants between 20 and 150 cm was fairly uniform and that biodegradation rates did not appreciable change with soil depth due changes in environmental conditions such as temperature ph moisture content and organic carbon colucci et al 2001 monteiro and boxall 2009 being minor table s1 regarding the distribution and behavior of each class of compounds in the soil column we observed different patterns while uv filters showed the highest maximum concentrations during summer and spring in the samples from the wwtp fig s3a they remained relatively constant in the soil despite the higher inputs from reclaimed wastewater during the warmer months fig s3c one possible explanation would be a higher rate of microbial degradation with increasing temperatures at that time of the year which would counteract the effect of higher uv filter inputs no losses due to volatilization are expected due to the low henry s constant for these chemicals up to 3 0 10 09 atm m3 mol 1 see table s7 a similar trend was also observed for deet on the contrary the concentrations of fragrances pcbs and opfrs in wastewater samples were fairly constant throughout the year fig s3b however lower concentrations were found in surface soil samples during warm months compared to colder months fig s3d as in the case of uv filters these findings could be related to their presumably higher microbial degradation rates at higher temperatures in addition to possible volatilization from soils based on henry s law constants for fragrances from 1 3 10 04 to 4 2 10 05 atm m3 mol 1 pcbs between 2 0 10 04 and 9 0 10 05 atm m3 mol 1 and opfrs between 5 4 10 05 and 3 3 10 06 atm m3 mol 1 all indicative of their semi volatile nature this explanation can also be extended to pahs some of which showed henry s law constants greater than 1 10 04 atm m3 mol 1 and which are frequently detected in the atmosphere zhang et al 2012 the concentrations of these regulated compounds as well as pcbs showed little variation over the sampling period and part of their presence due to atmospheric inputs e g vehicle traffic from adjacent roads cannot be discarded as confirmed in previous studies on persistent organic pollutants in soils from other regions armitage et al 2006 4 conclusions personal care products pcps of different classes were detected in both dissolved and particulate fractions in wastewater along with other persistent organic contaminants such as pahs a higher incidence was observed for uv filters in summer directly related to higher consumption during that period some target compounds were poorly removed during wastewater treatment particularly fragrances 21 due to their hydrophobic nature all compounds found in wastewater were also detected in the sludge except for deet a relatively polar insect repellent windrow composting seems an optimal strategy for further elimination of pcps 95 from sludge whereas anaerobic digestion proved inefficient the application of treated wastewater for irrigation of soils resulted on all the chemicals detected in the wwtp also occurring in this environmental compartment the measured total concentrations of pcps and regulated compounds in soil samples were up to 1680 ng g 1 with predominance of fragrances also major contaminants in effluent wastewater after continuous irrigation with reclaimed wastewater pcps were detected in the soil column up to 150 cm depth and often at significantly higher concentrations during winter compared to summer further research is needed to characterize the factors affecting the possible biodegradation and or volatilization of these contaminants of emerging concern from soils as well as laboratory experiments to fully determine their leaching potential although the presence of parent pcps in compost was negligible identification of potentially harmful metabolites formed during the composting process should be also assessed to guarantee their safe application in agricultural soils additionally the data presented here can provide useful information for future evaluation of the potential short and long term effects of pcps over terrestrial organisms through ecotoxicity tests as well as to improve management decisions on the application of treated wastewater and compost to land to reduce environmental exposure to these chemicals acknowledgements this study has been supported by project cgl2011 27349 and a fpi fellowship both funded by the spanish ministry of economy industry and competitiveness

19103,clean water is one of the main resources for key activities such as agriculture power generation and public and industrial supplies however once wastewater generated by these activities is released into the environment it may represent a potential risk to ecosystems and even human health depending on the presence of certain types and levels of contaminants this study is focused on personal care products pcps a class of contaminants of emerging concern cecs which includes commonly used cosmetic and personal hygiene products e g fragrances uv filters antimicrobials surfactants among others and their comparison with legacy contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs and polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs we have monitored the concentrations of up to 66 target compounds in influent and effluent wastewater sludge and compost samples from a wastewater treatment plant wwtp at jerez de la frontera sw spain over a 1 year period almost half of the target compounds 44 were frequently detected in influent wastewater samples with prevalence of synthetic fragrances and higher abundance of uv filters during warmer periods due to their relatively poor removal efficiencies 70 30 target compounds were always detected in the final effluent the highest levels here were observed for an uv filter octocrylene and three synthetic fragrances traseolide otne and galaxolide showing maximum concentrations of 4 7 Œºg l 1 and 12 95 Œºg g 1 in the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively concentrations of these compounds increased in sludge being up to 365 Œºg g 1 for some fragrances and showing negligible decrease after anaerobic digestion windrow composting of this sludge however resulted in an efficient removal up to 100 for most analytes on the other hand levels between 1 and 651 ng g 1 were measured in soils columns 0 150 cm at the wwtp gardens irrigated with effluent wastewater the occurrence of pcps in these soils seemed to be heavily influenced by temperature as maximum concentrations were measured in colder months indicating a higher rate of microbial activity degradation and or volatilization during warmer months keywords personal care products persistent organic pollutants sludge composting wastewater soil 1 introduction since the second half of the 20th century synthesis of new organic chemical products has experienced an exponential growth negative effects of some synthetic chemicals on the environment and human health started to become apparent soon after their widespread release into the environment during the 1960 70s since then the assessment of the impact of chemical pollution has mainly focused on those compounds that are toxic and or persistent in the environment examples are organic pollutants pops including organochlorine pesticides such as ddt polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs polychlorinated dibenzo p dioxins pcdds and polychlorinated dibenzofurans pcdfs included in the stockholm convention 2001 and legislations such as the regulation 850 2004 ec of the european parliament and the eu list of carcinogenic substances iarc 1983 international agency for research on cancer over the last decade there has also been a growing interest on the identification of new chemicals that are not included in current environmental legislation and regulatory programs known as contaminants of emerging concern cecs these substances may have very different chemical structures and uses many of them are ingredients in personal care products pcps including fragrances uv filters insect repellents and antimicrobials balmer et al 2005 whereas others are substitutes of previously banned or restricted compounds such as organophosphorus flame retardants opfrs a new alternative to brominated chemicals pintado herrera et al 2016 although the information on their environmental concentrations and fate is still mostly unknown some of these cecs have potential for bioaccumulation and or are bioactive substances that may jeopardize living organisms as an example some uv filters such as 4 methylbenzylidene camphor 4 mbc are suspected to present estrogenic activity schlumpf et al 2004 the incomplete removal of organic compounds during sewage treatment represents one of the main routes of input of both regulated compounds and cecs into the environment some recent studies have focused on the different mechanisms involved in the elimination of pcps in wastewater treatment plants wwtps balmer et al 2005 klaschka et al 2013 kupper et al 2006 liu et al 2012a montes grajales et al 2017 so far the most frequently reported compounds in wastewater were two fragrances galaxolide up to 595 Œºg l 1 in influents and 108 Œºg l 1 in effluents chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 and tonalide for which maximum concentrations of 92 Œºg l 1 have been measured balmer et al 2005 chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 other compounds detected in wwtp effluents were the antimicrobial triclosan which was found at concentrations between 19 and 97 ng l 1 in spain d√≠az gardu√±o et al 2017 the insect repellent deet detected at average concentrations ranging from 6 to 2100 ng l 1 in california loraine and pettigrove 2006 and south korea kim et al 2007 and the sunscreen benzophenone 3 identified in wwtps from uk and united states kasprzyk hordern et al 2009 trenholm et al 2008 at several Œºg l 1 many of these works however did not consider the fraction of these contaminants occurring in the particulate phase e g suspended solids and sludge in part due to challenges associated to analyze such complex matrices this is critical because a significant number of cecs including several classes of pcps such as fragrances and uv filters are hydrophobic substances log kow 4 and their elimination in wwtps must be strongly influenced by sorption processes baker and kasprzyk hordern 2011 carballa et al 2004 harrison et al 2006 once in the sludge anaerobic digestion and or composting processes may be employed to accelerate their biodegradation thanks to a combination of high microbial diversity and activity mainly thermophilic organisms abundant substrates and changing ph and redox conditions aerobic and anaerobic microenvironments xia et al 2005 the presence of pcps and other cecs in the environment has been recently reported in different matrices such as surface water balmer et al 2005 giger et al 2006 pintado herrera et al 2014 poiger et al 2004 groundwater cancilla et al 2003 sediments pintado herrera et al 2016 zhang et al 2011 sewage sludge nieto et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 and fish gago ferrero et al 2015 the most significant entry routes of pcps into soils are related with their release from conventional wwtps via application of treated sewage sludge as fertilizer and or re use of reclaimed water for irrigation of agricultural soils biel maeso et al 2017 for many hydrophobic organic chemicals if they are not degraded during sludge digestion land application of biosolids may result in their accumulation in the top layers verlicchi and zambello 2015 providing a reservoir of pollutants that could eventually enter waterways through leaching and runoff for instance difrancesco et al 2004 reported the dissipation of 22 fragrances in sludge amended soils after 1 year finding that musk ketone and ahtn tonalide remained in another study chase et al 2012 some of these synthetic musks were also detected at trace levels in agricultural soils concentrations of other pcps have been reported by ternes et al 2007 and karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 on arable land irrigated with treated municipal wastewater in germany and united states respectively available data also suggest that a wide number of the cecs in soils will be transported both vertically and horizontally and those with higher mobility may eventually reach groundwater corada fern√°ndez et al 2017 further research including monitoring and detailed toxicological tests at environmentally relevant concentrations are however still required for a better assessment of the potential ecological risk of most of these chemicals especially in the terrestrial environment where there is less information available one of the main goals of this study was to obtain for the first time extensive field data that can be used for further assessment on the exposure concentrations of pcps in aquatic and terrestrial environments in comparison to better known regulated compounds more specifically we determined the levels of a wide number n 66 of pcps and regulated contaminants pcbs and pahs in influent effluent and sludge from a wwtp in sw spain their concentrations were measured over one year in both water and sludge lines including dissolved and particulate fractions a second goal was to establish the removal of these target compounds during wastewater treatment using activated sludge as well as in sludge subjected to anaerobic digestion followed by composting as a fraction of the effluent is reused a third goal was to monitor the occurrence and spatiotemporal variations of pcps in the soils adjacent to the wwtp which are irrigated with reclaimed water and the transfer potential and persistence of these compounds in the terrestrial environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 wastewater samples this study was conducted at the wwtp serving jerez de la frontera 215 000 inhabitants and its industrial activities e g wineries laundry services food processing auto repair shops etc the plant is designed to receive the impact of 103 000 cubic meters of domestic sewage and industrial wastewater per day briefly the wwtp consists of a pretreatment for solid and grit removal and three main treatment steps a primary physicochemical treatment followed by a secondary biological treatment comprising nitrification and denitrification zones and finally an optional elimination step by disinfection through ultra violet radiation after filtration most of the jerez de la frontera sewage between 50 000 65 000 m3 day 1 or approximately 20 million m3 year 1 is treated at the wwtp and after undergoing secondary treatment discharged into the guadalete river and also used for irrigation of the wwtp gardens a small fraction of the wwtp effluent 60 000 70 000 m3 year 1 not analyzed in this work undergoes tertiary treatment and its transferred to a pond for later use in the local golf course a schematic diagram of the different treatment processes in the wwtp involving wastewater and sludge lines is shown in fig s1 supporting information on weekdays all wastewater samples influent consisting on wastewater after pretreatment and effluent after secondary treatment and sludge samples before and after anaerobic digestion were collected monthly in both ten sampling campaigns from july 2014 to june 2015 at jerez de la frontera wwtp daily composite wastewater samples were obtained by mixing sample volumes collected every hour during 24 h by an automatic device the hydraulic retention time in the wwtp 24 h was considered when taking influent and effluent samples one liter aliquots of the total sample volume collected were transferred to amber glass bottles rinsed prior to sampling and extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction sbse within 24 h after collection all the wastewater samples were previously filtered through whatman glass fiber filters 1 Œºm pore size which were combusted at 450 c for 4 h in an oven prior use the influent and effluent particulate fractions were preserved at 20 c after liofilization for further extraction of target contaminants mass balance was performed for each target compound equation 1 by adding the mass load in the dissolved fraction mdf equation 2 to the mass load in the particulate fraction mpf equation 3 1 m m d f m p f 2 m d f c d f v w 3 m p f c p f m w s where m is the total load for a contaminant ng cdf is the concentration measured in the dissolved fraction ng l 1 vw is the volume of wastewater treated l cpf is the concentration measured in the particulate fraction ng g 1 and mws is the mass of the particulate faction g corresponding to vw removal rates of individual compounds were calculated using the following equation 4 4 r m i n f m e f f m i n f 100 where minf is the total load in the influent wastewater and meff is the total load measured in the effluent wastewater 2 2 sludge and compost samples sewage sludge was also sampled at jerez de la frontera wwtp here the primary sludge is obtained by settling fresh sludge from the primary clarifier whereas secondary sludge is obtained by flotation of fresh sludge from the biological reactor afterwards digested sludge is obtained by anaerobic digestion of the mixture of both primary and secondary sludges the sludge retention time in the anaerobic digester is 30 days a fraction of the digested sludge produced 4500 out of 15 000 tons per year is composted and used in agricultural soils by local farmers as fertilizer covering a surface of up to 10 km2 the process followed to reuse the sewage sludge as fertilizer is windrow composting this is an open system where the receiving sludge 80 moisture from the outlet of the anaerobic digester is stacked in discharge springs step 1 then the sludge is spread out to form a thin layer on the ground in order to reduce the moisture content to approximately 50 step 2 step 3 consists on an 8 week fermentation process where the material to be composted is placed into rows of long piles called windrows dimensions 3 m height 3 m wide 10 m length in this step the temperature rises to 50 70 c step 4 consists of periodical aeration of the sludge by either manually or mechanically turning the piles windrows are turned four times twice per week to make sure there is enough oxygen for the microbes to undergo aerobic metabolism finally when the temperature is about 30 40 c the last step step 5 is the screening process using a 12 mm sieve to remove non compostable material from the generated compost and to produce a finer product suitable to be applied to the land as fertilizer overall the whole windrow composting process lasts approximately three months during a sampling period of one year from july 2014 to june 2015 ten sludge samples from the inlet and outlet of the anaerobic digester tank at jerez de la frontera wwtp were collected monthly additionally five samples from each step of the composting process were collected during the summer months when the composting plant operates all the sludge and compost samples were collected in 0 5 l amber jars stored on ice during transport to the laboratory dehydrated by centrifugation and finally lyophilized to dryness before extraction removal rates of individual compounds were calculated for both the anaerobic digestion and the composting process using the following equation 5 5 r c i n i t i a l c f i n a l c i n i t i a l 100 where cinitial is the concentration measured in sludge and or compost samples before undergoing treatment and cfinal is the resulting concentration 2 3 soil sample collection and characterization soil samples were collected at jerez de la frontera wwtp gardens which are regularly irrigated with effluent wastewater from the plant after undergoing physico chemical and biological treatments the irrigation rate was of 9 17 l min 1 according to the local gardener practices the wwtp gardens are irrigated roughly five times per week during summer months whereas during the rest of the year the irrigation frequency decreases at approximately twice per week this irrigation pattern is justified by the rain frequency in the region see fig s2 supporting information dominated by mediterranean climate with high and occasional rain events occurring during the spring and autumn regarding temperature oscillations they are mild due to the proximity of jerez de la frontera wwtp to the ocean resulting on average values of 10 7 c in winter and 25 7 c in summer spanish national meteorological agency aemet soil samples were vertically collected using hand auger drilling equipment eijkelkamp and stainless steel rings 5 cm length 5 cm inner diameter inserted by percussion with a hammer in the second half of summer 2014 and 2015 and winter 2015 at 6 specific depths 20 40 60 90 120 and 150 cm to determine the concentration of target compounds in the soil all the samples were transported at 4 c to the laboratory where they were frozen at 20 c later soil samples were freeze dried milled using a zirconium oxide ball mill and stored until analysis the main physical and chemical properties of the soils analyzed are shown in table s1 supporting information 2 4 analysis of pcps and regulated compounds extraction identification and quantification of 66 target compounds table s2 was performed following analytical protocols developed by pintado herrera et al 2014 2016 briefly effluent and influent water samples n 20 were extracted by stir bar sorptive extraction sbse whereas extraction of contaminants from solid matrices suspended solids n 20 sludge n 20 compost n 5 and soil samples n 18 was achieved by pressurized liquid extraction ple the extraction and analysis of all the samples were performed in duplicate determination of analytes was achieved using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry gc ms ms further information on the analytical standards and methods used can be found both in the aforementioned references as well as in the section analytical methodology in supporting information 3 results and discussion 3 1 occurrence and removal of pcps in wastewater table 1 shows the concentration ranges in dissolved and particulate fractions of wastewater samples and detection frequencies for all the detected compounds considered in this study for further details on concentrations of each contaminant within a specific month see tables s4 s5 and s6 supporting information the total concentrations ranged between 5 9 and 28 3 Œºg l 1 in the dissolved phase and between 36 7 and 335 Œºg g 1 in the particulate phase in influent wastewater whereas they were significantly lower in the effluent up to 17 3 Œºg l 1 and 204 Œºg g 1 respectively in total 30 and 32 out of 66 target compounds were found in the dissolved and particulate fractions respectively the hydrophobic nature of the target contaminants enhanced their sorption to the organic matter in the particulate phase where they were more frequently detected thus 69 and 53 of the detected compounds in influents and effluents respectively were found at detection frequencies 80 in the particulate fraction the number of compounds decreased to 43 and 37 in the dissolved phase in influent and effluents respectively six contaminants showed a frequency of detection of 100 in all analyzed samples 4 fragrances galaxolide tonalide musk ketone and otne and 2 pahs acenaphthene and phenanthrene focusing on the contaminants detected in influent samples the classes of compounds with the highest concentrations in the dissolved fraction were fragrances especially galaxolide traseolide and otne with values over 10 Œºg l 1 on average followed by uv filters 4 Œºg l 1 which is in agreement with previous studies performed in other wwtps balmer et al 2005 chen et al 2007 klaschka et al 2013 kupper et al 2006 for individual compounds the uv filter octocrylene oc was found at the highest concentration in the dissolved fraction up to 13 Œºg l 1 in june 2015 and 5 2 Œºg l 1 on average whereas up to 240 Œºg g 1 were measured in the particulate fraction making it the most abundant target contaminant in influent samples fig 1 a the higher relative amount of oc in the suspended solids 86 table 1 was attributed to its very high octanol water partition coefficient log kow 6 88 see table s7 at supporting information resulting in a very high affinity towards the organic matter in the particulate phase on the contrary bp 3 the most frequently detected uv filter in sewage present in 90 of the samples had a maximum concentration of 2 6 Œºg l 1 in the dissolved fraction and 0 1 Œºg g 1 in the particulate fraction in influent samples this preferential distribution in the aqueous phase was influenced by bp 3 relatively low kow 3 52 and was also observed for other substances such as the insect repellent deet log kow 2 02 the concentrations reported here for dissolved bp 3 were similar to those reported by liu et al 2012a which were around 2 1 Œºg l 1 synthetic fragrances such as traseolide otne and galaxolide were also detected at relatively high values in both particulate and dissolved fractions showing mean concentrations of 3 9 3 6 and 2 0 Œºg l 1 in the latter respectively fig 1a the predominance of both uv filters and fragrances was directly related to their wide usage in the formulation of pcps on the contrary chemicals with restricted production and application such as pcbs were always at concentrations below the limits of quantification among the different regulated compounds considered in this study pahs were the most abundant and their distribution between the dissolved and particulate fractions varied greatly depending on their molecular weight and hence hydrophobicity liu et al 2011 zhang et al 2012 thus acenaphthene log kow 3 92 was only quantified in the dissolved fraction whereas heavier components such as benzo a anthracene benzo b fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene and chrysene were completely adsorbed onto the suspended solids log kow 5 7 in wastewater effluent samples a significant decrease in the dissolved concentrations of most target contaminants during wastewater treatment could be observed that is 25 out of 30 detected compounds had average concentrations 0 5 Œºg l 1 however traseolide galaxolide and otne were still identified as the predominant pcps in both particulate and dissolved fractions with mean concentrations of 3 6 3 0 and 2 7 Œºg l 1 respectively fig 1b oc which was the most abundant chemical in the influent was displaced to the fourth position the aqueous concentrations of other uv filters such as 4 mbc were quite similar to those in a previous study conducted in april and october of 2010 by liu et al 2012a in a wwtp from south australia however these authors found lower levels for oc below 0 5 Œºg l 1 some of the aforementioned publications on the occurrence of fragrances uv filters and other pcps did not report their concentrations in suspended solids as we can see from data in table 1 this is of great importance to assess the removal efficiencies of wwtps as a high percentage of these chemicals might leave the plant in association with the particulate matter andersen et al 2005 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 to account for this the removal efficiencies of jerez de la frontera wwtp were calculated for each compound by performing a mass balance that considered the concentrations in both dissolved and particulate phases equation 4 table 2 shows the mass load ng of the different classes of pcps and regulated compounds in the influent and effluent of this plant as well as their removal efficiencies the removal of fragrances the insect repellent deet and the antimicrobial triclosan tcs was poor 50 on average on the other hand most of the uv filters e g ehs hms 4 mbc ehmc etc were very efficiently removed 87 98 in agreement with previous reports balmer et al 2005 liu et al 2012a differential removal efficiencies for fragrances and uv filters the two most abundant components in wastewater explain the changes in the composition of effluents fig 1b compared to influents fig 1a other target compounds such as opfrs 71 and pahs 64 showed intermediate removal efficiencies a seasonal variation in the concentrations and or removal percentages of some classes of target pcps and regulated contaminants could be observed during the sampling campaign as shown in table 2 the highest influent loads for uv filters were found during the warmer months 1980 ng in summer and 3100 ng in spring in comparison with winter 652 ng and autumn 571 ng as an example the average mass load for oc in the first period was 3 4 times higher than in the second similarly the mass of the insect repellent deet in influent wastewater fluctuated between 57 ng in summer and negligible in winter the seasonal variation of both uv filters and deet was thus directly correlated to their consumption patterns as these chemicals are mostly applied in warmer periods due to the higher incidences of exposure to sunlight and to mosquito bites respectively fig s3a the loads of other target compounds such as fragrances between 1170 and 1790 ng were fairly constant during the sampling period reflecting a constant input as a consequence of their year round usage in laundry products and cosmetics fig s3b there were however changes in their average removal efficiencies between cold 0 4 and warm months 29 41 which suggests that their biological removal during wastewater treatment must be influenced by the temperature we hypothesize that due to the relatively high henry s law constants in the order of 10 4 atm m3 mol 1 of most synthetic fragrances volatilization might also play an important role in their removal during warmer periods 3 2 inefficient removal of target compounds in sludge during anaerobic digestion the concentrations of the detected compounds in sludge samples collected at the inlet and outlet of anaerobic digester at jerez de la frontera wwtp and their removal efficiencies are summarized in table 3 more detailed information is presented in tables s8 and s9 supporting information we found the same compounds in the sludge samples as in dissolved and particulate fractions of the wastewater samples except for deet which was not detected in any samples from the anaerobic digester possibly due to its relatively hydrophilic character log kow 2 02 on the contrary two other contaminants were found in sludge samples and not in wastewater samples indeno 1 2 3 cd pyrene and tehp both have the highest values for log kow 6 70 and 9 49 respectively among all the target contaminants the measured total concentrations of target compounds in sludge samples at the inlet were 41 2 Œºg g 1 on average with predominance of the synthetic fragrances up to 43 9 Œºg g 1 in february and at an average concentration of 26 1 Œºg g 1 followed by uv filters up to 19 4 Œºg g 1 in june and at an average concentration of 9 4 Œºg g 1 the remaining classes of target contaminants were always at levels below 2 Œºg g 1 on average regarding specific compounds galaxolide traseolide tonalide otne and oc were detected at higher concentrations than other pcps 13 2 3 4 2 5 6 0 and 3 9 Œºg g 1 on average respectively at the inlet of the anaerobic digester fig 1c in agreement with the results found in wastewater samples fig 1a and b tcs ehmc ehs and hms were present at intermediate concentrations between 1 and 2 Œºg g 1 and the rest of the detected compounds were found at levels below 1 Œºg g 1 on average the removal of target compounds during the anaerobic digestion of the sludge was poor as the total concentration in sludge samples ranged from 19 to 60 Œºg g 1 at the inlet and from 19 to 52 Œºg g 1 at the outlet the levels of most of the pcps and regulated compounds were similar before and after anaerobic digestion table 3 as a consequence the sludge samples at the outlet presented a similar composition compared to those at the inlet with galaxolide tonalide traseolide otne and oc identified as the predominant pcps with average concentrations between 2 3 and 12 0 Œºg g 1 fig 1d similar results were found by verlicchi and zambello 2015 where the highest levels up to 10 ng g 1 of galaxolide traseolide and tonalide were found in sludge before digestion only 4 out of the 32 compounds detected in sludge were efficiently eliminated 70 three uv filters ehs ehmc and bp 3 and one fragrance musk ketone or mk the information available on the anaerobic removal of pcps in sludge is still scarce and mostly related to fragrances but in general terms the removal efficiencies reported in table 3 are somewhat below those measured by other researchers for instance kupper et al 2006 reported that galaxolide tonalide celestolide phantolide and cashmeran were removed by 50 during sludge anaerobic digestion and slightly higher values 60 70 were reported by carballa et al 2006 during mesophilic and thermophilic digestion on the contrary and more in line with our findings clara et al 2011 observed very low or negligible degradation for galaxolide tonalide cashmerane celestolide phantolide and traesolide we also detected no removal for some other compounds such as celestolide fluoranthene benzo k fluoranthene chrysene and pcbs all of them highly hydrophobic table s7 tcs at 1980 ng g 1 and 1500 ng g 1 at the inlet and outlet of anaerobic digester respectively was also persistent in agreement with previous studies mcavoy et al 2002 karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 the strong sorption capacity of many of the studied contaminants and hence low bioavailability must also influence the biodegradation process some of the compounds that were effectively removed during anaerobic digestion such as bp 3 79 had the lowest log kow values 3 52 and their disappearance has been shown to occur under different reducing conditions liu et al 2012b similar to our findings in the wastewater treatment line a seasonal variation was observed for some classes of compounds during the 1 year sampling campaign in the anaerobic digester table 4 while opfrs and pahs showed similar levels throughout the year fragrances occurred at highest concentrations in winter fig s3b given that their concentration in wastewater samples was fairly stable within the sampling period table 2 maximum levels in sludge during colder months may be attributed to slower degradation processes by microbial activity on the other hand concentrations of uv filters in the sludge samples peaked during the warmest months summer and spring fig s3a for instance levels of individual compounds such as 4 mbc and ehs changed drastically in the inlet where they were found at 10 6 and 8 8 times higher in summer than in winter respectively see table s8 supporting information a similar seasonal pattern was previously discussed by nieto et al 2009 for oc for which they reported up to 0 7 Œºg g 1 in winter and 1 8 Œºg g 1 in summer as we stated previously these differences in concentrations from one season to another are directly related to their higher use during warm months 3 3 composting as an effective process to remove pcps from sludge fig 2 shows the concentrations of different classes of target compounds at five stages during the composting process more detailed information on individual contaminants can be found in table s10 supporting information overall all the detected compounds decreased their concentrations throughout the windrow composting resulting in a reduction of 97 at the end of the process 90 days windrow composting was thus much more efficient than anaerobic digestion in the wwtp for elimination of pcps and regulated contaminants the removal efficiencies for most classes of target compounds were virtually 100 except for fragrances 96 and pahs 99 the most recalcitrant substances were tonalide and benzo b fluoranthene having a removal efficiency of 87 other contaminants such as bp 3 were totally degraded during the spreading stage in step 2 or during the fermentation process in step 3 e g ehs hms 2 ehdp and tnbp were eliminated in the last step screening stage in total 23 out of 32 detected compounds were either not detected or found at concentrations below the limits of quantification of the method after the composting process and therefore were considered to be totally removed so far there are only a few studies such as those performed by poulsen and bester 2010 and sadef et al 2014 investigating the effect of composting on pcps and other emerging contaminants they are however limited to monitoring a few common organic micropollutants in sewage sludge e g bactericides flame retardants fragrances vulcanizers and plasticizers at the beginning and the end of the process the concentrations of all these micropollutants decreased during the composting process and degradation was higher than 75 for most of them after 24 days poulsen and bester 2010 regarding regulated compounds br√§ndli et al 2007 had previously reported that some congeners of pcbs and pahs were also removed during open windrow composting their results also revealed that degradation of persistent compounds or their transformation to different metabolites occurred faster under aerobic conditions more recently chen et al 2011 have confirmed the same fact by measuring conversion rates of tcs into methyl triclosan in sludge incubated in presence of oxygen poulsen and bester 2010 also identified the occurrence of the metabolite galaxolidone from galaxolide during composting therefore indicating microbial degradation overall the reduction in the concentrations of most of the parent pcps and regulated contaminants to levels below the limits of detection ensures their safe application in agricultural practices in our sampling area the identification possible persistence and ecotoxicity assessment of their transformation products however is still pending 3 4 occurrence of pcps in soils irrigated with treated wastewater fig 3 shows the vertical distribution profiles for total concentrations of target compounds in soils from jerez de la frontera wwtp taken in summer 2014 and winter and summer 2015 more detailed information on the concentrations of individual contaminants can be found in tables s11 s12 and s13 supporting information the measured total concentrations of pcps and regulated compounds in soil samples were between 172 and 1680 ng g 1 and fragrances were the predominant class reaching maximum concentrations of up to 1290 ng g 1 they were followed in abundance by uv filters maximum concentration 214 ng g 1 and pahs maximum concentration 281 ng g 1 while the insect repellent deet the antibacterial tcs and pcbs were present at lower concentrations from 0 1 to 2 5 ng g 1 regarding individual compounds we detected 30 out of 66 target chemicals belonging to different classes galaxolide otne and ehs were measured at relatively higher concentrations than other compounds 220 103 and 28 ng g 1 on average respectively the remaining target compounds detected were found at 10 ng g 1 on average all those pcps and regulated compounds detected in the receiving soils were also present in effluent wastewater confirming the direct influence of the treated wastewater used for irrigation on soil pollution their occurrence in soils was not only a consequence of them being relatively abundant in effluent wastewater e g fragrances but also related to their physico chemical properties e g high log kow values table s7 and those in the receiving soils e g organic carbon content table s1 enhancing the retention and or persistence of these contaminants in general terms the highest concentrations of all target compounds were found at the surface layer of the soil 20 cm except for tcs and deet which peaked at 40 cm depth in winter 2015 the prevalence of contaminants in the top of the soil was related to the direct contact of surface soil and wastewater during irrigation in addition the first soil layer 20 cm has the highest percentage of organic matter 0 9 which would enhance the sorption of organic chemicals as the soil column is not entirely homogeneous see table s1 for changes in texture and organic carbon content at every depth soil properties might also influence the transport of contaminants and their resulting vertical concentration profiles for instance fragrances were measured at the highest concentrations in the surface layer in both seasons winter and summer but a secondary maximum was detected at 60 cm in winter and summer 2015 this is the soil layer having higher content in silt clay 90 which might increase retardation of these compounds as they are transported towards deeper layers the leaching potential of these substances and other pcps is evident in fig 3 as all target compounds that were detected in soils except for acenaphthene were measured in samples up to 150 cm this is in agreement with previous results on the vertical distribution of pharmaceuticals in same sampling area which are more polar substances and therefore have a presumably higher leaching potential biel maeso et al 2018 corada fern√°ndez et al 2015 as with wastewater and sludge samples seasonal variation of concentration of different classes of contaminants was observed in soils regarding although it was not always in agreement with the data obtained from the wwtp overall and in spite of undergoing less irrigation using recycled wastewater during winter the highest concentrations for most target compounds in surface soil were found during the cold months average soil mean temperature 12 c see table s14 being between 697 and 1680 ng g 1 table s12 some contaminants such as musk ketone were only found in the winter period one possible explanation is that lower temperatures might minimize biodegradation processes compared to summer months when mean values of 24 c are often measured in the sampling site biel maeso et al 2018 highest concentrations during colder months and lowest values in summer were not only observed in the surface layer but also deeper in the soil column fig 3 these results suggest that removal of contaminants between 20 and 150 cm was fairly uniform and that biodegradation rates did not appreciable change with soil depth due changes in environmental conditions such as temperature ph moisture content and organic carbon colucci et al 2001 monteiro and boxall 2009 being minor table s1 regarding the distribution and behavior of each class of compounds in the soil column we observed different patterns while uv filters showed the highest maximum concentrations during summer and spring in the samples from the wwtp fig s3a they remained relatively constant in the soil despite the higher inputs from reclaimed wastewater during the warmer months fig s3c one possible explanation would be a higher rate of microbial degradation with increasing temperatures at that time of the year which would counteract the effect of higher uv filter inputs no losses due to volatilization are expected due to the low henry s constant for these chemicals up to 3 0 10 09 atm m3 mol 1 see table s7 a similar trend was also observed for deet on the contrary the concentrations of fragrances pcbs and opfrs in wastewater samples were fairly constant throughout the year fig s3b however lower concentrations were found in surface soil samples during warm months compared to colder months fig s3d as in the case of uv filters these findings could be related to their presumably higher microbial degradation rates at higher temperatures in addition to possible volatilization from soils based on henry s law constants for fragrances from 1 3 10 04 to 4 2 10 05 atm m3 mol 1 pcbs between 2 0 10 04 and 9 0 10 05 atm m3 mol 1 and opfrs between 5 4 10 05 and 3 3 10 06 atm m3 mol 1 all indicative of their semi volatile nature this explanation can also be extended to pahs some of which showed henry s law constants greater than 1 10 04 atm m3 mol 1 and which are frequently detected in the atmosphere zhang et al 2012 the concentrations of these regulated compounds as well as pcbs showed little variation over the sampling period and part of their presence due to atmospheric inputs e g vehicle traffic from adjacent roads cannot be discarded as confirmed in previous studies on persistent organic pollutants in soils from other regions armitage et al 2006 4 conclusions personal care products pcps of different classes were detected in both dissolved and particulate fractions in wastewater along with other persistent organic contaminants such as pahs a higher incidence was observed for uv filters in summer directly related to higher consumption during that period some target compounds were poorly removed during wastewater treatment particularly fragrances 21 due to their hydrophobic nature all compounds found in wastewater were also detected in the sludge except for deet a relatively polar insect repellent windrow composting seems an optimal strategy for further elimination of pcps 95 from sludge whereas anaerobic digestion proved inefficient the application of treated wastewater for irrigation of soils resulted on all the chemicals detected in the wwtp also occurring in this environmental compartment the measured total concentrations of pcps and regulated compounds in soil samples were up to 1680 ng g 1 with predominance of fragrances also major contaminants in effluent wastewater after continuous irrigation with reclaimed wastewater pcps were detected in the soil column up to 150 cm depth and often at significantly higher concentrations during winter compared to summer further research is needed to characterize the factors affecting the possible biodegradation and or volatilization of these contaminants of emerging concern from soils as well as laboratory experiments to fully determine their leaching potential although the presence of parent pcps in compost was negligible identification of potentially harmful metabolites formed during the composting process should be also assessed to guarantee their safe application in agricultural soils additionally the data presented here can provide useful information for future evaluation of the potential short and long term effects of pcps over terrestrial organisms through ecotoxicity tests as well as to improve management decisions on the application of treated wastewater and compost to land to reduce environmental exposure to these chemicals acknowledgements this study has been supported by project cgl2011 27349 and a fpi fellowship both funded by the spanish ministry of economy industry and competitiveness

restoration projects to enhance hyporheic exchange with flowpaths optimized to promote biological habitat water quantity and water quality improvements designing hzs for in stream treatment of stormwater a significant source of flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks requires assessment of both the hydrology and biogeochemical capacity for water quality improvement here we applied tracer tests and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to characterize an engineered hyporheic zone unit process called a hyporheic design element hde in the thornton creek watershed in seattle wa dye nacl and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate the hydraulic retention time hrt of hyporheic flowpaths we then compared water quality improvements across hydrologically linked surface and hyporheic flowpaths 3 5 m length 30 min to 3 h during baseflow and stormflow conditions we evaluated fate outcomes for 83 identified contaminants during stormflow including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon non target hrms analysis was used to assess holistic water quality improvements and evaluate attenuation mechanisms the data indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to surface flow and improved contaminant removal with longer hyporheic hrt for 1900 non target compounds

engineered hzs in stream restoration projects can promote ecosystem function by improving biological health habitat water quantity and quality hester and gooseff 2010 lawrence et al 2013 in terms of organic contaminants the potential for water quality improvement in natural hzs has been assessed by evaluating the fate of wastewater derived organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals kunkel and radke 2008 lewandowski et al 2011 lin et al 2006 perfluorinated chemicals hoehn et al 2007 pesticides huntscha et al 2013 and alkylphenols lin et al 2006 however urban stormwater contributes

govern hyporheic contaminant attenuation kunkel and radke 2011 mendoza lera and datry 2017 generally both laboratory and field experiments indicate that longer contact times with hz sediments i e longer hrts increase contaminant attenuation although half life estimates for specific chemicals vary widely e g 2 7 h vs 10 5 days for gemfibrozil kunkel and radke 2008 lin et al 2006 notably studies by lewandowski et al 2011 and hoehn et al 2007 indicated that little reach scale contaminant removal was attributable to hz flow because hyporheic exchange volumes were small relative to total surface flow and or hz hrts were too short relative to attenuation timescales respectively likewise traditional restoration drop structures such as cross vanes and low head dams are often ineffective for water quality improvement in part because they promote short hrts azinheira et al 2014 hester et al 2016 however engineered hzs can be designed as unit processes known as hyporheic design elements or hdes to increase hyporheic exchange lengthen flowpaths and provide longer residence times harvey et al 2013 herzog et al 2018 2016 potentially promoting water quality improvements quantifying contaminant attenuation within the hz is complicated by spatiotemporally dynamic hyporheic flow patterns reach scale approaches that use injections or ambient fluctuations of tracers to model solute retention runkel 1998 assume uniform stream and hyporheic zone characteristics e g velocity hyporheic cross sectional area in the direction of flow and are not appropriate to characterize engineered restoration structures with disparate hydraulic properties further reach scale models do not separate surface vs hyporheic hrt ward et al 2017 so they cannot differentiate between surface eddies above vs hyporheic flow beneath a restored drop structure in contrast current state of the art design to assess flowpath scale solute retention in the hz relies on pore water samplers and the assumption of 1d vertical flow knapp et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2011 posselt et al 2018 schaper et al 2018 however this approach cannot reliably assess water quality changes if flow fields are 2d or 3d where downwelling water may travel both downstream and laterally prior to upwelling instead the start and end of individual flowpaths must be identified to provide hydrologically linked downwelling influent and upwelling effluent samples although the value of monitoring individual hyporheic flowpaths is clear abbott et al 2016 krause et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2011 only one prior study monitored water quality changes along specific hz flowpaths by injecting and tracking several tracers using a piezometer array zarnetske et al 2011 however this method relied on fortuitous flow connections rather than installing piezometers after identifying linked downwelling and upwelling zones and has not been applied in restored or natural step pool type structures zarnetske et al 2011 thus a reliable and generalizable sampling approach to 3d hyporheic flow fields for water treatment evaluation is still needed with a suitable flowpath based sampling design water treatment performance assessments in engineered hzs should evaluate both the occurrence and fate of novel and emerging urban stormwater contaminants as well as incorporate holistic metrics of water quality accordingly the use of suspect and non target screening analyses via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms supports assessment of known targeted contaminants enables detection of unknown and unanticipated chemicals bade et al 2015a and provides a powerful statistically robust approach for more comprehensive evaluation of process performance bader et al 2016 n√ºrenberg et al 2015 such assessments can reduce biases among smaller numbers of targeted chemicals where similar chemical properties skew data outputs and are less representative of overall contaminant loads parry and young 2016 insight into treatment performance can be developed by evaluating the number of unique molecular formulas mceachran et al 2018 using mass defect and spectral similarity screening to identify transformation products and homologous series hollender et al 2017 scholl√©e et al 2018 or applying data clustering techniques to group chemicals by fate and identify indicators merel et al 2015 more importantly linking treatment outcomes to molecular characteristics e g polarity can assess the role of common removal mechanisms e g sorption on performance existing applications of hrms to evaluate treatment processes have used tentative formula and structure assignments to evaluate removal for specific contaminant classes parry and young 2016 and applied average m z and retention time to determine overall changes in contaminant characteristics scholl√©e et al 2018 however existing approaches have not further incorporated molecular characteristics to delineate and characterize attenuation mechanisms in this study we characterized both hydrology and water quality improvement in an engineered hyporheic zone in the thornton creek watershed in seattle wa to the best of our knowledge the thornton creek hdes are among the first direct hyporheic manipulations installed in any urban stream restoration in the u s restoration efforts were intended to address both water quantity and quality to guide water quality sampling non reactive tracers dye nacl and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate flowpath hrts we then evaluated the fate of a suite of urban stormwater contaminants including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch peter et al 2018 by sampling surface and hyporheic flowpaths during both baseflow and stormflow conditions expanding on previous data analysis strategies e g bader et al 2017 parry and young 2016 we used suspect and non target hrms data to evaluate the potential for water quality improvements in the hde and the role of hrt and sorption in contaminant attenuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site thornton creek is the largest 3000 ha and most urbanized watershed in

s4 summer baseflow in 2016 and 2017 was 30 40 l s whereas multiple winter storms generated peak flows 600 l s during a 2014 restoration of the kingfisher reach the creek was re meandered and reconnected to its floodplain a homogeneous streambed mixture coarse gravel to medium sand 1 2 5 m depth figure s1 was installed over the native substrate a relatively impermeable compacted till bakke 2018 many partially buried logs were added to the reach but no additional organic matter was incorporated into the streambed aggregate additionally six engineered hdes were constructed to optimize hyporheic exchange fluxes and residence times hdes use a channel spanning log to create a plunge pool appearing similar to low head dams at the surface but incorporate several novel subsurface features 1 an impermeable barrier extends 1 m below the channel spanning log capping the streambed for the first several meters of the plunge pool and 2 the hyporheic zone is excavated deeper than the rest of the reach and backfilled with high permeability coarse gravel fig 2 the first design feature induces longer hz flowpaths by preventing short circuiting flows beneath the log and the second increases the hz exchange capacity across the structure to increase the proportion of streamflow treated by the hz although fine sediments accumulate and scour seasonally in the kingfisher reach plunge pools the surface sediment remained coarse after restoration 75 of samples had 90 pebbles and cobbles while some finer sands accumulated in the subsurface 75 85 pebbles and cobbles figure s1 the hdes are each 4 6 m wide and 1 1 m deep across the channel but the same coarse fill material extends into both stream banks increasing the hde cross sectional area to 8 4 m2 we performed initial flowpath delineation and sampling in hde 5 in september 2017 fig 1 however the upwelling zone at hde 5 later shifted reducing the hrt therefore subsequent flowpath delineation and sampling efforts were moved to hde 4 40 m upstream of hde 5 in october 2017 to complement an existing piezometer array hobo u20s and u20ls onset computer corp bourne ma this array included 4 riparian piezometers that bracketed hde 4 upstream downstream and left right bank and in stream stilling wells upstream and downstream of the structure all wells were 3 8 cm diameter stainless steel with the stilling wells slotted throughout their length and the riparian wells screened at depths of 75 125 cm 2 2 flowpath delineation we characterized individual hyporheic flowpaths by a multistep approach to hydrologically link hyporheic flowpaths non toxic red food dye was injected into downwelling zones with exfiltration monitored visually to identify upwelling zones sampling infrastructure was then installed at upwelling locations and quantitative tracers nacl bromide were then used to connect sampling points and estimate hrt where possible electrical conductivity loggers were deployed over longer timescales to assess flowpath hydrology during multiple storm events at hde 5 dye was injected into piezometer p5 1 in the downwelling zone 2 5 m upstream from the channel spanning log screened 10 30 cm below the streambed at 15 min after injection dye emerged in a focused location 1 m downstream from the log in the center of the pool then developed in an arc shape toward the right bank over the next hour two sampling locations were selected from this upwelling region to provide relatively fast 5 1 and slow 5 2 flowpaths minimum flowpath lengths of 3 6 m for flowpath 5 1 and 3 1 m for flowpath 5 2 despite the longer hrt were calculated by assuming a direct line from the injection point average 20 cm depth to the bottom of the hde impermeable barrier and then to the upwelling location at hde 4 dye was injected into downwelling piezometer p4 1 2 75 m upstream from channel spanning log and subsequent upwelling spread from the center of the pool to the left bank two flowpaths

tracer tests informed by preliminary dye testing were used to confirm flowpath connectivity and quantify hrt seepage meters were purged at 40 ml min twice the planned sampling rate for 20 min to reduce dead volume to introduce a compact br pulse into the hyporheic flowpath a 1 l bromide solution 0 1 m br was rapidly injected into the downwelling well in hde 5 poured via funnel over 30 s in hde 4 pumped at 100 ml min then during continuous 20 ml min pumping from the downwelling and upwelling locations samples for br analysis were collected at 10 min intervals over 1 2 h in 50 ml polypropylene tubes the slow sampling pump rate was selected based on approximate hz flow rates measured via volumetric bag fill rates to ensure that pumping did not artificially impact hz transport rates or hydraulics bromide testing at hde 5 was performed over 1 h after dye tests on september 13 2017 at hde 4 bromide testing was performed over 2 h immediately after water sample collection

analysis a calibration standard within the observed concentration range was re analyzed every 4 samples with any shift in the voltage used to correct measurements in real samples in hde 4 a nacl tracer was also injected into the downwelling well monitored as electrical conductivity at 1 000x background to evaluate turnover rates in upwelling seepage meters on october 23 and 24 2017 the downwelling well sample represented the injection solution rather than the resulting diluted concentration of the tracer labeled hyporheic water given the uniformity of the streambed aggregate and relative impermeability of the underlying native sediment we considered tracer presence absence appropriate to establish hydrologic connectivity rather than fitting the breakthrough curves with an advection dispersion model our approach assumed that any dispersion along the hyporheic flowpath represented mixing with comparable parcels of hyporheic water rather than dilution with clean groundwater electrical conductivity loggers deployed in the hde 4 seepage meters also logged ambient specific conductivity every 3 min from october 23 to december 2 2017 capturing several distinct

and discussion 3 1 hyporheic flowpath delineation 3 1 1 hde 5 results of tracer testing are summarized in table s2 dye tracer tests in hde 5 indicated a 20 30 min hrt in the hz for the bulk of the flow flowpath 5 1 fig 1b and detected a slower secondary flowpath 5 2 with an average hrt of 30 60 min likely due to finer sediments deposited sand silt at the 5 2 upwelling location repeated dye tests consistently produced similar outcomes indicating simple dye tests can quickly delineate hz flowpath connectivity the flowpath 5 1 seepage meter produced an upwelling flow rate of 1 2 l in 30 min areal flux 240 ml m 2 min 1 the flowpath 5 2 piezometer p5 2 produced 5 ml min areal flux 17 ml m 2 min 1 these distinct flux rates indicate considerable spatial heterogeneity across the hde the observed hrts and flux rates indicated that without pumping seepage meter 5 1 and p5 2 required 6 and 1 h respectively to fully equilibrate with upwelling hyporheic water subsequent bromide tracer tests at hde 5 failed to improve the accuracy of our hrt estimates for these flowpaths injection concentrations may have been too low or breakthrough not monitored over an appropriate time interval given the slow turnover rate of the seepage meter unfortunately the bromide electrode used for on line monitoring malfunctioned preventing on site correction however the baseflow samples are linked qualitatively with hrts estimated via dye tracer and the close alignment 1 day of dye testing and water quality sampling provided substantial confidence in the flowpath linkage given steady state conditions dye tests in hde 5 one month later october 20 2017 in preparation for storm sampling revealed extensive lateral shifts in the hyporheic flow field as dye exited the hz 3 m from seepage meter 5 1 at hrt 10 min consistent with prior observations of focused lateral inflows at hde 5 during the wet season hyporheic flowpaths are expected to shift seasonally as the hyporheic zone is compressed by rising riparian water tables by visual observation 20 30 cm of fine sediment had deposited over the hde 5 seepage meters also contributing to altered hydraulics these conditions especially the shorter hrt redirected our sampling efforts to hde 4 3 1 2 hde 4 for the surface flowpath in hde 4 from the downwelling well to the surface above the upwelling zone we visually estimated a 1 min hrt two hyporheic flowpaths with hrts of 30 and 40 min flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 respectively were delineated by dye testing fig 1c the observed hyporheic flow direction generally from river right above hde 4 towards river left below was reasonable in light of similar head gradients observed in the lateral right to left and downstream directions fig s2 in flowpath 4 1 after seepage meter installation the nacl tracer injection hrt 32 min fig s6 and ambient specific conductivity from two late october storms hrt 30 60 min fig s7 validated this estimate during bromide testing november 12 2017 three weeks after dye testing bromide breakthrough 10x background first occurred in flowpath 4 1 at 80 min fig s8 ambient conductivity data from six early november storms also reflected this longer hrt with an 86 13 min lag time between the start of the reach and seepage meter 4 1 fig s7 similar changes occurred in flowpath 4 2 although bromide tracer data were complicated by the too short 2 h tracer sampling design nacl tracer and ambient storm conductivity data indicated the 4 2 flowpath was still hydrologically linked to downwelling surface water during water sampling the nacl tracer data fig s6 in flowpath 4 2 showed an attenuated specific conductivity spike 10 of max in 4 1 at 195 min after the max peak in 4 1 indicating an hrt of 3 75 h this offset relative to flowpath 4 1 aligned with the 140 42 min offset observed during ambient specific conductivity storm peaks during late october and early november the increased hrt estimates in subsurface flowpaths suggested slower hz water velocities during fall storm events e g from reduced head drop across the hde clogging of upwelling zones by fine sediments mobilized during storms water elevations from stilling wells bracketing hde 4 showed 21 decreases in downstream head drop and similar decreases across lateral gradients during the november 12 2017 storm fig s2 which would reduce hyporheic flow velocities correspondingly in addition to shifting hydraulics seepage meter installation may partially cap the hz forcing hyporheic flow to slow and or partially re direct around the seepage meters given the dramatic increase in hrt for flowpath 4 2 we hypothesize that seepage meter 4 2 had slower rates of upwelling and thus equilibration than 4 1 artificially increasing hrt to mitigate this possibility we recommend the use of sampling equipment that minimizes internal volumes and maximizes flow e g piezometers effectively capturing area and time integrated volumetric samples from linked upwelling or downwelling zones remains a substantial technical challenge in these dynamic systems while the multi tracer hydraulic sampling approach was effective experiments should be carefully adapted to the site conditions and updated in close to real time to ensure that collected data are accurate and fit to purpose overall the tracer detections in flowpath 4 1 delineated hydrologic connectivity between downwelling and upwelling locations for subsequent water quality sampling while the flowpath 4 2 linkage and hrt estimate are less certain many contaminant peaks exhibited conservative behavior see section 3 3 supporting our assumption that upwelling samples were not meaningfully diluted by groundwater instead the unlabeled upwelling water is assumed to be other hyporheic water of comparable residence time and influent quality this assumption is reasonable in the homogeneous coarse fill in these hdes vs a natural heterogeneous hz and the relatively impermeable underlying sediment compacted till thus despite uncertainty in exact hrts comparison between short and long hrt in hde 4 derived from dye and nacl studies and distance flowpath 4 2 was further downstream was appropriate 3 1 3 hyporheic flow as a fraction of streamflow based on the most constrained hrt estimate 32 min in flowpath 4 1 a head drop of 0 33 m over 4 25 m in the longitudinal direction dh dx 0 078 a 4 4 m 3d hyporheic flowpath v 0 0023 m s and assumed 30 porosity darcy s law yields a hydraulic conductivity k of 0 009 m s in line with typical rates for gravel fetter 2001 applying these data uniformly across the hde cross sectional area a 5 9 l s total hyporheic flux was estimated in each hde 35 l s across all six hdes although the streambed aggregate is uniform along the study reach this flux estimate is based on a single relatively fast flowpath and does not account for seasonal fine sediment deposits or reductions in head drop thus it is an upper limit most relevant to baseflow conditions notably the total hyporheic flux is quite similar to the 2016 2017 baseflow indicating near equivalent volumes of surface water and hz flow through the six hdes this estimate highlights the relevance of the engineered hdes for reach scale water quality especially for seasonal first flush events in 2017 the first four fall storms prior to the october 2017 tracer test generated discharges of 57 172 l s therefore we estimate 20 60 of these first flush events were likely to have passed through the engineered hdes of course the hde flow capacity would represent a much smaller fraction of overall stream flow during larger winter storms due to increases in surface discharge and lateral groundwater inflows treating the entirety of such flows may not be practical with in stream methods although this also depends on the length of restored reach the above flow fraction calculation does not include the several hundred meters of additional restored hyporheic zone in the reach beyond the six hdes 3 2 chemical identification we detected 1900 individual non target compounds during stormflow in hde 4 while only 320 non target compounds were detected during baseflow conditions in hde 5 in the hde 4 stormwater 83 were identified at a confidence of s2b as contaminants that are 1 commonly detected in urban waters 2 linked to specific sources e g roadway runoff residential areas and or 3 structurally related to chemicals strongly correlated with an urban stormwater linked coho salmon acute mortality syndrome mcintyre et al 2018 peter et al 2018 scholz et al 2011 of those 27 were detected during baseflow conditions although at peak areas consistently lower 2 90 fold than those observed during stormflow the identified contaminants were grouped by structure and or sources table s3 and peak area indicating relative abundance in the hde 4 downwelling well fig 3 a several organophosphates and pesticides that are pervasive anthropogenic indicators in urban watersheds bradley et al 2017 were detected in particular tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp s2a and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep s1 190 ng l used as flame retardants and paint additives are known endocrine disruptors and reproductive toxicants meeker and stapleton 2010 van der veen and de boer 2012 and were quite abundant peak areas 106 during stormflow during baseflow conditions tcpp and tboep were again among the largest peak area detections albeit at 8 fold lower abundance 3 105 cotinine a nicotine metabolite diuron an herbicide and booster biocide and deet an insect repellent were each detected s1 in stormflow at 10 ng l while only deet was detected during baseflow conditions 5 ng l several contaminants from vehicles and roadway runoff were detected including the commonly observed corrosion inhibitor 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole s1 160 ng l stormflow 70 ng l baseflow lefevre et al 2015 other vehicle derived contaminants all 9 ng l during baseflow included 1 3 diphenylguanidine s1 125 ng l in stormflow 1 3 dicyclohexylurea s1 60 ng l 1 cyclohexyl 3 phenylurea s1 65 ng l n methyl dicyclohexylamine s1 2 ng l n cyclohexyl benzothiazolamine s1 3 ng l dicyclohexylamine s2a and 1 3 diphenylurea s2a which are used in tire rubber manufacturing or are reaction by products wik and dave 2009 hexa methoxymethyl melamine hmmm s1 150 ng l stormflow 4 ng l baseflow and its structural family leach from tire rubbers and are one of the most abundant high peak area and detection frequency organic contaminants detected in road runoff and urban receiving waters such as thornton creek peter et al 2018 the significantly elevated peak areas observed during storm events suggest these roadway related contaminants are potentially useful as stormwater specific indicators eight homologous series of poly propylene glycols ppgs poly ethylene glycols pegs and octylphenol ethoxylates opeos 60 contaminants in total were identified in the hde 4 stormflow glycols are widely used in antifreeze personal care products and polymer formulations and are degradation products of non ionic surfactants such as opeos which are pervasive in aquatic environments ferguson et al 2001 gonz√°lez et al 2007 the peg series consisted of saturated pegs c2n 2h4n 2on n 17 18 21 23 s1 peg dimethyl ethers c2nh4n 2on n 4 7 s1 peg monomethyl ethers c2n 1h4non n 4 15 s1 and peg monobutyl ethers c2n 2h4n 6on n 5 6 s2b detected opeos had formulas c14h22o c2nh4non n 8 16 s1 the ppg series consisted of saturated ppgs c3n 3h6n 4on n 5 18 s1 and two mono unsaturated ppgs c3n 3h6n 6on n 6 16 s2b and c3n 6h6n 12on n 8 13 s2b while long chain surfactants are commonly detected in wastewater and hydraulic fracking waters schymanski et al 2014b thurman et al 2017 this is among the first reports of long chain ppgs in surface waters linked to urban runoff notably the saturated ppgs were among the most abundant compounds present in the hde 4 surface water comprising 14 of total peak area and 42 of peak area for identified compounds with an additional 5 and 14 of total and identified peak area respectively attributed to unsaturated ppgs by comparison to available technical standards using total peak area we estimate 40 ng l opeo 70 ng l peg 45 ng l peg dimethyl ether 35 ng l peg monomethyl ether and 700 ng l ppg in hde 4 during stormflow in contrast only 7 glycols ethoxylates were detected 4 members in any series during baseflow conditions at 8 fold lower peak areas relative to stormflow thus the glycol and ethoxylate families also represent potential surrogates indicators for urban pollution among the identified contaminants in stormflow 27 overlap with a coho mortality chemical signature reflecting urban pollution peter et al 2018 in hde 5 during baseflow 39 22 compounds total peak area 1 7 106 of the mortality signature both identified and unidentified compounds was detected in the downwelling water in hde 4 during stormflow and consistent with our expectation of increased coho mortality risk during storms in urbanized creeks 86 of the mortality signature 50 non target compounds total peak area 9 107 was detected 3 3 water quality assessment to assess potential water quality improvement we evaluated the hdes as a set of paired in stream reactors with two possible flowpaths that reflect the two potential treatment outcomes that may impact water quality in this reach 1 surface attenuation represented by surface flow immediately above the hyporheic paths or 2 hz treatment via flow through the subsurface hde at varying hrts fig 2 we note that due to mixing of surface water and upwelling hyporheic water in the plunge pool turnover time of several to tens of minutes somewhat more attenuation in the sampled surface flowpath relative to a hydraulically isolated 1 min surface flowpath can be expected although attenuation via mechanisms such as photolysis or sorption were not anticipated to be significant over such short timescales a visual comparison between the hde 4 influent and effluents is shown in fig s9 where a substantial reduction in turbidity was evident after transport through the hyporheic flowpaths we assessed water quality using both a traditional analysis focused on targeted analytes within the hrms data and a complementary analysis focused on non target data both approaches evaluated the fate of stormwater derived contaminants along hydraulically paired surface and hyporheic flowpaths the non target hrms data were used to assess treatment performance more broadly and evaluate the role of sorption based attenuation mechanisms in contaminant attenuation on a practical note while the benefit of hrms analysis is the simultaneous detection of many contaminants it is not typically feasible to acquire all relevant standards even when pure standards are available and quantify all detected contaminants therefore water quality is typically compared on the basis of peak area reduction equation 1 n√ºrenberg et al 2015 parry and young 2016 peak area comparison may over or underestimate removal relative to the use of concentration e g due to matrix enhancement or suppression but provides relative comparisons across contaminants and flowpaths 3 3 1 removal of identified compounds we first evaluated the fate of the 83 identified contaminants in thornton creek fig 3b overall consistently higher removal occurred in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 relative to the paired surface flowpath for example the long chain glycols and opeos were removed 38 during surface flow in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 removals increased by 47 20 for ppgs to 37 100 removal by 75 5 for opeos 71 78 removal and by 55 29 for pegs 51 100 removal during baseflow conditions ppgs were better removed via hyporheic flowpath 5 1 65 100 relative to surface flow 14 23 table s3 similarly the organophosphates persisted during surface flow 15 removal while moderate removal 26 57 occurred along flowpath 4 1 for vehicle and roadway derived contaminants removals 35 occurred during surface flow with the exception of the hmmm family and 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole removals in flowpath 4 1 40 100 were 40 18 higher than during surface flow increased removals at the longer hrt of flowpath 4 2 relative to flowpath 4 1 were evident indicating that longer hz residence time contributed to contaminant attenuation and improved water quality fig 3 additional removal of the glycols and ethoxylates occurred with longer hyporheic flow with removals exceeding 80 and often 95 for all ppgs pegs and opeos in flowpath 4 2 representing an increase of 22 16 relative to flowpath 4 1 removal of the organophosphates also was 37 6 higher in flowpath 4 2 70 90 removal than in flowpath 4 1 removal of 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole and the hmmm family compounds excepting the most polar and persistent members tetra and penta mmm was 31 3 higher in flowpath 4 2 than in flowpath 4 1 for all other roadway associated contaminants removals exceeded 70 in flowpath 4 2 an increase of 23 11 relative to flowpath 4 1 based on the substantial peak areas of the identified contaminants in the hde 4 stormflow their effective attenuation in the hz contributes significantly to reduction in anthropogenic contaminant loads to downstream reaches assuming 20 60 of stormflow passes through the series of hdes see section 3 1 3 the observed removals for all identified contaminants corresponds to a net 15 50 reduction in the total load of these contaminants observed removal of the coho mortality signature mirrored overall trends in the removal of identified contaminants in hde 4 stormflow and hde 5 baseflow only 20 of the signature peak area detected in the downwelling well was removed during surface flow one compound removed completely in contrast flow through hyporheic flowpath 5 1 yielded a 51 reduction in signature peak area two compounds removed completely likewise signature peak area reductions of 55 and 84 occurred in flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 respectively with 6 and 15 compounds removed completely thus hyporheic flow particularly at longer hrt reduced the number and peak area of compounds correlated to the mortality phenomenon although ongoing studies are assessing the potential for mortality signature outcomes to reflect actual reductions in risk to aquatic organisms 3 3 2 assessment of treatment performance with non target compounds after evaluating individual chemicals the entire non target dataset was used to assess treatment performance we compared non target compound peak area equation 1 to estimate removal outcomes in paired samples and applied predicted logk ow characteristics to evaluate the potential contribution of sorption to attenuation in the hz one metric of treatment performance is the total number of non target compounds fig s10 in hde 4 during stormflow 1198 compounds were detected while 4 fewer compounds were detected in downstream surface flow 23 and 52 fewer compounds were detected after hyporheic flow at short flowpath 4 1 and long hrt flowpath 4 2 respectively in hde 5 during baseflow 320 non target compounds were detected in the downwelling well in the downstream sample 15 fewer compounds were observed vs 35 fewer compounds in flowpath 5 1 residual dye detected in flowpath 5 2 during this event precluded non target analysis of flowpath 5 2 data overall enhanced removal was evident for hyporheic vs surface flow and fewer compounds were detected as hyporheic hrt increased per bader et al 2016 we grouped removal outcomes into defined intervals to categorize non target compound fate notably bader et al 2016 used peak height as a surrogate for concentration our use of peak area is conceptually similar but accounts for peak shape variability across different matrices and analytical runs the intervals describe possible outcomes for extent of peak area removal formation r 500 increase 500 r 200 consistent 200 r 50 decrease 50 r 80 and elimination r 80 formation and increase represent compounds that are newly detected during treatment e g leaching transformation products while decrease and elimination represent compounds removed from the aqueous phase the broad range for consistent is intended to compensate for possible peak area variations derived from matrix effects e g matrix suppression and enhancement as well as small changes in compound concentration n√ºrenberg et al 2015 the reported range for consistent was validated by spiking 12 isotopically labeled internal standards into process influent and effluent waters fig s11 bader et al 2016 the ratio of effluent influent peak area ranged from 0 80 to 1 32 75 of pairs within 0 85 1 15 indicating 1 peak area comparisons to assess removal are appropriate with consistent matrix bias expected throughout the treatment train li et al 2018 and 2 the reported interval categories should be broadly applicable across surface waters and similar matrices results of this analysis are shown for stormflow fig 4 a and baseflow fig 4b for both most non target compounds in the downstream surface flowpath shown in gray were consistent i e no clear attenuation relative to surface flow hyporheic flow shown in blue green drove more compounds to the decrease and elimination categories notably in hde 4 stormflow the impact of hrt on removal was clear in flowpath 4 1 shorter hrt 24 of non target compounds decreased in peak area 50 r 80 and 35 were eliminated r 80 in flowpath 4 2 longer hrt 9 of compounds decreased while 69 were eliminated longer hyporheic hrt clearly enhanced contaminant attenuation in hde 4 13 of total non target compounds in each flowpath were only detected downstream i e formation interval fig 4a these new compounds could arise from transformation of influent compounds or leaching a few new detections are probably analytical artifacts not captured by controls for example several poly caprolactam compounds detected only in the hde 4 upwelling samples likely leached from seepage meter materials caprolactam is a monomer of nylon 6 while we did not conclusively detect a parent product pair we anticipate that many other new compounds are transformation products for example detection s2b of short chain pegs di and triethylene glycol nonyl ether c13h28o3 rt 11 93 min c15h32o4 rt 12 1 min fig s12 3 3 3 assessing sorption potential with non target data based on the relatively short hrt of the hz flowpaths and previously observed organic micropollutant fate in hzs ding et al 1999 lin et al 2006 hydrophobic sorption e g to accumulated organic matter and subsurface biofilms is expected to be a dominant removal mechanism without conclusively identifying each non target detection the contribution of sorption to attenuation was evaluated by using instrument rt to predict octanol water partitioning coefficients logk ow bade et al 2015b nurmi et al 2012 via a previously established correlation built with 260 pure standards fig s13 from du et al 2017 this approach relies on the statistical power of the hundreds thousands of detected compounds to overcome expected uncertainties and errors arising from assignation of chemical characteristics to unidentified compounds while some will be outliers from the logk ow prediction e g ionizable compounds this approach supports evaluation of broader system trends and attenuation mechanisms using the extensive non target dataset although more advanced modeling approaches e g artificial neural networks quantitative structure retention time relationships can improve the accuracy of logk ow prediction bade et al 2015a barron and mceneff 2016 the simple linear correlation remains an effective predictor for example bade et al 2015b demonstrated that for 95 of 595 pesticides and pharmaceuticals actual rt was within 4 min of the prediction and for a 345 point pesticide only regression 79 were within 2 min of the prediction similarly for our regression actual and predicted rt were within 2 and 4 min for 78 and 96 of compounds respectively to depict removal trends as a function of predicted sorption potential for the different flowpaths we compared relative removal performance using scatterplots hde 4 stormflow data in fig 5 hde 5 baseflow data in fig s14 via parry and young 2016 the 1 1 line indicates identical removal in the two flowpaths while compounds above the 1 1 line were more effectively removed during hyporheic flow than surface flow and vice versa a second visualization approach not described previously supports a statistical comparison across logk ow ranges and treatment types this approach used box plots to evaluate removal as a function of estimated logk ow with median removals extracted as a single point comparison of removal performance across logk ow ranges hde 4 in fig 6 hde 5 in fig s15 both approaches indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to limited removal during surface flow and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed attenuation in the scatterplots figs 5 and s16 more polar compounds estimated logk ow 3 blue and green primarily lay along the 1 1 line at removals 50 while more hydrophobic compounds estimated logk ow 3 yellow and red clearly exhibited much higher removal along hyporheic flowpaths in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 as logk ow increased the distribution visibly shifted towards elimination fig 5a indicating the hz was increasingly effective for removal of more hydrophobic compounds particularly during stormflow this trend was even more apparent in the longer hrt hyporheic flowpath 4 2 fig 5b non target detections in all logk ow ranges exhibited greater removal in hz flow than surface flow and nearly all detections with logk ow 5 in red exhibited near 100 removal in hyporheic flow clusters along the top edge of the plot thus by comparison to the shorter hyporheic flowpath increasing hrt in the hz promoted enhanced removal of more hydrophobic compounds and was especially important for increased removal of polar compounds these trends were reflected by the removal of identified compounds described above scatterplots for the 83 identified compounds provided in fig s16 for example removal of the polar 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole logk ow 1 8 was similar in surface flow and flowpath 4 1 33 and 32 respectively but increased to 61 in flowpath 4 2 the organophosphates exemplify trends observed in hde 4 for non polar compounds removals of tboep logk ow 3 75 and triphenyl phosphate logk ow 4 59 increased from 12 and 7 respectively during surface flow to 55 and 57 respectively in flowpath 4 1 with even higher removal 90 for both in flowpath 4 2 in the boxplots fig 6 s15 two statistically significant trends were apparent in the data 1 increasing removal with compound hydrophobicity in flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 dunn s test p 0 01 for all comparisons except logk ow 1 3 vs 3 5 in flowpath 4 1 p 0 41 and logk ow 1 vs 1 3 in flowpath 4 2 p 0 36 and 2 increasing removal with hyporheic hrt dunn s test p 0 01 for all comparisons except removal in surface flow vs flowpath 4 1 at logk ow 1 thus sorption to immobile geomedia biofilms and organic matter phases was a dominant removal mechanism in the hz however we observed more variability in removal performance within the lower logk ow ranges this is consistent with the potential for additional molecular characteristics e g functional groups ionizability and removal mechanisms e g electrostatic interactions to govern the fate outcomes of more polar compounds schaffer et al 2012 t√ºlp et al 2009 3 3 4 relevance for hyporheic restoration identifying and sampling hydrologically paired downwelling and upwelling locations in the hz is challenging but is needed to quantify the treatment capabilities of the restored hz variability in the hyporheic residence times of individual flowpaths observed during timescales of days to weeks were attributed to both the changing water table during storm events siltation and artificial flowpath alterations caused by seepage meter installation although longer term studies are needed to fully evaluate these phenomena in the kingfisher hdes a few meters in length 0 5 3 h hrt we observed 50 attenuation of hundreds of organic stormwater contaminants the data also indicated increasing contaminant removal efficiency with longer hyporheic hrt and that hydrophobic sorption processes to geomedia and organic matter phases are key contributors to rapid water quality improvement in hdes although contaminants may degrade microbially over longer timescales after sorption this requires further investigation while these results are specific to a subset of emerging organic contaminants we anticipate that hdes also attenuate other regulated pollutants e g nutrients pathogens metals at the reach scale we estimated that the six kingfisher hdes can treat a water volume similar to the total surface discharge during summer baseflow and early hydrograph first flush fall storm events the kingfisher hdes have several novel design features to lengthen hrt but further improvements e g longer caps lateral groundwater seals could improve treatment performance and reliability of water quality monitoring while the potential for water quality improvement within individual hdes is clear the primary technical challenge for these systems is hydraulic promoting the passage of sufficient volumes through hdes while maintaining adequate contact times with biofilms and media to meaningfully improve reach scale water quality particularly during storm events that reduce the head drop across the hde while introducing significant contaminant loads future work should include longer term studies to assess the repeatability of hz performance over time and should optimize hyporheic exchange to meet reach scale water quality goals with hrt matched to contaminant attenuation timescales further the hde subsurface media could be amended with specific sorbents e g biochar to improve attenuation of high priority contaminants thereby allowing higher throughput rates to provide proportionally larger reductions in the contaminant load continued research is needed to develop effective and reliable options for in stream treatment of surface waters via hz engineering to promote high quality and healthy urban freshwater ecosystems 4 conclusions linked hyporheic flowpaths were identified for subsequent water quality sampling in an engineered hyporheic design element using dye nacl and bromide tracer tests hydraulic retention times in the sampled hz ranged from 30 min to 3 h over 3 5 m hyporheic travel removal data for non target compounds across surface and hyporheic flowpaths including identified compounds linked to vehicle roadway sources and a coho mortality chemical signature demonstrated that hyporheic flow attenuates hundreds of organic compounds particularly at longer hrt thus improving water quality relative to surface transport non target hrms data can assess holistic water quality improvements using metrics such as total number and total peak area to describe overall system trends additionally non target compound hydrophobicity estimated via rt logk ow relationships can be used to evaluate the potential contributions of hydrophobic sorption to attenuation during both baseflow and stormflow the hz is increasingly effective for removal of increasingly hydrophobic compounds indicating that sorption is a dominant removal mechanism longer hydraulic retention times promote compound removal particularly for more polar compounds declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was

19104,the hyporheic zone hz located at the interface of surface and groundwater is a natural bioreactor for attenuation of chemical contaminants engineered hzs can be incorporated into stream restoration projects to enhance hyporheic exchange with flowpaths optimized to promote biological habitat water quantity and water quality improvements designing hzs for in stream treatment of stormwater a significant source of flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks requires assessment of both the hydrology and biogeochemical capacity for water quality improvement here we applied tracer tests and high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to characterize an engineered hyporheic zone unit process called a hyporheic design element hde in the thornton creek watershed in seattle wa dye nacl and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate the hydraulic retention time hrt of hyporheic flowpaths we then compared water quality improvements across hydrologically linked surface and hyporheic flowpaths 3 5 m length 30 min to 3 h during baseflow and stormflow conditions we evaluated fate outcomes for 83 identified contaminants during stormflow including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon non target hrms analysis was used to assess holistic water quality improvements and evaluate attenuation mechanisms the data indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to surface flow and improved contaminant removal with longer hyporheic hrt for 1900 non target compounds detected during stormflow 17 were attenuated 50 via surface flow vs 59 and 78 via short and long hyporheic residence times respectively and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed contaminant attenuation graphical abstract image 1 keywords non target analysis suspect screening urban stream restoration stormwater treatment hyporheic zone sorption 1 introduction the hyporheic zone hz the interface of surface water and groundwater exchange in a lotic system has been described as the river s liver fischer et al 2005 because it is a natural bioreactor for chemical contaminants huntscha et al 2013 lewandowski et al 2011 however hydromodification of urban streams increases scour reducing hz exchange and attenuation potential lawrence et al 2013 including engineered hzs in stream restoration projects can promote ecosystem function by improving biological health habitat water quantity and quality hester and gooseff 2010 lawrence et al 2013 in terms of organic contaminants the potential for water quality improvement in natural hzs has been assessed by evaluating the fate of wastewater derived organic contaminants such as pharmaceuticals kunkel and radke 2008 lewandowski et al 2011 lin et al 2006 perfluorinated chemicals hoehn et al 2007 pesticides huntscha et al 2013 and alkylphenols lin et al 2006 however urban stormwater contributes substantial flow and contaminant loads to urban creeks including many contaminants distinct from those above grebel et al 2013 importantly engineered hzs can treat non point source pollution in stream eliminating the need for side stream treatment options and land in space limited urban environments in the hz hydraulic residence time hrt distributions mass transfer rates and microbial abundance govern hyporheic contaminant attenuation kunkel and radke 2011 mendoza lera and datry 2017 generally both laboratory and field experiments indicate that longer contact times with hz sediments i e longer hrts increase contaminant attenuation although half life estimates for specific chemicals vary widely e g 2 7 h vs 10 5 days for gemfibrozil kunkel and radke 2008 lin et al 2006 notably studies by lewandowski et al 2011 and hoehn et al 2007 indicated that little reach scale contaminant removal was attributable to hz flow because hyporheic exchange volumes were small relative to total surface flow and or hz hrts were too short relative to attenuation timescales respectively likewise traditional restoration drop structures such as cross vanes and low head dams are often ineffective for water quality improvement in part because they promote short hrts azinheira et al 2014 hester et al 2016 however engineered hzs can be designed as unit processes known as hyporheic design elements or hdes to increase hyporheic exchange lengthen flowpaths and provide longer residence times harvey et al 2013 herzog et al 2018 2016 potentially promoting water quality improvements quantifying contaminant attenuation within the hz is complicated by spatiotemporally dynamic hyporheic flow patterns reach scale approaches that use injections or ambient fluctuations of tracers to model solute retention runkel 1998 assume uniform stream and hyporheic zone characteristics e g velocity hyporheic cross sectional area in the direction of flow and are not appropriate to characterize engineered restoration structures with disparate hydraulic properties further reach scale models do not separate surface vs hyporheic hrt ward et al 2017 so they cannot differentiate between surface eddies above vs hyporheic flow beneath a restored drop structure in contrast current state of the art design to assess flowpath scale solute retention in the hz relies on pore water samplers and the assumption of 1d vertical flow knapp et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2011 posselt et al 2018 schaper et al 2018 however this approach cannot reliably assess water quality changes if flow fields are 2d or 3d where downwelling water may travel both downstream and laterally prior to upwelling instead the start and end of individual flowpaths must be identified to provide hydrologically linked downwelling influent and upwelling effluent samples although the value of monitoring individual hyporheic flowpaths is clear abbott et al 2016 krause et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2011 only one prior study monitored water quality changes along specific hz flowpaths by injecting and tracking several tracers using a piezometer array zarnetske et al 2011 however this method relied on fortuitous flow connections rather than installing piezometers after identifying linked downwelling and upwelling zones and has not been applied in restored or natural step pool type structures zarnetske et al 2011 thus a reliable and generalizable sampling approach to 3d hyporheic flow fields for water treatment evaluation is still needed with a suitable flowpath based sampling design water treatment performance assessments in engineered hzs should evaluate both the occurrence and fate of novel and emerging urban stormwater contaminants as well as incorporate holistic metrics of water quality accordingly the use of suspect and non target screening analyses via high resolution mass spectrometry hrms supports assessment of known targeted contaminants enables detection of unknown and unanticipated chemicals bade et al 2015a and provides a powerful statistically robust approach for more comprehensive evaluation of process performance bader et al 2016 n√ºrenberg et al 2015 such assessments can reduce biases among smaller numbers of targeted chemicals where similar chemical properties skew data outputs and are less representative of overall contaminant loads parry and young 2016 insight into treatment performance can be developed by evaluating the number of unique molecular formulas mceachran et al 2018 using mass defect and spectral similarity screening to identify transformation products and homologous series hollender et al 2017 scholl√©e et al 2018 or applying data clustering techniques to group chemicals by fate and identify indicators merel et al 2015 more importantly linking treatment outcomes to molecular characteristics e g polarity can assess the role of common removal mechanisms e g sorption on performance existing applications of hrms to evaluate treatment processes have used tentative formula and structure assignments to evaluate removal for specific contaminant classes parry and young 2016 and applied average m z and retention time to determine overall changes in contaminant characteristics scholl√©e et al 2018 however existing approaches have not further incorporated molecular characteristics to delineate and characterize attenuation mechanisms in this study we characterized both hydrology and water quality improvement in an engineered hyporheic zone in the thornton creek watershed in seattle wa to the best of our knowledge the thornton creek hdes are among the first direct hyporheic manipulations installed in any urban stream restoration in the u s restoration efforts were intended to address both water quantity and quality to guide water quality sampling non reactive tracers dye nacl and bromide were used to hydrologically link downwelling and upwelling zones and estimate flowpath hrts we then evaluated the fate of a suite of urban stormwater contaminants including those correlated with an urban runoff mortality syndrome in coho salmon oncorhynchus kisutch peter et al 2018 by sampling surface and hyporheic flowpaths during both baseflow and stormflow conditions expanding on previous data analysis strategies e g bader et al 2017 parry and young 2016 we used suspect and non target hrms data to evaluate the potential for water quality improvements in the hde and the role of hrt and sorption in contaminant attenuation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site thornton creek is the largest 3000 ha and most urbanized watershed in seattle wa the kingfisher reach located high on the south fork of thornton creek 47¬∫42 5 n 122¬∫18 27 w fig 1 has a flashy hydrograph due to the watershed s high fraction of impervious surfaces

s4 summer baseflow in 2016 and 2017 was 30 40 l s whereas multiple winter storms generated peak flows 600 l s during a 2014 restoration of the kingfisher reach the creek was re meandered and reconnected to its floodplain a homogeneous streambed mixture coarse gravel to medium sand 1 2 5 m depth figure s1 was installed over the native substrate a relatively impermeable compacted till bakke 2018 many partially buried logs were added to the reach but no additional organic matter was incorporated into the streambed aggregate additionally six engineered hdes were constructed to optimize hyporheic exchange fluxes and residence times hdes use a channel spanning log to create a plunge pool appearing similar to low head dams at the surface but incorporate several novel subsurface features 1 an impermeable barrier extends 1 m below the channel spanning log capping the streambed for the first several meters of the plunge pool and 2 the hyporheic zone is excavated deeper than the rest of the reach and backfilled with high permeability coarse gravel fig 2 the first design feature induces longer hz flowpaths by preventing short circuiting flows beneath the log and the second increases the hz exchange capacity across the structure to increase the proportion of streamflow treated by the hz although fine sediments accumulate and scour seasonally in the kingfisher reach plunge pools the surface sediment remained coarse after restoration 75 of samples had 90 pebbles and cobbles while some finer sands accumulated in the subsurface 75 85 pebbles and cobbles figure s1 the hdes are each 4 6 m wide and 1 1 m deep across the channel but the same coarse fill material extends into both stream banks increasing the hde cross sectional area to 8 4 m2 we performed initial flowpath delineation and sampling in hde 5 in september 2017 fig 1 however the upwelling zone at hde 5 later shifted reducing the hrt therefore subsequent flowpath delineation and sampling efforts were moved to hde 4 40 m upstream of hde 5 in october 2017 to complement an existing piezometer array hobo u20s and u20ls onset computer corp bourne ma this array included 4 riparian piezometers that bracketed hde 4 upstream downstream and left right bank and in stream stilling wells upstream and downstream of the structure all wells were 3 8 cm diameter stainless steel with the stilling wells slotted throughout their length and the riparian wells screened at depths of 75 125 cm 2 2 flowpath delineation we characterized individual hyporheic flowpaths by a multistep approach to hydrologically link hyporheic flowpaths non toxic red food dye was injected into downwelling zones with exfiltration monitored visually to identify upwelling zones sampling infrastructure was then installed at upwelling locations and quantitative tracers nacl bromide were then used to connect sampling points and estimate hrt where possible electrical conductivity loggers were deployed over longer timescales to assess flowpath hydrology during multiple storm events at hde 5 dye was injected into piezometer p5 1 in the downwelling zone 2 5 m upstream from the channel spanning log screened 10 30 cm below the streambed at 15 min after injection dye emerged in a focused location 1 m downstream from the log in the center of the pool then developed in an arc shape toward the right bank over the next hour two sampling locations were selected from this upwelling region to provide relatively fast 5 1 and slow 5 2 flowpaths minimum flowpath lengths of 3 6 m for flowpath 5 1 and 3 1 m for flowpath 5 2 despite the longer hrt were calculated by assuming a direct line from the injection point average 20 cm depth to the bottom of the hde impermeable barrier and then to the upwelling location at hde 4 dye was injected into downwelling piezometer p4 1 2 75 m upstream from channel spanning log and subsequent upwelling spread from the center of the pool to the left bank two flowpaths representing different hrts were selected 4 1 was faster 4 4 m long 4 2 was slower 5 m long seepage meters 47 cm diameter 110 l hdpe barrel sections fitted with sampling ports and volumetric bags were installed at each upwelling location 5 2 did not seal well and was replaced with a piezometer p5 2 seepage meter 5 1 20 cm tall was installed to a depth of 15 cm internal volume 16 5 l assuming 30 sediment porosity p5 2 1 cm radius had an internal volume of 0 340 l to achieve faster equilibration rates in hde 4 seepage meters were cut to 4 cm tall and installed flush with the sediment internal volume 2 l dye testing was performed on september 13 2017 in hde 5 one day prior to baseflow sampling flow 28 l s and on october 22 2017 in hde 4 2 weeks prior to storm sampling flow 47 l s bromide tracer tests informed by preliminary dye testing were used to confirm flowpath connectivity and quantify hrt seepage meters were purged at 40 ml min twice the planned sampling rate for 20 min to reduce dead volume to introduce a compact br pulse into the hyporheic flowpath a 1 l bromide solution 0 1 m br was rapidly injected into the downwelling well in hde 5 poured via funnel over 30 s in hde 4 pumped at 100 ml min then during continuous 20 ml min pumping from the downwelling and upwelling locations samples for br analysis were collected at 10 min intervals over 1 2 h in 50 ml polypropylene tubes the slow sampling pump rate was selected based on approximate hz flow rates measured via volumetric bag fill rates to ensure that pumping did not artificially impact hz transport rates or hydraulics bromide testing at hde 5 was performed over 1 h after dye tests on september 13 2017 at hde 4 bromide testing was performed over 2 h immediately after water sample collection november 12 2017 bromide concentrations were measured with an hi4102 bromide combination ion selective electrode hanna instruments woonsocket ri calibrated at 10 6 0 1 m br immediately before sample analysis a calibration standard within the observed concentration range was re analyzed every 4 samples with any shift in the voltage used to correct measurements in real samples in hde 4 a nacl tracer was also injected into the downwelling well monitored as electrical conductivity at 1 000x background to evaluate turnover rates in upwelling seepage meters on october 23 and 24 2017 the downwelling well sample represented the injection solution rather than the resulting diluted concentration of the tracer labeled hyporheic water given the uniformity of the streambed aggregate and relative impermeability of the underlying native sediment we considered tracer presence absence appropriate to establish hydrologic connectivity rather than fitting the breakthrough curves with an advection dispersion model our approach assumed that any dispersion along the hyporheic flowpath represented mixing with comparable parcels of hyporheic water rather than dilution with clean groundwater electrical conductivity loggers deployed in the hde 4 seepage meters also logged ambient specific conductivity every 3 min from october 23 to december 2 2017 capturing several distinct specific conductivity peaks attributable to storms 2 3 water sample collection samples for hrms analysis were collected in hde 5 on september 14 2017 baseflow conditions 28 l s and in hde 4 on november 12 2017 stormflow conditions flows turbid and elevated maximum 110 l s the sampling design was based on dye tracer based flowpath delineation to permit direct comparison between spatially

pumped through the sampling system for 30 min to ensure that the downwelling well sample provided a hydrologically representative influent to the hz we compared a second possible influent during each

and discussion 3 1 hyporheic flowpath delineation 3 1 1 hde 5 results of tracer testing are summarized in table s2 dye tracer tests in hde 5 indicated a 20 30 min hrt in the hz for the bulk of the flow flowpath 5 1 fig 1b and detected a slower secondary flowpath 5 2 with an average hrt of 30 60 min likely due to finer sediments deposited sand silt at the 5 2 upwelling location repeated dye tests consistently produced similar outcomes indicating simple dye tests can quickly delineate hz flowpath connectivity the flowpath 5 1 seepage meter produced an upwelling flow rate of 1 2 l in 30 min areal flux 240 ml m 2 min 1 the flowpath 5 2 piezometer p5 2 produced 5 ml min areal flux 17 ml m 2 min 1 these distinct flux rates indicate considerable spatial heterogeneity across the hde the observed hrts and flux rates indicated that without pumping seepage meter 5 1 and p5 2 required 6 and 1 h respectively to fully equilibrate with upwelling hyporheic water subsequent bromide tracer tests at hde 5 failed to improve the accuracy of our hrt estimates for these flowpaths injection concentrations may have been too low or breakthrough not monitored over an appropriate time interval given the slow turnover rate of the seepage meter unfortunately the bromide electrode used for on line monitoring malfunctioned preventing on site correction however the baseflow samples are linked qualitatively with hrts estimated via dye tracer and the close alignment 1 day of dye testing and water quality sampling provided substantial confidence in the flowpath linkage given steady state conditions dye tests in hde 5 one month later october 20 2017 in preparation for storm sampling revealed extensive lateral shifts in the hyporheic flow field as dye exited the hz 3 m from seepage meter 5 1 at hrt 10 min consistent with prior observations of focused lateral inflows at hde 5 during the wet season hyporheic flowpaths are expected to shift seasonally as the hyporheic zone is compressed by rising riparian water tables by visual observation 20 30 cm of fine sediment had deposited over the hde 5 seepage meters also contributing to altered hydraulics these conditions especially the shorter hrt redirected our sampling efforts to hde 4 3 1 2 hde 4 for the surface flowpath in hde 4 from the downwelling well to the surface above the upwelling zone we visually estimated a 1 min hrt two hyporheic flowpaths with hrts of 30 and 40 min flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 respectively were delineated by dye testing fig 1c the observed hyporheic flow direction generally from river right above hde 4 towards river left below was reasonable in light of similar head gradients observed in the lateral right to left and downstream directions fig s2 in flowpath 4 1 after seepage meter installation the nacl tracer injection hrt 32 min fig s6 and ambient specific conductivity from two late october storms hrt 30 60 min fig s7 validated this estimate during bromide testing november 12 2017 three weeks after dye testing bromide breakthrough 10x background first occurred in flowpath 4 1 at 80 min fig s8 ambient conductivity data from six early november storms also reflected this longer hrt with an 86 13 min lag time between the start of the reach and seepage meter 4 1 fig s7 similar changes occurred in flowpath 4 2 although bromide tracer data were complicated by the too short 2 h tracer sampling design nacl tracer and ambient storm conductivity data indicated the 4 2 flowpath was still hydrologically linked to downwelling surface water during water sampling the nacl tracer data fig s6 in flowpath 4 2 showed an attenuated specific conductivity spike 10 of max in 4 1 at 195 min after the max peak in 4 1 indicating an hrt of 3 75 h this offset relative to flowpath 4 1 aligned with the 140 42 min offset observed during ambient specific conductivity storm peaks during late october and early november the increased hrt estimates in subsurface flowpaths suggested slower hz water velocities during fall storm events e g from reduced head drop across the hde clogging of upwelling zones by fine sediments mobilized during storms water elevations from stilling wells bracketing hde 4 showed 21 decreases in downstream head drop and similar decreases across lateral gradients during the november 12 2017 storm fig s2 which would reduce hyporheic flow velocities correspondingly in addition to shifting hydraulics seepage meter installation may partially cap the hz forcing hyporheic flow to slow and or partially re direct around the seepage meters given the dramatic increase in hrt for flowpath 4 2 we hypothesize that seepage meter 4 2 had slower rates of upwelling and thus equilibration than 4 1 artificially increasing hrt to mitigate this possibility we recommend the use of sampling equipment that minimizes internal volumes and maximizes flow e g piezometers effectively capturing area and time integrated volumetric samples from linked upwelling or downwelling zones remains a substantial technical challenge in these dynamic systems while the multi tracer hydraulic sampling approach was effective experiments should be carefully adapted to the site conditions and updated in close to real time to ensure that collected data are accurate and fit to purpose overall the tracer detections in flowpath 4 1 delineated hydrologic connectivity between downwelling and upwelling locations for subsequent water quality sampling while the flowpath 4 2 linkage and hrt estimate are less certain many contaminant peaks exhibited conservative behavior see section 3 3 supporting our assumption that upwelling samples were not meaningfully diluted by groundwater instead the unlabeled upwelling water is assumed to be other hyporheic water of comparable residence time and influent quality this assumption is reasonable in the homogeneous coarse fill in these hdes vs a natural heterogeneous hz and the relatively impermeable underlying sediment compacted till thus despite uncertainty in exact hrts comparison between short and long hrt in hde 4 derived from dye and nacl studies and distance flowpath 4 2 was further downstream was appropriate 3 1 3 hyporheic flow as a fraction of streamflow based on the most constrained hrt estimate 32 min in flowpath 4 1 a head drop of 0 33 m over 4 25 m in the longitudinal direction dh dx 0 078 a 4 4 m 3d hyporheic flowpath v 0 0023 m s and assumed 30 porosity darcy s law yields a hydraulic conductivity k of 0 009 m s in line with typical rates for gravel fetter 2001 applying these data uniformly across the hde cross sectional area a 5 9 l s total hyporheic flux was estimated in each hde 35 l s across all six hdes although the streambed aggregate is uniform along the study reach this flux estimate is based on a single relatively fast flowpath and does not account for seasonal fine sediment deposits or reductions in head drop thus it is an upper limit most relevant to baseflow conditions notably the total hyporheic flux is quite similar to the 2016 2017 baseflow indicating near equivalent volumes of surface water and hz flow through the six hdes this estimate highlights the relevance of the engineered hdes for reach scale water quality especially for seasonal first flush events in 2017 the first four fall storms prior to the october 2017 tracer test generated discharges of 57 172 l s therefore we estimate 20 60 of these first flush events were likely to have passed through the engineered hdes of course the hde flow capacity would represent a much smaller fraction of overall stream flow during larger winter storms due to increases in surface discharge and lateral groundwater inflows treating the entirety of such flows may not be practical with in stream methods although this also depends on the length of restored reach the above flow fraction calculation does not include the several hundred meters of additional restored hyporheic zone in the reach beyond the six hdes 3 2 chemical identification we detected 1900 individual non target compounds during stormflow in hde 4 while only 320 non target compounds were detected during baseflow conditions in hde 5 in the hde 4 stormwater 83 were identified at a confidence of s2b as contaminants that are 1 commonly detected in urban waters 2 linked to specific sources e g roadway runoff residential areas and or 3 structurally related to chemicals strongly correlated with an urban stormwater linked coho salmon acute mortality syndrome mcintyre et al 2018 peter et al 2018 scholz et al 2011 of those 27 were detected during baseflow conditions although at peak areas consistently lower 2 90 fold than those observed during stormflow the identified contaminants were grouped by structure and or sources table s3 and peak area indicating relative abundance in the hde 4 downwelling well fig 3 a several organophosphates and pesticides that are pervasive anthropogenic indicators in urban watersheds bradley et al 2017 were detected in particular tris 1 chloro 2 propyl phosphate tcpp s2a and tris 2 butoxyethyl phosphate tboep s1 190 ng l used as flame retardants and paint additives are known endocrine disruptors and reproductive toxicants meeker and stapleton 2010 van der veen and de boer 2012 and were quite abundant peak areas 106 during stormflow during baseflow conditions tcpp and tboep were again among the largest peak area detections albeit at 8 fold lower abundance 3 105 cotinine a nicotine metabolite diuron an herbicide and booster biocide and deet an insect repellent were each detected s1 in stormflow at 10 ng l while only deet was detected during baseflow conditions 5 ng l several contaminants from vehicles and roadway runoff were detected including the commonly observed corrosion inhibitor 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole s1 160 ng l stormflow 70 ng l baseflow lefevre et al 2015 other vehicle derived contaminants all 9 ng l during baseflow included 1 3 diphenylguanidine s1 125 ng l in stormflow 1 3 dicyclohexylurea s1 60 ng l 1 cyclohexyl 3 phenylurea s1 65 ng l n methyl dicyclohexylamine s1 2 ng l n cyclohexyl benzothiazolamine s1 3 ng l dicyclohexylamine s2a and 1 3 diphenylurea s2a which are used in tire rubber manufacturing or are reaction by products wik and dave 2009 hexa methoxymethyl melamine hmmm s1 150 ng l stormflow 4 ng l baseflow and its structural family leach from tire rubbers and are one of the most abundant high peak area and detection frequency organic contaminants detected in road runoff and urban receiving waters such as thornton creek peter et al 2018 the significantly elevated peak areas observed during storm events suggest these roadway related contaminants are potentially useful as stormwater specific indicators eight homologous series of poly propylene glycols ppgs poly ethylene glycols pegs and octylphenol ethoxylates opeos 60 contaminants in total were identified in the hde 4 stormflow glycols are widely used in antifreeze personal care products and polymer formulations and are degradation products of non ionic surfactants such as opeos which are pervasive in aquatic environments ferguson et al 2001 gonz√°lez et al 2007 the peg series consisted of saturated pegs c2n 2h4n 2on n 17 18 21 23 s1 peg dimethyl ethers c2nh4n 2on n 4 7 s1 peg monomethyl ethers c2n 1h4non n 4 15 s1 and peg monobutyl ethers c2n 2h4n 6on n 5 6 s2b detected opeos had formulas c14h22o c2nh4non n 8 16 s1 the ppg series consisted of saturated ppgs c3n 3h6n 4on n 5 18 s1 and two mono unsaturated ppgs c3n 3h6n 6on n 6 16 s2b and c3n 6h6n 12on n 8 13 s2b while long chain surfactants are commonly detected in wastewater and hydraulic fracking waters schymanski et al 2014b thurman et al 2017 this is among the first reports of long chain ppgs in surface waters linked to urban runoff notably the saturated ppgs were among the most abundant compounds present in the hde 4 surface water comprising 14 of total peak area and 42 of peak area for identified compounds with an additional 5 and 14 of total and identified peak area respectively attributed to unsaturated ppgs by comparison to available technical standards using total peak area we estimate 40 ng l opeo 70 ng l peg 45 ng l peg dimethyl ether 35 ng l peg monomethyl ether and 700 ng l ppg in hde 4 during stormflow in contrast only 7 glycols ethoxylates were detected 4 members in any series during baseflow conditions at 8 fold lower peak areas relative to stormflow thus the glycol and ethoxylate families also represent potential surrogates indicators for urban pollution among the identified contaminants in stormflow 27 overlap with a coho mortality chemical signature reflecting urban pollution peter et al 2018 in hde 5 during baseflow 39 22 compounds total peak area 1 7 106 of the mortality signature both identified and unidentified compounds was detected in the downwelling water in hde 4 during stormflow and consistent with our expectation of increased coho mortality risk during storms in urbanized creeks 86 of the mortality signature 50 non target compounds total peak area 9 107 was detected 3 3 water quality assessment to assess potential water quality improvement we evaluated the hdes as a set of paired in stream reactors with two possible flowpaths that reflect the two potential treatment outcomes that may impact water quality in this reach 1 surface attenuation represented by surface flow immediately above the hyporheic paths or 2 hz treatment via flow through the subsurface hde at varying hrts fig 2 we note that due to mixing of surface water and upwelling hyporheic water in the plunge pool turnover time of several to tens of minutes somewhat more attenuation in the sampled surface flowpath relative to a hydraulically isolated 1 min surface flowpath can be expected although attenuation via mechanisms such as photolysis or sorption were not anticipated to be significant over such short timescales a visual comparison between the hde 4 influent and effluents is shown in fig s9 where a substantial reduction in turbidity was evident after transport through the hyporheic flowpaths we assessed water quality using both a traditional analysis focused on targeted analytes within the hrms data and a complementary analysis focused on non target data both approaches evaluated the fate of stormwater derived contaminants along hydraulically paired surface and hyporheic flowpaths the non target hrms data were used to assess treatment performance more broadly and evaluate the role of sorption based attenuation mechanisms in contaminant attenuation on a practical note while the benefit of hrms analysis is the simultaneous detection of many contaminants it is not typically feasible to acquire all relevant standards even when pure standards are available and quantify all detected contaminants therefore water quality is typically compared on the basis of peak area reduction equation 1 n√ºrenberg et al 2015 parry and young 2016 peak area comparison may over or underestimate removal relative to the use of concentration e g due to matrix enhancement or suppression but provides relative comparisons across contaminants and flowpaths 3 3 1 removal of identified compounds we first evaluated the fate of the 83 identified contaminants in thornton creek fig 3b overall consistently higher removal occurred in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 relative to the paired surface flowpath for example the long chain glycols and opeos were removed 38 during surface flow in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 removals increased by 47 20 for ppgs to 37 100 removal by 75 5 for opeos 71 78 removal and by 55 29 for pegs 51 100 removal during baseflow conditions ppgs were better removed via hyporheic flowpath 5 1 65 100 relative to surface flow 14 23 table s3 similarly the organophosphates persisted during surface flow 15 removal while moderate removal 26 57 occurred along flowpath 4 1 for vehicle and roadway derived contaminants removals 35 occurred during surface flow with the exception of the hmmm family and 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole removals in flowpath 4 1 40 100 were 40 18 higher than during surface flow increased removals at the longer hrt of flowpath 4 2 relative to flowpath 4 1 were evident indicating that longer hz residence time contributed to contaminant attenuation and improved water quality fig 3 additional removal of the glycols and ethoxylates occurred with longer hyporheic flow with removals exceeding 80 and often 95 for all ppgs pegs and opeos in flowpath 4 2 representing an increase of 22 16 relative to flowpath 4 1 removal of the organophosphates also was 37 6 higher in flowpath 4 2 70 90 removal than in flowpath 4 1 removal of 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole and the hmmm family compounds excepting the most polar and persistent members tetra and penta mmm was 31 3 higher in flowpath 4 2 than in flowpath 4 1 for all other roadway associated contaminants removals exceeded 70 in flowpath 4 2 an increase of 23 11 relative to flowpath 4 1 based on the substantial peak areas of the identified contaminants in the hde 4 stormflow their effective attenuation in the hz contributes significantly to reduction in anthropogenic contaminant loads to downstream reaches assuming 20 60 of stormflow passes through the series of hdes see section 3 1 3 the observed removals for all identified contaminants corresponds to a net 15 50 reduction in the total load of these contaminants observed removal of the coho mortality signature mirrored overall trends in the removal of identified contaminants in hde 4 stormflow and hde 5 baseflow only 20 of the signature peak area detected in the downwelling well was removed during surface flow one compound removed completely in contrast flow through hyporheic flowpath 5 1 yielded a 51 reduction in signature peak area two compounds removed completely likewise signature peak area reductions of 55 and 84 occurred in flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 respectively with 6 and 15 compounds removed completely thus hyporheic flow particularly at longer hrt reduced the number and peak area of compounds correlated to the mortality phenomenon although ongoing studies are assessing the potential for mortality signature outcomes to reflect actual reductions in risk to aquatic organisms 3 3 2 assessment of treatment performance with non target compounds after evaluating individual chemicals the entire non target dataset was used to assess treatment performance we compared non target compound peak area equation 1 to estimate removal outcomes in paired samples and applied predicted logk ow characteristics to evaluate the potential contribution of sorption to attenuation in the hz one metric of treatment performance is the total number of non target compounds fig s10 in hde 4 during stormflow 1198 compounds were detected while 4 fewer compounds were detected in downstream surface flow 23 and 52 fewer compounds were detected after hyporheic flow at short flowpath 4 1 and long hrt flowpath 4 2 respectively in hde 5 during baseflow 320 non target compounds were detected in the downwelling well in the downstream sample 15 fewer compounds were observed vs 35 fewer compounds in flowpath 5 1 residual dye detected in flowpath 5 2 during this event precluded non target analysis of flowpath 5 2 data overall enhanced removal was evident for hyporheic vs surface flow and fewer compounds were detected as hyporheic hrt increased per bader et al 2016 we grouped removal outcomes into defined intervals to categorize non target compound fate notably bader et al 2016 used peak height as a surrogate for concentration our use of peak area is conceptually similar but accounts for peak shape variability across different matrices and analytical runs the intervals describe possible outcomes for extent of peak area removal formation r 500 increase 500 r 200 consistent 200 r 50 decrease 50 r 80 and elimination r 80 formation and increase represent compounds that are newly detected during treatment e g leaching transformation products while decrease and elimination represent compounds removed from the aqueous phase the broad range for consistent is intended to compensate for possible peak area variations derived from matrix effects e g matrix suppression and enhancement as well as small changes in compound concentration n√ºrenberg et al 2015 the reported range for consistent was validated by spiking 12 isotopically labeled internal standards into process influent and effluent waters fig s11 bader et al 2016 the ratio of effluent influent peak area ranged from 0 80 to 1 32 75 of pairs within 0 85 1 15 indicating 1 peak area comparisons to assess removal are appropriate with consistent matrix bias expected throughout the treatment train li et al 2018 and 2 the reported interval categories should be broadly applicable across surface waters and similar matrices results of this analysis are shown for stormflow fig 4 a and baseflow fig 4b for both most non target compounds in the downstream surface flowpath shown in gray were consistent i e no clear attenuation relative to surface flow hyporheic flow shown in blue green drove more compounds to the decrease and elimination categories notably in hde 4 stormflow the impact of hrt on removal was clear in flowpath 4 1 shorter hrt 24 of non target compounds decreased in peak area 50 r 80 and 35 were eliminated r 80 in flowpath 4 2 longer hrt 9 of compounds decreased while 69 were eliminated longer hyporheic hrt clearly enhanced contaminant attenuation in hde 4 13 of total non target compounds in each flowpath were only detected downstream i e formation interval fig 4a these new compounds could arise from transformation of influent compounds or leaching a few new detections are probably analytical artifacts not captured by controls for example several poly caprolactam compounds detected only in the hde 4 upwelling samples likely leached from seepage meter materials caprolactam is a monomer of nylon 6 while we did not conclusively detect a parent product pair we anticipate that many other new compounds are transformation products for example detection s2b of short chain pegs di and triethylene glycol nonyl ether c13h28o3 rt 11 93 min c15h32o4 rt 12 1 min fig s12 3 3 3 assessing sorption potential with non target data based on the relatively short hrt of the hz flowpaths and previously observed organic micropollutant fate in hzs ding et al 1999 lin et al 2006 hydrophobic sorption e g to accumulated organic matter and subsurface biofilms is expected to be a dominant removal mechanism without conclusively identifying each non target detection the contribution of sorption to attenuation was evaluated by using instrument rt to predict octanol water partitioning coefficients logk ow bade et al 2015b nurmi et al 2012 via a previously established correlation built with 260 pure standards fig s13 from du et al 2017 this approach relies on the statistical power of the hundreds thousands of detected compounds to overcome expected uncertainties and errors arising from assignation of chemical characteristics to unidentified compounds while some will be outliers from the logk ow prediction e g ionizable compounds this approach supports evaluation of broader system trends and attenuation mechanisms using the extensive non target dataset although more advanced modeling approaches e g artificial neural networks quantitative structure retention time relationships can improve the accuracy of logk ow prediction bade et al 2015a barron and mceneff 2016 the simple linear correlation remains an effective predictor for example bade et al 2015b demonstrated that for 95 of 595 pesticides and pharmaceuticals actual rt was within 4 min of the prediction and for a 345 point pesticide only regression 79 were within 2 min of the prediction similarly for our regression actual and predicted rt were within 2 and 4 min for 78 and 96 of compounds respectively to depict removal trends as a function of predicted sorption potential for the different flowpaths we compared relative removal performance using scatterplots hde 4 stormflow data in fig 5 hde 5 baseflow data in fig s14 via parry and young 2016 the 1 1 line indicates identical removal in the two flowpaths while compounds above the 1 1 line were more effectively removed during hyporheic flow than surface flow and vice versa a second visualization approach not described previously supports a statistical comparison across logk ow ranges and treatment types this approach used box plots to evaluate removal as a function of estimated logk ow with median removals extracted as a single point comparison of removal performance across logk ow ranges hde 4 in fig 6 hde 5 in fig s15 both approaches indicated substantial water quality improvement in hyporheic flowpaths relative to limited removal during surface flow and strong contributions of hydrophobic sorption towards observed attenuation in the scatterplots figs 5 and s16 more polar compounds estimated logk ow 3 blue and green primarily lay along the 1 1 line at removals 50 while more hydrophobic compounds estimated logk ow 3 yellow and red clearly exhibited much higher removal along hyporheic flowpaths in hyporheic flowpath 4 1 as logk ow increased the distribution visibly shifted towards elimination fig 5a indicating the hz was increasingly effective for removal of more hydrophobic compounds particularly during stormflow this trend was even more apparent in the longer hrt hyporheic flowpath 4 2 fig 5b non target detections in all logk ow ranges exhibited greater removal in hz flow than surface flow and nearly all detections with logk ow 5 in red exhibited near 100 removal in hyporheic flow clusters along the top edge of the plot thus by comparison to the shorter hyporheic flowpath increasing hrt in the hz promoted enhanced removal of more hydrophobic compounds and was especially important for increased removal of polar compounds these trends were reflected by the removal of identified compounds described above scatterplots for the 83 identified compounds provided in fig s16 for example removal of the polar 4 5 methyl 1h benzotriazole logk ow 1 8 was similar in surface flow and flowpath 4 1 33 and 32 respectively but increased to 61 in flowpath 4 2 the organophosphates exemplify trends observed in hde 4 for non polar compounds removals of tboep logk ow 3 75 and triphenyl phosphate logk ow 4 59 increased from 12 and 7 respectively during surface flow to 55 and 57 respectively in flowpath 4 1 with even higher removal 90 for both in flowpath 4 2 in the boxplots fig 6 s15 two statistically significant trends were apparent in the data 1 increasing removal with compound hydrophobicity in flowpaths 4 1 and 4 2 dunn s test p 0 01 for all comparisons except logk ow 1 3 vs 3 5 in flowpath 4 1 p 0 41 and logk ow 1 vs 1 3 in flowpath 4 2 p 0 36 and 2 increasing removal with hyporheic hrt dunn s test p 0 01 for all comparisons except removal in surface flow vs flowpath 4 1 at logk ow 1 thus sorption to immobile geomedia biofilms and organic matter phases was a dominant removal mechanism in the hz however we observed more variability in removal performance within the lower logk ow ranges this is consistent with the potential for additional molecular characteristics e g functional groups ionizability and removal mechanisms e g electrostatic interactions to govern the fate outcomes of more polar compounds schaffer et al 2012 t√ºlp et al 2009 3 3 4 relevance for hyporheic restoration identifying and sampling hydrologically paired downwelling and upwelling locations in the hz is challenging but is needed to quantify the treatment capabilities of the restored hz variability in the hyporheic residence times of individual flowpaths observed during timescales of days to weeks were attributed to both the changing water table during storm events siltation and artificial flowpath alterations caused by seepage meter installation although longer term studies are needed to fully evaluate these phenomena in the kingfisher hdes a few meters in length 0 5 3 h hrt we observed 50 attenuation of hundreds of organic stormwater contaminants the data also indicated increasing contaminant removal efficiency with longer hyporheic hrt and that hydrophobic sorption processes to geomedia and organic matter phases are key contributors to rapid water quality improvement in hdes although contaminants may degrade microbially over longer timescales after sorption this requires further investigation while these results are specific to a subset of emerging organic contaminants we anticipate that hdes also attenuate other regulated pollutants e g nutrients pathogens metals at the reach scale we estimated that the six kingfisher hdes can treat a water volume similar to the total surface discharge during summer baseflow and early hydrograph first flush fall storm events the kingfisher hdes have several novel design features to lengthen hrt but further improvements e g longer caps lateral groundwater seals could improve treatment performance and reliability of water quality monitoring while the potential for water quality improvement within individual hdes is clear the primary technical challenge for these systems is hydraulic promoting the passage of sufficient volumes through hdes while maintaining adequate contact times with biofilms and media to meaningfully improve reach scale water quality particularly during storm events that reduce the head drop across the hde while introducing significant contaminant loads future work should include longer term studies to assess the repeatability of hz performance over time and should optimize hyporheic exchange to meet reach scale water quality goals with hrt matched to contaminant attenuation timescales further the hde subsurface media could be amended with specific sorbents e g biochar to improve attenuation of high priority contaminants thereby allowing higher throughput rates to provide proportionally larger reductions in the contaminant load continued research is needed to develop effective and reliable options for in stream treatment of surface waters via hz engineering to promote high quality and healthy urban freshwater ecosystems 4 conclusions linked hyporheic flowpaths were identified for subsequent water quality sampling in an engineered hyporheic design element using dye nacl and bromide tracer tests hydraulic retention times in the sampled hz ranged from 30 min to 3 h over 3 5 m hyporheic travel removal data for non target compounds across surface and hyporheic flowpaths including identified compounds linked to vehicle roadway sources and a coho mortality chemical signature demonstrated that hyporheic flow attenuates hundreds of organic compounds particularly at longer hrt thus improving water quality relative to surface transport non target hrms data can assess holistic water quality improvements using metrics such as total number and total peak area to describe overall system trends additionally non target compound hydrophobicity estimated via rt logk ow relationships can be used to evaluate the potential contributions of hydrophobic sorption to attenuation during both baseflow and stormflow the hz is increasingly effective for removal of increasingly hydrophobic compounds indicating that sorption is a dominant removal mechanism longer hydraulic retention times promote compound removal particularly for more polar compounds declarations of interest none acknowledgements this work was
