6240,wetlands as oxbows play a fundamental socio economic and environmental role they behave as efficient tools in regards to hydrological and ecological concerns they contribute to control rivers discharge flood prevention and contribution to drought flow as well as to manage water quality excess nutrients retention and they constitute refuge habitats for flora and fauna they may so become more and more determinant as nature based solutions in a near future however the establishment of complete and reliable functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can present these specific wetlands to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer moreover monodisciplinary approaches usually conducted can underestimate or even neglect sources of water supply the present study offers a multidisciplinary approach coupling hydrodynamic surface water groundwater levels geochemical t ec ph major ions and isotopic δ2h δ18o characterization in order to properly assess the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems and so be able to establish a complete and reliable hydrodynamic conceptual model the coupling approach has been tested on the auzon oxbow one of the fluvial annexes of the allier river massif central france the resulting conceptual model testifies for connection degree higher that expected between the oxbow and both the main stream and alluvial aquifer indeed a non negligible supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater is observed especially in its downstream part as this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the allier river groundwater supply could have been underestimated the geochemical approach shows that allier river also supply the oxbow through the upstream paleochannel result of a channel migration 30 years ago hydrodynamic and isotopic approaches complete the understanding showing that the paleochannel pathway is only active during high flow periods from november to june based on these results the

surface ground water interaction hydrochemistry stable isotopes 1 introduction wetlands were subject of various scientific considerations in recent decades and benefit from specific international convention especially as waterfowl habitat ramsar convention 1971 they are indeed particularly recognized to preserve the ecological function of hydrosystems ecological niches refuge areas however during the last decades the general intensification of pollution has led to the contamination of most of the water bodies with negative effects on aquatic ecosystems human health productive activities water system reliability and operating costs for water use gleick 1998 bates et al 2008 hulton 2012 sutton et al 2013 unep 2016 in the meantime a world loss of about 64 71 of natural wetlands is to deplore since 1900 because of human activities davidson 2014 locally some sectors are especially affected with for instance percentage of wetlands lost reaching 91 for the california state between the 1780 s and the 1980 s dahl 1990 actions have been therefore implemented in order 1 to preserve or restore wetlands 2 to complete the knowledge on their functioning and 3 to communicate about the necessity of maintaining such environments these are the objectives for instance of the 3rd national action plan for wetlands in france pnmh 2014 and of the united states geological survey fretwell et al 1996 as a special feature of wetlands oxbows are generated by spatial and temporal dynamics of rivers within their floodplains that kind of perifluvial environments are of a major ecological importance for the habitat and diversity of fauna and vegetation oxbows indeed promote reproduction and provide refuge areas for biotic communities especially fishes bornette et al 1998 ghosh and biswas 2017 yang et al 2018 however since an oxbow is a floodplain annex it can be supplied by local precipitation main stream s water alluvial groundwater from the bank between the river and the oxbow and from the bank delineating the alluvial plain rollet et al 2005 therefore the whole ecosystem of oxbows depends largely on hydrodynamic conditions and more peculiarly on the mixing between water masses through hydrological connectivity to the main stream and or the alluvial groundwater dahm et al 1998 amoros and bornette 2002 it is now widely recognized that maintaining oxbows in riparian areas contributes to control floods occurrence to stabilize river base flows during dry periods to enhance the water quality by nutrient retention and to preserve ecosystems winter et al 1998 alard et al 2001 bullock and acreman 2003 larocque et al 2016 however obtain a complete hydrological knowledge about oxbows dynamic remains challenging various monodisciplinary approaches implying mostly hydrodynamic but also hydrochemistry carrel and juget 1987 bengen et al 1992 le coz 2003 babka et al 2011 hudson et al 2012 have been tested separately however such focused investigations can lead to neglect or underestimate contributions of connected water masses to the whole functioning of the oxbow which may produce unaccurate conceptual models to water managers multidisciplinary approach carried out on a representative and spatially distributed sampling network boreholes and surface water points covering both the selected wetland and the connected water masses of the whole hydrosystem constitute an integrated solution to insure the most complete hydrological understanding of the system and therefore contribute effectively to wetlands and rivers preservation actions restoration rehabilitation remeandering the present study is carried out on the auzon oxbow one of the fluvial annexes of the allier river massif central france fig 1 a located in the upper allier river basin ecological concerns surround that specific oxbow especially since it constitutes trout s reproduction and refuge areas consequently local fishing associations carried out conservation operation as the dredging of alluvial plugs to maintain its connectivity to the main stream beauger et al 2015 as an experimental site of the soahal observatory système d observation d une annexe hydraulique de l allier a complete monitoring of the hydrosystem including surface and groundwater with a dense spatial resolution 20 sampling sites for 0 4 km2 has been organized from 2014 the objectives are to provide effective diagnostic tools to evaluate the connection degree of the auzon oxbow to the allier river the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer and thus to establish a complete hydrodynamic description of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem to achieve that goal the strategy was to combine individual investigation approaches through a multidisciplinary analysis on both hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry 2 study area 2 1 general settings the study was performed on the auzon oxbow sexagesimal gps standard longitude latitude coordinates at the confluence 03 21 41 e 45 22

cenozoic volcanic rocks the remaining part of the watershed is made of calcareous oligocene fluvio lacustrine sediments korobova et al 1997 the study area is located in the small subsidence basin of brioude that tectonic depression constitutes the western end of an e w direction extension grabens network due to the tectonic phase in distention which took place in western europe during the cenozoic period vanderhaeghe and prognon 2012 the brioude basement is composed of hercynian metamorphic and magmatic bedrock overlaid by the sedimentary formation of limagne during the oligocene and miocene periods detrital sedimentation in continental environment alternation of clays sands and marls with some carbonates levels filled the basin since quaternary the alluvial deposits of the allier river are completing the sequence on the underlying oligocene marls lasnier and marchand 1982 korobova et al 1997 they extend over a width of between 0 5 and 2 km and a thickness of about 10 m at the

neutral ph and calcium bicarbonate water type mohammed 2014 mohammed et al 2014 the alluvial aquifer of the allier river is one of the major water resources of the area this aquifer is therefore intensively exploited for drinking water supply and agricultural purposes as it is the case on the study site thanks to its geomorphology and location auzon oxbow is considered as an active floodplain oxbow babka et al 2011 it was formed by the migration of an old channel of the allier river which occurred during two flood events in 1988 and 1989 a former gravel pit located in the point bar has facilitated the cutoff process leading to the main channel abandon upper part of the channel was rapidly in filled by sands and gravels since then only the downstream end remains connected to the main stream beauger 2008 conferring to the auzon oxbow the first stage of development of oxbows gagliano and howard 1984 wren et al 2008 hudson et al 2012 as so it can be supplied by water of four different origins local precipitation main stream s water through the confluence groundwater inflowing from the bank between allier river and the oxbow and finally groundwater from the bank delineating the alluvial plain rollet et al 2005 the 560 m length of the oxbow can be divided into three geomorphological parts fig 1c i the upstream zone uz which is disconnected from the main stream and is similar to a pond 197 m length 13 m width and maximum depth of 1 8 m ii the intermediate zone iz which is a former geomorphological riffle 176 m length 0 3 to 8 m width and maximum depth of 0 4 m iii and the downstream zone dz which is connected to the allier river by its downstream extremity beauger et al 2015 188 m length 17 m width and maximum depth of 1 6 m highly subject to flooding the right bank rb is used for punctual grazing while the left bank lb is a low terrace dedicated to cereals production however close to the auzon oxbow crops are smaller and agricultural practices relatively soft compared to the western plateau where they are much more intensive fig 1b that neighboring plateau presents an aquifer that is assumed to partly feed the lb alluvial groundwater auzon oxbow has been monitored since 2007 beauger 2008 in terms of geomorphology sedimentation and ecology study of diatom macrophyte and benthic macroinvertebrate communities to complete ecological investigations the monitoring has been extended to surface and groundwater hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry in this purpose near surface piezometers from 0 92 to 1 85 m deep were built on the oxbow s shore of both banks fig 1c in 2012 beauger et al 2015 as well as deep observation boreholes catching the whole aquifer thickness in 2014 2 2 sampling sites precipitation height have been collected

which is assumed to partly feed the alluvial groundwater 3 sampling and analytical methods 3 1 hydrodynamic monitoring 07 22 2014 11 24 2017 in order to assess the hydrodynamic behavior of the oxbow the potential water sources entering the system have been investigated in terms of hydrodynamic and hydrochemistry surface water level of the allier river at the confluence with the auzon oxbow and water table in the 6 observation boreholes have been recorded on an hourly basis with an in situ level troll 500 probe all water level data have been corrected from the barometric pressure variations the hydrological station was located on lb prior to the 11 05 2015 a1 fig 1c and then moved to rb a2 fig 1c because of a too important erosion of the left bank during previous floods geographical coordinates and elevation of each pressure sensor were measured using the centimetric trimble r10 dgps whose data was post processed with trimble business center software version 3 8 and adjusted according to the dimensions of the boreholes in order to calculate level variations through time in the same reference of altitude cunningham and schalk 2011 the reliability of the continuous piezometric levels monitoring was checked and validated through manual measurements carried out during the 40 sampling campaigns correlation coefficients between data recorded and manually measured r2 from 0 92 to 0 99 testify for a good representativeness of the piezometric level time series 3 2 water chemistry monitoring forty sampling campaigns have been performed on the 21 sampling sites on a monthly basis from july 2014 to november 2017 except in february 2017 when the alluvial plain was flooded a few data are also missing for p7 because of small floods or vandalism prior to sampling bottles have been rinsed two times by using the water to be sampled surface waters and le monteil spring were directly sampled using sampling vials groundwater was sampled using a cole parmer masterflex i s pump for near surface piezometers while it was a 12 v standard pvc narrow diameter submersible pump for the observation boreholes for each groundwater sampling stagnating water present into the borehole was renewed before sampling and measuring an intensive campaign was performed on the 23rd of november 2017 in the auzon oxbow in order to assess spatial distribution of electrical conductivity ec 124 measures have been performed in the near surface of the oxbow 0 2 m depth along the uz the iz and on the upper part of the dz using a wtw multi 340i and a dgps trimble geo7x whose data were post processed with pathfinder software two sites of the ec campaign points 3 and 103 were also sampled for major ions analyses ec ph and water temperature have been measured in situ using a wtw multi 340i hco3 concentrations have been determined directly in the field by using hach digital titrator sulfuric acid 0 1600 n and 1 600 n and bromocresol green methyl red indicator hach method 8203 a total of 837 water samples have thus been taken in clean sterile polypropylene straight containers with polyethylene caps of 180 ml transported in cooler to geolab laboratory in clermont ferrand cnrs umr 6042 university clermont auvergne and then stored at 4 c anions and cations were analyzed within 3 days in geolab laboratory anions f cl no2 no3 po4 3 so4 2 using the thermo fisher scientific dionex dx120 ionic chromatography with a ionpac as23 4 250 mm column and the dionex 7 anions standard solution cations li na nh4 k mg2 ca2 using the thermo fisher scientific dionex ics1100 ionic chromatography with a ionpac cs12a 4 250 mm column and the dionex 6 cations standard solution the error margins were of 4 6 and 2 4 respectively for anions and cations these analyses are reliable since all the 839 ionic balances 837 monthly punctual samples 3 and 103 are under 10 with even 95 1 under 5 from july 2014 to march 2017 only groundwater from the six observation boreholes has been analyzed for stable isotopes since april 2017 all sites have been sampled for δ2h and δ18o analyses so the database accounts for 360 isotopic analyses waters have been collected with no air bubbles in 20 ml borosilicate glass vials closed by polypropylene caps isotopic analysis were performed at the university of corsica france cnrs umr 6134 spe both 2h and 18o of the water molecule were characterized using a liquid water stable isotope analyzer dlt 100 los gatos research according to the analytical scheme recommended by the iaea iaea 2009 penna et al 2010 isotopic data were reported in the standard delta notation in part per thousand relative to vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow clark and fritz 1997 the accuracy is 1 for δ2h and 0 1 for δ18o 3 3 geophysical investigations electrical resistivity tomography ert is a geophysical method providing images of electrical resistivity ρ inverse of conductivity of the subsurface ert is generally used to characterize the lithology and the geometry of the ground to assess its saturation or even to monitor soil pollution loke 2011 the technique consists of injecting current in a pair of electrodes set into the ground and measuring the resulting potential difference between another dipole of electrodes which yields information about ρ a 2d ert survey was carried out on the soahal observatory on the 02 21 2018 in order to investigate potential underground connections between auzon oxbow and allier river the data collection was done by using a syscal r1 iris instruments with a wenner schlumberger electrode configuration loke and barker 1996 an array of 72 electrodes was installed distributed every 3 m along a nnw sse line fig 1c the apparent resistivity data were inverted with res2dinv software loke 2016 using least squares inversion optimization inversion converged to rms error of 3 after 5 iterations 4 results and discussion 4 1 end members characterization and interactions 4 1 1 hydrodynamical data allier river discharge presents an average value of 25 m3 s 1 for the studied period 07 22 2014 11 24 2017 the most important flood impulse reached 328 m3 s 1 11 23 2016 while two other flood peaks have been registered equal or superior to 150 m3 s 1 156 m3 s 1 on the 11 29 2014 and 150 m3 s 1 on the 04 06 16 fig 2 d these events are quite moderate compared to the large floods that allier river can historically experience 10y flood and 50y flood 590 and 840 m3 s 1 respectively banque hydro n d annual discharge variations are observed with globally low flow lf periods during the warmest months from july to october with an average flow rate around 14 m3 s 1 while high flow hf periods including important flood events occur along the rest of the year with an average flow rate around 32 m3 s 1 this lf hf distribution over time is more consistent with variations of precipitation recorded in the upstream mountainous area mohammed et al 2014 whose naussac weather station is the witness fig 2a than the local ones represented by sainte florine weather station on fig 2a however the maximum flood peak of 328 m3 s 1 is actually related to high precipitation recorded at both stations suggesting a generalized rainfall event linked to a cevénol episode a climatic phenomenon more and more frequent these last few years with rainy events that mainly affects the cevennes mountain range and piedmont which often cause severe floods in the massif central region jubertie 2006 gay 2015 on the contrary flood peak occurring the 01 26 2017 seems to be only due to high altitude precipitation rainfall event is actually only recorded at naussac weather station finally flood peak recorded the 08 30 2017 is caused by a stormy event affecting saint florine weather station only these examples emphasize that discharge variations recorded for allier river are related to a large set of meteorological conditions affecting the entire allier basin including rapid winter temperature elevation with or without rainfall causing snow melting jubertie 2006 water level variations at the auzon oxbow allier river confluence solid black lines in fig 2b and c are consistent with discharge variations of the allier river recorded at agnat pont d auzon station fig 2d it shows the accuracy of the in situ surface water level monitoring which was therefore crossed with water table monitoring for piezometric mapping triangular interpolation fig 3 a and b present lf 08 04 2015 and hf 04 06 2016 piezometric maps respectively these two dates are identified on fig 2d the lf piezometric map indicates a global northward circulation of groundwater gw and identified gw as a potential end member supplying auzon oxbow water level time series observation fig 2b and c shows that pz1 and pz2 rb as well as pz4 lb present very impulsive variations they were pretty close to the water level variations at the confluence auzon oxbow allier river moreover in hf piezometric levels were lower than surface water levels with 0 7 of the records at pz1 0 3 at pz2 and 4 at pz4 this observation suggests that gw are supplied by surface water whatever bank considered during hf pz3 pz5 and pz6 lb show smoother signals fig 2b most of the lb piezometric level variations remained consistent with the surface water level variations the hf piezometric map illustrates the hydrodynamic situation during the third most important flood event of the studied period this flood was linked to a large rainfall event which affected the whole allier river catchment fig 2a the map can be used to identify potential hydrodynamic changes compared to lf situation then an inversion of the hydraulic gradient is induced by high surface water level recorded at the auzon oxbow allier river confluence it affects gw on both auzon oxbow banks however in the rb inversion is reduced to a gw flow inversion from pz2 to pz1 since the allier river discharge just began to decline while the rb is still in charge on the lb inversion seemed to extend from surface water to pz5 passing through pz4 actually during that hf event as generally for all hf recordings pz4 levels varied synchronously with the surface water level up to inversion of hydraulic gradient while the other lb boreholes remained stable pz5 included pz3 piezometric level starts to increase only 24 h after the rise of surface water level the response delay of pz5 and pz6 is about 26 h besides pz5 piezometric level stays lower than the one of pz6 inducing a piezometric depression the delay between the increase in surface water level and that of the more inland lb boreholes suggests that the hydraulic gradient inversion is limited to pz4 this hydrodynamic feature can be explained by high disparities existing within the alluvial deposits from silts to gravels teles et al 2004 ounaïes et al 2013 sarris et al 2018 these 3d heterogeneities lead to variations in water flows distribution within the aquifer to summarize hydrodynamic data highlight that during lf auzon oxbow is supplied by gw during hf an inversion of the hydraulic gradient is recorded and auzon oxbow contributes to the recharge of gw rb is entirely concerned by this recharge while only the oxbow closest borehole pz4 is affected in the lb fig 3b the important time delay observed between surface water flood peaks and gw recharge at pz3 pz5 and pz6 from 24 to 26 h indicates that lb gw is mainly recharged by the southern gw system 4 1 2 physico chemical data for the 21 sample sites physico chemical parameters measurements water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec as well as ions concentrations and water stable isotopes determinations are presented in table 1 with average arithmetic means minimum maximum and standard deviation values ec vs t data of the entire soahal observatory are reported in fig 4 a while ec time series of auzon oxbow dz b2bis iz b4 uz b7 and of each end member are quoted in fig 4b allier river pz1 rb gw pz3 pz4 lb gw with an increasing distance to the auzon oxbow from pz4 to pz3 the ph values are comprised between 6 5 and 8 8 table 1 which is consistent with natural water ph usually ranging from 6 5 to 9 5 the more neutral values have been recorded in gw and are assumed to be due to the buffering capacity of soils ec and t values were the most interesting physico chemical parameters to differentiate water end members fig 4 allier river ec is the lowest one within the study site 110 17 µs cm 1 table 1 without any significant variations during the year fig 4b on the contrary t experiences high amplitudes from 0 9 to 21 8 c table 1 as an impact of air temperature annual variation pz1 and pz2 show the lowest ec values of the boreholes with 290 and 491 µs cm 1 respectively table 1 ec annual variations are relatively low fig 4b while t amplitudes can reach more than 12 c table 1 the rb p2 p4 p6 and p9 and lb p7 near surface piezometers fig 1c also present low ec values and high t amplitudes fig 4a and table 1 pz3 to pz6 are characterized by the highest ec values mean value of the four boreholes 981 µs cm 1 while t experienced the smaller variations around 7 c table 1 ec time series show a quite stable signal with no clearly identified seasonal variations fig 4b p3 and p5 the two remaining lb near surface piezometers fig 1c present similar ec and t patterns fig 4a and table 1 le monteil spring shows a high ec value 925 µs cm 1 table 1 and low amplitude of t 6 7 c table 1 which is consistent with the lb gw fig 4a 4 1 3 hydrochemical data hydrochemical data of table 1 have been plotted on a piper diagram fig 5 in order to define the geochemical water types of each end member water types are distributed between two groups with a noticeable difference in the cations content the first group has a ca na hco3 type and includes allier river pz1 pz2 rb gw p2 p4 p6 p9 rb near surface piezometers p7 lb near surface piezometer and then the second group presents a ca hco3 signature and corresponds to pz3 to pz6 lb gw p3 and p5 the two remaining lb near surface piezometers and le monteil spring then the gw signal shows a clear distribution between rb and lb rb gw are predominantly supplied by allier river whereas lb gw chemical facies is consistent with the one of the plateau aquifer le monteil this is in agreement with hydrodynamic data p7 can be quoted as an exception to this rb lb gw distribution as this lb near surface piezometer presents physico chemical and geochemical characteristics close to the rb gw ones chemical difference between allier river as well as rb gw and lb gw is due to the geological composition of the watershed actually the ca na hco3 water type of the allier river can be related to the volcano metamorphic basement upstream of the study site the allier river incised the basement while downwards the riverbed widens within the brioude basin where an enrichment in calcareous nodules between vieille brioude and the study site has been documented lasnier and marchand 1982 carbonate dissolution occurrences are reported in the allier river and the shallow gw associated négrel et al 2004 sodium minerals subjects to weathering are reported as common in the allier terraces as augite green and brown hornblende and nepheline rudel 1963 pastre 1986 veldkamp and jongmans 1990 which explain the na enriched signature of the allier river and so that of the rb gw the ca hco3 water type of lb gw has been already described by several authors négrel et al 2004 vanderhaeghe and prognon 2012 mohammed et al 2014 and corresponds to many alluvial aquifers in france roux 2006 and over the world chkirbene et al 2009 andrade and stigter 2011 huang et al 2014 indeed because the mineral phases that composed alluvial aquifers do not generally impose a very marked geochemical type and because of short residence times within the aquifer alluvial gw presents frequently a ca hco3 water type roux 2006 4 2 auzon oxbow as a result of the mixing between end members 4 2 1 general features of auzon oxbow chemistry in a first approximation taking into account their origin perifluvial oxbows and main stream are supposed to have a similar chemical composition négrel et al 2003 however despite its still active connection with the allier river the auzon oxbow presents a mean ec value 300 µs cm 1 higher than allier river one 110 µs cm 1 but lower than gw 784 µs cm 1 in mean for observation boreholes of both banks this indicates that the auzon oxbow water results from a mixing between the low concentration water of the allier river and the more concentrated one of gw whatever the bank table 1 fig 4 fig 6 confirms this trend and highlights a clear evolution of the auzon oxbow between a na pole characterized by allier river and a more calcic end member delineated by lb gw rb gw water type is close to the auzon oxbow one and seems to result also from the mixing between allier river and lb gw the proximity of lb gw and le monteil spring confirms the contribution of the plateau aquifer to the alluvial gw this general feature is however not constant within the hydrological cycle records of april 2016 highlighted by the grey area of fig 4b show a decrease of auzon oxbow ec which reaches the value of allier river this specific period corresponds to one of the major floods that have affected the allier river during the study with a discharge flow of 150 m3 s 1 registered on the 04 06 16 fig 2d during this period the allier river penetrated further into the auzon oxbow this surface water arrival characterized by a low concentration affected the auzon oxbow up to b6 b7 showing constant ec this was a short time process since auzon oxbow recovered its pre flood concentration the month after fig 4b indicating that the oxbow restitutes quickly to the main stream what it absorbs during flood this time constrain phenomenon has already been quoted for oxbows by carrel and juget 1987 for the morte du sauget one of the rhône oxbows and for oxbows of ain river le coz 2003 pz4 records also an ec decrease in april 2016 in accordance with the inversion of the hydraulic gradient showed in hf piezometric map fig 3b 4 2 2 identification of punctual arrivals of gw within auzon oxbow to precise the downstream upstream evolution within the auzon oxbow a fine cartography of ec has been performed on the 11 23 2017 during a low flow stage allier river daily discharge 6 7 m3 s 1 fig 7 presents the results of this campaign and puts in evidence a difference between the upstream zone characterized by low ec values mainly in the range 0 250 µs cm 1 and iz and dz parts of the auzon oxbow with values comprised between 250 and 400 µs cm 1 this general pattern is disturbed by local arrivals of water a high ec is observed along the downstream zone left bank point 103 735 µs cm 1 fig 7 and testifies for a high concentration groundwater arrival on the contrary the whole upstream part is characterized by low ec in accordance with low concentration water incomes some of which were identified as coming from the bed of the oxbow points 3 as an example of the latter and 103 have been sampled for ions analyses physico chemical parameters and ions concentrations of samples acquired on the 11 23 24 2017 for the points 3 103 and the 21 followed sites are reported in table 2 results show that point 103 presents a ca hco3 signature pretty close to that of lb gw fig 8 and especially pz4 table 2 fig 8 pz4 shows higher no3 13 1 mg l 1 probably due to a contamination of alluvial gw but not transmitted or degraded before the transfer lb gw to auzon oxbow the low concentration water arrival located at the uz end of the oxbow point 3 presents a ca na hco3 water type similar to allier river one table 2 fig 8 this is in accordance with an upstream supply by the allier river the water arrival of point 3 was coming from the bed of the oxbow which indicates that this supply is realized through underground inflows the location of these low concentration water arrivals directly close to the paleochannel visible in the landscape suggests that an old and deeper channel connects auzon oxbow to allier river the potential recharge by underground paleochannels because of their high hydraulic conductivity has already been observed rathore et al 2010 babka et al 2011 therefore to verify the present hypothesis an ert sounding has been performed on the 02 21 2018 high flow period allier river daily discharge 57 3 m3 s 1 see part 3 3 the location of the profile is indicated in fig 1c oriented sse nnw the profile was designed perpendicularly to the visible paleochannel and close to the upstream end of the auzon oxbow indeed electrical resistivity sounding has already been used to investigate subsurface paleochannel geometry architecture and hydrodynamic sinha et al 2013 as well as fresh gw discharge through a paleochannel kolker et al 2013 the resulting ert profile indicates a general decrease of the electrical resistivity with depth fig 9 two main zones can however be observed in the first one from surface to 8 10 m depth resistivity varies laterally the southern part of the profile along with the 48 first lateral meters on fig 9 presents a relatively low resistivity ρ 150 350 ω m 1 compared to the rest of the section ρ 600 ω m 1 it can be interpreted as a sand formation saturated with freshwater sinha et al 2013 this is consistent with the presence of the paleochannel of the allier river fig 1c which higher porosity induces lower resistivity archie 1942 in addition there is lateral resistivity change within the paleochannel which most likely reflects the progressive filling of the system and a potential connection to the river blue circle on fig 9 the second zone starts below 10 m depth with low resistivity values and corresponds to the oligocene marl substratum lasnier and marchand 1982 korobova et al 1997 this paleochannel supplies the auzon oxbow with low concentration water and explains the low ec and the water types observed in the upstream part of the auzon oxbow and in the near surface piezometer p7 fig 1c the repartition of auzon oxbow points along the mixing line of the fig 6 with b7 closer to the allier river end member than b2 is thus explained for information a simple estimation of contribution percentages of allier river and lb gw to the oxbow at its different sampling locations can therefore been deduced from the fig 6 data indeed considering that the chemical characteristics of the allier river end member point 30 2 mg l 1 of hco3 and a na ca ratio of 0 95 represent 100 of contribution from the main stream and that those of lb gw 302 6 mg l 1 of hco3 and a na ca ratio of 0 23 represent 0 it is easy to deduce the contributions of those end member to the oxbow at the different sampling sites so it was logically estimated that b2 the closest location to the confluence and b7 the closest location to the paleochannel arrival were mostly and equally fed by the allier river with respectively 63 and 64 of contribution the rest of the oxbow would be according to these strictly indicative estimates as much fed by the river as by the alluvial groundwater 49 of allier river contribution for b3 50 for b4 and 51 for b2bis and b6 those estimates would imply that alluvial groundwater contributions to the auzon oxbow are not negligible and that in terms of contribution share the river contributes as much by the confluence as by the upstream paleochannel to the oxbow water supply 4 2 3 use of δ2h and δ18o of the water molecule for temporal insight the 2h 18o stable isotopes of the water molecule constitute one of the best water tracer since it provides information about water origins as well as water mixing processes through the hydrological cycle fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1999 for the study of wetlands they allow approaching their functioning hunt et al 1998 clay et al 2004 and more peculiarly to characterize the isotopic content of the different supplying sources or the auzon oxbow babka et al 2011 according to the temperature amount altitudinal and continental effects rozanski et al 2001 for coherent interpretations data from april to november 2017 period of the concomitant investigation of all sites have been selected among the database allier river 8 0 δ18o 52 0 δ2h and rb gw 8 1 δ18o 53 2 δ2h present the most depleted isotopic content the lb gw 7 7 δ18o 51 5 δ2h and le monteil spring 7 3 δ18o 50 0 δ2h are characterized by more enriched signatures as previously referred by négrel et al 2003 and by mohammed et al 2014 allier river displays a clear seasonal variation fig 10 a with depleted values during winter and more generally during hf period around 8 5 δ18o than for summer around 7 5 mainly due to the temperature effect on precipitation fig 10b shows δ2hvsmow vs δ18ovsmow means for auzon oxbow sampling sites and its end members taking into account the high variability of the allier river data all the measurements have been plotted individually precipitation is represented by the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and more regionally by the local meteoric water line lmwl proposed by petelet giraud et al 2005 with a local average of δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 and low altitude rainfalls of cournon 03 13 33 e 45 44 54 n elevation 327 m period 2013 2016 auverwatch database 2018 celle jeanton 2017 all data follow a trend line between lmwl and local precipitation of cournon rainfall the more depleted signal is characterized by the samples of allier river during hf 8 5 δ18o 55 0 δ2h while the more enriched by the allier river lf ones 7 4 δ18o 49 1 δ2h lb gw 7 7 δ18o 51 5 δ2h and le monteil spring 7 3 δ18o 50 0 δ2h allier river hf data follow the lmwl and are representative of the colder and higher altitude precipitation the more enriched and evaporated signal of allier river lf is explained by low altitude precipitation summer local storms and or local gw supply this is consistent with the previous conclusions based on hydrodynamic data that showed relationships between low flow surface water and groundwater with more enriched gw during summer due to evaporation process geyh and mook 2000 mohammed et al 2014 auzon oxbow isotopic data are well plotted along a mixing line between allier river hf and isotopically enriched waters auzon oxbow dz b2 and b2bis presents the more enriched and evaporated signal close to that of the lb gw the heavy isotopes content globally decreases up to the uz b7 fig 10b on a temporal scale evolution of isotopic data in the auzon oxbow tends to homogenize and the 3 identified zones dz b2bis iz b4 and uz b7 present in winter period the same isotopic content fig 10a this behavior is partly explained by previous observations dz is subject to a double supply through its connection to the allier river at the confluence and lb gw inputs point 103 the later explains the more enrich isotopes contents and its important variations through time b7 has been shown to be supplied by allier river that inflows to the auzon oxbow through the subsurface paleochannel however b7 presents a behavior completely different from the one of allier river and isotopic values of b7 match only the allier river ones during winter high flow period fig 10a this observation provides precision about the recharge of the auzon oxbow from the paleochannel that occurs only seasonally during hf periods as for the rb gw indeed according to the hydrodynamic monitoring the rb gw recharge through inversion of the hydraulic gradient during hf which is also in agreement with the depleted isotopic values observed for rb gw 4 3 conceptual model of the auzon oxbow the multidisciplinary analysis between hydrodynamic geochemical and isotopic approaches carried out at the dense soahal observatory allows establishing a reliable conceptual model of the hydrodynamical functioning of the auzon oxbow fig 11 as expected for that kind of perifluvial environments rollet et al 2005 interactions between the oxbow and both the main stream and the alluvial aquifer were identified since the auzon oxbow is disconnected from the main stream in its upstream end for the last 30 years the allier river supplies the oxbow generally through the downstream confluence surface water flows on fig 11 however during major flood events the main stream can submerge the right bank and then supply the entire oxbow area geochemical data show another interaction between the allier river and the auzon oxbow through the upstream underground paleochannel recognized both via geochemical analysis and geophysical investigations a detailed isotopic analysis has shown that this auzon oxbow area has a similar isotopic signature than allier river during high flow periods only this observation implies that the paleochannel is active from november to june only this is in agreement with the results of hydrodynamic and geochemical approaches which identified existing pathways from surface water to alluvial groundwater during the same periods high flow gw flows on fig 11 the coupling approach also testifies for a supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater this especially affects the water composition in its downstream part as this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the allier river groundwater supply could have been underestimated otherwise that connection with the adjunct alluvial aquifer is active during low flow fig 11 lb gw are mainly supplied by the southern part of alluvial aquifer and the neighboring agricultural plateau permanent gw flows on fig 11 except during high floods when small gradient inversions can drive pathways from surface water to groundwater the active connection existing between the auzon oxbow and the allier river through the underground paleochannel would not have been identified and specified without the geochemical and isotopic approaches a standard hydrodynamic study based on their apparent geomorphological surface connection would have produced an incomplete understanding of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem besides while studies attest for the importance of oxbow connection degree to the main stream on the water quality carrel and juget 1987 bengen et al 1992 it is mostly based on the type of surface connection observed between the two water bodies oxbow isolated from the river or connected through one or two sides as ward et al 2002 described those observations indeed inform about the extent of the hydrological connection that impacts the water chemistry of oxbows tockner et al 1999 glińska lewczuk 2009 especially for instance for metals contaminations ciazela et al 2018 however the present study show that consequent underground connection can also occur between the main stream and the oxbow through paleochannel as already suggested by babka et al 2011 increasing so their apparent connection degree and impacting the water chemistry of the oxbow therefore the possibility of underground connectivity to the main stream should be further considered in oxbows hydrogeological studies applying multidisciplinary approach as the one performed on the auzon oxbow should so be essential to the establishment of reliable conceptual models and to their resulting management applications 5 conclusions in a near future wetlands like oxbows are assumed to become more and more determinant as nature based solutions to respond to hydrological river discharge control and ecological excess nutrients removal function concerns therefore the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems must be fully understood however the establishment of complete and useful functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can have these specific wetlands with the surrounding water masses the task is all the more difficult since it is usually undertaken through individual investigation approach which can neglect or underestimate some supply components the objectives of the present study were so to provide effective diagnostic tools to evaluate oxbow connection degree to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer in order to be able to establish a complete hydrodynamic description of such hydrosystems the auzon oxbow conservation is the subject of local regional great concerns especially for the local fishing associations in fact hydrodynamic and hydrochemical features of auzon oxbow have a direct impact on its ecological functions as reproduction and refuge areas for emblematic fishes such as trouts this study so proposed the coupling of hydrodynamic geochemical and isotopic approaches to produce a model which can serve as a reference state for further operations of conservation and management of the auzon oxbow the conceptual model thus produced attests to a greater degree of connection than expected between the auzon oxbow and both the main stream and the alluvial aquifer indeed despite their surface upstream disconnection for the last 30 years the study proved that allier river supplies the oxbow through the downstream confluence and through the upstream underground paleochannel besides the model attests to a non negligible supply of the auzon oxbow by the adjunct alluvial aquifer the current model can however be improved by completing the present hydrodynamic monitoring set with hydrological stations within the oxbow one at the upstream ends of its downstream zone to compare data with the current hydrological station of the confluence and one at the upstream end of the oxbow close to the paleochannel water arrival flowrates measurements must indeed be performed in order to be able to quantify the water fluxes identified in this paper thus the auzon oxbow role to manage flood events in the allier river system would be evaluated besides the impact of the allier river arrival through the paleochannel on the water level of the upstream zone of the oxbow would be assessed furthermore such reliable conceptual models can be used for further applications strategic wetlands operations or water quality managements responding to environmental and or ecological issues indeed such hydrodynamic knowledges on hydrosystems constitute an essential requirement to understand the transport of polluting substances by water the conceptual hydrodynamic scheme coupled with the contaminants observations can support the assessment of the origin s and fate s of pollutants within wetlands hydrosystems and the identification of potential remediation processes occurences the present conceptual model of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem is currently used to assess the role of that wetland regarding to excess nutrients and emerging molecules dynamics the study here proved that coupling several investigation approaches such as hydrodynamic surface water and groundwater levels geochemical physico chemical parameters and ionic concentrations and isotopic δ2h δ18o of the water molecule monitorings actually efficiently supports the identification of water supply sources to the wetland through space and time indeed while the hydrodynamic approach gives general informations about surface water groundwater interactions the geochemical and isotopic approaches complete the overview by identifying the origin of water imaging the hydrochemistry of the oxbow and following the evolution of hydrodynamical and chemical parameters within time spatial and temporal disparities in the oxbow connection degree to the main stream and to the alluvial groundwater are proved to largely depend on river discharge during low and high flows besides relevance of considering the degree of underground connection between the oxbow and the river was highlighted the used of the multidisciplinary approach proposed here to image oxbows is then very promising declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the study was funded by the european regional development fund erdf 2014 2020 through the cper project les phytosanitaires du champ à l assiette the authors also thank the auvergne rhône alpes region for its financial support

6240,wetlands as oxbows play a fundamental socio economic and environmental role they behave as efficient tools in regards to hydrological and ecological concerns they contribute to control rivers discharge flood prevention and contribution to drought flow as well as to manage water quality excess nutrients retention and they constitute refuge habitats for flora and fauna they may so become more and more determinant as nature based solutions in a near future however the establishment of complete and reliable functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can present these specific wetlands to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer moreover monodisciplinary approaches usually conducted can underestimate or even neglect sources of water supply the present study offers a multidisciplinary approach coupling hydrodynamic surface water groundwater levels geochemical t ec ph major ions and isotopic δ2h δ18o characterization in order to properly assess the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems and so be able to establish a complete and reliable hydrodynamic conceptual model the coupling approach has been tested on the auzon oxbow one of the fluvial annexes of the allier river massif central france the resulting conceptual model testifies for connection degree higher that expected between the oxbow and both the main stream and alluvial aquifer indeed a non negligible supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater is observed especially in its downstream part as this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the allier river groundwater supply could have been underestimated the geochemical approach shows that allier river also supply the oxbow through the upstream paleochannel result of a channel migration 30 years ago hydrodynamic and isotopic approaches complete the understanding showing that the paleochannel pathway is only active during high flow periods from november to june based on these results the

surface ground water interaction hydrochemistry stable isotopes 1 introduction wetlands were subject of various scientific considerations in recent decades and benefit from specific international convention especially as waterfowl habitat ramsar convention 1971 they are indeed particularly recognized to preserve the ecological function of hydrosystems ecological niches refuge areas however during the last decades the general intensification of pollution has led to the contamination of most of the water bodies with negative effects on aquatic ecosystems human health productive activities water system reliability and operating costs for water use gleick 1998 bates et al 2008 hulton 2012 sutton et al 2013 unep 2016 in the meantime a world loss of about 64 71 of natural wetlands is to deplore since 1900 because of human activities davidson 2014 locally some sectors are especially affected with for instance percentage of wetlands lost reaching 91 for the california state between the 1780 s and the 1980 s dahl 1990 actions have been therefore implemented in order 1 to preserve or restore wetlands 2 to complete the knowledge on their functioning and 3 to communicate about the necessity of maintaining such environments these are the objectives for instance of the 3rd national action plan for wetlands in france pnmh 2014 and of the united states geological survey fretwell et al 1996 as a special feature of wetlands oxbows are generated by spatial and temporal dynamics of rivers within their floodplains that kind of perifluvial environments are of a major ecological importance for the habitat and diversity of fauna and vegetation oxbows indeed promote reproduction and provide refuge areas for biotic communities especially fishes bornette et al 1998 ghosh and biswas 2017 yang et al 2018 however since an oxbow is a floodplain annex it can be supplied by local precipitation main stream s water alluvial groundwater from the bank between the river and the oxbow and from the bank delineating the alluvial plain rollet et al 2005 therefore the whole ecosystem of oxbows depends largely on hydrodynamic conditions and more peculiarly on the mixing between water masses through hydrological connectivity to the main stream and or the alluvial groundwater dahm et al 1998 amoros and bornette 2002 it is now widely recognized that maintaining oxbows in riparian areas contributes to control floods occurrence to stabilize river base flows during dry periods to enhance the water quality by nutrient retention and to preserve ecosystems winter et al 1998 alard et al 2001 bullock and acreman 2003 larocque et al 2016 however obtain a complete hydrological knowledge about oxbows dynamic remains challenging various monodisciplinary approaches implying mostly hydrodynamic but also hydrochemistry carrel and juget 1987 bengen et al 1992 le coz 2003 babka et al 2011 hudson et al 2012 have been tested separately however such focused investigations can lead to neglect or underestimate contributions of connected water masses to the whole functioning of the oxbow which may produce unaccurate conceptual models to water managers multidisciplinary approach carried out on a representative and spatially distributed sampling network boreholes and surface water points covering both the selected wetland and the connected water masses of the whole hydrosystem constitute an integrated solution to insure the most complete hydrological understanding of the system and therefore contribute effectively to wetlands and rivers preservation actions restoration rehabilitation remeandering the present study is carried out on the auzon oxbow one of the fluvial annexes of the allier river massif central france fig 1 a located in the upper allier river basin ecological concerns surround that specific oxbow especially since it constitutes trout s reproduction and refuge areas consequently local fishing associations carried out conservation operation as the dredging of alluvial plugs to maintain its connectivity to the main stream beauger et al 2015 as an experimental site of the soahal observatory système d observation d une annexe hydraulique de l allier a complete monitoring of the hydrosystem including surface and groundwater with a dense spatial resolution 20 sampling sites for 0 4 km2 has been organized from 2014 the objectives are to provide effective diagnostic tools to evaluate the connection degree of the auzon oxbow to the allier river the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer and thus to establish a complete hydrodynamic description of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem to achieve that goal the strategy was to combine individual investigation approaches through a multidisciplinary analysis on both

intensively exploited for drinking water supply and agricultural purposes as it is the case on the study site thanks to its geomorphology and location auzon oxbow is considered as an active floodplain oxbow babka et al 2011 it was formed by the migration of an old channel of the allier river which occurred during two flood events in 1988 and 1989 a former gravel pit located in the point bar has facilitated the cutoff process leading to the main channel abandon upper part of the channel was rapidly in filled by sands and gravels since then only the downstream end remains connected to the main

water table in the 6 observation boreholes have been recorded on an hourly basis with an in situ level troll 500 probe all water level data have been corrected from the barometric pressure variations the hydrological station was located on lb prior to the 11 05 2015 a1 fig 1c and then moved to rb a2 fig 1c because of a too important erosion of the left bank during previous floods geographical coordinates and elevation of each pressure sensor were measured using the centimetric trimble r10 dgps whose data was post processed with trimble business center software version 3 8 and adjusted according to the dimensions of the boreholes in order to calculate level variations through time in the same reference of altitude cunningham and schalk 2011 the reliability of the continuous piezometric levels monitoring was checked and validated through manual measurements carried out during the 40 sampling campaigns correlation coefficients between data recorded and manually measured r2 from 0 92 to 0 99 testify for a good representativeness of the piezometric level time series 3 2 water chemistry monitoring forty sampling campaigns have been performed on the 21 sampling sites on a monthly basis from july 2014 to november 2017 except in february 2017 when the alluvial plain was flooded a few data are also missing for p7 because of small floods or vandalism prior to sampling bottles have been rinsed two times by using the water to be sampled surface waters and le monteil spring were directly sampled using sampling vials groundwater was sampled using a cole parmer masterflex i s pump for near surface piezometers while it was a 12 v standard pvc narrow diameter submersible pump for the observation boreholes for each groundwater sampling stagnating water present

electrical resistivity tomography ert is a geophysical method providing images of electrical resistivity ρ inverse of conductivity of the subsurface ert is generally used to characterize the lithology and the geometry of the ground to assess its saturation or even to monitor soil pollution loke 2011 the technique consists of injecting current in a pair of electrodes set into the ground and measuring the resulting potential difference between another dipole of electrodes which yields information about ρ a 2d ert survey was carried out on the soahal observatory on the 02 21 2018 in order to investigate potential underground connections between auzon oxbow and allier river the data collection was done by using a syscal r1 iris instruments with a wenner schlumberger electrode configuration loke and barker 1996 an array of 72 electrodes was installed distributed every 3 m along a nnw sse line fig 1c the apparent resistivity data were inverted with res2dinv software loke

peaks have been registered equal or superior to 150 m3 s 1 156 m3 s 1 on the 11 29 2014 and 150 m3 s 1 on the 04 06 16 fig 2 d these events are quite moderate compared to the large floods that allier river can historically experience 10y flood and 50y flood 590 and 840 m3 s 1 respectively banque hydro n d annual discharge variations are observed with globally low flow lf periods during the warmest months from july to october with an average flow rate around 14 m3 s 1 while high flow hf periods including important flood events occur along the rest of the year with an average flow rate around 32 m3 s 1 this lf hf distribution over time is more consistent with variations of precipitation recorded in the upstream mountainous area mohammed et al 2014 whose naussac weather station is the witness fig 2a than the local ones represented by sainte florine weather station on fig 2a however the maximum flood peak of 328 m3 s 1 is actually related to high precipitation recorded at both stations suggesting a generalized rainfall event linked to a cevénol episode a climatic phenomenon more and more frequent these last few years with rainy events that mainly affects the cevennes mountain range and piedmont which often cause severe floods in the massif central region jubertie 2006 gay 2015 on the contrary flood peak occurring the 01 26 2017 seems to be only due to high altitude precipitation rainfall event is actually only recorded at naussac weather station finally flood peak recorded the 08 30 2017 is caused by a stormy event affecting saint florine weather station only these examples emphasize that discharge variations recorded for allier river are related to a large set of meteorological conditions affecting the entire allier basin including rapid winter temperature elevation with or without rainfall causing snow melting jubertie 2006 water level variations at the auzon oxbow allier river confluence solid black lines in fig 2b and c are consistent with discharge variations of the allier river recorded at agnat pont d auzon station fig 2d it shows the accuracy of the in situ surface water level monitoring which was therefore crossed with water table monitoring for piezometric mapping triangular interpolation fig 3 a and b present lf 08 04 2015 and hf 04 06 2016 piezometric maps respectively these two dates are identified on fig 2d the lf piezometric map indicates a global northward circulation of groundwater gw and identified gw as a potential end member supplying auzon oxbow water level time series observation fig 2b and c shows that pz1 and pz2 rb as well as pz4 lb present very impulsive variations they were pretty close to the water level variations at the confluence auzon oxbow allier river moreover in hf piezometric levels were lower than surface water levels with 0 7 of the records at pz1 0 3 at pz2 and 4 at pz4 this observation suggests that gw are supplied by surface water whatever bank considered during hf pz3 pz5 and pz6 lb show smoother signals fig 2b most of the lb piezometric level variations remained consistent with the surface water level variations the hf piezometric map illustrates the hydrodynamic situation during the third most important flood event of the studied period this flood was linked to a large rainfall event which affected the whole allier river catchment fig 2a the map can be used to identify potential hydrodynamic changes compared to lf situation then an inversion of the hydraulic gradient is induced by high surface water level recorded at the auzon oxbow allier river confluence it affects gw on both auzon oxbow banks however in the rb inversion is reduced to a gw flow inversion from pz2 to pz1 since the allier river discharge just began to decline while the rb is still in charge on the lb inversion seemed to extend from surface water to pz5 passing through pz4 actually during that hf event as generally for all hf recordings pz4 levels varied synchronously with the surface water level up to inversion of hydraulic gradient while the other lb boreholes remained stable pz5 included pz3 piezometric level starts to increase only 24 h after the rise of surface water level the response delay of pz5 and pz6 is about 26 h besides pz5 piezometric level stays lower than the one of pz6 inducing a piezometric depression the delay between the increase in surface water level and that of the more inland lb boreholes suggests that the hydraulic gradient inversion is limited to pz4 this hydrodynamic feature can be explained by high disparities existing within the alluvial deposits from silts to gravels teles et al 2004 ounaïes et al 2013 sarris et al 2018 these 3d heterogeneities lead to variations in water flows distribution within the aquifer to summarize hydrodynamic data highlight that during lf auzon oxbow is supplied by gw during hf an inversion of the hydraulic gradient is recorded and auzon oxbow contributes to the recharge of gw rb is entirely concerned by this recharge while only the oxbow closest borehole pz4 is affected in the lb fig 3b the important time delay observed between surface water flood peaks and gw recharge at pz3 pz5 and pz6 from 24 to 26 h indicates that lb gw is mainly recharged by the southern gw system 4 1 2 physico chemical data for the 21 sample sites physico chemical parameters measurements water temperature t ph electrical conductivity ec as well as ions concentrations and water stable isotopes determinations are presented in table 1 with average arithmetic means minimum maximum and standard deviation values ec vs t

with an increasing distance to the auzon oxbow from pz4 to pz3 the ph values are comprised between 6 5 and 8 8 table 1 which is consistent with natural water ph usually ranging from 6 5 to 9 5 the more neutral values have been recorded in gw and are assumed to be due to the buffering capacity of soils ec and t values were the most interesting physico chemical parameters to differentiate water end members fig 4 allier river ec is the lowest one within the study site 110 17 µs cm 1 table 1 without any significant variations during the year fig 4b on the contrary t experiences high amplitudes

stable signal with no clearly identified seasonal variations fig 4b p3 and p5 the two remaining lb near surface piezometers fig 1c present similar ec and t patterns fig 4a and table 1 le monteil spring shows a high ec value 925 µs cm 1 table 1 and low amplitude of t 6 7 c table 1 which is consistent with the lb gw fig 4a 4 1 3 hydrochemical data hydrochemical data of table 1 have been plotted on a piper diagram fig 5 in order to define the geochemical water types of each end member water types are distributed between two groups with a noticeable difference in the cations content the first group has a ca na hco3 type and includes allier river pz1 pz2 rb gw p2 p4 p6 p9 rb near surface piezometers p7 lb near surface piezometer and then the second group presents a ca hco3 signature and corresponds to pz3 to pz6 lb gw p3 and p5 the two remaining lb near surface piezometers and le monteil spring then the gw signal shows a clear distribution between rb and lb rb gw are predominantly supplied by allier river whereas lb gw chemical facies is consistent with the one of the plateau aquifer le monteil this is in agreement with hydrodynamic data p7 can be quoted as an exception to this rb lb gw distribution as this lb near surface piezometer presents physico chemical and geochemical characteristics close to the rb gw ones chemical difference between allier river as well as rb gw and lb gw is due to the geological composition of the watershed actually the ca na hco3 water type of the allier river can be related to the volcano metamorphic basement upstream of the study site the allier river incised the basement while downwards the riverbed widens within the brioude basin where an enrichment in calcareous nodules between vieille brioude and the study site has been documented lasnier and marchand 1982 carbonate dissolution occurrences are reported in the allier river and the shallow gw associated négrel et al 2004 sodium minerals subjects to weathering are reported as common in the allier terraces as augite green and brown hornblende and nepheline rudel 1963 pastre 1986 veldkamp and jongmans 1990 which explain the na enriched signature of the allier river and so that of the rb gw the ca hco3 water type of lb gw has been already described by several authors négrel et al 2004 vanderhaeghe and prognon 2012 mohammed et al 2014 and corresponds to many alluvial aquifers in france roux 2006 and over the world chkirbene et al 2009 andrade and stigter 2011 huang et al 2014 indeed because the mineral phases that composed alluvial aquifers do not generally impose a very marked geochemical type and because of short residence times within the aquifer alluvial gw presents frequently a ca hco3 water type roux 2006 4 2 auzon oxbow as a result of the mixing between end members 4 2 1 general features of auzon oxbow chemistry in a first approximation taking into account their origin perifluvial oxbows and main stream are supposed to have a similar chemical composition négrel et al 2003 however despite its still active connection with the allier river the auzon oxbow presents a mean ec value 300 µs cm 1 higher than allier river one 110 µs cm 1 but lower than gw 784 µs cm 1 in mean for observation boreholes of both banks this indicates that the auzon oxbow water results from a mixing between the low concentration water of the allier river and the more concentrated one of gw whatever the bank table 1 fig 4 fig 6 confirms this trend and highlights a clear evolution of the auzon oxbow between a na pole characterized by allier river and a more calcic end member delineated by lb gw rb gw water type is close to the auzon oxbow one and seems to result also from the mixing between allier river and lb gw the proximity of lb gw and le monteil spring confirms the contribution of the plateau aquifer to the alluvial gw this general feature is however not constant within the hydrological cycle records of april 2016 highlighted by the grey area of fig 4b show a decrease of auzon oxbow ec which reaches the value of allier river this specific period corresponds to one of the major floods that have affected the allier river during the study with a discharge flow of 150 m3 s 1 registered on the 04 06 16 fig 2d during this period the allier river penetrated further into the auzon oxbow this surface water arrival characterized by a low concentration affected the auzon oxbow up to b6 b7 showing constant ec this was a short time process since auzon oxbow recovered its pre flood concentration the month after fig 4b indicating that the oxbow restitutes quickly to the main stream what it absorbs during flood this time constrain phenomenon has already been quoted for oxbows by carrel and juget 1987 for the morte du sauget one of the rhône oxbows and for oxbows of ain river le coz 2003 pz4 records also an ec decrease in april 2016 in accordance with the inversion of the hydraulic gradient showed in hf piezometric map fig 3b 4 2 2 identification of punctual arrivals of gw within auzon oxbow to precise the downstream upstream evolution within the auzon oxbow a fine cartography of ec has been performed on the 11 23 2017 during a low flow stage allier river daily discharge 6 7 m3 s 1 fig 7 presents the results of this campaign and puts in evidence a difference between the upstream zone characterized by low ec values mainly in the range 0 250 µs cm 1 and iz and dz parts of the auzon oxbow with values comprised between 250 and 400 µs cm 1 this general pattern is disturbed by local arrivals of water a high ec is observed along the downstream zone left bank point 103 735 µs cm 1 fig 7 and testifies for a high concentration groundwater arrival on the contrary the whole upstream part is characterized by low ec in accordance with low concentration water incomes some of which were identified as coming from the bed of the oxbow points 3 as an example of the latter and 103 have been sampled for ions analyses physico chemical parameters and ions concentrations of samples acquired on the 11 23 24 2017 for the points 3 103 and the 21 followed sites are reported in table 2 results show that point 103 presents a ca hco3 signature pretty close to that of lb gw fig 8 and especially pz4 table 2 fig 8 pz4 shows higher no3 13 1 mg l 1 probably due to a contamination of alluvial gw but not transmitted or degraded before the transfer lb gw to auzon oxbow the low concentration water arrival located at the uz end of the oxbow point 3 presents a ca na hco3 water type similar to allier river one table 2 fig 8 this is in accordance with an upstream supply by the allier river the water arrival of point 3 was coming from the bed of the oxbow which indicates that this supply is realized through underground inflows the location of these low concentration water arrivals directly close to the paleochannel visible in the landscape suggests that an old and deeper channel connects auzon oxbow to allier river the potential recharge by underground paleochannels because of their high hydraulic conductivity has already been observed rathore et al 2010 babka et al 2011 therefore to verify the present hypothesis an ert sounding has been performed on the 02 21 2018 high flow period allier river daily discharge 57 3 m3 s 1 see part 3 3 the location of the profile is indicated in fig 1c oriented sse nnw the profile was designed perpendicularly to the visible paleochannel and close to the upstream end of the auzon oxbow indeed electrical resistivity sounding has already been used to investigate subsurface paleochannel geometry architecture and hydrodynamic sinha et al 2013 as well as fresh gw discharge through a paleochannel kolker et al 2013 the resulting ert profile indicates a general decrease of the electrical resistivity with depth fig 9 two main zones can however be observed in the first one from surface to 8 10 m depth resistivity varies laterally the southern part of the profile along with the 48 first lateral meters on fig 9 presents a relatively low resistivity ρ 150 350 ω m 1 compared to the rest of the section ρ 600 ω m 1 it can be interpreted as a sand formation saturated with freshwater sinha et al 2013 this is consistent with the presence of the paleochannel of the allier river fig 1c which higher porosity induces lower resistivity archie 1942 in addition there is lateral resistivity change within the paleochannel which most likely reflects the progressive filling of the system and a potential connection to the river blue circle on fig 9 the second zone starts below 10 m depth with low resistivity values and corresponds to the oligocene marl substratum lasnier and marchand 1982 korobova et al 1997 this paleochannel supplies the auzon oxbow with low concentration water and explains the low ec and the water types observed in the upstream part of the auzon oxbow and in the near surface piezometer p7 fig 1c the repartition of auzon oxbow points along the mixing line of the fig 6 with b7 closer to the allier river end member than b2 is thus explained for information a simple estimation of contribution percentages of allier river and lb gw to the oxbow at its different sampling locations can therefore been deduced from the fig 6 data indeed considering that the chemical characteristics of the allier river end member point 30 2 mg l 1 of hco3 and a na ca ratio of 0 95 represent 100 of contribution from the main stream and that those of lb gw 302 6 mg l 1 of hco3 and a na ca ratio of 0 23 represent 0 it is easy to deduce the contributions of those end member to the oxbow at the different sampling sites so it was logically estimated that b2 the closest location to the confluence and b7 the closest location to the paleochannel arrival were mostly and equally fed by the allier river with respectively 63 and 64 of contribution the rest of the oxbow would be according to these strictly indicative estimates as much fed by the river as by the alluvial groundwater 49 of allier river contribution for b3 50 for b4 and 51 for b2bis and b6 those estimates would imply that alluvial groundwater contributions to the auzon oxbow are not negligible and that in terms of contribution share the river contributes as much by the confluence as by the upstream paleochannel to the oxbow water supply 4 2 3 use of δ2h and δ18o of the water molecule for temporal insight the 2h 18o stable isotopes of the water molecule constitute one of the best water tracer since it provides information about water origins as well as water mixing processes through the hydrological cycle fontes 1980 clark and fritz 1997 kendall and mcdonnell 1999 for the study of wetlands they allow approaching their functioning hunt et al 1998 clay et al 2004 and more peculiarly to characterize the isotopic content of the different supplying sources or the auzon oxbow babka et al 2011 according to the temperature amount altitudinal and continental effects rozanski et al 2001 for coherent interpretations data from april to november 2017 period of the concomitant investigation of all sites have been selected among the database allier river 8 0 δ18o 52 0 δ2h and rb gw 8 1 δ18o 53 2 δ2h present the most depleted isotopic content the lb gw 7 7 δ18o 51 5 δ2h and le monteil spring 7 3 δ18o 50 0 δ2h are characterized by more enriched signatures as previously referred by négrel et al 2003 and by mohammed et al 2014 allier river displays a clear seasonal variation fig 10 a with depleted values during winter and more generally during hf period around 8 5 δ18o than for summer around 7 5 mainly due to the temperature effect on precipitation fig 10b shows δ2hvsmow vs δ18ovsmow means for auzon oxbow sampling sites and its end members taking into account the high variability of the allier river data all the measurements have been plotted individually precipitation is represented by the global meteoric water line gmwl of craig 1961 and more regionally by the local meteoric water line lmwl proposed by petelet giraud et al 2005 with a local average of δ2h 8 δ18o 13 7 and low altitude rainfalls of cournon 03 13 33 e 45 44 54 n elevation 327 m period 2013 2016 auverwatch database 2018 celle jeanton 2017 all data follow a trend line between lmwl and local precipitation of cournon rainfall the more depleted signal is characterized by the samples of allier river during hf 8 5 δ18o 55 0 δ2h while the more enriched by the allier river lf ones 7 4 δ18o 49 1 δ2h lb gw 7 7 δ18o 51 5 δ2h and le monteil spring 7 3 δ18o 50 0 δ2h allier river hf data follow the lmwl and are representative of the colder and higher altitude precipitation the more enriched and evaporated signal of allier river lf is explained by low altitude precipitation summer local storms and or local gw supply this is consistent with the previous conclusions based on hydrodynamic data that showed relationships between low flow surface water and groundwater with more enriched gw during summer due to evaporation process geyh and mook 2000 mohammed et al 2014 auzon oxbow isotopic data are well plotted along a mixing line between allier river hf and isotopically enriched waters auzon oxbow dz b2 and b2bis presents the more enriched and evaporated signal close to that of the lb gw the heavy isotopes content globally decreases up to the uz b7 fig 10b on a temporal scale evolution of isotopic data in the auzon oxbow tends to homogenize and the 3 identified zones dz b2bis iz b4 and uz b7 present in winter period the same isotopic content fig 10a this behavior is partly explained by previous observations dz is subject to a double supply through its connection to the allier river at the confluence and lb gw inputs point 103 the later explains the more enrich isotopes contents and its important variations through time b7 has been shown to be supplied by allier river that inflows to the auzon oxbow through the subsurface paleochannel however b7 presents a behavior completely different from the one of allier river and isotopic values of b7 match only the allier river ones during winter high flow period fig 10a this observation provides precision about the recharge of the auzon oxbow from the paleochannel that occurs only seasonally during hf periods as for the rb gw indeed according to the hydrodynamic monitoring the rb gw recharge through inversion of the hydraulic gradient during hf which is also in agreement with the depleted isotopic values observed for rb gw 4 3 conceptual model of the auzon oxbow the multidisciplinary analysis between hydrodynamic geochemical and isotopic approaches carried out at the dense soahal observatory allows establishing a reliable conceptual model of the hydrodynamical functioning of the auzon oxbow fig 11 as expected for that kind of perifluvial environments rollet et al 2005 interactions between the oxbow and both the main stream and the alluvial aquifer were identified since the auzon oxbow is disconnected from the main stream in its upstream end for the last 30 years the allier river supplies the oxbow generally through the downstream confluence surface water flows on fig 11 however during major flood events the main stream can submerge the right bank and then supply the entire oxbow area geochemical data show another interaction between the allier river and the auzon oxbow through the upstream underground paleochannel recognized both via geochemical analysis and geophysical investigations a detailed isotopic analysis has shown that this auzon oxbow area has a similar isotopic signature than allier river during high flow periods only this observation implies that the paleochannel is active from november to june only this is in agreement with the results of hydrodynamic and geochemical approaches which identified existing pathways from surface water to alluvial groundwater during the same periods high flow gw flows on fig 11 the coupling approach also testifies for a supply of the oxbow by the alluvial groundwater this especially affects the water composition in its downstream part as this part of the oxbow is the site of its confluence to the allier river groundwater supply could have been underestimated otherwise that connection with the adjunct alluvial aquifer is active during low flow fig 11 lb gw are mainly supplied by the southern part of alluvial aquifer and the neighboring agricultural plateau permanent gw flows on fig 11 except during high floods when small gradient inversions can drive pathways from surface water to groundwater the active connection existing between the auzon oxbow and the allier river through the underground paleochannel would not have been identified and specified without the geochemical and isotopic approaches a standard hydrodynamic study based on their apparent geomorphological surface connection would have produced an incomplete understanding of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem besides while studies attest for the importance of oxbow connection degree to the main stream on the water quality carrel and juget 1987 bengen et al 1992 it is mostly based on the type of surface connection observed between the two water bodies oxbow isolated from the river or connected through one or two sides as ward et al 2002 described those observations indeed inform about the extent of the hydrological connection that impacts the water chemistry of oxbows tockner et al 1999 glińska lewczuk 2009 especially for instance for metals contaminations ciazela et al 2018 however the present study show that consequent underground connection can also occur between the main stream and the oxbow through paleochannel as already suggested by babka et al 2011 increasing so their apparent connection degree and impacting the water chemistry of the oxbow therefore the possibility of underground connectivity to the main stream should be further considered in oxbows hydrogeological studies applying multidisciplinary approach as the one performed on the auzon oxbow should so be essential to the establishment of reliable conceptual models and to their resulting management applications 5 conclusions in a near future wetlands like oxbows are assumed to become more and more determinant as nature based solutions to respond to hydrological river discharge control and ecological excess nutrients removal function concerns therefore the dynamic of these specific hydrosystems must be fully understood however the establishment of complete and useful functioning models is complicated by the different connection degrees that can have these specific wetlands with the surrounding water masses the task is all the more difficult since it is usually undertaken through individual investigation approach which can neglect or underestimate some supply components the objectives of the present study were so to provide effective diagnostic tools to evaluate oxbow connection degree to the main stream and to the adjunct alluvial aquifer in order to be able to establish a complete hydrodynamic description of such hydrosystems the auzon oxbow conservation is the subject of local regional great concerns especially for the local fishing associations in fact hydrodynamic and hydrochemical features of auzon oxbow have a direct impact on its ecological functions as reproduction and refuge areas for emblematic fishes such as trouts this study so proposed the coupling of hydrodynamic geochemical and isotopic approaches to produce a model which can serve as a reference state for further operations of conservation and management of the auzon oxbow the conceptual model thus produced attests to a greater degree of connection than expected between the auzon oxbow and both the main stream and the alluvial aquifer indeed despite their surface upstream disconnection for the last 30 years the study proved that allier river supplies the oxbow through the downstream confluence and through the upstream underground paleochannel besides the model attests to a non negligible supply of the auzon oxbow by the adjunct alluvial aquifer the current model can however be improved by completing the present hydrodynamic monitoring set with hydrological stations within the oxbow one at the upstream ends of its downstream zone to compare data with the current hydrological station of the confluence and one at the upstream end of the oxbow close to the paleochannel water arrival flowrates measurements must indeed be performed in order to be able to quantify the water fluxes identified in this paper thus the auzon oxbow role to manage flood events in the allier river system would be evaluated besides the impact of the allier river arrival through the paleochannel on the water level of the upstream zone of the oxbow would be assessed furthermore such reliable conceptual models can be used for further applications strategic wetlands operations or water quality managements responding to environmental and or ecological issues indeed such hydrodynamic knowledges on hydrosystems constitute an essential requirement to understand the transport of polluting substances by water the conceptual hydrodynamic scheme coupled with the contaminants observations can support the assessment of the origin s and fate s of pollutants within wetlands hydrosystems and the identification of potential remediation processes occurences the present conceptual model of the auzon oxbow hydrosystem is currently used to assess the role of that wetland regarding to excess nutrients and emerging molecules dynamics the study here proved that coupling several investigation approaches such as hydrodynamic surface water and groundwater levels geochemical physico chemical parameters and ionic concentrations and isotopic δ2h δ18o of the water molecule monitorings actually efficiently supports the identification of water supply sources to the wetland through space and time indeed while the hydrodynamic approach gives general informations about surface water groundwater interactions the geochemical and isotopic approaches complete the overview by identifying the origin of water imaging the hydrochemistry of the oxbow and following the evolution of hydrodynamical and chemical parameters within time spatial and temporal disparities in the oxbow connection degree to the main stream and to the alluvial groundwater are proved to largely depend on river discharge during low and high flows besides relevance of considering the degree of underground connection between the oxbow and the river was highlighted the used of the multidisciplinary approach proposed here to image oxbows is then very promising declaration of competing interest none acknowledgments the study was funded by the

6241,the availability of québec canada river temperature data has improved significantly in recent years with increased monitoring effort and sharing of existing data although it is now recognized that this variable is of central interest in a variety of instream habitat issues the actual interpretation and use of the data by managers and researchers can be challenging due to the spatial sparsity of the measurement sites and to the unevenness of the length of the temperature time series in this paper we propose a model for all québec rivers thermal regimes as a means to interpret and exploit the available river temperature data the model based on fitting a gaussian function to time series of interannual mean daily temperatures was used to characterize the thermal regime at more than 400 locations in québec rivers the three parameters of the model annual maximum date of annual maximum and length of the warm season allowed to produce a first map of québec river thermal regimes a method to quantify the uncertainty on the parameters estimation taking into account the length of the time series and the interannual variability of the river temperature is presented finally stepwise regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the basins upstream of the measurement sites keywords river

2013 detecting and anticipating disturbances require systematic monitoring of river water temperature on the long term at appropriate spatial scales unfortunately such monitoring programs are rare

optimization of river temperature measurement networks daigle et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 as well as initiatives for the gathering of existing river temperature data into publicly available databases e g norwest isaak et al 2017 noreast stewart 2015 in eastern canada the rivtemp network boyer et al 2016 compiles daily water temperature at 705 sites in 321 watercourses and 139 main basins

growth potential and preservation on the other hand the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of measurement sites their variable and sometimes limited duration of annual time series and the small number of years with data for most sites hardly provides a readily comprehensive river thermal pattern and may limit the actual exploitation of the rivtemp data by managers and researchers the general behaviour of northern rivers thermal regimes is well known water temperature ranges from 0 c during a significant part of the year to a maximum that is typically reached within a week of that of air temperature caissie 2006 this seasonal pattern is critical for different life stages of instream species and governs the phenology of the entire lotic food chain salmonid fry emergence and growth rates are primarily dictated by water temperature cumulative degree days and duration of extreme temperature events elliott and elliott 2010 forseth et al 2010 jonsson and jonsson 2009 a river thermal regime is therefore an essential foundation in assessing and monitoring the quality of its habitats and its fish production potential in this work we propose a standardized characterization of québec canada rivers thermal regimes as a means to interpret and exploit the information collected as part of the rivtemp network specific objectives are to represent the thermal regimes of québec rivers using a standard and easily interpretable model to quantify model uncertainty based on available data to propose a first map of river thermal regimes in québec to relate the model parameters to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river 2 material and methods 2 1 rivtemp network the rivtemp network is a partnership among universities provincial and federal governments watershed groups and organizations dedicated to atlantic salmon conservation http rivtemp ca partners 2 lang en more than 38 groups have installed and are maintaining river temperature monitoring stations in salmon rivers across eastern canada the centralized database of river temperature is a major result of this collaboration across the province of quebec 433 monitoring sites installed on 158 rivers were operational for a period of one summer to 28 years between 1985 and 2017 among these 340 have less than 5 years of data the number of sites with more than 10 years of data is 26 the year to year number of active measurement sites is highly variable ranging from 1 in 1985 to 228 in 2016 and 0 in 1986 and 1988 prior to 2016 there is no active monitoring site north of latitude 52 5 n or west of longitude 73 3 w confining the network s geographical span to the vicinity of the st lawrence river valley and gulf and to the gaspésie region all measurements sites are point locations thus providing water temperature information at one specific point presumably representative of the cross section of the river as rivtemp is the result of many river temperature contributions and contributors details about the temperature loggers installation are generally not known but a deployment protocol is made available to current rivtemp partners measurement sites are assumed to be located in well mixed water with no vertical stratification and avoiding pools or shallow creeks this does not exclude eventual transversal stratification in large channels which was not taken into account neither were the effects of water level variation throughout the measurement season all sources adding to the data uncertainty data processing and quality checks are however performed on data before they are added to rivtemp including screening for outliers out of water days and data gaps the analysis presented here was performed on all 433 stations plus one on the richelieu river fig 1 the richelieu is not a salmon river and this additional station maintained by environment canada is thus not part of the rivtemp database it was included here because of its long water temperature record 15 years of data and rather warm thermal regime 2 2 standardized representation of québec rivers thermal regimes throughout this paper a river thermal regime is defined as the variation of the interannual mean daily

variance and size n 100 can be computed as meyer 1970 2 ci x t γ k s n x t γ k s n where x is the empirical mean t γ k is the order γ 1 α 2 quantile of the k degrees of freedom student t distribution with k n 1 and 3 s 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 is the unbiased estimator of the variance the confidence interval on a given t d value can thus be obtained from 2 assuming that the samples t n d are normally distributed one side of this ci corresponds to twice the distribution standard deviation σ 4 σ 1 2 t γ k s n the uncertainty on the t d values will hereafter be quantified by their σ value given a 95 confidence interval α 0 05 for very small 3 n values the σ obtained using 4 may take values larger than a reasonable estimate of the maximum year to year temperature variability for a given day a maximum value σmax was therefore evaluated for each d to this end interannual standard deviations of observed temperature at all site day for which n 8 were considered for d 46 feb 15 it is observed that the interannual standard deviation stays 0 5 c for d 46 the upper values were modeled as a function of d fig 2 eight years were considered to be a fair trade off given out data set between a sufficient number of years to estimate the daily interannual variability and the number of available site days obtained 6416 to evaluate the maximum year to year daily temperature variability increasing the number of years to 9 provides better estimates for interannual variability but fewer sites days 4544 are available for analysis conversely reducing the number of years to 7 results in more sites days 8891 but at the cost of less accurate estimates for the inter annual standard deviation in addition the day of the year and the normal air temperature at each site were used as a priori knowledge to further constraint the model days earlier than april 30 and later than december 25 for which no measurements were available and for which the air temperature had been negative during the previous 10 days were set to t 0 c for these days however the assigned value for σmax was doubled if d 120 april 30 in order to include the rare cases when the winter water temperature never reaches the freezing point e g groundwater fed streams conditions for the evaluation of σmax are summarized in table 1 air temperature data at each site was extracted from anusplin 10 km gridded interpolated climate data mckenney et al 2011 hopkinson et al 2011 hutchinson et al 2009 finally the uncertainty 95 confidence interval of a given interannual mean daily temperature value t d was evaluated as 2σ d with σ d given by 4 with the following exceptions for n 1 σ d σmax d for n 2 σ d min σ d 0 5σmax d this allows to prevent cases when the σ d value obtained with 4 is artificially small due to two fortuitously similar measurements if the σ d value obtained from 4 is greater than σmax d it is set to σmax d to prevent values larger than a reasonable estimate of the maximum year to year temperature variability for a given day even in the case of a small n 2 2 2 model selection the typical northern river thermal regime includes an extended period for which the water temperature is close to 0 c and a warmer period during which the temporal variation of water temperature takes a bell shaped curve this curve reaches its maximum approximately one week after air temperature during this ice free period water and air temperatures are generally correlated with a few days lag the lag and correlation vary in relation with the size of the river its exposure to solar radiation and the proportion of its flow fed by groundwater among other factors caissie 2006 garner et al 2014 o sullivan et al 2019 for example water temperature in a fairly wide river highly exposed to solar radiation and with a small groundwater flow contribution will correlate closely with air temperature whereas water temperature in a small stream in a forested area with mainly groundwater fed flow will be less correlated with air temperature and will thus show a smaller annual variability fig 3 these physiographic differences translate into differences in the amplitude and width of the bell shaped curve of temperature variation during the ice free period the wide river will typically reach a higher maximum temperature than the narrower groundwater fed stream while the latter might experience a longer ice free season and thus a greater seasonal temperature curve width river seasonal thermal regimes have often been modeled using sinusoidal functions or fourier series maheu et al 2016a caissie et al 2001 steele 1978 while a sinusoidal model provides a good description for the interannual mean daily water temperature as a function of time during the ice free season it is not valid during a significant part of the year when water temperature is 0 c therefore prior to the sinusoidal model fitting a decision must thus be made either as to the beginning and end of the fitting period i e the ice free season which varies from river to river or as to the minimum temperature to be taken into account in the fitting either way the fitting results are sensitive to the decision made and so is the correspondence between the sinusoidal function parameters and the thermal regime metrics because the model is fitted on part of the year only the mean value of the sine function does not correspond to the average annual temperature accordingly the sine function amplitude cannot be assimilated to the amplitude of the seasonal temperature cycle since it depends on the annual mean value moreover this ambiguity in the mean and amplitude parameters brings a degeneracy issue to the modeling sinusoidal functions with lower mean and greater amplitude or with higher mean and lower amplitude could show equivalent fitting performances for the same dataset several other bell shaped functions exist that are defined as 0 and thus would not require to be truncated a number of these were tested based on their capacity to represent thermal regimes at nine river measurement sites in québec for which daily data were available for more than nine years and for which at least one interannual value could be computed for every 365 days these functions are the gaussian asymmetric gaussian lognormal and beta functions all functions were fitted on interannual daily mean water temperature at all nine sites independently and the root mean squared errors rmse were computed 5 r m s e 1 365 d 1 365 t d t d 2 where t d is the observed interannual mean daily temperature on day d and t d is the estimated value by the fitted model for day d while all models showed a visually appropriate fit to the data fig 4 the best overall performance according to the rmse values was obtained by the asymmetric gaussian function lowest rmse value in 5 9 cases and lowest overall mean rmse value table 2 however the symmetrical gaussian model shows very similar rmse values 0 13 c differences and has fewer one less parameters than the asymmetric gaussian the model selected to represent the thermal regimes at all sites in the dataset is thus the gaussian function given by 6 t d a exp 1 2 d c b 2 where a is a scale factor b is the standard deviation and c the mean value most interesting with this choice of model is that its three parameters can be directly and uniquely related to meaningful properties of the thermal regime a is equal to the annual maximum value c is the day at which this maximum occurs and b is a measure of the length of the warm i e t 0 c period model parameters were estimated at all sites using the matlab nonlinear fitting function fitnlm the mathworks r2016b the fitting is an iterative procedure starting with initial parameter values and taking into account data weight values w giving more relative importance to data with higher weight values here weights were assigned to 7 w d m a x σ σ d 1 r a n g e σ 1 where w d is the weight assigned to the datum on day d max σ is the σ maximum value for all d and range σ is max σ min σ 2 3 evaluation of model uncertainty the uncertainty of a model fit can be measured by the confidence intervals on its parameters evaluated as part of the fitting procedure the widths of these confidence intervals however only depict the model accuracy level in representing the given data with no regards to data errors while the fitting procedure used here does take into account relative differences in the data precision it does not distinguish between an annual series of interannual means t obtained from two years of observations n 2 or an annual series obtained from 15 years of observations n 15 even if the latter is expected to be much more precise the model uncertainty should thus reflect the uncertainty or confidence intervals on the interannual mean daily values t 2 3 1 confidence intervals on the model parameters confidence intervals on the model parameters were evaluated by fitting the following extreme models that is models adjusted in order to reach minimum and maximum values of a b and c these extreme models are defined by considering the 25 lowest t confidence intervals 2σ during warm mild and cold periods of the year defined as follows fig 5 warm period interval d 1 c b 2 mild periods intervals d 2a c 3b 2 to c b 2 and d 2b c b 2 to c 3b 2 cold periods intervals d 3a 1 to c 3b 2 and d 3b c 3b 2to 365 days with σ values below the 25th percentile of the σ values in each period are identified and the extreme models are fitted given these days only black error bars in fig 5 this avoids an overestimation of the parameters uncertainties by making better use of the most precise t values available in each of the five periods and ignoring neighboring uncertain values extreme models are then obtained as follows model with the highest a value a max is obtained by fitting t 2σ values for all periods similarly model with the lowest a value a min was obtained by fitting t 2σ values for all periods model with lowest b value b min the shortest warm period is obtained by fitting t 2σ values during the warm period d 1 t 2σ values during the cold periods d 3a and d 3b and mean t values during the mild periods d 2a and d 2b similarly model with highest b value b max the longest warm period is obtained by fitting t 2σ values during the warm period t 2σ values during the cold periods and mean t values during the mild periods model with highest c value c max is obtained by fitting lower t values t σ in spring and early summer d 3a and d 2a periods higher t values t σ at the end of the summer and in fall d 2b and d 3b periods and mean t values during the warm period similarly model with lowest c value c min is obtained by fitting t σ values in spring and early summer t σ values at the end of the summer and in fall and mean t values during the warm period finally the confidence intervals on the model parameters are defined as a min 2se a a max 2se a b min 2se b b max 2se b and c min 2se c c max 2se c where the se are the standard errors on the parameter estimation by the nonlinear fitting procedure 2 4 model relation to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river relationships between the gaussian model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the river were investigated in order to limit error propagation in the analysis only those sites for which the uncertainties on the parameters a b and c were under given maximum values were considered basins upstream these sites were delineated and characterised given several physiographic and climatic variables known as potential water temperature drivers the variables showing significant correlation to parameters a b and c were then used as potential explanatory variables in stepwise regressions a stepwise regression is an iterative procedure used to include and or exclude explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression depending on their statistical significance in the model independent forward stepwise regressions were performed for each parameter a b and c using the stepwisefit matlab function the mathworks r2016b 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model uncertainty parameter uncertainty depends primarily on the length of the available time series as an example fig 6 shows the evolution of the parameters values and confidence intervals when the gaussian model is fitted on increasing numbers of daily observations at a measurement site in the trinité river for this specific time series the gaussian model parameters go from a b c 20 15 c 40 49 d 208 31 after one summer of data 112 daily observations to a b c 19 1 c 52 2 d 211 3 after 26 years 5485 daily observations one important observation is that the parameters final domains that is the values uncertainties obtained with all available data should be included in the parameter confidence intervals obtained with less data this would be an indication that the confidence intervals estimates obtained with fewer data adequately include more robust parameter estimates it was found that it is not always the case some confidence intervals do not include the very highest values or the very lowest values of the parameter domains obtained with fewer observations for example the small box in fig 6 highlights three parameter c domains obtained with 638 704 and 815 daily observations that exceed the highest value of the domain obtained with fewer 551 observations typically though these excursions represent a small fraction of the estimated parameter value when considering all 1606 year per year fits for all sites these excursions are 5 of estimated a b c values for 98 89 99 of the cases to evaluate the magnitude of the confidence intervals obtained on the three parameters as a function of the number of daily observations for all measurement sites the gaussian model was adjusted on the first year of data for all sites then on the first two years when more than a year was available then on the first three etc fig 7 illustrates the uncertainties obtained as a function of the number of daily observations the dashed vertical lines indicate the approximate number of corresponding years given that a year of river temperature measurement is often limited to the summer period here the approximate number of years is based on the median value for all year site of 149 daily observations year table 3 lists the median 5th and 95th percentiles of parameter uncertainties as a function of the time series approximate length in years the same exercise was done after a random permutation of the observation years at all sites and the results not shown were similar 3 2 standardized representation of québec rivers thermal regimes values of the gaussian model parameters adjusted to each of the the rivtemp québec sites data are shown in fig 8 the sizes of the circular markers are inversely proportional to the obtained confidence interval on the parameters as may be expected the largest values of parameter a maximum annual temperature 23 25 c are found in the southern half of the studied region the smallest values 10 c are found in gaspésie where elevations reach 500 m parameter b which can be associated with the length of the ice free season decreases with latitude and longitude and the parameter c values date of the maximum annual temperature seem to increase eastward 3 3 model relation to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river table 4 lists correlation values between the three model parameters and a number of physioclimatic variables correlations were computed and subsequent analysis were conducted considering only those sites for which model fits were estimated with parameter uncertainties δa δb and δc limited to 3 c 7 days and 7 days respectively the number of sites meeting these conditions is 48 the stepwise adjusted models for each a b and c parameters are summarized in table 5 models listed on the left were fitted with a forward stepwise procedure with no initial variable models listed on the right were fitted starting with one initial variable the mean daily max july air temperature julymaxt for parameter a model the mean duration of 0 c air temperature duration 0 for parameter b model and the mean date of annual maximum air temperature datemaxt for parameter c model this adjustment of the initial conditions did not change the parameter c model results datemaxt was removed from the model as part of the stepwise procedure and the same other variables were included for the parameter a model the julymaxt was removed and the basin centroid longitude basinlon was replaced by the longitude at site sitelon with slight improvements to the rmse and r 2 values variable duration 0 was retained in the parameter b model with the log transformed drainage area log da and the broadleaf forested cover broadleaf leading to better rmse and r 2 values fitting results from the second model listed on the right in table 5 are illustrated on fig 9 values on the horizontal axis are the ones obtained from the gaussian fits values on the vertical axis are the ones estimated from the physioclimatic variables with the stepwise regressions dashed lines are drawn at the 95th percentile of the 48 sites δa δb and δc values from the 1 1 solid line 4 discussion and conclusion the choice of a gaussian model to represent québec rivers thermal regimes was motivated by the need of a bell shaped function that did not require to be truncated during the frost season it has the main advantage of being described by a small number of independent and readily interpretable parameters while tests showed that the gaussian model provides good fits for the overall thermal regime shape as compared to other functions fig 4 table 2 it was observed that it does not always appropriately fit the thaw period in spring for example it can be seen on the top panel of fig 4 that the gaussian curve overestimates temperatures between days 80 and 140 in the romaine where the water stays frozen until day 110 and reaches 2 c only 18 days later from the time the river reaches 5 c however the gaussian fit follows the temperature values closely again for a study requiring precise representation of the thaw thermal conditions the use of another model could be more appropriate in the coming decades earlier thaw periods and decreased snow stocks and ice covers are to be expected this could lead to a more gradual warming of the water temperature closer to the gaussian curve in spring see for example the richelieu river fig 4 a number of empirically based choices had to be made in the evaluation of the model uncertainties the standard deviation value σ on the interannual mean daily water temperature t was limited as a function of the day of the year and air temperature fig 2 table 1 cold mild and warm periods had to be defined to fit the extreme models fig 5 only part of the estimated t those with σ 25th percentile of the period were used in these fits all conditions that could be adjusted or defined differently with consequential effects on the estimation of the model confidence intervals the robustness of the evaluated confidence intervals was tested by evaluating cases for which a parameter domain is not fully included in all domains obtained with less data see example on fig 6 for most cases these excursions represent 5 of the estimated parameter value and usually occur for domains obtained with 1 or 2 years of data the evaluated confidence intervals therefore seem reliable but should be interpreted with more caution when dealing with a small number of observations unsurprisingly parameters a b and c uncertainties remain high until the available time series length reaches a 3 5 year length fig 7 table 3 there seems to be a clear break in δa after a 5 year length is reached with most values 4 c differences in median and lowest 5th percentile uncertainties for all three parameters do not change much between 5 and 10 year series lengths but the largest 95th percentile uncertainties are typically divided by two for every doubling of the time series length table 3 to our knowledge the only other study quantifying uncertainty on river temperature metrics as a function of the length of the temperature series was presented by jones and schmidt 2018 who estimated metrics on randomized temperature series of increasing length at 73 locations in the u s and in ontario canada the metrics are not parameters of a model of the thermal regime but rather interannual means of descriptive statistics like monthly extrema and ranges the number of years required to obtain stated uncertainty thresholds varied depending on the metric thermal regimes are affected by climate and physiographic differences between river basins which translates into differences in the gaussian model parameter values stepwise adjusted regression models between each a b c parameter and climate and physiographic variables confirm significant empirical relationships table 5 some explanatory variables are highly inter correlated for example the climate variables show 85 95 inter correlations and thus show similar explanatory power the log transformed drainage area included in all models can be an indication of the relative subsurface and groundwater contribution to a river discharge small das are also often associated with headwater basins low exposure to weather conditions and therefore with cooler water this is consistent with the log da positive contribution to parameter a higher maximum annual temperature and with its negative contribution to parameters b shorter warm season and to parameter c more time needed to reach the annual maximum the present study is a first attempt at representing all quebec river thermal regimes with a single standardized model while many previous studies used a sinusoidal curve to characterize the thermal regime of streams and rivers in canada and the u s we propose a gaussian model this model offers the advantage of being adjustable beyond the ice free period without biasing the estimates a first map of meaningful descriptors for quebec rivers thermal regimes as measured at 400 point locations was produced in addition the present study provides a complete methodology to estimate uncertainties associated with the proposed model analysis of our limited dataset from the rivtemp database indicates that relatively robust estimations of the three parameters of the gaussian model can be obtained when more than 5 years of data are available stepwise regressions showed that the thermal regime shape is significantly related to some physioclimatic characteristics of the basin such as its size geographical location elevation climate and land use as reported by other studies of similar scales chu et al 2010 maheu et al 2016a the stepwise models presented here although informative are however essentially descriptive and should not be seen as confirmations of cause to effect relationships such as those formulated in physically based water temperature models this new approach to water temperature characterization opens new research avenues including the possible use of spot measurements in the fitting of the gaussian curve indeed there are large quantities of unused punctual measurements of water temperature that could enhance knowledge of river temperature regimes across north america and the world the present study only explored simple linear models of the gaussian model parameters as functions of physioclimatic variables further studies to better investigate potential predictors and more suitable models could provide more robust estimates for the gaussian model parameters such models could then be used to generate scenarios of future water temperature gaussian curves using future climate scenarios declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

6241,the availability of québec canada river temperature data has improved significantly in recent years with increased monitoring effort and sharing of existing data although it is now recognized that this variable is of central interest in a variety of instream habitat issues the actual interpretation and use of the data by managers and researchers can be challenging due to the spatial sparsity of the measurement sites and to the unevenness of the length of the temperature time series in this paper we propose a model for all québec rivers thermal regimes as a means to interpret and exploit the available river temperature data the model based on fitting a gaussian function to time series of interannual mean daily temperatures was used to characterize the thermal regime at more than 400 locations in québec rivers the three parameters of the model annual maximum date of annual maximum and length of the warm season allowed to produce a first map of québec river thermal regimes a method to quantify the uncertainty on the parameters estimation taking into account the length of the time series and the interannual variability of the river temperature is presented finally stepwise regressions were used to investigate the relationships between the model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the basins upstream of the measurement sites keywords river thermal regime sparse data river temperature monitoring network 1 introduction with the growing interest within the hydrological biological and ecological research communities for river water temperature much has been accomplished in the last two decades regarding the acknowledgement and understanding of water temperature impact on instream habitat dugdale et al 2016 elliott and elliott

2013 detecting and anticipating disturbances require systematic monitoring of river water temperature on the long term at appropriate spatial scales unfortunately such monitoring programs are rare efforts to improve the availability of river temperature data include airborne and satellite thermal imagery martí cardona et al 2019 cherkauer et al 2005 calls for the implementation and or optimization of river temperature measurement networks daigle et al 2016 jackson et al 2016 as well as initiatives for the gathering of existing river temperature data into publicly available databases e g norwest isaak et al 2017 noreast stewart 2015 in eastern canada the rivtemp network boyer et al 2016 compiles daily water temperature at 705 sites in 321 watercourses and 139 main basins in salmon rivers it is by far the richest river temperature database available in canada its content is already a potential major source of information for the assessment of atlantic salmon habitat growth potential and preservation on the other hand the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of measurement sites their variable and sometimes limited duration of annual time series and the small number of years with data for most sites hardly provides a readily comprehensive river thermal pattern and may limit the actual exploitation of the rivtemp data by managers and researchers the general behaviour of northern rivers thermal regimes is well known water temperature ranges from 0 c during a significant part of the year to a maximum that is typically reached within a week of that of air temperature caissie 2006 this seasonal pattern is critical for different life stages of instream species and governs the phenology of the entire lotic food chain salmonid fry emergence and growth rates are primarily dictated by water temperature cumulative degree days and duration of extreme temperature events elliott and elliott 2010 forseth et al 2010 jonsson and jonsson 2009 a river thermal regime is therefore an essential foundation in assessing and monitoring the quality of its habitats and its fish production potential in this work we propose a standardized characterization of québec canada rivers thermal regimes as a means to interpret and exploit the information collected as part of the rivtemp network specific objectives are to represent the thermal regimes of québec rivers using a standard and easily interpretable model to quantify model uncertainty based on available data to propose a first map of river thermal regimes in québec to relate the model parameters to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river 2 material and methods 2 1 rivtemp network the rivtemp network is a partnership among universities provincial and federal governments watershed groups and organizations dedicated to atlantic salmon conservation http rivtemp ca partners 2 lang en more than 38 groups have installed and are maintaining river temperature monitoring stations in salmon rivers across eastern canada the centralized database of river temperature is a major result of this collaboration across the province of quebec 433 monitoring sites installed on 158 rivers were operational for a period of one summer to 28 years between 1985 and 2017 among these 340 have less than 5 years of data the number of sites with more than 10 years of data is 26 the year to year number of active measurement sites is highly variable ranging from 1 in 1985 to 228 in 2016 and 0 in 1986 and 1988 prior to 2016 there is no active monitoring site north of latitude 52 5 n or west of longitude 73 3 w confining the network s geographical span to the vicinity of the st lawrence river valley and gulf and to the gaspésie region all measurements sites are point locations thus providing water temperature information at one specific point presumably representative of the cross section of the river as rivtemp is the result of many river temperature contributions and contributors details about the temperature loggers installation are generally not known but a deployment protocol is made available to current rivtemp partners measurement sites are assumed to be located in well mixed water with no vertical stratification and avoiding pools or shallow creeks this does not exclude eventual transversal stratification in large channels which was not taken into account neither were the effects of water level variation throughout the measurement season all sources adding to the data uncertainty data processing and quality checks are however performed on data before they are added to rivtemp including screening for outliers out of water days and data gaps the analysis presented here was performed on all 433 stations plus one on the richelieu river fig 1 the richelieu is not a salmon river and this additional station maintained by environment canada is thus not part of the rivtemp database it was included here because of its long water temperature record 15 years of data and rather warm thermal regime 2 2 standardized representation of québec rivers thermal regimes throughout this paper a river thermal regime is defined as the variation of the interannual mean daily temperature t as a function of the day of the year d 1 365 an empirical estimation of t d is thus given by 1 t d 1 n n 1 n t n d where t n d is the observed mean daily water temperature on day d of year n and n is the number of years for which an observation is available for day d 2 2 1 confidence intervals on the interannual mean daily temperatures the precision of the estimated interannual mean is related to the number n of available observations as well as to the t n d interannual variance the confidence interval on the empirical mean of a normally distributed sample of unknown variance and size n 100 can be computed as meyer 1970 2 ci x t γ k s n x t γ k s n where x is the empirical mean t γ k is the order γ 1 α 2 quantile of the k degrees of freedom student t distribution with k n 1 and 3 s 1 n 1 i 1 n x i x 2 is the unbiased estimator of the variance the confidence interval on a given t d value can thus be obtained from 2 assuming that the samples t n d are normally distributed one side of this ci corresponds to twice the distribution standard deviation σ 4 σ 1 2 t γ k s n the uncertainty on the t d values will hereafter be quantified by their σ value given a 95 confidence interval α 0 05 for very small 3 n values the σ obtained using 4 may take values larger than a reasonable estimate of the maximum year to year temperature variability for a given day a maximum value σmax was therefore evaluated for each d to this end interannual standard deviations of observed temperature at all site day for which n 8 were considered for d 46 feb 15 it is observed that the interannual standard deviation stays 0 5 c for d 46 the upper values were modeled as a function of d fig 2 eight years were considered to be a fair trade off given out data set between a sufficient number of years to estimate the daily interannual variability and the number of available site days obtained 6416 to evaluate the maximum year to year daily temperature variability increasing the number of years to 9 provides better estimates for interannual variability but fewer sites days 4544 are available for analysis conversely reducing the number of years to 7 results in more sites days 8891 but at the cost of less accurate estimates for the inter annual standard deviation in addition the day of the year and the normal air temperature at each site were used as a priori knowledge to further constraint the model days earlier than april 30 and later than december 25 for which no measurements were available and for which the air temperature had been negative during the previous 10 days were set to t 0 c for these days however the assigned value for σmax was doubled if d 120 april 30 in order to include the rare cases when the winter water temperature never reaches the freezing point e g groundwater fed streams conditions for the evaluation of σmax are summarized in table 1 air temperature data at each site was extracted from anusplin 10 km gridded interpolated climate data mckenney et al 2011 hopkinson et al 2011 hutchinson et al 2009 finally the uncertainty 95 confidence interval of a given interannual mean daily temperature value t d was evaluated as 2σ d with σ d given by 4 with the following exceptions for n 1 σ d σmax d for n 2 σ d min σ d 0 5σmax d this allows to prevent cases when the σ d value obtained with 4 is artificially small due to two fortuitously similar measurements if the σ d value obtained from 4 is greater than σmax d it is set to σmax d to prevent values larger than a reasonable estimate of the maximum year to year temperature variability for a given day even in the case of a small n 2 2 2 model selection the typical northern river thermal regime includes an extended period for which the water temperature is close to 0 c and a warmer period during which the temporal variation of water temperature takes a bell shaped curve this curve reaches its maximum approximately one week after air temperature during this ice free period water and air temperatures are generally correlated with a few days lag the lag and correlation vary in relation with the size of the river its exposure to solar radiation and the proportion of its flow fed by groundwater among other factors caissie 2006 garner et al 2014 o sullivan et al 2019 for example water temperature in a fairly wide river highly exposed to solar radiation and with a small groundwater flow contribution will correlate closely with air temperature whereas water temperature in a small stream in a forested area with mainly groundwater fed flow will be less correlated with air temperature and will thus show a smaller annual variability fig 3 these physiographic differences translate into differences in the amplitude and width of the bell shaped curve of temperature variation during the ice free period the wide river will typically reach a higher maximum temperature than the narrower groundwater fed stream while the latter might experience a longer ice free season and thus a greater seasonal temperature curve width river seasonal thermal regimes have often been modeled using sinusoidal functions or fourier series maheu et al 2016a caissie et al 2001 steele 1978 while a sinusoidal model provides a good description for the interannual mean daily water temperature as a function of time during the ice free season it is not valid during a significant part of the year when water temperature is 0 c therefore prior to the sinusoidal model fitting a decision must thus be made either as to the beginning and end of the fitting period i e the ice free season which varies from river to river or as to the minimum temperature to be taken into account in the fitting either way the fitting results are sensitive to the decision made and so is the correspondence between the sinusoidal function parameters and the thermal regime metrics because the model is fitted on part of the year only the mean value of the sine function does not correspond to the average annual temperature accordingly the sine function amplitude cannot be assimilated to the amplitude of the seasonal temperature cycle since it depends on the annual mean value moreover this ambiguity in the mean and amplitude parameters brings a degeneracy issue to the modeling sinusoidal functions with lower mean and greater amplitude or with higher mean and lower amplitude could show equivalent fitting performances for the same dataset several other bell shaped functions exist that are defined as 0 and thus would not require to be truncated a number of these were tested based on their capacity to represent thermal regimes at nine river measurement sites in québec for which daily data were available for more than nine years and for which at least one interannual value could be computed for every 365 days these functions are the gaussian asymmetric gaussian lognormal and beta functions all functions were fitted on interannual daily mean water temperature at all nine sites independently and the root mean squared errors rmse were computed 5 r m s e 1 365 d 1 365 t d t d 2 where t d is the observed interannual mean daily temperature on day d and t d is the estimated value by the fitted model for day d while all models showed a visually appropriate fit to the data fig 4 the best overall performance according to the rmse values was obtained by the asymmetric gaussian function lowest rmse value in 5 9 cases and lowest overall mean rmse value table 2 however the symmetrical gaussian model shows very similar rmse values 0 13 c differences and has fewer one less parameters than the asymmetric gaussian the model selected to represent the thermal regimes at all sites in the dataset is thus the gaussian function given by 6 t d a exp 1 2 d c b 2 where a is a scale factor b is the standard deviation and c the mean value most interesting with this choice of model is that its three parameters can be directly and uniquely related to meaningful properties of the thermal regime a is equal to the annual maximum value c is the day at which this maximum occurs and b is a measure of the length of the warm i e t 0 c period model parameters were estimated at all sites using the matlab nonlinear fitting function fitnlm the mathworks r2016b the fitting is an iterative procedure starting with initial parameter values and taking into account data weight values w giving more relative importance to data with higher weight values here weights were assigned to 7 w d m a x σ σ d 1 r a n g e σ 1 where w d is the weight assigned to the datum on day d max σ is the σ maximum value for all d and range σ is max σ min σ 2 3 evaluation of model uncertainty the uncertainty of a model fit can be measured by the confidence intervals on its parameters evaluated as part of the fitting procedure the widths of these confidence intervals however only depict the model accuracy level in representing the given data with no regards to data errors while the fitting procedure used here does take into account relative differences in the data precision it does not distinguish between an annual series of interannual means t obtained from two years of observations n 2 or an annual series obtained from 15 years of observations n 15 even if the latter is expected to be much more precise the model uncertainty should thus reflect the uncertainty or confidence intervals on the interannual mean daily values t 2 3 1 confidence intervals on the model parameters confidence intervals on the model parameters were evaluated by fitting the following extreme models that is models adjusted in order to reach minimum and maximum values of a b and c these extreme models are defined by considering the 25 lowest t confidence intervals 2σ during warm mild and cold periods of the year defined as follows fig 5 warm period interval d 1 c b 2 mild periods intervals d 2a c 3b 2 to c b 2 and d 2b c b 2 to c 3b 2 cold periods intervals d 3a 1 to c 3b 2 and d 3b c 3b 2to 365 days with σ values below the 25th percentile of the σ values in each period are identified and the extreme models are fitted given these days only black error bars in fig 5 this avoids an overestimation of the parameters uncertainties by making better use of the most precise t values available in each of the five periods and ignoring neighboring uncertain values extreme models are then obtained as follows model with the highest a value a max is obtained by fitting t 2σ values for all periods similarly model with the lowest a value a min was obtained by fitting t 2σ values for all periods model with lowest b value b min the shortest warm period is obtained by fitting t 2σ values during the warm period d 1 t 2σ values during the cold periods d 3a and d 3b and mean t values during the mild periods d 2a and d 2b similarly model with highest b value b max the longest warm period is obtained by fitting t 2σ values during the warm period t 2σ values during the cold periods and mean t values during the mild periods model with highest c value c max is obtained by fitting lower t values t σ in spring and early summer d 3a and d 2a periods higher t values t σ at the end of the summer and in fall d 2b and d 3b periods and mean t values during the warm period similarly model with lowest c value c min is obtained by fitting t σ values in spring and early summer t σ values at the end of the summer and in fall and mean t values during the warm period finally the confidence intervals on the model parameters are defined as a min 2se a a max 2se a b min 2se b b max 2se b and c min 2se c c max 2se c where the se are the standard errors on the parameter estimation by the nonlinear fitting procedure 2 4 model relation to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river relationships between the gaussian model parameters and the physioclimatic characteristics of the river were investigated in order to limit error propagation in the analysis only those sites for which the uncertainties on the parameters a b and c were under given maximum values were considered basins upstream these sites were delineated and characterised given several physiographic and climatic variables known as potential water temperature drivers the variables showing significant correlation to parameters a b and c were then used as potential explanatory variables in stepwise regressions a stepwise regression is an iterative procedure used to include and or exclude explanatory variables in a multiple linear regression depending on their statistical significance in the model independent forward stepwise regressions were performed for each parameter a b and c using the stepwisefit matlab function the mathworks r2016b 3 results 3 1 evaluation of model uncertainty parameter uncertainty depends primarily on the length of the available time series as an example fig 6 shows the evolution of the parameters values and confidence intervals when the gaussian model is fitted on increasing numbers of daily observations at a measurement site in the trinité river for this specific time series the gaussian model parameters go from a b c 20 15 c 40 49 d 208 31 after one summer of data 112 daily observations to a b c 19 1 c 52 2 d 211 3 after 26 years 5485 daily observations one important observation is that the parameters final domains that is the values uncertainties obtained with all available data should be included in the parameter confidence intervals obtained with less data this would be an indication that the confidence intervals estimates obtained with fewer data adequately include more robust parameter estimates it was found that it is not always the case some confidence intervals do not include the very highest values or the very lowest values of the parameter domains obtained with fewer observations for example the small box in fig 6 highlights three parameter c domains obtained with 638 704 and 815 daily observations that exceed the highest value of the domain obtained with fewer 551 observations typically though these excursions represent a small fraction of the estimated parameter value when considering all 1606 year per year fits for all sites these excursions are 5 of estimated a b c values for 98 89 99 of the cases to evaluate the magnitude of the confidence intervals obtained on the three parameters as a function of the number of daily observations for all measurement sites the gaussian model was adjusted on the first year of data for all sites then on the first two years when more than a year was available then on the first three etc fig 7 illustrates the uncertainties obtained as a function of the number of daily observations the dashed vertical lines indicate the approximate number of corresponding years given that a year of river temperature measurement is often limited to the summer period here the approximate number of years is based on the median value for all year site of 149 daily observations year table 3 lists the median 5th and 95th percentiles of parameter uncertainties as a function of the time series approximate length in years the same exercise was done after a random permutation of the observation years at all sites and the results not shown were similar 3 2 standardized representation of québec rivers thermal regimes values of the gaussian model parameters adjusted to each of the the rivtemp québec sites data are shown in fig 8 the sizes of the circular markers are inversely proportional to the obtained confidence interval on the parameters as may be expected the largest values of parameter a maximum annual temperature 23 25 c are found in the southern half of the studied region the smallest values 10 c are found in gaspésie where elevations reach 500 m parameter b which can be associated with the length of the ice free season decreases with latitude and longitude and the parameter c values date of the maximum annual temperature seem to increase eastward 3 3 model relation to the physioclimatic characteristics of the river table 4 lists correlation values between the three model parameters and a number of physioclimatic variables correlations were computed and subsequent analysis were conducted considering only those sites for which model fits were estimated with parameter uncertainties δa δb and δc limited to 3 c 7 days and 7 days respectively the number of sites meeting these conditions is 48 the stepwise adjusted models for each a b and c parameters are summarized in table 5 models listed on the left were fitted with a forward stepwise procedure with no initial variable models listed on the right were fitted starting with one initial variable the mean daily max july air temperature julymaxt for parameter a model the mean duration of 0 c air temperature duration 0 for parameter b model and the mean date of annual maximum air temperature datemaxt for parameter c model this adjustment of the initial conditions did not change the parameter c model results datemaxt was removed from the model as part of the stepwise procedure and the same other variables were included for the parameter a model the julymaxt was removed and the basin centroid longitude basinlon was replaced by the longitude at site sitelon with slight improvements to the rmse and r 2 values variable duration 0 was retained in the parameter b model with the log transformed drainage area log da and the broadleaf forested cover broadleaf leading to better rmse and r 2 values fitting results from the second model listed on the right in table 5 are illustrated on fig 9 values on the horizontal axis are the ones obtained from the gaussian fits values on the vertical axis are the ones estimated from the physioclimatic variables with the stepwise regressions dashed lines are drawn at the 95th percentile of the 48 sites δa δb and δc values from the 1 1 solid line 4 discussion and conclusion the choice of a gaussian model to represent québec rivers thermal regimes was motivated by the need of a bell shaped function that did not require to be truncated during the frost season it has the main advantage of being described by a small number of independent and readily interpretable parameters while tests showed that the gaussian model provides good fits for the overall thermal regime shape as compared to other functions fig 4 table 2 it was observed that it does not always appropriately fit the thaw period in spring for example it can be seen on the top panel of fig 4 that the gaussian curve overestimates temperatures between days 80 and 140 in the romaine where the water stays frozen until day 110 and reaches 2 c only 18 days later from the time the river reaches 5 c however the gaussian fit follows the temperature values closely again for a study requiring precise representation of the thaw thermal conditions the use of another model could be more appropriate in the coming decades earlier thaw periods and decreased snow stocks and ice covers are to be expected this could lead to a more gradual warming of the water temperature closer to the gaussian curve in spring see for example the richelieu river fig 4 a number of empirically based choices had to be made in the evaluation of the model uncertainties the standard deviation value σ on the interannual mean daily water temperature t was limited as a function of the day of the year and air temperature fig 2 table 1 cold mild and warm periods had to be defined to fit the extreme models fig 5 only part of the estimated t those with σ 25th percentile of the period were used in these fits all conditions that could be adjusted or defined differently with consequential effects on the estimation of the model confidence intervals the robustness of the evaluated confidence intervals was tested by evaluating cases for which a parameter domain is not fully included in all domains obtained with less data see example on fig 6 for most cases these excursions represent 5 of the estimated parameter value and usually occur for domains obtained with 1 or 2 years of data the evaluated confidence intervals therefore seem reliable but should be interpreted with more caution when dealing with a small number of observations unsurprisingly parameters a b and c uncertainties remain high until the available time series length reaches a 3 5 year length fig 7 table 3 there seems to be a clear break in δa after a 5 year length is reached with most values 4 c differences in median and lowest 5th percentile uncertainties for all three parameters do not change much between 5 and 10 year series lengths but the largest 95th percentile uncertainties are typically divided by two for every doubling of the time series length table 3 to our knowledge the only other study quantifying uncertainty on river temperature metrics as a function of the length of the temperature series was presented by jones and schmidt 2018 who estimated metrics on randomized temperature series of increasing length at 73 locations in the u s and in ontario canada the metrics are not parameters of a model of the thermal regime but rather interannual means of descriptive statistics like monthly extrema and ranges the number of years required to obtain stated uncertainty thresholds varied depending on the metric thermal regimes are affected by climate and physiographic differences between river basins which translates into differences in the gaussian model parameter values stepwise adjusted regression models between each a b c parameter and climate and physiographic variables confirm significant empirical relationships table 5 some explanatory variables are highly inter correlated for example the climate variables show 85 95 inter correlations and thus show similar explanatory power the log transformed drainage area included in all models can be an indication of the relative subsurface and groundwater contribution to a river discharge small das are also often associated with headwater basins low exposure to weather conditions and therefore with cooler water this is consistent with the log da positive contribution to parameter a higher maximum annual temperature and with its negative contribution to parameters b shorter warm season and to parameter c more time needed to reach the annual maximum the present study is a first attempt at representing all quebec river thermal regimes with a single standardized model while many previous studies used a sinusoidal curve to characterize the thermal regime of streams and rivers in canada and the u s we propose a gaussian model this model offers the advantage of being adjustable beyond the ice free period without biasing the estimates a first map of meaningful descriptors for quebec rivers thermal regimes as measured at 400 point locations was produced in addition the present study provides a complete methodology to estimate uncertainties associated with the proposed model analysis of our limited dataset from the rivtemp database indicates that relatively robust estimations of the three parameters of the gaussian model can be obtained when more than 5 years of data are available stepwise regressions showed that the thermal regime shape is significantly related to some physioclimatic characteristics of the basin such as its size geographical location elevation climate and land use as reported by other studies of similar scales chu et al 2010 maheu et al 2016a the stepwise models presented here although informative are however essentially descriptive and should not be seen as confirmations of cause to effect relationships such as those formulated in physically based water temperature models this new approach to water temperature characterization opens new research avenues including the possible use of spot measurements in the fitting of the gaussian curve indeed there are large quantities of unused punctual measurements of water temperature that could enhance knowledge of river temperature regimes across north america and the world the present study only explored simple linear models of the gaussian model parameters as functions of physioclimatic variables further studies to better investigate potential predictors and more suitable models could provide more robust estimates for the gaussian model parameters such models could then be used to generate scenarios of future water temperature gaussian curves using future climate scenarios declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements this

6242,the precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction have a variety of potential uses in flood forecasting and reservoir operation but suffer from relatively poor performance due to the uncertainty of the hydrometeorological system in this study the control forecasts of four global weather centres were selected and assessed against the measured data using several verification metrics during the flood season may september over the shihe river catchment in the huaihe river basin of china the results show that the daily rainfall forecasts have low prediction ability and cannot meet the demand of reservoir regulation to describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts for the safety of flood control a new model was proposed using fuzzy probability and bayesian theory on the basis of the generalized probability density function gpdf the performance of the new model is examined by using various probability measures and compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather centres it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model can generate the conditional probability distribution of actual precipitation from a single predicted value based on the historical observation and forecast data and has strong generalization ability compared with the ensemble forecasts although the fuzzy bayesian model shows a slightly improvement in accuracy it has better performance in sharpness and reliability meanwhile the new model is easy to update with new samples by modifying its likelihood function which is favourable for real time reservoir regulation in addition the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast was analysed with the model in different lead times generally the uncertainty increases with the growth of lead time and the probability distribution of the rainfall forecast within 3 days is an acceptable result for a risk and benefit analysis of the flood control system to be more specific a fuzzy bayesian model based on the gpdf is an efficient way to generate the probability distribution of the precipitation with forecast data for the uncertainty analysis and makes it possible to provide a reference for reservoir managers to plan regulation strategies with a lead time of at least 3 days keywords tigge precipitation forecast fuzzy probability bayesian theory uncertainty analysis data availability the tigge datasets can be downloaded at https www ecmwf int 1 introduction with the rapid development of computer technology and the progress of meteorological and climate models numerical weather prediction nwp has been commonly used in the prediction of hydrologic events and reservoir regulation especially for extreme events sagar et al 2017 bauer et al 2015 forecasts of potential flood conditions based on the nwp provide the flood control system with a long lead time and an opportunity to plan regulation strategies and utilize flood resources cuo et al 2011 bao and zhao 2012 however as mentioned in many previous cases the rainfall forecasting from the nwp in general is biased and uncertain and cannot be directly employed in flood forecast or reservoir regulation which requires high accuracy of rainfall forecast lavers and villarini 2013 he et al 2009 khan et al 2015 pappenberger et al 2008 su et al 2014 therefore the rainfall information from the nwp still has not been fully and efficiently used in flood control disaster reduction as well as flood resource utilization liu et al 2015 todini 2017 zhou et al 2018 in the past few years various post processing and statistical methods have been used to assess and model the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts jha et al 2018 roulin and vannitsem 2012 madadgar et al 2014 qu et al 2017 cloke and pappenberger 2009 however due to the strong space time variability of precipitation the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts is still a great challenge to analyse and simulate it is expected that significant additional efforts will be needed to evaluate the uncertainty of rainfall forecasts and to determine whether they can be used in flood control systems at different timescales the natural rainfall is generally characterized as an intermittent stochastic process with a mixed marginal distribution including both discrete and continuous parts liu et al 2013 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 the discrete part is concentrated at the zero and means the probability of no rain which is easy to estimate by the ratio of the number of no rain days to the total number of days on the other hand the distribution of the continuous part cannot be easily assessed meanwhile due to the complexity of the precipitation distribution it is difficult to estimate the conditional distribution of the actual rainfall from a prediction consequently in order to analyse the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast and make full use of the lead time from the nwp there is a demand for methods that are able to generate the actual probability of precipitation from nwp based forecasts over recent decades a number of studies have been extensively carried out to meet this objective based on a bivariate probability distribution between observations and the single value precipitation forecast li et al 2017 dai et al 2018 the bivariate meta gaussian distribution function was developed by krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 by using a normal quantile transformation nqt in the bayesian forecasting system bfs herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 first used this method to assess the uncertainty in the precipitation data berrocal et al 2008 used a two stage approach to model the precipitation amounts in which the occurrence of rainfall is considered first and a gamma distribution is used to model the positive amount in the case of rainfall occurrence wu et al 2011 introduced the mixed type meta gaussian joint distribution on the basis of the method of schaake et al 2007 and krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 robertson et al 2013 proposed an ensemble approach called rainfall post processing rpp according to the combination of the bayesian joint probability approach from wang and robertson 2011 tao et al 2014 used the ensemble post processing epp to generate a probabilistic forecast from the nwp single value forecasts khajehei and moradkhani 2017 employed the copula functions to build the bivariate joint distribution and compared them with the meta gaussian distribution approach most of the former cases assumed that the distributions of the observations and the forecasts are irrelevant which can be estimated respectively and the conditional distribution is built through the joint distribution and marginal distribution brown and seo 2013 furthermore using nqt will inevitably lead to the transformation of non normal variables into normal space which may have impacts on the performance of the estimated probability khajehei and moradkhani 2017 although the copulas can capture the probability distribution between the observations and forecasts without variable transformation selecting the appropriate function is difficult due to the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall additionally since the hydrometeorological system is highly random the actual reservoir operation strategies are usually formulated by magnitudes of flood or precipitation rather than specific values accordingly the main task is to develop a procedure that can accurately and simply describe the uncertainty in numerical precipitation forecasts for a particular timescale and simultaneously provide a basis for reservoir flood control engineering regulation as well as an alert in advance in this paper we evaluated the daily precipitation predictions from four different global forecasting centres over the shihe river catchment of huaihe river basin in china during the flood season an uncertainty analysis model will be established under the bayesian framework with a generalized probability density function gpdf meanwhile in this paper we paid more attention to the magnitude of the future precipitation and the classification of the precipitation events involves the fuzziness therefore the fuzzy probability was employed to describe the fuzziness of the system this new model can not only obtain the conditional probability distribution of the precipitation with high accuracy and reliability by the nwp but also take the fuzzy events in actual flood control into consideration furthermore the new model was compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather agencies by using several verification methods in the next section we detail the fuzzy bayesian uncertainty analysis model along with the evaluation indicators section 3 introduces an overview of the dataset and the study area the results and discussion are described in section 4 and finally the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methodology the purpose of this study is to develop an uncertainty analysis model to offer reliable advanced information for flood control and water resource management the bayesian theory and fuzzy probability were used to build the relationship between specific forecast values and true magnitudes of precipitation on the basis of the gpdf the theory of the fuzzy bayesian model and the gpdf are provided below 2 1 bayesian theory 2 1 1 generalized probability density function the bayesian formula is an effective way for uncertainty analysis and has been commonly used in hydrological forecasting krzysztofowicz 2002 biondi and de luca 2013 han and coulibaly 2017 the probability distribution for precipitation however is a mixed distribution including a discrete part and a continuous part which cannot be directly applied in the bayesian formula here we transform the distribution law of discrete random variable into a probability density function pdf form through the gpdf making it applicable to the bayesian formula the dirac delta function is one of the most commonly used generalized function in hydrology which is also known as the impulse function and usually represented by δ x conceptually define δ x x r as a dirac delta function indicating 1 δ x x 0 0 x 0 δ x d x ε ε δ x d x 1 ε 0 let x as a discrete random variable r v and all its possible values are x 1 x 2 x n then the distribution law of r v x can be expressed as 2 p x x i p i i 1 2 n where p i 0 i 1 2 n i 1 n p i 1 through the eq 1 the gpdf of r v x can be drawn as follows 3 f x x i 1 n p i δ x x i the gpdf of discrete r v x can satisfy the properties of pdf eq 4 4 f x x 0 x f x x d x 1 2 1 2 prior distribution the first step of the model is to estimate the prior distribution based on historical data or expert opinions in this case the prior distribution is the marginal distribution of natural precipitation i e the historical observation values therefore the procedure begins with fitting different distributions to the observation as many former studies have mentioned the probability distribution of daily rainfall is composed of a discrete part and a continuous part the discrete part of the probability of daily rainfall is easy to estimate from the frequency of no rain occurrence in the total number of days but the continuous part varies in different studies a number of specific distributions such as gamma lognormal weibull and exponential or nonparametric methods were used to fit the marginal distribution of daily precipitation brown and seo 2010 these distributions are well suited to non negative data and are powerful in representing the extreme values in this paper the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is adopted to find the most suitable marginal distribution of the observations here we denote r v x as the daily precipitation and its sample space is ω x 0 therefore the cumulative probability distribution cdf of r v x can be drawn as 5 f x x p x x 0 x 0 f x x p x x α 0 1 α 0 p 0 x x x 0 x 0 where α 0 p x 0 subsequently the gpdf of x is as follows 6 f x x α 0 δ x 1 α 0 f x x x 0 2 1 3 likelihood function let r v y indicate the predicted precipitation the forecast is also non negative so the sample space of y is ω y 0 the likelihood function is the relationship between the two random variables in this paper the forecast errors are used to set up the conditional distribution eq 7 7 y x ε in this equation the ε is the forecast error and the conditional probability of y can be introduced with the probability distribution of the error 8 f y y x x p y y x x 0 y 0 f y y x x p y 0 x x p y 0 x x p y y y 0 x x y 0 meanwhile it is noticed that the errors are non negative when x 0 due to the sample space of y accordingly the case of x 0 should be considered separately and the non negative distributions are employed for fy x 0 y eq 9 9 f y x 0 y p y y x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 p y 0 x 0 p y 0 x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 β 0 0 1 β 0 0 0 y f y t x 0 d t where β 0 0 p y 0 x 0 f y y x 0 0 y 0 0 y 0 0 f y y x 0 d y 1 in contrast when x 0 it can generally be assumed that the errors between the forecasted value and unknown true value obey a censored normal distribution 10 f y x x x 0 y p y y x x x 0 p y y y 0 x x x 0 p y y y 0 x x x 0 β x 0 1 β x 0 0 y f y t x x 0 d t where β x 0 p y 0 x x f y y x x 0 0 y 0 0 y 0 0 f y y x x 0 d y 1 consequently the conditional gpdf for r v y with r v x x can be expressed as shown in eq 11 11 f y y x x β x 0 δ y 1 β x 0 f y y x x 2 1 4 posterior distribution through the gpdf of the prior distribution and likelihood function the posterior distribution of observation can be derived using a bayesian formula eq 12 additionally the discrete continuous and mixed distributions can be unified in this formula by using the gpdf 12 f x x y y f x x f y y x x f x t f y y x t d t where f x x y y is the conditional gpdf of the r v x at r v y y 2 2 probability of fuzzy event since most of the events in nature contain both random and fuzzy uncertainties the probability of a fuzzy event has always been a hotspot in research fields since the theory of the fuzzy set was proposed in 1965 zadeh 2015 a fuzzy set a on a universe set x is mapping a x 0 1 x a x the 0 a x 1 represents the degree of membership of each element x x the a x of a fuzzy set a is also called the membership function and can be presented as μ a x if a is a fuzzy event on a complete set x x 1 x 2 x i with the corresponding probability p x i i 1 2 p x i 0 i 1 p x i 1 of each element x i x we define the probability of fuzzy event a with eq 13a for the discrete condition and eq 13b for the continuous condition with pdf f x 13a p a i 1 μ a x i p x i 13b p a μ a x f x d x where μ a x is the membership function of a note that the probability of the fuzzy set has been studied in three different aspects 1 the event is fuzzy but the probability is clear 2 the event is clear but the probability is fuzzy and 3 both the event and probability are fuzzy zadeh 1999 in this paper only case 1 i e the fuzzy event with clear probability is discussed through the eqs 12 and 13 the fuzzy probability of each magnitude can be derived by the fuzzy bayesian model with the eq 14 14 p a i y y x i x i 1 f x x f y y x x μ a i x f x t f y y x t d t d x it is remarkable that there are obvious differences between the model in this study and the fuzzy bayesian formula introduced by zadeh eq 15 the posterior distribution of the fuzzy bayesian formula is the conditional cdf between two different fuzzy sets while the model obtains the probability of a fuzzy set from a single specific value das and ghosh 2019 15 p a i b j p a i p b j a i j 1

in the flood season when there will be only a small amount of precipitation in the future the reservoir can maintain a relatively high water level to store additional water and generate more energy conversely if there will be a large amount of precipitation the reservoir may need to release part of its storage to ensure the safety of flood control in this paper the amount of daily precipitation is divided into four different magnitudes based on the classification standard of the meteorological department of china table 1 a 1 0 10 including no rain and light rain a 2 10 50 including medium rain and heavy rain a 3 50 100 including rainstorm a 4 100 including heavy rainstorm and extreme rainstorm the classification in this study can provide a basis for reservoir regulation however for the actual regulation more specific classification criteria based on the reservoir conditions and the hydrological characteristics of watershed are necessary 2 3 2 membership function the membership function is an important part in the theory of fuzzy sets indicating the relationship between elements and sets there are various different kinds of curve shape for the membership function such as the normal distribution curve cauchy distribution curve and trapezium distribution curve compared to the nonlinear membership functions the trapezium distribution curve has the advantages of simple calculation and parameterization therefore the trapezium distribution curve is selected as the membership function in this paper fig 1 and its formula is expressed in eqs 16 eq 16a for the left side trapezium distribution eq 16b for the right side trapezium distribution and eq 16c for the trapezium distribution 16a μ a x a b 1 x a b x b a a x b 0 b x 16b μ a x c d 0 x c x c d c c x d 1 d x 16c μ

lead times several statistical metrics were assessed to compare the forecasts and observations including correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse additionally three different probabilistic measures were also chosen to evaluate the ability of the fuzzy bayesian model and compare with the ensemble forecasts from the weather agencies 2 4 1 mean square error the mean square error mse is one of the most commonly used measure to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value is close to the true response value in this case the mse of is employed to examine the accuracy of the bayesian model based on the gpdf eq 17a and ensemble forecasts eq 17b 17a mse 1 n i 1 n e x x oi 2 y y i 1 n i 1 n 0 t x oi 2 f t y y i d t 17b mse 1 n i 1 n 1 m j 1 m x i j x oi 2 where n denotes the total number of forecasts m denotes the number of forecast ensembles xi j denotes the ith prediction of the jth ensemble member and xoi denotes the ith true value 2 4 2 average width of the prediction intervals the average width of the prediction intervals wpi is a simple but effective measure of sharpness generally it refers to the average width of a 90 prediction interval 18 wpi 1 n i 1 n f i u f i l where n represents the total number of forecasts f i u and f i l represent the ith upper and lower bound of probability 0 90 prediction interval respectively eq 19 19 p x

2007 candille and talagrand 2005 and it can be calculated with the following equation 20 bs 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 where n denotes the total number of forecasts fi denotes the prediction probability of the weather event and oi is equal to 1 or 0 depending on whether the event has been observed to occur or not the brier score is negatively oriented with a range of 0 1 and the brier score is equal to 0 if the forecast is perfect to assess the reliability of the fuzzy bayesian model the brier score is employed for different magnitudes in this paper 3 data and study area 3 1 study area the shihe river is the one of the most important tributaries of main stream of the huaihe river with a catchment area of 5848 km2 above the jiangji hydrological station there are two main reservoirs located in the catchment the meishan reservoir and the nianyushan reservoir fig 2 due to the impact of the monsoon climate the precipitation over the shihe river catchment is concentrated in the flood season during may september the watershed receives over 800 mm of precipitation per year on average while over 65 of the annual precipitation occurs during the flood season the precipitation in the catchment exhibits a slightly downward trend from south to north in order to obtain better areal precipitation and meet the demand of flood forecasting the study area is divided into three subcatchments according to the location of rainfall or hydrological measure stations and large reservoirs and the areal average precipitation is estimated by the area weighted method in the subcatchments respectively 3 2 forecast and observation data as a major component of the observing system research and predictability experiment thorpex tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble dataset consists of ensemble forecast datasets from eleven main forecasting centres starting in 2006 aimed at improving the ability of high impact weather forecasting within two weeks swinbank et al 2016 the control forecasts of four agencies from 2015 to 2018 were selected in this study cma china meteorological centre jma japan meteorological agency ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecast and ukmo united kingdom meteorological office more details of the datasets used in this paper are briefly given in table 2 according to table 2 the horizontal resolutions and forecast lengths of the four centres are different thus several methods were used to make the forecasts consistent 1 we only selected the forecast on the base time of 00 00utc 2 the forecast length for this study is 7 d 168 h and 3 the spatial resolutions for all four datasets were 0 50 0 50 meanwhile the locations of the precipitation ground stations in shihe river basin are shown in fig 2 this study is conducted on the measured daily rainfall data of different subcatchments by using the thiessen polygon during the flood season from 2013 to 2018 the first four years 2013 2016 of observations are used to evaluate the prior distribution the forecast data from 2015 to 2016 are employed to calibrate the model and the last two years 2017 2018 are treated as a validation period 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessment of precipitation forecast from tigge the experiment begins with the evaluation of the precipitation forecast data to examine the performance of precipitation forecasts from the four datasets the rmse for different lead times between the forecasts and observation in the flood season during 2015 2018 are shown in fig 3 fig 3 presents that the jma is the best precipitation forecast in the study area the performance of ukmo and ecmwf are similar while the cma has the worst prediction ability generally with the increase of lead time the forecast accuracies of the four centres show a downward trend the cc of the precipitation forecasts illustrate the same trend as the rmse table 3 meanwhile the performances of jma ecmwf and ukmo are closer in table 3 the cma however is still the worst forecast the daily forecasted rainfall versus measured rainfall during 2015 2018 in the whole shihe river catchment for several lead times is shown in figs 4 and 5 shows the distribution of errors for the four centres from the last two figures it is significant that the mean errors of the rainfall forecasts are close to 0 and most of the values are concentrated near 0 however all four centres still have large outlier values of error which is a fatal defect for flood control safety and water resource management fig 5 the evaluation results prove that the precipitation forecasts from tigge are unreliable for flood forecasting and reservoir regulation it is necessary to develop a method that can describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts and provide reservoir managers with a reliable prediction of risk for flood control in advance thielen et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 4 2 the performance of fuzzy bayesian model the fuzzy bayesian model begins with finding the best prior distribution that can describe the probability of measured daily precipitation several specific probability distributions were determined by maximum likelihood estimation mle and examined by the k s test in table 4 h is a logical value indicating the result of the hypothesis test if h 1 this means the rejection of the null hypothesis at 5 significance level otherwise the null hypothesis is accepted i e h 0 meanwhile the p represents the scalar value with a range of 0 1 and small values of p cast doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis the results indicate that the weibull distribution with h 0 and the largest p value is the best distribution to describe the probability of daily precipitation over the shihe river catchment additionally the cdf of the three distributions are shown in fig 6 all the three distributions in fig 6 can capture the probability distribution of measured daily rainfall in this paper the weibull distribution is selected to describe the probability of observations the likelihood function is one of the most important parts of the bayesian formula in this model there are two different conditions that should be considered x 0 and x 0 the likelihood function of x 0 can be expressed simply through a discrete part and a censored normal distribution with a mean value of 0 eq 21 in the case of x 0 the likelihood function is also composed of a discrete part and a non negative distribution also the weibull distribution is chosen as the best distribution for the continuous part based on the mle and the k s test subsequently the posterior distribution can be generated by eq 12 21 φ y x σ 2 a x 2 π σ e y x 2 2 σ 2 y 0 where a x is a parameter to guarantee a total probability of 1 and 0 φ y x σ 2 d y 1 to examine the performance of the fuzzy bayesian model the mse wpi and brier score are selected to evaluate its accuracy sharpness and reliability and compared with the results of ensemble forecasts from the four weather agencies according to fig 7 the mse of probabilistic forecasts from different forecast datasets estimated by the bayesian model show a decreasing trend of accuracy with the growth of lead time also the probabilistic forecasts generated from jma and ecmwf have better performance indicating that high accuracy control forecast lead to a better probabilistic result with the new model additionally the small differences between the mse of the training period and verification period prove the good generalization ability of the model the ensemble forecasts of the four centres in the verification period are selected as comparisons to study the performance of the generated probabilistic forecast based on the new model as seen in fig 8 the bayesian model based on gpdf has a similar performance in mse with the ensemble forecasts from ecmwf jma and ukmo although the mse of fuzzy bayesian model is slightly larger than that of ensemble forecasts in the first two days of lead time it has a higher accuracy for longer lead time by contrast the ensemble forecast from cma has a worse performance than the new model in all the lead times fig 9 presents the wpi of the bayesian model and ensemble forecasts in the verification period over the shihe river catchment in the figure the wpi of the new model is lower than the ensemble forecasts especially for lead time over 3d the lower wpi indicates a narrower 90 prediction interval and better sharpness meanwhile the wpi of the new model is more stable and has only small fluctuation with the change of lead time the brier scores calculated for this study are presented in fig 10 this figure shows the brier scores for the four classifications through the fuzzy bayesian model and ensemble forecasts in the verification periods overall the brier scores of the fuzzy bayesian model is lower than the ensemble forecasts indicating a better ability to resolve different magnitudes additionally there are only small differences in the brier scores between the results of fuzzy bayesian model obtained by different centres the fuzzy bayesian model is proved as an effective and consistent method to describe the probability of the precipitation forecast in conclusion the assessment results for the fuzzy bayesian model illustrate that the model can acquire an accurate probability distribution of the true value from a single specific forecast value compared with the ensemble forecasts the results of the fuzzy bayesian model prove that the model and ensemble forecasts have a little improvement in accuracy but the model is more effective from the aspect of sharpness and reliability also the model has great generalization performance and is easy to update through the likelihood function when new samples appear which is beneficial to real time flood forecast and control 4 3 uncertainty analysis of precipitation forecast according to the above results it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model is a reliable method to estimate the probability distribution of precipitation magnitude also the results show that better predictions will lead to more effectively probability forecasts since the one of the main purposes of this study is to provide a credible probability precipitation prediction for flood forecasting and reservoir regulation the fuzzy bayesian model is also used to analyse the uncertainty of different prediction values at a particular lead time the forecast dataset from jma with the best forecast performance was chosen as an example for the uncertainty analysis in this study fig 11 reveals the probability distribution of different magnitudes from different precipitation forecast values over the shihe river catchment with the lead times of 1 d 3 d 5 d and 7 d in fig 11 it is noticed that the probability of a1 is quite high for a forecast value of less than 5 mm over 0 75 in contrast for predictions over 120 mm the probability of a4 is over 0 95 the probability of a3 reaches its peak when the forecast value is approximately 70 mm while the peak value of a2 is the lowest of the four magnitudes only around 0 80 overall the maximum probability of each magnitude appears near the midpoint of the range except the a1 meanwhile the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast increases gradually with the increase in lead time which is consistent with the former results furthermore for the forecasts exceeding 50 mm the probability of a1 has an increasing trend while the probability of a4 decreases especially when the lead time exceeds 5d the decrease in the probability of a4 means that the large prediction values with long lead time are likely to be overestimated which is also shown in figs 4 and 5 to summarize the probability distribution of the precipitation forecasts over the shihe river catchment is clear and stable with a short lead time less than 3 d since the accuracy of the precipitation forecast decreases along with the increase in the lead time the uncertainty also shows an upward trend especially for the forecast values over 30 mm more specifically the results of the uncertainty analysis indicate that through the fuzzy bayesian model the short term precipitation forecasts from tigge with good prediction ability and stable distribution of uncertainty can be applied to provide a reference for reservoir operation and flood resource utilization conversely further efforts are needed to improve precipitation forecasts with a long lead time in order to obtain a better probability distribution 5 conclusion the uncertainty analysis of the precipitation forecast is essential for improving the lead time of reservoir operation as well as for assessing the risk of flood resource utilization although the development of the nwp makes it possible to plan regulation strategies with a long lead time these methods suffer from the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast the purpose of this study is to examine the performance of precipitation forecasts from tigge and develop a probabilistic model to describe the uncertainty of the forecasts on the basis of bayesian theory and fuzzy probability therefore the rainfall forecasts from tigge were evaluated in the shihe river catchment during the flood season 2015 2018 and a fuzzy bayesian model was established to depict the probability distribution of the daily precipitation forecast the technique is based on the gpdf which can be used to unify bayesian formulas with different forms of distribution in this study four control forecast datasets from tigge were selected and compared with the area weighed historical observations the results show that the jma has the best performance in the shihe river catchment and the prediction abilities of ecmwf and ukmo are close to jma in general the forecast abilities of the control forecasts exhibit an inverse relationship with the lead time in addition through the assessment of the forecasts it is noticed that the precipitation forecast from the four datasets are biased and unreliable the forecast results from tigge are affected by a number of errors from different sources and cannot meet the demand of flood control safety to describe the uncertainty in the precipitation forecast a fuzzy bayesian model was built with the gpdf taking into account both the fuzziness and randomness of the forecasts the probabilistic measures including the mse wpi and brier score were employed to evaluate the forecast ability of the new model and compare with the ensemble forecasts from the weather agencies the assessment results indicate that the fuzzy bayesian model is capable of building the conditional distribution between observations and the forecasts of daily rainfall and it has good generalization capability furthermore compared with the ensemble forecasts although the new model has a slightly improvement in mse but it has better performance in wpi and brier score it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model is an effective method to model and assess the uncertainty in the precipitation forecast due to its performance in accuracy sharpness and reliability the results of the uncertainty analysis using a fuzzy bayesian model show that the short term forecast within 3 d from jma is acceptable to evaluate the risk and benefit of the reservoir regulation driven by the nwp the probability distribution of rainfall forecast based on jma with long lead time however is unstable and relatively complex therefore we think that it is a feasible result to extend the lead time of reservoir operation to 3 d meanwhile some correction methods such as multi model ensemble forecast can be combined with the model for further enhancement of the performance in long term forecasting zhi et al 2012 cai et al 2018 one main challenge for reservoir operation and flood resource utilization is the accuracy and lead time of the precipitation or flood forecasting the rainfall forecast from nwp is an effective method to improve the lead time but is limited to the low prediction ability due to the relatively simple structure and stable performance in short term forecast the fuzzy bayesian model would be a strong candidate for error modelling and assessment of precipitation forecasts as well as risk and benefit assessment of reservoir regulation in addition it is worth mentioning that this study only used the four different fuzzy sets and the trapezium distribution curve and assumed that the likelihood function is a censored normal distribution the future investigations will employ more specific classifications other membership functions and some non parametric methods under the framework of fuzzy bayesian model to provide probabilistic precipitation prediction for flood forecast and

6242,the precipitation forecasts from numerical weather prediction have a variety of potential uses in flood forecasting and reservoir operation but suffer from relatively poor performance due to the uncertainty of the hydrometeorological system in this study the control forecasts of four global weather centres were selected and assessed against the measured data using several verification metrics during the flood season may september over the shihe river catchment in the huaihe river basin of china the results show that the daily rainfall forecasts have low prediction ability and cannot meet the demand of reservoir regulation to describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts for the safety of flood control a new model was proposed using fuzzy probability and bayesian theory on the basis of the generalized probability density function gpdf the performance of the new model is examined by using various probability measures and compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather centres it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model can generate the conditional probability distribution of actual precipitation from a single predicted value based on the historical observation and forecast data and has strong generalization ability compared with the ensemble forecasts although the fuzzy bayesian model shows a slightly improvement in accuracy it has better performance in sharpness and reliability meanwhile the new model is easy to update with new samples by modifying its likelihood function which is favourable for real time reservoir regulation in addition the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast was analysed with the model in different lead times generally the uncertainty increases with the growth of lead time and the probability distribution of the rainfall forecast within 3 days is an acceptable result for a risk and benefit analysis of the flood control system to be more specific a fuzzy bayesian model based on the gpdf is an efficient way to generate the probability distribution of the precipitation with forecast data for the uncertainty analysis and makes it possible to provide a reference for reservoir managers to plan regulation strategies with a lead time of at least 3 days keywords tigge precipitation forecast fuzzy probability bayesian theory uncertainty analysis data availability the tigge datasets can be downloaded at https www ecmwf int 1 introduction with the rapid development of computer technology and the progress of meteorological and climate models numerical weather prediction nwp has been commonly used in the prediction of hydrologic events and reservoir regulation especially for extreme events sagar et al 2017 bauer et al 2015 forecasts of potential flood conditions based on the nwp provide the flood control system with a long lead time and an opportunity to plan regulation strategies and utilize flood resources cuo et al 2011 bao and zhao 2012 however as mentioned in many previous cases the rainfall forecasting from the nwp in general is biased and uncertain and cannot be directly employed in flood forecast or reservoir regulation which requires high accuracy of rainfall forecast lavers and villarini 2013 he et al 2009 khan et al 2015 pappenberger et al 2008 su et al 2014 therefore the rainfall information from the nwp still has not been fully and efficiently used in flood control disaster reduction as well as flood resource utilization liu et al 2015 todini 2017 zhou et al 2018 in the past few years various post processing and statistical methods have been used to assess and model the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts jha et al 2018 roulin and vannitsem 2012 madadgar et al 2014 qu et al 2017 cloke and pappenberger 2009 however due to the strong space time variability of precipitation the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts is still a great challenge to analyse and simulate it is expected that significant additional efforts will be needed to evaluate the uncertainty of rainfall forecasts and to determine whether they can be used in flood control systems at different timescales the natural rainfall is generally characterized as an intermittent stochastic process with a mixed marginal distribution including both discrete and continuous parts liu et al 2013 papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2016 the discrete part is concentrated at the zero and means the probability of no rain which is easy to estimate by the ratio of the number of no rain days to the total number of days on the other hand the distribution of the continuous part cannot be easily assessed meanwhile due to the complexity of the precipitation distribution it is difficult to estimate the conditional distribution of the actual rainfall from a prediction consequently in order to analyse the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast and make full use of the lead time from the nwp there is a demand for methods that are able to generate the actual probability of precipitation from nwp based forecasts over recent decades a number of studies have been extensively carried out to meet this objective based on a bivariate probability distribution between observations and the single value precipitation forecast li et al 2017 dai et al 2018 the bivariate meta gaussian distribution function was developed by krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 by using a normal quantile transformation nqt in the bayesian forecasting system bfs herr and krzysztofowicz 2005 first used this method to assess the uncertainty in the precipitation data berrocal et al 2008 used a two stage approach to model the precipitation amounts in which the occurrence of rainfall is considered first and a gamma distribution is used to model the positive amount in the case of rainfall occurrence wu et al 2011 introduced the mixed type meta gaussian joint distribution on the basis of the method of schaake et al 2007 and krzysztofowicz and kelly 2000 robertson et al 2013 proposed an ensemble approach called rainfall post processing rpp according to the combination of the bayesian joint probability approach from wang and robertson 2011 tao et al 2014 used the ensemble post processing epp to generate a probabilistic forecast from the nwp single value forecasts khajehei and moradkhani 2017 employed the copula functions to build the bivariate joint distribution and compared them with the meta gaussian distribution approach most of the former cases assumed that the distributions of the observations and the forecasts are irrelevant which can be estimated respectively and the conditional distribution is built through the joint distribution and marginal distribution brown and seo 2013 furthermore using nqt will inevitably lead to the transformation of non normal variables into normal space which may have impacts on the performance of the estimated probability khajehei and moradkhani 2017 although the copulas can capture the probability distribution between the observations and forecasts without variable transformation selecting the appropriate function is difficult due to the temporal and spatial variability of rainfall additionally since the hydrometeorological system is highly random the actual reservoir operation strategies are usually formulated by magnitudes of flood or precipitation rather than specific values accordingly the main task is to develop a procedure that can accurately and simply describe the uncertainty in numerical precipitation forecasts for a particular timescale and simultaneously provide a basis for reservoir flood control engineering regulation as well as an alert in advance in this paper we evaluated the daily precipitation predictions from four different global forecasting centres over the shihe river catchment of huaihe river basin in china during the flood season an uncertainty analysis model will be established under the bayesian framework with a generalized probability density function gpdf meanwhile in this paper we paid more attention to the magnitude of the future precipitation and the classification of the precipitation events involves the fuzziness therefore the fuzzy probability was employed to describe the fuzziness of the system this new model can not only obtain the conditional probability distribution of the precipitation with high accuracy and reliability by the nwp but also take the fuzzy events in actual flood control into consideration furthermore the new model was compared with the ensemble forecasts generated by the weather agencies by using several verification methods in the next section we detail the fuzzy bayesian uncertainty analysis model along with the evaluation indicators section 3 introduces an overview of the dataset and the study area the results and discussion are described in section 4 and finally the conclusions are provided in section 5 2 methodology the purpose of this study is to develop an uncertainty analysis model to offer reliable advanced information for flood control and water resource management the bayesian theory and fuzzy probability were used to build the relationship between specific forecast values and true magnitudes of precipitation on the basis of the gpdf the theory of the fuzzy bayesian model and the gpdf are provided below 2 1 bayesian theory 2 1 1 generalized probability density function the bayesian formula is an effective way for uncertainty analysis and has been commonly used in hydrological forecasting krzysztofowicz 2002 biondi and de luca 2013 han and coulibaly 2017 the probability distribution for precipitation however is a mixed distribution including a discrete part and a continuous part which cannot be directly applied in the bayesian formula here we transform the distribution law of discrete random variable into a probability density function pdf form through the gpdf making it applicable to the bayesian formula the dirac delta function is one of the most commonly used generalized function in hydrology which is also known as the impulse function and usually represented by δ x conceptually define δ x x r as a dirac delta function indicating 1 δ x x 0 0 x 0 δ x d x ε ε δ x d x 1 ε 0 let x as a discrete random variable r v and all its possible values are x 1 x 2 x n then the distribution law of r v x can be expressed as 2 p x x i p i i 1 2 n where p i 0 i 1 2 n i 1 n p i 1 through the eq 1 the gpdf of r v x can be drawn as follows 3 f x x i 1 n p i δ x x i the gpdf of discrete r v x can satisfy the properties of pdf eq 4 4 f x x 0 x f x x d x 1 2 1 2 prior distribution the first step of the model is to estimate the prior distribution based on historical data or expert opinions in this case the prior distribution is the marginal distribution of natural precipitation i e the historical observation values therefore the procedure begins with fitting different distributions to the observation as many former studies have mentioned the probability distribution of daily rainfall is composed of a discrete part and a continuous part the discrete part of the probability of daily rainfall is easy to estimate from the frequency of no rain occurrence in the total number of days but the continuous part varies in different studies a number of specific distributions such as gamma lognormal weibull and exponential or nonparametric methods were used to fit the marginal distribution of daily precipitation brown and seo 2010 these distributions are well suited to non negative data and are powerful in representing the extreme values in this paper the kolmogorov smirnov test k s test is adopted to find the most suitable marginal distribution of the observations here we denote r v x as the daily precipitation and its sample space is ω x 0 therefore the cumulative probability distribution cdf of r v x can be drawn as 5 f x x p x x 0 x 0 f x x p x x α 0 1 α 0 p 0 x x x 0 x 0 where α 0 p x 0 subsequently the gpdf of x is as follows 6 f x x α 0 δ x 1 α 0 f x x x 0 2 1 3 likelihood function let r v y indicate the predicted precipitation the forecast is also non negative so the sample space of y is ω y 0 the likelihood function is the relationship between the two random variables in this paper the forecast errors are used to set up the conditional distribution eq 7 7 y x ε in this equation the ε is the forecast error and the conditional probability of y can be introduced with the probability distribution of the error 8 f y y x x p y y x x 0 y 0 f y y x x p y 0 x x p y 0 x x p y y y 0 x x y 0 meanwhile it is noticed that the errors are non negative when x 0 due to the sample space of y accordingly the case of x 0 should be considered separately and the non negative distributions are employed for fy x 0 y eq 9 9 f y x 0 y p y y x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 p y 0 x 0 p y 0 x 0 p y y y 0 x 0 β 0 0 1 β 0 0 0 y f y t x 0 d t where β 0 0 p y 0 x 0 f y y x 0 0 y 0 0 y 0 0 f y y x 0 d y 1 in contrast when x 0 it can generally be assumed that the errors between the forecasted value and unknown true value obey a censored normal distribution 10 f y x x x 0 y p y y x x x 0 p y y y 0 x x x 0 p y y y 0 x x x 0 β x 0 1 β x 0 0 y f y t x x 0 d t where β x 0 p y 0 x x f y y x x 0 0 y 0 0 y 0 0 f y y x x 0 d y 1 consequently the conditional gpdf for r v y with r v x x can be expressed as shown in eq 11 11 f y y x x β x 0 δ y 1 β x 0 f y y x x 2 1 4 posterior distribution through the gpdf of the prior distribution and likelihood function the posterior distribution of observation can be derived using a bayesian formula eq 12 additionally the discrete continuous and mixed distributions can be unified in this formula by using the gpdf 12 f x x y y f x x f y y x x f x t f y y x t d t where f x x y y is the conditional gpdf of the r v x at r v y y 2 2 probability of fuzzy event since most of the events in nature contain both random and fuzzy uncertainties the probability of a fuzzy event has always been a hotspot in research fields since the theory of the fuzzy set was proposed in 1965 zadeh 2015 a fuzzy set a on a universe set x is mapping a x 0 1 x a x the 0 a x 1 represents the degree of membership of each element x x the a x of a fuzzy set a is also called the membership function and can be presented as μ a x if a is a fuzzy event on a complete set x x 1 x 2 x i with the corresponding probability p x i i 1 2 p x i 0 i 1 p x i 1 of each element x i x we define the probability of fuzzy event a with eq 13a for the discrete condition and eq 13b for the continuous condition with pdf f x 13a p a i 1 μ a x i p x i 13b p a μ a x f x d x where μ a x is the membership function of a note that the probability of the fuzzy set has been studied in three different aspects 1 the event is fuzzy but the probability is clear 2 the event is clear but the probability is fuzzy and 3 both the event and probability are fuzzy zadeh 1999 in this paper only case 1 i e the fuzzy event with clear probability is discussed through the eqs 12 and 13 the fuzzy probability of each magnitude can be derived by the fuzzy bayesian model with the eq 14 14 p a i y y x i x i 1 f x x f y y x x μ a i x f x t f y y x t d t d x it is remarkable that there are obvious differences between the model in this study and the fuzzy bayesian formula introduced by zadeh eq 15 the posterior distribution of the fuzzy bayesian formula is the conditional cdf between two different fuzzy sets while the model obtains the probability of a fuzzy set from a single specific value das and ghosh 2019 15 p a i b j p a i p b j a i j 1

in the flood season when there will be only a small amount of precipitation in the future the reservoir can maintain a relatively high water level to store additional water and generate more energy conversely if there will be a large amount of precipitation the reservoir may need to release part of its storage to ensure the safety of flood control in this paper the amount of daily precipitation is divided into four different magnitudes based on the classification standard of the meteorological department of china table 1 a 1 0 10 including no rain and light rain a 2 10 50 including medium rain and heavy rain a 3 50 100 including rainstorm a 4 100 including heavy rainstorm and extreme rainstorm the classification in this study can provide a basis for reservoir regulation however for the actual regulation more specific classification criteria based on the reservoir conditions and the hydrological characteristics of watershed are necessary 2 3 2 membership function the membership function is an important part in the theory of fuzzy sets indicating the relationship between elements and sets there are various different kinds of curve shape for the membership function such as the normal distribution curve cauchy distribution curve and trapezium distribution curve compared to the nonlinear membership functions the trapezium distribution curve has the advantages of simple calculation and parameterization therefore the trapezium distribution curve is selected as the membership function in this paper fig 1 and its formula is expressed in eqs 16 eq 16a for the left side trapezium distribution eq 16b for the right side trapezium distribution and eq 16c for the trapezium distribution 16a μ a x a b 1 x a b x b a a x b 0 b x 16b μ a x c d 0 x c x c d c c x d 1 d x 16c μ

lead times several statistical metrics were assessed to compare the forecasts and observations including correlation coefficient cc and root mean square error rmse additionally three different probabilistic measures were also chosen to evaluate the ability of the fuzzy bayesian model and compare with the ensemble forecasts from the weather agencies 2 4 1 mean square error the mean square error mse is one of the most commonly used measure to quantify the extent to which the predicted response value is close to the true response value in this case the mse of is employed to examine the accuracy of the bayesian model based on the gpdf eq 17a and ensemble forecasts eq 17b 17a mse 1 n i 1 n e x x oi 2 y y i 1 n i 1 n 0 t x oi 2 f t y y i d t 17b mse 1 n i 1 n 1 m j 1 m x i j x oi 2 where n denotes the total number of forecasts m denotes the number of forecast ensembles xi j denotes the ith prediction of the jth ensemble member and xoi denotes the ith true value 2 4 2 average

2007 candille and talagrand 2005 and it can be calculated with the following equation 20 bs 1 n i 1 n f i o i 2 where n denotes the total number of forecasts fi denotes the prediction probability of the weather event and oi is equal to 1 or 0 depending on whether the event has been observed to occur or not the brier score is negatively oriented with a range of 0 1 and the brier score is equal to 0 if the forecast is perfect to assess the reliability of the fuzzy bayesian model the brier score is employed for different magnitudes in this paper 3 data and study area 3 1 study area the shihe river is the one of the most important tributaries of main stream of the huaihe river with a catchment area of 5848 km2 above the jiangji hydrological station there are two main reservoirs located in the catchment the meishan reservoir and the nianyushan reservoir fig 2 due to the impact of the monsoon climate the precipitation over the shihe river catchment is concentrated in the flood season during may september the watershed receives over 800 mm of precipitation per year on average while over 65 of the annual precipitation occurs during the flood season the precipitation in the catchment exhibits a slightly downward trend from south to north in order to obtain better areal precipitation and meet the demand of flood forecasting the study area is divided into three subcatchments according to the location of rainfall or hydrological measure stations and large reservoirs and the areal average precipitation is estimated by the area weighted method in the subcatchments respectively 3 2 forecast and observation data as a major component of the observing system research and predictability experiment thorpex tigge thorpex interactive grand global ensemble dataset consists of ensemble forecast datasets from eleven main forecasting centres starting in 2006 aimed at improving the ability of high impact weather forecasting within two weeks swinbank et al 2016 the control forecasts of four agencies from 2015 to 2018 were selected in this study cma china meteorological centre jma japan meteorological agency ecmwf european centre for medium range weather forecast and ukmo united kingdom meteorological office more details of the datasets used in this paper are briefly given in table 2 according to table 2 the horizontal resolutions and forecast lengths of the four centres are different thus several methods were used to make the forecasts consistent 1 we only selected the forecast on the base time of 00 00utc 2 the forecast length for this study is 7 d 168 h and 3 the spatial resolutions for all four datasets were 0 50 0 50 meanwhile the locations of the precipitation ground stations in shihe river basin are shown in fig 2 this study is conducted on the measured daily rainfall data of different subcatchments by using the thiessen polygon during the flood season from 2013 to 2018 the first four years 2013 2016 of observations are used to evaluate the prior distribution the forecast data from 2015 to 2016 are employed to calibrate the model and the last two years 2017 2018 are treated as a validation period 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessment of precipitation forecast from tigge the experiment begins with the evaluation of the precipitation forecast data to examine the performance of precipitation forecasts from the four datasets the rmse for different lead times between the forecasts and observation in the flood season during 2015 2018 are shown in fig 3 fig 3 presents that the jma is the best precipitation forecast in the study area the performance of ukmo and ecmwf are similar while the cma has the worst prediction ability generally with the increase of lead time the forecast accuracies of the four centres show a downward trend the cc of the precipitation forecasts illustrate the same trend as the rmse table 3 meanwhile the performances of jma ecmwf and ukmo are closer in table 3 the cma however is still the worst forecast the daily forecasted rainfall versus measured rainfall during 2015 2018 in the whole shihe river catchment for several lead times is shown in figs 4 and 5 shows the distribution of errors for the four centres from the last two figures it is significant that the mean errors of the rainfall forecasts are close to 0 and most of the values are concentrated near 0 however all four centres still have large outlier values of error which is a fatal defect for flood control safety and water resource management fig 5 the evaluation results prove that the precipitation forecasts from tigge are unreliable for flood forecasting and reservoir regulation it is necessary to develop a method that can describe the uncertainty of precipitation forecasts and provide reservoir managers with a reliable prediction of risk for flood control in advance thielen et al 2009 zhang et al 2011 4 2 the performance of fuzzy bayesian model the fuzzy bayesian model begins with finding the best prior distribution that can describe the probability of measured daily precipitation several specific probability distributions were determined by maximum likelihood estimation mle and examined by the k s test in table 4 h is a logical value indicating the result of the hypothesis test if h 1 this means the rejection of the null hypothesis at 5 significance level otherwise the null hypothesis is accepted i e h 0 meanwhile the p represents the scalar value with a range of 0 1 and small values of p cast doubt on the validity of the null hypothesis the results indicate that the weibull distribution with h 0 and the largest p value is the best distribution to describe the probability of daily precipitation over the shihe river catchment additionally the cdf of the three distributions are shown in fig 6 all the three distributions in fig 6 can capture the probability distribution of measured daily rainfall in this paper the weibull distribution is selected to describe the probability of observations the likelihood function is one of the most important parts of the bayesian formula in this model there are two different conditions that should be considered x 0 and x 0 the likelihood function of x 0 can be expressed simply through a discrete part and a censored normal distribution with a mean value of 0 eq 21 in the case of x 0 the likelihood function is also composed of a discrete part and a non negative distribution also the weibull distribution is chosen as the best distribution for the continuous part based on the mle and the k s test subsequently the posterior distribution can be generated by eq 12 21 φ y x σ 2 a x 2 π σ e y x 2 2 σ 2 y 0 where a x is a parameter to guarantee a total probability of 1 and 0 φ y x σ 2 d y 1 to examine the performance of the fuzzy bayesian model the mse wpi and brier score are selected to evaluate its accuracy sharpness and reliability and compared with the results of ensemble forecasts from the four weather agencies according to fig 7 the mse of probabilistic forecasts from different forecast datasets estimated by the bayesian model show a decreasing trend of accuracy with the growth of lead time also the probabilistic forecasts generated from jma and ecmwf have better performance indicating that high accuracy control forecast lead to a better probabilistic result with the new model additionally the small differences between the mse of the training period and verification period prove the good generalization ability of the model the ensemble forecasts of the four centres in the verification period are selected as comparisons to study the performance of the generated probabilistic forecast based on the new model as seen in fig 8 the bayesian model based on gpdf has a similar performance in mse with the ensemble forecasts from ecmwf jma and ukmo although the mse of fuzzy bayesian model is slightly larger than that of ensemble forecasts in the first two days of lead time it has a higher accuracy for longer lead time by contrast the ensemble forecast from cma has a worse performance than the new model in all the lead times fig 9 presents the wpi of the bayesian model and ensemble forecasts in the verification period over the shihe river catchment in the figure the wpi of the new model is lower than the ensemble forecasts especially for lead time over 3d the lower wpi indicates a narrower 90 prediction interval and better sharpness meanwhile the wpi of the new model is more stable and has only small fluctuation with the change of lead time the brier scores calculated for this study are presented in fig 10 this figure shows the brier scores for the four classifications through the fuzzy bayesian model and ensemble forecasts in the verification periods overall the brier scores of the fuzzy bayesian model is lower than the ensemble forecasts indicating a better ability to resolve different magnitudes additionally there are only small differences in the brier scores between the results of fuzzy bayesian model obtained by different centres the fuzzy bayesian model is proved as an effective and consistent method to describe the probability of the precipitation forecast in conclusion the assessment results for the fuzzy bayesian model illustrate that the model can acquire an accurate probability distribution of the true value from a single specific forecast value compared with the ensemble forecasts the results of the fuzzy bayesian model prove that the model and ensemble forecasts have a little improvement in accuracy but the model is more effective from the aspect of sharpness and reliability also the model has great generalization performance and is easy to update through the likelihood function when new samples appear which is beneficial to real time flood forecast and control 4 3 uncertainty analysis of precipitation forecast according to the above results it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model is a reliable method to estimate the probability distribution of precipitation magnitude also the results show that better predictions will lead to more effectively probability forecasts since the one of the main purposes of this study is to provide a credible probability precipitation prediction for flood forecasting and reservoir regulation the fuzzy bayesian model is also used to analyse the uncertainty of different prediction values at a particular lead time the forecast dataset from jma with the best forecast performance was chosen as an example for the uncertainty analysis in this study fig 11 reveals the probability distribution of different magnitudes from different precipitation forecast values over the shihe river catchment with the lead times of 1 d 3 d 5 d and 7 d in fig 11 it is noticed that the probability of a1 is quite high for a forecast value of less than 5 mm over 0 75 in contrast for predictions over 120 mm the probability of a4 is over 0 95 the probability of a3 reaches its peak when the forecast value is approximately 70 mm while the peak value of a2 is the lowest of the four magnitudes only around 0 80 overall the maximum probability of each magnitude appears near the midpoint of the range except the a1 meanwhile the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast increases gradually with the increase in lead time which is consistent with the former results furthermore for the forecasts exceeding 50 mm the probability of a1 has an increasing trend while the probability of a4 decreases especially when the lead time exceeds 5d the decrease in the probability of a4 means that the large prediction values with long lead time are likely to be overestimated which is also shown in figs 4 and 5 to summarize the probability distribution of the precipitation forecasts over the shihe river catchment is clear and stable with a short lead time less than 3 d since the accuracy of the precipitation forecast decreases along with the increase in the lead time the uncertainty also shows an upward trend especially for the forecast values over 30 mm more specifically the results of the uncertainty analysis indicate that through the fuzzy bayesian model the short term precipitation forecasts from tigge with good prediction ability and stable distribution of uncertainty can be applied to provide a reference for reservoir operation and flood resource utilization conversely further efforts are needed to improve precipitation forecasts with a long lead time in order to obtain a better probability distribution 5 conclusion the uncertainty analysis of the precipitation forecast is essential for improving the lead time of reservoir operation as well as for assessing the risk of flood resource utilization although the development of the nwp makes it possible to plan regulation strategies with a long lead time these methods suffer from the uncertainty of the precipitation forecast the purpose of this study is to examine the performance of precipitation forecasts from tigge and develop a probabilistic model to describe the uncertainty of the forecasts on the basis of bayesian theory and fuzzy probability therefore the rainfall forecasts from tigge were evaluated in the shihe river catchment during the flood season 2015 2018 and a fuzzy bayesian model was established to depict the probability distribution of the daily precipitation forecast the technique is based on the gpdf which can be used to unify bayesian formulas with different forms of distribution in this study four control forecast datasets from tigge were selected and compared with the area weighed historical observations the results show that the jma has the best performance in the shihe river catchment and the prediction abilities of ecmwf and ukmo are close to jma in general the forecast abilities of the control forecasts exhibit an inverse relationship with the lead time in addition through the assessment of the forecasts it is noticed that the precipitation forecast from the four datasets are biased and unreliable the forecast results from tigge are affected by a number of errors from different sources and cannot meet the demand of flood control safety to describe the uncertainty in the precipitation forecast a fuzzy bayesian model was built with the gpdf taking into account both the fuzziness and randomness of the forecasts the probabilistic measures including the mse wpi and brier score were employed to evaluate the forecast ability of the new model and compare with the ensemble forecasts from the weather agencies the assessment results indicate that the fuzzy bayesian model is capable of building the conditional distribution between observations and the forecasts of daily rainfall and it has good generalization capability furthermore compared with the ensemble forecasts although the new model has a slightly improvement in mse but it has better performance in wpi and brier score it is proved that the fuzzy bayesian model is an effective method to model and assess the uncertainty in the precipitation forecast due to its performance in accuracy sharpness and reliability the results of the uncertainty analysis using a fuzzy bayesian model show that the short term forecast within 3 d from jma is acceptable to evaluate the risk and benefit of the reservoir regulation driven by the nwp the probability distribution of rainfall forecast based on jma with long lead time however is unstable and relatively complex therefore we think that it is a feasible result to extend the lead time of reservoir operation to 3 d meanwhile some correction methods such as multi model ensemble forecast can be combined with the model for further enhancement of the performance in long term forecasting zhi et al 2012 cai et al 2018 one main challenge for reservoir operation and flood resource utilization is the accuracy and lead time of the precipitation or flood forecasting the rainfall forecast from nwp is an effective method to improve the lead time but is limited to the low prediction ability due to the relatively simple structure and stable performance in short term forecast the fuzzy bayesian model would be a strong candidate for error modelling and assessment of precipitation forecasts as well as risk and benefit assessment of reservoir regulation in addition it is worth mentioning that this study only used the four different fuzzy sets and the trapezium distribution curve and assumed that the likelihood function is a censored normal distribution the future investigations will employ more specific classifications other membership functions and some non parametric methods under the framework of fuzzy bayesian model to provide probabilistic precipitation prediction for flood forecast and

6243,rapid economic development and population growth in the lancang mekong river basin makes it imperative for water resources to be used fairly and efficiently among all stakeholders this paper proposes an integrated model framework to assess the water benefits sharing schemes among the five stakeholders in the basin namely china thailand laos cambodia and vietnam three objectives are considered for this assessment hydropower hp eco index ei and agricultural water use aw the hydrologic model optimization model and cooperative game theory methods are jointly used to analyze the water benefits of stakeholders under different scenarios according to the model cooperation can bring more incremental benefits in dry years when water resources are scarce three cooperative game theoretical methods namely the shapley value the gately point and the nash harsanyi solution are employed to find the possible benefit sharing solutions the results show that china and laos need to operate their reservoirs for downstream countries beneficial uses under cooperation and thus compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit from cooperation is necessary no matter which method is used it is found that all of the future damming plans would enhance the basin level cooperation in most cases in particular according to the analysis damming in the basins of the sesan srepok and sekong rivers would have more effect than damming in the upper lancang mekong river basin after 2030 based on some verified assumptions the results of this paper can offer real world preferences but the uncertainties need to be further explored keywords cooperative game theory cgt hydrological model optimization model reservoir operation 1 introduction water is the source of life the basis of ecosystems and essential for production frutiger 2004 cunha 2009 feitelson 2012 in many cultures water is regarded not only as a life resource but also as a source of spiritual inspiration with existential value dinar and hogarth 2015 however water scarcity and the temporal and spatial variability of water lead to international conflicts over shared water resources ohlsson 2000 for instance dams are expected to meet various objectives but conflicts often arise when different stakeholders compete for scarce water resources and limited reservoir storage capacity hipel et al 1997 2003 in the real world it is not possible to satisfy the myriad needs of all stakeholders even with an optimal solution the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the most contested international river basins in the world more than 70 dams spread across the six riparian countries i e china myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in the lmrb make the management of this transboundary river a daunting task the water demand of each of the six countries is quite different without an effective cooperation mechanism dams in this basin were not constructed and operated under unified planning leading to disputes over water benefits sharing among stakeholders moreover with construction and operation of future planned dams along the mainstream and tributaries efforts to maintain water quality and protect aquatic and floodplain ecosystems in downstream countries will become increasingly difficult dudgeon 2000 the primary objective of water resources systems management is to maximize water benefits and allocate them to all stakeholders in an equitable and efficient way game theory specifically cooperative game theory cgt offers an attractive way to achieve this goal cgt describes outcomes when players come together in different combinations unlike global optimization cgt determines the benefits of each combination of stakeholders separately thereby assessing the relative benefits of stakeholders forming coalitions recently some studies have applied cgt methods to analyze water benefits sharing in the lmrb for instance yu et al 2018 explored the effects of hydrological conditions and reservoir operation policies on transboundary cooperation of the mekong basin based on a real case in 2016 however ambitious future damming plans in the lmrb have introduced additional challenges in this context different water uses such as hydropower ecological demand and agricultural water demand among different stakeholders may change owing to different cooperation patterns and damming plans which need to be further explored ringler 2001 wang et al 2003 johnston and kummu 2012 ziv et al 2012 this paper proposes an integrated model framework to examine water benefits sharing schemes and cooperative patterns under different scenarios using the lmrb as a case study the changes of three objectives hydropower ecological demand and agricultural water use under different cooperation patterns and damming plans are analyzed i e the rest of this paper is arranged as follows first the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model is used to simulate the natural streamflow which offers a baseline for analyzing the effects of reservoir operation then the benefits under different coalitions are calculated by an optimization model based on the differential evolution de algorithm considering hydropower hp ecological demand represented by an eco index ei and agricultural water use aw on this basis three cgt methods are tested to reallocate the incremental benefits of cooperation in typical years then five damming scenarios in the lower mekong basin are compared to analyze the effects of damming on cooperation finally conclusions are presented 2 research area and data the lancang mekong river flows 4800 km from tibet through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam and into the south china sea fig 1 the lmrb is generally divided into two sub basins xi et al 2008 the upper mekong river basin which is called the lancang river basin in china covers an area of approximately 195 000 km2 24 of the total drainage area the lower mekong river basin consists of the other five countries and covers an area of about 600 000 km2 76 of the total drainage area li et al 2017 increasing energy demand and pursuit of economic growth in the lmrb have led to extensive hydropower development in the lancang mekong river and its tributaries grumbine et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 china has built six hydropower dams on the mainstream of the lancang river since 1992 the two largest dams are xiaowan 14 56 km3 of total storage completed in 2010 and nuozhadu 22 4 km3 of total storage completed in 2014 in recent years tributary dams have developed rapidly as discussed in many works in the literature arias et al 2014 cochrane et al 2014 piman et al 2016 in thailand powerful state and private companies are driving hydropower development in laos to control the benefits of these projects matthews 2012 the government of laos has committed to supplying 9000 mw to thailand and 3000 mw to vietnam by 2025 geheb and suhardiman 2019 another important hydropower area is the so called 3s i e sesan srepok and sekong river basins where nine dams are currently operated and 11 dams are under construction with a total installed capacity of 3643 mw 60 of a potential 6400 mw mrc 2009 piman et al 2012 within the next 20 years 18 dams are planned for construction on the mainstream of the mekong river 8 in china 9 in laos and 1 in cambodia li et al 2017 as for the whole mekong basin more dams will be built by 2025 with a water storage capacity of 55 km3 baran and myschowoda 2009 agriculture is the primary economic sector of the countries in the lower mekong river basin and thus the water consumption for agriculture is the main driver of total water consumption yu et al 2016 agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 90 of the total water consumption in laos and thailand while the share for vietnam is more than 60 the availability of water for agriculture is a significant driver of economic development in the downstream countries meanwhile the lmrb is one of the world s 35 biodiversity hotspots mittermeier et al 2011 ngor et al 2018 more than 1700 fish species have been recognized and the list is still expanding bao 2001 mrc 2002 the operation of reservoirs may destroy the systems and change the flood pulse regime which is the key driver of the ecological productivity of the mekong river mrc 2010 holtgrieve et al 2013 two important ecological entities are closely related to the flow regimes of the river and are located toward the downstream of the lmrb first the tonle sap located in cambodia is rich in aquatic resources and contains more than 300 species of freshwater fish the water level fluctuates extremely between the wet season june to october and dry season november to may second the mekong delta covering an area of about 55 000 km2 44 000 km2 in vietnam and 11 000 km2 in cambodia is sensitive to tidal and seawater intrusion to reconcile the conflicts of water use among lmrb countries a cooperative organization was established in 1995 called the mekong river commission mrc only four countries i e thailand laos cambodia and vietnam became constituent members and thus the coalition is partial and unintegrated a new organization called the lancang mekong cooperation mechanism lmc which consists of all six countries in the mrb was established in 2016 water resources and agriculture are two of the five priority areas of the lmc for basin scale cooperation the daily flow data and reservoir data used in this paper were obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index räsänen et al 2017 reservoir mapping tool http damtool servir adpc net and china s hydrologic gage stations the hourly rainfall data from 1998 to 2014 were obtained from the trmm 3b42v7 product ftp disc2 nascom nasa gov data trmm gridded huffman et al 2007 the potential evapotranspiration pet data were obtained from a global daily database provided by the famine early warning systems network http earlywarning usgs gov fews 3 methodology 3 1 model framework description the proposed model framework presented in fig 2 includes the following four steps 1 setting the cooperation scenarios 2 calculating stakeholders direct water benefits under different scenarios 3 reallocating the incremental water benefits from coalitions based on cgt while ensuring that the water benefit sharing schemes make all stakeholders better off and 4 assessing the effects of damming and model sensitivity in the first step cooperation scenarios are set among them the c rule is developed based on a linear regression model to simulate china s current reservoir operation strategies the c rule is derived and verified by comparing natural streamflow and dam impacted streamflow the crest hydrological model is used to simulate natural streamflow based on the rainfall and potential evaporation data from 1998 to 2014 in the second step the water benefit value is defined as the combination of hydropower hp eco index ei and agricultural water use aw an optimization model using a differential evolution de algorithm i e hea de is developed to obtain the direct water benefits of stakeholders in different scenarios based on the hea de model when a country chooses to operate independently water demand is satisfied as much as possible regardless of other countries demand however when a country decides to participate in a coalition it may abandon part of its direct water benefits e g hp in exchange for greater total water benefits historical natural daily streamflow data from 1960 to 1991 are used to represent the hydrological conditions based on which the results of three typical years i e wet normal and dry are analyzed generally the optimization model provides globally optimized solutions at basin level assuming that all stakeholders cooperate however if a stakeholder obtains fewer benefits in a grand coalition cooperation among all stakeholders than in a partial coalition or if it operates independently it would certainly break away from the grand coalition and choose the partial coalition or independent operation thus two conditions are necessary for the grand coalition 1 it should yield incremental benefit over the partial coalition and non cooperation and 2 the incremental benefit should be shared among all stakeholders so that each stakeholder is better off than partial coalition and operating independently therefore in the third step reallocating the incremental benefit generated by cooperation is essential for stakeholder cooperation for this purpose three cgt methods i e shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution are employed in this paper to find the feasible schemes of benefit reallocation step 4 offers some extended analysis 3 2 crest hydrological model the crest model khan et al 2011 wang et al 2011 is a grid based distributed hydrological model that was jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and the national aeronautics and space administration servir project team several operational systems including the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs project and flood monitoring demonstration system utilize crest as a primary model gourley et al 2017 crest v2 1 matlab version is used in this paper the crest model requires grid based precipitation pet and watershed characteristics including the digital elevation model flow direction and flow accumulation as model inputs the outputs of this model include discharge actual et and runoff natural streamflow in sekong sesaen srepok and tonle sap are simulated by the crest model and compared with the observed streamflow data arias et al 2014 piman et al 2016 china s current reservoir operation rules c rule are simulated by regressing a linear equation li et al 2018 as follows 1 r i a s i i b s s i 1 c s r i 1 d s s 1 2 3 o r 4 where r i is the water released on the i th day i i is inflow on the i th day s i 1 is water storage on the i 1th day s represents 4 seasons and a s b s c s a n d d s are four parameters in period s these parameters are regressed based on the crest simulated natural flow i and the observed flow r assuming that the differences between i and r are mostly induced by reservoir operation 3 3 hea de optimization model a daily optimization model considering hp ei and aw as the objectives is developed nine conceptual dams based on real projects are set in this model table 1 the installed capacities and active storage values of the conceptual dams are set as the sum of the values of all involved dams in the lmrb a schematic of the multiple reservoir system is shown in fig 3 the benefit of hydropower generation is defined as hp li et al 2018 as follows 2 hp η i 1 365 r g i g h i h down where hp is total hydropower production η is the coefficient of efficiency rg i is the water release for hydropower generation on the i th day g is gravitational acceleration h i is the average reservoir water level on the i th day and h down is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant recreating the natural flow regime is viewed as a promising and effective way to meet environmental objectives richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha parameters are the most popular metrics to represent a natural flow regime the ecological objective defined in this paper is set as ei li et al 2018 3 ei p 1 p w p a r a t e p 4 a r a t e p a r p a n p a n p where p is the total number of parameters chosen from the iha w p is the weight of the p th parameter a r a t e p is the alteration rate of the p th parameter a r p is the value of the p th parameter after reservoir operation regulated and a n p is the value of the p th parameter under natural conditions unregulated the smaller the ei is the less the natural flow regime is changed here principle component analysis pca guttman 1954 jackson 1993 is employed to choose the representative parameters from all 33 iha parameters moreover each parameter chosen by pca contains a certain percentage of the available information of the whole group this percentage represents the contribution rate of the parameter a subset of indexes selected by pca from the iha metrics can represent particular facets of the flow regime that are relatively independent of one another olden and poff 2003 and therefore is applicable in determining environmental flow constraints or ecological objectives in reservoir operation the kaiser guttman criterion jackson 1993 gao et al 2009 is used in this paper to select the parameters these parameters are 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum which can represent the major components of flow regime in the basin the ei weight coefficients wp are set based on the contribution rate of each principal component and are 0 76 0 084 0 062 0 049 and 0 045 respectively the third objective is agricultural water demand aw yu et al 2018 based on the fao database 2010 and mrc 2018 5 aw m 1 12 awr m awu m awr m 2 12 where aw is the shortage index for agricultural water use m is the number of months awrm is the volume of potential agricultural water demand in month m and awum is the volume of actual agricultural water use in month m the smaller the aw is the better the agricultural demand is met annual agricultural water use demand in the lower mekong basin is 322 9 134 9 147 0 and 1390 9 108 m3 in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam respectively mrc 2018 monthly distribution of agricultural water demand is shown in table 2 the total benefit function is defined as follows 6 f c b 100 λ 1 hp hp min hp max hp min λ 2 ei max e i ei max ei min λ 3 aw max a w aw max aw min 7 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 1 where fcb represents the final comprehensive benefit λ 1 λ 2 a n d λ 3 are the weights assigned to each objective respectively and the maximum and minimum values of the three objectives are set as hp max eimax awmax hp min eimin and awmin respectively as shown in fig 4 setting max hp as the only objective hp max can be obtained directly by optimization and so can eimin and awmin eimax is the larger of the ei value out of the max hp only and min aw only results while awmax is the larger of the aw value from the max hp only and min ei only results the values of hp ei and aw have different ranges i e hp ranges from 25 7 to 430 4 ei from 0 to 9 01 and aw from 0 to 0 56 thus eq 6 non dimensionalizes the three objectives and makes them comparable to find optimal solutions the differential evolution de algorithm storn and price 1997 is applied the algorithm combines simple operators with operations of mutation crossover and selection to evolve from a randomly produced initial population to a final near optimal solution ahmadianfar et al 2017 3 4 essentials of cooperative game theory many studies have utilized cgt to address multi stakeholder problems in water resources rogers 1969 dinar and alemu 2000 fernandez 2002 fisher and huber lee 2009 fernandez et al 2009 madani 2010 teasley and mckinney 2011 madani and lund 2011 hui et al 2016 a cooperative game g n v consists of two elements 1 players and 2 a characteristic function that can specify the value under all possible coalitions shapley 1953 here n 1 2 3 i n represents the set of all players the characteristic function v assigns a value v s to every non empty coalition s n among them v n means the final gain obtained when all players cooperate which is defined as the grand coalition the core is the most important concept in cgt and is defined as a set of valid efficient allocations focusing on how to reallocate the incremental benefits of coalitions among players in cgt the core may be empty this occurs when the benefit obtained from partial coalition is larger than that from the grand coalition the individual rationality condition group rationality condition and efficiency condition are defined as 11 x i v i i n 12 i s x i v s s n 13 i n x i v n respectively where xi is the final gain after reallocation of player i under the grand coalition v i is the value for player i when this player operates independently n is the number of players v s is the final gain of a partial coalition s and v n is the final gain of the grand coalition 3 5 cooperative game theory methods 3 5 1 shapley value this method was proposed by shapley 1953 the fair gain of the players from the grand coalition is calculated as follows 14 x i s n i s n s s 1 n v s v s i where n is the number of players s is the number of players in coalition s and v s i is the value of coalition s without player i the shapley value applies mainly to situations in which the contributions of each player are unequal 3 5 2 gately point the gately point dermot gately 1974 is based on the bargaining ability of players consider an original imputation x1 x2 xn for a grand coalition if player i decides to quit the coalition the loss of player i should be xi v i and the joint loss to the rest of the players is 15 j i x j v n i the ratio of the joint loss of the other players except player i and the loss of player i is defined as the quit propensity of player i as follows 16 d x i j i x j v n i x i v i the higher is the value of d x i the larger loss in the grand coalition does the absence of player i cause the gately point is defined as the imputation that every player has equal quit propensity dermot gately 1974 3 5 3 nash harsanyi solution this method was proposed by nash 1953 for a two player bargaining game and then extended to an n player game by harsanyi 1959 as follows 17 m a x i 1 n x i v i the incremental benefit of player i is defined as x i v i which represents the final gain obtained from the grand coalition minus the benefit obtained from independent operations 4 results of the six countries that the mekong river flows through myanmar makes the lowest contribution to both flow 2 and area 3 ringler 2001 and thus it is not considered in the model therefore five stakeholders are modelled in this paper 1 china 2 thailand 3 laos 4 cambodia and 5 vietnam here china and laos are located in upstream areas and have an advantage in developing reservoirs meanwhile the other three stakeholders are located in downstream areas with similar demand for water resources i e irrigation and ecological demand considering that the coalitions of stakeholders for more beneficial water use greatly depend on the operation of reservoirs china and laos play more important roles in forming possible coalitions in practice this is observed from the real cooperative case that occurred in 2016 yu et al 2018 and the negotiations between thailand and laos on cooperative dam development planning in laos government of laos 2010 thus of the 67 possible coalitions among the stakeholders 6 coalition structures which are more likely to happen in reality are selected to analyze other coalitions such as those among downstream countries or between two upstream countries are possible in theory but difficult to form owing to lack of incentives the six selected coalition structures are as follows 1 grand coalition with all five stakeholders china thailand laos cambodia vietnam where denotes a coalition 2 all independent china thailand laos cambodia vietnam 3 china other stakeholders 4 china c rule other stakeholders 5 china thailand laos cambodia vietnam and 6 china thailand laos cambodia vietnam the detailed reasons for selecting these coalitions are as follows coalitions 1 and 2 are designed to represent the baselines in the best and worst cases of cooperation china as the most upstream stakeholder holds big reservoirs and thus coalitions 3 and 4 are designed to analyze the impacts of china s strategies on other countries with optimised and current reservoir operations respectively there has been considerable cooperation in reservoir construction between thailand and laos mostly the thai private sector and the government of laos and cooperation will be strengthened in the future government of laos 2010 matthews 2012 thus coalition 5 is employed laos cambodia and vietnam have built many dams in the 3s river basins leading to significant positive and negative impacts on the three countries which is represented by coalition 6 4 1 china s current reservoir release rules the crest hydrological model is used to develop the operation rules under the current condition streamflow values in the upstream station i e chiang saen and downstream station i e stung treng as shown in fig 1 are simulated on a daily basis by this model the calibration period is from 1998 to 2002 and the validation period is from 2003 to 2014 fig 5 the two periods are divided because five dams were constructed in china after 2003 the validation period is further split from 2010 validation period 1 from 2003 to 2010 and validation period 2 from 2011 to 2014 as the two largest reservoirs xiaowan built in 2010 nuozadu built in 2014 were operated after 2010 these reservoirs contribute 91 of the total storage capacity of all existing reservoirs in the basin li et al 2017 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to evaluate the simulation results of the crest model which are compared with the observed streamflow series the nsc values for streamflow at the upstream chiang saen station are 0 91 0 79 and 0 16 in the calibration period validation period 1 and validation period 2 respectively since the rainfall and pet input to crest do not change much in the validation periods the differences between the simulated natural streamflow and the observed streamflow can be attributed mostly to dam construction and operation from 2003 to 2014 the extreme low nsc value in validation period 2 could be attributed to the construction and operation of the two largest reservoirs the nsc values for streamflow at the downstream stung treng station are 0 85 0 85 and 0 84 during the calibration period validation period 1 and validation period 2 respectively the simulated streamflow can capture the natural streamflow regime well downstream because china s dam construction and operation have no clear effects on the downstream flow regime li et al 2017 on this basis the observed flow in 2013 and 2014 at chiang saen station is regarded as release induced by the cascade reservoir operations in china by contrast the simulated flow from crest is considered as natural flow fig 6 the simulated flow and observed flow are used to regress the parameters of the c rule in eq 1 table 3 shows the regressed parameters of the c rule fig 5 shows the comparison of the crest simulated flow observed flow and c rule simulated flow in 2013 and 2014 at chiang saen station indicating that the regressed c rule can simulate the observed release well the reservoir operation with the c rule is regarded as the strategy in the current state providing a baseline for further comparison 4 2 stakeholders direct benefits in different scenarios as shown in eqs 6 and 7 the fcb is set as the final comprehensive benefit to measure the gains of stakeholders the equal weights λ1 0 33 λ2 0 33 λ3 0 33 are defined in eq 7 which treats the three objectives on an equal basis hydropower and instream ecological water use do not alter the total availability of water owing to no water consumption which is very different from agricultural water use however the temporal flow regimes are changed by hydropower and instream ecological water use which lead to competition among the three objectives in a given time period for instance when downstream farmers need water for irrigation hydropower companies may keep water in reservoir for high water head to generate more power in this paper the competitive relationship can be captured by the hea de model and considered in the reallocation of total benefits the results of the different scenarios are summarized in tables 4 and 5 the highest and lowest values of fcb at system level occur in scenario 1 grand coalition and scenario 2 independent which are 277 3 and 244 1 respectively in a normal year taking a normal year as an example if china and laos join a coalition the fcb values for lower mekong countries i e thailand cambodia and vietnam increase substantially especially vietnam 59 7 in scenario 1 21 8 in scenario 2 however the fcb value of china decreases dramatically for coalition from 88 8 in scenario 2 to 44 9 in scenario 1 and the fcb value of laos also declines from 53 0 in scenario 2 to 51 7 in scenario 1 both the hp and ei of china decline significantly hp 389 6 106 kwh ei 0 26 in scenario 2 hp 325 6 106 kwh ei 4 42 in scenario 1 china and laos need to give up some of their own benefits to guarantee greater benefits at the system level under coalitions especially china the fcb value of china is greater under the optimal operation rule than under the c rule 80 3 in scenario 3 69 9 in scenario 4 implying that the current release strategy could be improved although the fcb values of other countries do not change much according to this model the fcb value for vietnam in scenario 2 is 21 8 when vietnam joins a coalition it always gains substantially 59 7 in scenario 1 33 7 in scenario 3 31 9 in scenario 4 and 33 3 in scenario 6 hydrologic conditions also exert significant impact on the values of fcb the results show that the fcb values are more sensitive when water resources are limited in a typical dry year at system level the total fcb differences between the most scenario 1 and the least scenario 2 are 16 6 in a wet year 33 2 in a normal year and 37 6 in a dry year respectively this conclusion implies that cooperation is more valuable and expected in dry years yu et al 2018 because the marginal value of water increases with increasing scarcity 4 3 benefit reallocation under grand coalition when all the stakeholders join the grand coalition scenario 1 the total benefit would be the greatest but some of the stakeholders e g china and laos might suffer a loss if no compensation were offered cgt can be used to reallocate the incremental benefits obtained from the grand coalition the shapely value gately point and nash harsanyi methods are used to analyze the possible solutions any solution belonging to the core is potentially acceptable by the cooperating parties however they might have different preferences over the core solutions table 6 summarizes the final gain i e benefit after compensation to the stakeholders based on these three methods the results are discussed based on a normal year for instance according to the gately point method china and laos obtain compensation of 48 4 93 3 44 9 48 4 and 1 7 53 4 51 7 1 7 fcb respectively in the grand collation thailand cambodia and vietnam offer compensation of 8 0 59 9 51 9 8 0 17 0 61 1 44 1 17 0 and 25 1 59 7 34 6 25 1 fcb respectively nevertheless the final gain for the lower mekong countries is still larger than that obtained without any coalition as shown in table 6 in practice the reallocation of incremental benefits can be undertaken by compensation in varying forms not only water or money it may occur in the form of economic trade and political exchange among other ways 4 4 cooperative opportunities under different damming scenarios a series of dam construction scenarios are set to explore the cooperative opportunities under different countries future damming plans namely status quo construction assumed construction 2020 a 2020 assumed construction 2025 a 2025 assumed construction 2030 a 2030 and assumed construction far future a far future here the status quo construction scenario represents the current dam construction situation the years following the assumed construction scenarios represent the years that storage capacity will be reached in future damming plans for instance scenario a 2020 refers to the dam construction situation in the year 2020 table 7 shows the storage capacities of different dam constructions the results are shown in fig 7 the final gain obtained by stakeholders is calculated by the gately point method as the results from the shapley value and nash harsanyi solution are similar to that from the gately point method according to this analysis under the status quo scenario china has the most powerful ability to regulate streamflow and thus china obtains most of the incremental benefits for future scenarios downstream stakeholders can obtain more final gain from cooperation owing to the increase of active storage capacity in the lower mekong and thus their willingness to cooperate is enhanced when the storage capacity of laos is larger than that of china i e a 2025 a 2030 and a far future laos asks for more benefits than china does in conclusion future damming plans in the lmrb would enhance basin level cooperation in most cases 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of weights and iha parameters equal weights λ1 0 33 λ2 0 33 λ3 0 33 are applied in the analysis in the previous section however the choice of weight depends on many factors e g stakeholder s water use performance and may alter the results here five groups of weights are tested to analyze the impact of weights the stakeholders final gains are shown in table 8 in these five groups the weight of hp is changed from 0 to 1 while the remaining weight of ei and aw is apportioned equally the main objective of reservoirs built in china is to generate hydropower when considering hp as the only objective λ1 1 0 λ2 0 0 λ3 0 0 china changes the flow regimes significantly and thus china can obtain far greater water benefit than downstream countries can owing to its large storage capacity and advantageous position by contrast when considering ei and aw as the only two equal objectives λ1 0 0 λ2 0 5 λ3 0 5 china s superior position is weakened the results show that different weights impact the water sharing and cooperation strategy among different countries the weights may be related to the total water capital of the countries the ecological degradation risk or other sources of energy available to them which make the cooperation situation complex the differences among the stakeholders utility functions need to be analyzed further five parameters of iha 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum are chosen as the representative parameters of ei li et al 2017 the values of the alteration rate compared with natural streamflow a r a t e p in eq 4 of the five parameters in all the grand coalition scenarios with different weights are plotted with boxes of variation fig 8 the model prioritizes meeting demand for the 90 day maximum and low pulse duration which are not significantly changed from the natural flow regimes and remain stable in all scenarios however the other three parameters vary significantly in different scenarios this is related to the contribution rate of these parameters and the trade off among the three objectives it should be noted that the ecological demand of rivers is very complex and thus better ecological assessment methods for the lmrb and its sub basins need to be explored further based on more detailed data e g fish data 5 2 cooperative incentives and ecological damage under 3s basins dam construction the 3s rivers contribute up to 20 of the mekong s annual flows and provide critical ecosystem services to the downstream tonle sap lake and mekong delta piman et al 2016 the most important ecological node is located at the intersection of three tributaries where dam construction by laos cambodia and vietnam could have potential ecological impacts on the basin in the future the active reservoir storage in the 3s basins will increase at least 2 8 times especially in cambodia table 7 piman et al 2012 table 9 shows the final gain in the different dam construction scenarios based on the model equal weights and fcb is reallocated by gately point method cambodia s final gains increase substantially because of its rapidly expanding storage capacity in the a 2030 scenario it is worth noting that the ei of the ecological node of the intersection of the three tributaries in cambodia is 2 0 5 8 and 6 2 in the status quo a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively this result implies that the environmental flow in the 3s basins may be altered considerably due to the construction of reservoirs if dams are constructed only in the 3s basin assuming the other six conceptual dams do not exist the ei calculated at vietnam s ecological node is 1 9 2 0 2 5 5 3 and 5 7 in the current a 2020 a 2025 a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively if no dam is built in the 3s basins the ei for vietnam s ecological node is 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 and 4 7 in the current a 2020 a 2025 a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively according to this result hydropower development in the 3s basins may have more effects than damming of the upper lancang mekong river after the year 2030 5 3 limitations and future work the mekong basin is a complex and sensitive system of more than 70 dams spread across six riparian countries li et al 2017 and the number of dams is still growing this model simplifies the connection of dams and ignores some small dams which may make the results less applicable to some local cases the natural flow simulated based on the crest model might not fully match the reality the streamflow from tonle sap is regarded as having a fixed seasonal pattern based on the observations in practice the flow regimes of tonle sap may be dynamically influenced by the streamflow from the mainstream and 3s basins arias et al 2014 thus the impact mechanism needs further study this paper considers ecological demand as part of water benefit and a group of widely used indicators the iha is applied in the model the effects of water withdrawal water quality and sediment changes induced by dam construction are also significant and should be considered in future work the concept of water benefit is difficult to quantify accurately especially when related to ecological objectives moreover the utility functions among different countries may differ this paper considers only three objectives that are important for all mekong countries the unit of hydropower is kwh while ei and aw are dimensionless this paper changes the three variables into the same dimension and the range of values is from 0 to 1 another common method is to convert them into money ringler 2001 ringler and cai 2006 however conversion formulas are not easy to find a better normalization method is needed this paper considers only six possible coalitions additional partial coalitions with better payoff need to be further explored different stakeholders may have different preferences for the three methods and some commonly used rules could be applied to evaluate their acceptability such as plurality sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 propensity to disrupt asgari et al 2014 read et al 2014 and the stability index dinar and howitt 1997 read et al 2014 which is left for future research however all the benefit sharing solutions are in the core which means that although the stakeholders have different preferred benefit sharing solutions they have no incentive to depart from grand cooperation if one of the solutions is implemented this conclusion highlights the importance of a cooperative institution that can promote the implementation of grand cooperation schemes in addition the de algorithm is limited by a slow rate and low accuracy of convergence and it is easy to fall into local optimal solution it is necessary to develop more advanced algorithms in future 6 conclusions to analyze the water benefits sharing in transboundary rivers this paper proposes a framework that integrates the hydrological model crest the optimization model hea and the cooperative game theory methods six most possible coalition patterns are discussed the results show that if china and laos choose to join a coalition rather than remaining independent the direct water benefits of lower mekong countries increase substantially under the current dam construction situation however china and laos need to give up some of its own benefits to guarantee greater benefits at the system level under coalitions and thus compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit of cooperation is necessary the results also show that the total fcb differences between the largest scenario scenario 1 and the smallest scenario scenario 2 are 16 6 in a wet year 33 2 in a normal year and 37 6 in a dry year implying that cooperation is more valuable and expected in dry years the shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution methods are used to reallocate the incremental benefits under the grand coalition the reallocation schemes from the three methods are different but all stakeholders final gains are always larger than those under independent scenarios the effects of future damming plans in the lmrb are analyzed all of the damming plans would incentivise and hence enhance basin level cooperation in most cases however when downstream stakeholders have comparative regulating capacity to upstream countries there would be competition for benefit reallocation a case study of the 3s basins which form part of one of the lmrb s most important sub basins shows that the environment may be destroyed considerably owing to the construction of reservoirs this indicates that damming in the 3s basins would have more environmental effects than damming in the upper lmrb after 2030 the results and analysis can help decision makers to understand the current situation and help to promote future cooperation considering the complexity of the reality in transboundary river basins uncertainties of water benefits sharing and transboundary cooperation in the lmrb certainly remain which calls for further research acknowledgments this research was funded by the national key research and development program of

6243,rapid economic development and population growth in the lancang mekong river basin makes it imperative for water resources to be used fairly and efficiently among all stakeholders this paper proposes an integrated model framework to assess the water benefits sharing schemes among the five stakeholders in the basin namely china thailand laos cambodia and vietnam three objectives are considered for this assessment hydropower hp eco index ei and agricultural water use aw the hydrologic model optimization model and cooperative game theory methods are jointly used to analyze the water benefits of stakeholders under different scenarios according to the model cooperation can bring more incremental benefits in dry years when water resources are scarce three cooperative game theoretical methods namely the shapley value the gately point and the nash harsanyi solution are employed to find the possible benefit sharing solutions the results show that china and laos need to operate their reservoirs for downstream countries beneficial uses under cooperation and thus compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit from cooperation is necessary no matter which method is used it is found that all of the future damming plans would enhance the basin level cooperation in most cases in particular according to the analysis damming in the basins of the sesan srepok and sekong rivers would have more effect than damming in the upper lancang mekong river basin after 2030 based on some verified assumptions the results of this paper can offer real world preferences but the uncertainties need to be further explored keywords cooperative game theory cgt hydrological model optimization model reservoir operation 1 introduction water is the source of life the basis of ecosystems and essential for production frutiger 2004 cunha 2009 feitelson 2012 in many cultures water is regarded not only as a life resource but also as a source of spiritual inspiration with existential value dinar and hogarth 2015 however water scarcity and the temporal and spatial variability of water lead to international conflicts over shared water resources ohlsson 2000 for instance dams are expected to meet various objectives but conflicts often arise when different stakeholders compete for scarce water resources and limited reservoir storage capacity hipel et al 1997 2003 in the real world it is not possible to satisfy the myriad needs of all stakeholders even with an optimal solution the lancang mekong river basin lmrb is one of the most contested international river basins in the world more than 70 dams spread across the six riparian countries i e china myanmar thailand laos cambodia and vietnam in the lmrb make the management of this transboundary river a daunting task the water demand of each of the six countries is quite different without an effective cooperation mechanism dams in this basin were not constructed and operated under unified planning leading to disputes over water benefits sharing among stakeholders moreover with construction and operation of future planned dams along the mainstream and tributaries efforts to maintain water quality and protect aquatic and floodplain ecosystems in downstream countries will become increasingly difficult dudgeon 2000 the primary objective of water resources systems management is to maximize water benefits and allocate them to all stakeholders in an equitable and efficient way game theory specifically cooperative game theory cgt offers an attractive way to achieve this goal cgt describes outcomes when players come together in different combinations unlike global optimization cgt determines the benefits of each combination of stakeholders separately thereby assessing the relative benefits of stakeholders forming coalitions recently some studies have applied cgt methods to analyze water benefits sharing in the lmrb for instance yu et al 2018 explored the effects of hydrological conditions and reservoir operation policies on transboundary cooperation of the mekong basin based on a real case in 2016 however ambitious future damming plans in the lmrb have introduced additional challenges in this context different water uses such as hydropower ecological demand and agricultural water demand among different stakeholders may change owing to different cooperation patterns and damming plans which need to be further explored ringler 2001 wang et al 2003 johnston and kummu 2012 ziv et al 2012 this paper proposes an integrated model framework to examine water benefits sharing schemes and cooperative patterns under different scenarios using the lmrb as a case study the changes of three objectives hydropower ecological demand and agricultural water use under different cooperation patterns and damming plans are analyzed i e the rest of this paper is arranged as follows first the coupled routing and excess storage crest hydrological model is used to simulate the natural streamflow which offers a baseline for analyzing the effects of reservoir operation then the benefits under different coalitions are calculated by an optimization model based on the differential evolution de algorithm considering hydropower hp ecological demand represented by an eco index ei and agricultural water use aw on this basis three cgt methods are tested to reallocate the incremental benefits of cooperation in typical years then five damming scenarios in the lower mekong basin are compared to analyze the effects of damming on cooperation finally conclusions are presented 2 research area and data the lancang mekong river flows 4800 km from tibet through china myanmar laos thailand cambodia and vietnam and into the south china sea fig 1 the lmrb is generally divided into two sub basins xi et al 2008 the upper mekong river basin which is called the lancang river basin in china covers an area of approximately 195 000 km2 24 of the total drainage area the lower mekong river basin consists of the other five countries and covers an area of about 600 000 km2 76 of the total drainage area li et al 2017 increasing energy demand and pursuit of economic growth in the lmrb have led to extensive hydropower development in the lancang mekong river and its tributaries grumbine et al 2012 räsänen et al 2017 china has built six hydropower dams on the mainstream of the lancang river since 1992 the two largest dams are xiaowan 14 56 km3 of total storage completed in 2010 and nuozhadu 22 4 km3 of total storage completed in 2014 in recent years tributary dams have developed rapidly as discussed in many works in the literature arias et al 2014 cochrane et al 2014 piman et al 2016 in thailand powerful state and private companies are driving hydropower development in laos to control the benefits of these projects matthews 2012 the government of laos has committed to supplying 9000 mw to thailand and 3000 mw to vietnam by 2025 geheb and suhardiman 2019 another important hydropower area is the so called 3s i e sesan srepok and sekong river basins where nine dams are currently operated and 11 dams are under construction with a total installed capacity of 3643 mw 60 of a potential 6400 mw mrc 2009 piman et al 2012 within the next 20 years 18 dams are planned for construction on the mainstream of the mekong river 8 in china 9 in laos and 1 in cambodia li et al 2017 as for the whole mekong basin more dams will be built by 2025 with a water storage capacity of 55 km3 baran and myschowoda 2009 agriculture is the primary economic sector of the countries in the lower mekong river basin and thus the water consumption for agriculture is the main driver of total water consumption yu et al 2016 agricultural water consumption accounts for more than 90 of the total water consumption in laos and thailand while the share for vietnam is more than 60 the availability of water for agriculture is a significant driver of economic development in the downstream countries meanwhile the lmrb is one of the world s 35 biodiversity hotspots mittermeier et al 2011 ngor et al 2018 more than 1700 fish species have been recognized and the list is still expanding bao 2001 mrc 2002 the operation of reservoirs may destroy the systems and change the flood pulse regime which is the key driver of the ecological productivity of the mekong river mrc 2010 holtgrieve et al 2013 two important ecological entities are closely related to the flow regimes of the river and are located toward the downstream of the lmrb first the tonle sap located in cambodia is rich in aquatic resources and contains more than 300 species of freshwater fish the water level fluctuates extremely between the wet season june to october and dry season november to may second the mekong delta covering an area of about 55 000 km2 44 000 km2 in vietnam and 11 000 km2 in cambodia is sensitive to tidal and seawater intrusion to reconcile the conflicts of water use among lmrb countries a cooperative organization was established in 1995 called the mekong river commission mrc only four countries i e thailand laos cambodia and vietnam became constituent members and thus the coalition is partial and unintegrated a new organization called the lancang mekong cooperation mechanism lmc which consists of all six countries in the mrb was established in 2016 water resources and agriculture are two of the five priority areas of the lmc for basin scale cooperation the daily flow data and reservoir data used in this paper were obtained from the mekong river commission http portal mrcmekong org index räsänen et al 2017 reservoir mapping tool http damtool servir adpc net and china s hydrologic gage stations the hourly rainfall data from 1998 to 2014 were obtained from the trmm 3b42v7 product ftp disc2 nascom nasa gov data trmm gridded huffman et al 2007 the potential evapotranspiration pet data were obtained from a global daily database provided by the famine early warning systems network http earlywarning usgs gov fews 3 methodology 3 1 model framework description the proposed model framework presented in fig 2 includes the following four steps 1 setting the cooperation scenarios 2 calculating stakeholders direct water benefits under different scenarios 3 reallocating the incremental water benefits from coalitions based on cgt while ensuring that the water benefit sharing schemes make all stakeholders better off and 4 assessing the effects of damming and model sensitivity in the first step cooperation scenarios are set among them the c rule is developed based on a linear regression model to simulate china s current reservoir operation strategies the c rule is derived and verified by comparing natural streamflow and dam impacted streamflow the crest hydrological model is used to simulate natural streamflow based on the rainfall and potential evaporation data from 1998 to 2014 in the second step the water benefit value is defined as the combination of hydropower hp eco index ei and agricultural water use aw an optimization model using a differential evolution de algorithm i e hea de is developed to obtain the direct water benefits of stakeholders in different scenarios based on the hea de model when a country chooses to operate independently water demand is satisfied as much as possible regardless of other countries demand however when a country decides to participate in a coalition it may abandon part of its direct water benefits e g hp in exchange for greater total water benefits historical natural daily streamflow data from 1960 to 1991 are used to represent the hydrological conditions based on which the results of three typical years i e wet normal and dry are analyzed generally the optimization model provides globally optimized solutions at basin level assuming that all stakeholders cooperate however if a stakeholder obtains fewer benefits in a grand coalition cooperation among all stakeholders than in a partial coalition or if it operates independently it would certainly break away from the grand coalition and choose the partial coalition or independent operation thus two conditions are necessary for the grand coalition 1 it should yield incremental benefit over the partial coalition and non cooperation and 2 the incremental benefit should be shared among all stakeholders so that each stakeholder is better off than partial coalition and operating independently therefore in the third step reallocating the incremental benefit generated by cooperation is essential for stakeholder cooperation for this purpose three cgt methods i e shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution are employed in this paper to find the feasible schemes of benefit reallocation step 4 offers some extended analysis 3 2 crest hydrological model the crest model khan et al 2011 wang et al 2011 is a grid based distributed hydrological model that was jointly developed by the university of oklahoma and the national aeronautics and space administration servir project team several operational systems including the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs project and flood monitoring demonstration system utilize crest as a primary model gourley et al 2017 crest v2 1 matlab version is used in this paper the crest model requires grid based precipitation pet and watershed characteristics including the digital elevation model flow direction and flow accumulation as model inputs the outputs of this model include discharge actual et and runoff natural streamflow in sekong sesaen srepok and tonle sap are simulated by the crest model and compared with the observed streamflow data arias et al 2014 piman et al 2016 china s current reservoir operation rules c rule are simulated by regressing a linear equation li et al 2018 as follows 1 r i a s i i b s s i 1 c s r i 1 d s s 1 2 3 o r 4 where r i is the water released on the i th day i i is inflow on the i th day s i 1 is water storage on the i 1th day s represents 4 seasons and a s b s c s a n d d s are four parameters in period s these parameters are regressed based on the crest simulated natural flow i and the observed flow r assuming that the differences between i and r are mostly induced by reservoir operation 3 3 hea de optimization model a daily optimization model considering hp ei and aw as the objectives is developed nine conceptual dams based on real projects are set in this model table 1 the installed capacities and active storage values of the conceptual dams are set as the sum of the values of all involved dams in the lmrb a schematic of the multiple reservoir system is shown in fig 3 the benefit of hydropower generation is defined as hp li et al 2018 as follows 2 hp η i 1 365 r g i g h i h down where hp is total hydropower production η is the coefficient of efficiency rg i is the water release for hydropower generation on the i th day g is gravitational acceleration h i is the average reservoir water level on the i th day and h down is the downstream tailwater level of the hydropower plant recreating the natural flow regime is viewed as a promising and effective way to meet environmental objectives richter et al 1996 poff et al 1997 the indicators of hydrologic alteration iha parameters are the most popular metrics to represent a natural flow regime the ecological objective defined in this paper is set as ei li et al 2018 3 ei p 1 p w p a r a t e p 4 a r a t e p a r p a n p a n p where p is the total number of parameters chosen from the iha w p is the weight of the p th parameter a r a t e p is the alteration rate of the p th parameter a r p is the value of the p th parameter after reservoir operation regulated and a n p is the value of the p th parameter under natural conditions unregulated the smaller the ei is the less the natural flow regime is changed here principle component analysis pca guttman 1954 jackson 1993 is employed to choose the representative parameters from all 33 iha parameters moreover each parameter chosen by pca contains a certain percentage of the available information of the whole group this percentage represents the contribution rate of the parameter a subset of indexes selected by pca from the iha metrics can represent particular facets of the flow regime that are relatively independent of one another olden and poff 2003 and therefore is applicable in determining environmental flow constraints or ecological objectives in reservoir operation the kaiser guttman criterion jackson 1993 gao et al 2009 is used in this paper to select the parameters these parameters are 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum which can represent the major components of flow regime in the basin the ei weight coefficients wp are set based on the contribution rate of each principal component and are 0 76 0 084 0 062 0 049 and 0 045 respectively the third objective is agricultural water demand aw yu et al 2018 based on the fao database 2010 and mrc 2018 5 aw m 1 12 awr m awu m awr m 2 12 where aw is the shortage index for agricultural water use m is the number of months awrm is the volume of potential agricultural water demand in month m and awum is the volume of actual agricultural water use in month m the smaller the aw is the better the agricultural demand is met annual agricultural water use demand in the lower mekong basin is 322 9 134 9 147 0 and 1390 9 108 m3 in thailand laos cambodia and vietnam respectively mrc 2018 monthly distribution of agricultural water demand is shown in table 2 the total benefit function is defined as follows 6 f c b 100 λ 1 hp hp min hp max hp min λ 2 ei max e i ei max ei min λ 3 aw max a w aw max aw min 7 λ 1 λ 2 λ 3 1 where fcb represents the final comprehensive benefit λ 1 λ 2 a n d λ 3 are the weights assigned to each objective respectively and the maximum and minimum values of the three objectives are set as hp max eimax awmax hp min eimin and awmin respectively as shown in fig 4 setting max hp as the only objective hp max can be obtained directly by optimization and so can eimin and awmin eimax is the larger of the ei value out of the max hp only and min aw only results while awmax is the larger of the aw value from the max hp only and min ei only results the values of hp ei and aw have different ranges i e hp ranges from 25 7 to 430 4 ei from 0 to 9 01 and aw from 0 to 0 56 thus eq 6 non dimensionalizes the three objectives and makes them comparable to find optimal solutions the differential evolution de algorithm storn and price 1997 is applied the algorithm combines simple operators with operations of mutation crossover and selection to evolve from a randomly produced initial population to a final near optimal solution ahmadianfar et al 2017 3 4 essentials of cooperative game theory many studies have utilized cgt to address multi stakeholder problems in water resources rogers 1969 dinar and alemu 2000 fernandez 2002 fisher and huber lee 2009 fernandez et al 2009 madani 2010 teasley and mckinney 2011 madani and lund 2011 hui et al 2016 a cooperative game g n v consists of two elements 1 players and 2 a characteristic function that can specify the value under all possible coalitions shapley 1953 here n 1 2 3 i n represents the set of all players the characteristic function v assigns a value v s to every non empty coalition s n among them v n means the final gain obtained when all players cooperate which is defined as the grand coalition the core is the most important concept in cgt and is defined as a set of valid efficient allocations focusing on how to reallocate the incremental benefits of coalitions among players in cgt the core may be empty this occurs when the benefit obtained from partial coalition is larger than that from the grand coalition the individual rationality condition group rationality condition and efficiency condition are defined as 11 x i v i i n 12 i s x i v s s n 13 i n x i v n respectively where xi is the final gain after reallocation of player i under the grand coalition v i is the value for player i when this player operates independently n is the number of players v s is the final gain of a partial coalition s and v n is the final gain of the grand coalition 3 5 cooperative game theory methods 3 5 1 shapley value this method was proposed by shapley 1953 the fair gain of the players from the grand coalition is calculated as follows 14 x i s n i s n s s 1 n v s v s i where n is the number of players s is the number of players in coalition s and v s i is the value of coalition s without player i the shapley value applies mainly to situations in which the contributions of each player are unequal 3 5 2 gately point the gately point dermot gately 1974 is based on the bargaining ability of players consider an original imputation x1 x2 xn for a grand coalition if player i decides to quit the coalition the loss of player i should be xi v i and the joint loss to the rest of the players is 15 j i x j v n i the ratio of the joint loss of the other players except player i and the loss of player i is defined as the quit propensity of player i as follows 16 d x i j i x j v n i x i v i the higher is the value of d x i the larger loss in the grand coalition does the absence of player i cause the gately point is defined as the imputation that every player has equal quit propensity dermot gately 1974 3 5 3 nash harsanyi solution this method was proposed by nash 1953 for a two player bargaining game and then extended to an n player game by harsanyi 1959 as follows 17 m a x i 1 n x i v i the incremental benefit of player i is defined as x i v i which represents the final gain obtained from the grand coalition minus the benefit obtained from independent operations 4 results of the six countries that the mekong river flows through myanmar makes the lowest contribution to both flow 2 and area 3 ringler 2001 and thus it is not considered in the model therefore five stakeholders are modelled in this paper 1 china 2 thailand 3 laos 4 cambodia and 5 vietnam here china and laos are located in upstream areas and have an advantage in developing reservoirs meanwhile the other three stakeholders are located in downstream areas with similar demand for water resources i e irrigation and ecological demand considering that the coalitions of stakeholders for more beneficial water use greatly depend on the operation of reservoirs china and laos play more important roles in forming possible coalitions in practice this is observed from the real cooperative case that occurred in 2016 yu et al 2018 and the negotiations between thailand and laos on cooperative dam development planning in laos government of laos 2010 thus of the 67 possible coalitions among the stakeholders 6 coalition structures which are more likely to happen in reality are selected to analyze other coalitions such as those among downstream countries or between two upstream countries are possible in theory but difficult to form owing to lack of incentives the six selected coalition structures are as follows 1 grand coalition with all five stakeholders china thailand laos cambodia vietnam where denotes a coalition 2 all independent china thailand laos cambodia vietnam 3 china other stakeholders 4 china c rule other stakeholders 5 china thailand laos cambodia vietnam and 6 china thailand laos cambodia vietnam the detailed reasons for selecting these coalitions are as follows coalitions 1 and 2 are designed to represent the baselines in the best and worst cases of cooperation china as the most upstream stakeholder holds big reservoirs and thus coalitions 3 and 4 are designed to analyze the impacts of china s strategies on other countries with optimised and current reservoir operations respectively there has been considerable cooperation in reservoir construction between thailand and laos mostly the thai private sector and the government of laos and cooperation will be strengthened in the future government of laos 2010 matthews 2012 thus coalition 5 is employed laos cambodia and vietnam have built many dams in the 3s river basins leading to significant positive and negative impacts on the three countries which is represented by coalition 6 4 1 china s current reservoir release rules the crest hydrological model is used to develop the operation rules under the current condition streamflow values in the upstream station i e chiang saen and downstream station i e stung treng as shown in fig 1 are simulated on a daily basis by this model the calibration period is from 1998 to 2002 and the validation period is from 2003 to 2014 fig 5 the two periods are divided because five dams were constructed in china after 2003 the validation period is further split from 2010 validation period 1 from 2003 to 2010 and validation period 2 from 2011 to 2014 as the two largest reservoirs xiaowan built in 2010 nuozadu built in 2014 were operated after 2010 these reservoirs contribute 91 of the total storage capacity of all existing reservoirs in the basin li et al 2017 the nash sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient nsc nash and sutcliffe 1970 is used to evaluate the simulation results of the crest model which are compared with the observed streamflow series the nsc values for streamflow at the upstream chiang saen station are 0 91 0 79 and 0 16 in the calibration period validation period 1 and validation period 2 respectively since the rainfall and pet input to crest do not change much in the validation periods the differences between the simulated natural streamflow and the observed streamflow can be attributed mostly to dam construction and operation from 2003 to 2014 the extreme low nsc value in validation period 2 could be attributed to the construction and operation of the two largest reservoirs the nsc values for streamflow at the downstream stung treng station are 0 85 0 85 and 0 84 during the calibration period validation period 1 and validation period 2 respectively the simulated streamflow can capture the natural streamflow regime well downstream because china s dam construction and operation have no clear effects on the downstream flow regime li et al 2017 on this basis the observed flow in 2013 and 2014 at chiang saen station is regarded as release induced by the cascade reservoir operations in china by contrast the simulated flow from crest is considered as natural flow fig 6 the simulated flow and observed flow are used to regress the parameters of the c rule in eq 1 table 3 shows the regressed parameters of the c rule fig 5 shows the comparison of the crest simulated flow observed flow and c rule simulated flow in 2013 and 2014 at chiang saen station indicating that the regressed c rule can simulate the observed release well the reservoir operation with the c rule is regarded as the strategy in the current state providing a baseline for further comparison 4 2 stakeholders direct benefits in different scenarios as shown in eqs 6 and 7 the fcb is set as the final comprehensive benefit to measure the gains of stakeholders the equal weights λ1 0 33 λ2 0 33 λ3 0 33 are defined in eq 7 which treats the three objectives on an equal basis hydropower and instream ecological water use do not alter the total availability of water owing to no water consumption which is very different from agricultural water use however the temporal flow regimes are changed by hydropower and instream ecological water use which lead to competition among the three objectives in a given time period for instance when downstream farmers need water for irrigation hydropower companies may keep water in reservoir for high water head to generate more power in this paper the competitive relationship can be captured by the hea de model and considered in the reallocation of total benefits the results of the different scenarios are summarized in tables 4 and 5 the highest and lowest values of fcb at system level occur in scenario 1 grand coalition and scenario 2 independent which are 277 3 and 244 1 respectively in a normal year taking a normal year as an example if china and laos join a coalition the fcb values for lower mekong countries i e thailand cambodia and vietnam increase substantially especially vietnam 59 7 in scenario 1 21 8 in scenario 2 however the fcb value of china decreases dramatically for coalition from 88 8 in scenario 2 to 44 9 in scenario 1 and the fcb value of laos also declines from 53 0 in scenario 2 to 51 7 in scenario 1 both the hp and ei of china decline significantly hp 389 6 106 kwh ei 0 26 in scenario 2 hp 325 6 106 kwh ei 4 42 in scenario 1 china and laos need to give up some of their own benefits to guarantee greater benefits at the system level under coalitions especially china the fcb value of china is greater under the optimal operation rule than under the c rule 80 3 in scenario 3 69 9 in scenario 4 implying that the current release strategy could be improved although the fcb values of other countries do not change much according to this model the fcb value for vietnam in scenario 2 is 21 8 when vietnam joins a coalition it always gains substantially 59 7 in scenario 1 33 7 in scenario 3 31 9 in scenario 4 and 33 3 in scenario 6 hydrologic conditions also exert significant impact on the values of fcb the results show that the fcb values are more sensitive when water resources are limited in a typical dry year at system level the total fcb differences between the most scenario 1 and the least scenario 2 are 16 6 in a wet year 33 2 in a normal year and 37 6 in a dry year respectively this conclusion implies that cooperation is more valuable and expected in dry years yu et al 2018 because the marginal value of water increases with increasing scarcity 4 3 benefit reallocation under grand coalition when all the stakeholders join the grand coalition scenario 1 the total benefit would be the greatest but some of the stakeholders e g china and laos might suffer a loss if no compensation were offered cgt can be used to reallocate the incremental benefits obtained from the grand coalition the shapely value gately point and nash harsanyi methods are used to analyze the possible solutions any solution belonging to the core is potentially acceptable by the cooperating parties however they might have different preferences over the core solutions table 6 summarizes the final gain i e benefit after compensation to the stakeholders based on these three methods the results are discussed based on a normal year for instance according to the gately point method china and laos obtain compensation of 48 4 93 3 44 9 48 4 and 1 7 53 4 51 7 1 7 fcb respectively in the grand collation thailand cambodia and vietnam offer compensation of 8 0 59 9 51 9 8 0 17 0 61 1 44 1 17 0 and 25 1 59 7 34 6 25 1 fcb respectively nevertheless the final gain for the lower mekong countries is still larger than that obtained without any coalition as shown in table 6 in practice the reallocation of incremental benefits can be undertaken by compensation in varying forms not only water or money it may occur in the form of economic trade and political exchange among other ways 4 4 cooperative opportunities under different damming scenarios a series of dam construction scenarios are set to explore the cooperative opportunities under different countries future damming plans namely status quo construction assumed construction 2020 a 2020 assumed construction 2025 a 2025 assumed construction 2030 a 2030 and assumed construction far future a far future here the status quo construction scenario represents the current dam construction situation the years following the assumed construction scenarios represent the years that storage capacity will be reached in future damming plans for instance scenario a 2020 refers to the dam construction situation in the year 2020 table 7 shows the storage capacities of different dam constructions the results are shown in fig 7 the final gain obtained by stakeholders is calculated by the gately point method as the results from the shapley value and nash harsanyi solution are similar to that from the gately point method according to this analysis under the status quo scenario china has the most powerful ability to regulate streamflow and thus china obtains most of the incremental benefits for future scenarios downstream stakeholders can obtain more final gain from cooperation owing to the increase of active storage capacity in the lower mekong and thus their willingness to cooperate is enhanced when the storage capacity of laos is larger than that of china i e a 2025 a 2030 and a far future laos asks for more benefits than china does in conclusion future damming plans in the lmrb would enhance basin level cooperation in most cases 5 discussion 5 1 impacts of weights and iha parameters equal weights λ1 0 33 λ2 0 33 λ3 0 33 are applied in the analysis in the previous section however the choice of weight depends on many factors e g stakeholder s water use performance and may alter the results here five groups of weights are tested to analyze the impact of weights the stakeholders final gains are shown in table 8 in these five groups the weight of hp is changed from 0 to 1 while the remaining weight of ei and aw is apportioned equally the main objective of reservoirs built in china is to generate hydropower when considering hp as the only objective λ1 1 0 λ2 0 0 λ3 0 0 china changes the flow regimes significantly and thus china can obtain far greater water benefit than downstream countries can owing to its large storage capacity and advantageous position by contrast when considering ei and aw as the only two equal objectives λ1 0 0 λ2 0 5 λ3 0 5 china s superior position is weakened the results show that different weights impact the water sharing and cooperation strategy among different countries the weights may be related to the total water capital of the countries the ecological degradation risk or other sources of energy available to them which make the cooperation situation complex the differences among the stakeholders utility functions need to be analyzed further five parameters of iha 90 day maximum low pulse duration high pulse duration number of fluctuations and date of maximum are chosen as the representative parameters of ei li et al 2017 the values of the alteration rate compared with natural streamflow a r a t e p in eq 4 of the five parameters in all the grand coalition scenarios with different weights are plotted with boxes of variation fig 8 the model prioritizes meeting demand for the 90 day maximum and low pulse duration which are not significantly changed from the natural flow regimes and remain stable in all scenarios however the other three parameters vary significantly in different scenarios this is related to the contribution rate of these parameters and the trade off among the three objectives it should be noted that the ecological demand of rivers is very complex and thus better ecological assessment methods for the lmrb and its sub basins need to be explored further based on more detailed data e g fish data 5 2 cooperative incentives and ecological damage under 3s basins dam construction the 3s rivers contribute up to 20 of the mekong s annual flows and provide critical ecosystem services to the downstream tonle sap lake and mekong delta piman et al 2016 the most important ecological node is located at the intersection of three tributaries where dam construction by laos cambodia and vietnam could have potential ecological impacts on the basin in the future the active reservoir storage in the 3s basins will increase at least 2 8 times especially in cambodia table 7 piman et al 2012 table 9 shows the final gain in the different dam construction scenarios based on the model equal weights and fcb is reallocated by gately point method cambodia s final gains increase substantially because of its rapidly expanding storage capacity in the a 2030 scenario it is worth noting that the ei of the ecological node of the intersection of the three tributaries in cambodia is 2 0 5 8 and 6 2 in the status quo a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively this result implies that the environmental flow in the 3s basins may be altered considerably due to the construction of reservoirs if dams are constructed only in the 3s basin assuming the other six conceptual dams do not exist the ei calculated at vietnam s ecological node is 1 9 2 0 2 5 5 3 and 5 7 in the current a 2020 a 2025 a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively if no dam is built in the 3s basins the ei for vietnam s ecological node is 2 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 and 4 7 in the current a 2020 a 2025 a 2030 and a far future scenarios respectively according to this result hydropower development in the 3s basins may have more effects than damming of the upper lancang mekong river after the year 2030 5 3 limitations and future work the mekong basin is a complex and sensitive system of more than 70 dams spread across six riparian countries li et al 2017 and the number of dams is still growing this model simplifies the connection of dams and ignores some small dams which may make the results less applicable to some local cases the natural flow simulated based on the crest model might not fully match the reality the streamflow from tonle sap is regarded as having a fixed seasonal pattern based on the observations in practice the flow regimes of tonle sap may be dynamically influenced by the streamflow from the mainstream and 3s basins arias et al 2014 thus the impact mechanism needs further study this paper considers ecological demand as part of water benefit and a group of widely used indicators the iha is applied in the model the effects of water withdrawal water quality and sediment changes induced by dam construction are also significant and should be considered in future work the concept of water benefit is difficult to quantify accurately especially when related to ecological objectives moreover the utility functions among different countries may differ this paper considers only three objectives that are important for all mekong countries the unit of hydropower is kwh while ei and aw are dimensionless this paper changes the three variables into the same dimension and the range of values is from 0 to 1 another common method is to convert them into money ringler 2001 ringler and cai 2006 however conversion formulas are not easy to find a better normalization method is needed this paper considers only six possible coalitions additional partial coalitions with better payoff need to be further explored different stakeholders may have different preferences for the three methods and some commonly used rules could be applied to evaluate their acceptability such as plurality sheikhmohammady and madani 2008 propensity to disrupt asgari et al 2014 read et al 2014 and the stability index dinar and howitt 1997 read et al 2014 which is left for future research however all the benefit sharing solutions are in the core which means that although the stakeholders have different preferred benefit sharing solutions they have no incentive to depart from grand cooperation if one of the solutions is implemented this conclusion highlights the importance of a cooperative institution that can promote the implementation of grand cooperation schemes in addition the de algorithm is limited by a slow rate and low accuracy of convergence and it is easy to fall into local optimal solution it is necessary to develop more advanced algorithms in future 6 conclusions to analyze the water benefits sharing in transboundary rivers this paper proposes a framework that integrates the hydrological model crest the optimization model hea and the cooperative game theory methods six most possible coalition patterns are discussed the results show that if china and laos choose to join a coalition rather than remaining independent the direct water benefits of lower mekong countries increase substantially under the current dam construction situation however china and laos need to give up some of its own benefits to guarantee greater benefits at the system level under coalitions and thus compensation by reallocating the incremental benefit of cooperation is necessary the results also show that the total fcb differences between the largest scenario scenario 1 and the smallest scenario scenario 2 are 16 6 in a wet year 33 2 in a normal year and 37 6 in a dry year implying that cooperation is more valuable and expected in dry years the shapley value gately point and nash harsanyi solution methods are used to reallocate the incremental benefits under the grand coalition the reallocation schemes from the three methods are different but all stakeholders final gains are always larger than those under independent scenarios the effects of future damming plans in the lmrb are analyzed all of the damming plans would incentivise and hence enhance basin level cooperation in most cases however when downstream stakeholders have comparative regulating capacity to upstream countries there would be competition for benefit reallocation a case study of the 3s basins which form part of one of the lmrb s most important sub basins shows that the environment may be destroyed considerably owing to the construction of reservoirs this indicates that damming in the 3s basins would have more environmental effects than damming in the upper lmrb after 2030 the results and analysis can help decision makers to understand the current situation and help to promote future cooperation considering the complexity of the reality in transboundary river basins uncertainties of water benefits sharing and transboundary cooperation in the lmrb certainly remain which calls for further research acknowledgments this research was funded by the national key research and development program of

6244,in this study the suitability of precipitation waters as semi artificial and multi component groundwater tracers is investigated and potential applications as well as limitations are discussed specifically we analyzed their migration behavior during laboratory scale experiments with groundwater saturated porous media artificially 2h and 18o labelled water as well as natural precipitation waters were injected into sediment packed columns and traced via stable isotope analysis their migration behavior was compared to that of widely used tracers these flow through experiments were underpinned by a batch reactor study and by hydrogeochemical modeling while most artificial isotope applications showed a high stability and conservative transport behavior for all tested sediments the breakthrough curves observed in some experiments with rain and snowmelt were unsteady this was most likely caused by the small ratio between the tracer s isotopic difference compared to the background signal and the available analytical precision the minimum ratio required for effectively reducing uncertainties during data evaluation showed to depend significantly on experimental conditions but should not decrease below 10 during peak breakthrough and preferably be higher furthermore our study illustrates that measurements based on using the precipitation waters inherent low electrical conductivity can be significantly biased by water sediment reactions the batch study and reactive transport simulations confirmed this observation while revealing mineral reactions and to a minor extent also ion exchange as the underlying processes keywords precipitation water tracer groundwater deuterium oxygen 18 electrical conductivity 1 introduction in hydrogeology tracer tests are routinely used to reveal the fundamental transport characteristics of aquifers davis et al 1980 the value of any tracer whether induced intentionally to the subsurface artificial tracer or naturally abundant environmental tracer depends on many different factors including the tracer characteristics the aquifer characteristics and the employed experimental design most tracer test techniques rely on the assumption of a strictly conservative behavior of the traced signal davis et al 1980 käss 2004 i e the tracer should be physically and chemically inert such that it mimics the migration of the water molecules becker and coplen 2001 additionally tracers should be non toxic easy to use and clearly distinguishable from the ambient groundwater e g käss 2004 i e a sufficiently pronounced signal to noise ratio snr is required among others a wide selection of salts such as sodium chloride nacl or potassium bromide kbr dyes e g sodium fluorescein i e uranine as well as stable or radioactive isotopes but alternatively also sum parameters such as electrical conductivity ec can be employed in artificial tracer studies davis et al 1980 käss 2004 further traceable substances such as persistent pharmaceutical compounds arye et al 2011 or properties such as temperature greskowiak et al 2006 seibert et al 2014 have been successfully used as environmental tracers e g in the context of monitoring soil aquifer treatment or managed aquifer recharge systems however under unfavorable conditions most of these tracers can change their expected behavior due to environmental factors and their variability for example the inert behavior of uranine persists only for a limited groundwater ph range käss 2004 the stable isotopes of the water molecule elements are deemed to be the most ideal water tracers as they resemble the water molecule both physically and chemically becker and coplen 2001 signatures of natural waters which are typically reported as delta notations i e as δ2h deuterium and as δ18o oxygen 18 in vs vsmow2 vienna standard mean ocean water depend strongly on climatic factors e g mook and de vries 2001 therefore they can vary significantly with covered ranges of δ δ2h 400 and δ δ18o 40 dansgaard 1964 respectively numerous environmental tracer studies have exploited such differences in the isotopic fingerprint for among others recharge estimation e g adomako et al 2010 flow and discharge pattern identification e g james et al 2000 as well as the analysis of groundwater origins and evolution e g tsujimura et al 2007 studies that employed artificial isotope labelling relied mostly on deuterium oxide 2h2o i e artificially 2h enriched water to determine flow and transport parameters in aquifers e g garnier et al 1985 maloszewski et al 1999 luhmann et al 2012 and to actively investigate infiltration processes in the vadose zone e g hangen et al 2005 mali et al 2007 schoen et al 1999 koeniger et al 2010 also used artificially 18o enriched water i e h2 18o to investigate snowmelt infiltration recently precipitation waters were employed as injection waters in two artificial tracer tests on small field scale binder et al 2019a tritschler et al 2019 thereby intentionally exploiting the existing inherent offset of δ2h δ18o and ec as detectable entities in binder et al 2019a for example the isotopes conservative behavior of a significantly depleted snowmelt was compared to variations in the ec that were simultaneously induced by the active injection of meltwater into a fluviatile aquifer both isotope signal components were recovered during extraction in the form of clearly measurable perturbations with snrs during the peak between 21 δ2h and 24 δ18o these results however indicate that the currently available precision of stable isotope analysis may limit the information content of a breakthrough signal in cases where the isotopic shift is less pronounced furthermore the observed behavior of the ec signal in particular a slightly reduced peak value suggested that geochemical reactions may have influenced the migration both aspects need to be better understood in order to clarify the usefulness of precipitation waters as active multi component tracers for aquifers i e ground water saturated porous media systems therefore we performed comparative laboratory scale experiments with controlled precipitation water applications to investigate their stability and to what extent they behaved truly conservatively finally we performed transport simulations to investigate measurement uncertainties and to explain observed ec modifications 2 study site the site selected for this study is located in pirna saxony germany in close vicinity to the elbe river fig 1 pirna is characterized by a humid temperate climate with an annual precipitation slightly below 700 mm e g tritschler et al 2019 four types of sediments table 1 were prepared to represent the characteristics of this site s lithology with a particular focus on the sediments from the upper most semi confined aquifer this aquifer zone consists of two distinct sub sections dietze and dietrich 2012 händel et al 2016 i an overlying section of relatively low permeability hydraulic conductivities i e k values are below 10 6 m s with anthropogenic fillings and varying content of fines originating from flood events of the elbe river as well as ii an underlying highly permeable section k values mostly between 10 4 m s and 10 3 m s consisting of sand and gravel all materials were obtained from nearby gravel sand pits pratzschwitz germany and excavations heidenau germany where needed samples were amended with kaolinite loam powder to more closely mimic the fines found at the study site especially with respect to the particle size distribution note that multiple detrimental impacts on the stability of uranine such as a slight sorption desorption hysteresis were previously observed for these sediments especially for the heidenau material component fichtner et al 2015 a fifth sediment type not shown in table 1 comparable to the kaolinite sample was included to identify the potential influence of clay type e g brady and weil 2002 on tracer stability this sediment contained 2 montmorillonite clay instead of kaolinite using an artificial material called friedländer blauton which was pretreated with sodium bicarbonate i e nahco3 during the manufacturing process four precipitation water samples table 2 were selected to act as proxies for the multitude of waters in the region of central and eastern saxony fig 1 small grey map the employed totalizers were protected from evaporation losses and other environmental influences by using a combination of the table tennis ball and paraffin oil methods as suggested by the international atomic energy agency iaea gnip 2014 both rain samples were characterized by comparably low ionic strengths 0 4 to 0 6 mmol kgw and low buffering capacities e g burton and pitt 2001 contrary the two snow samples had elevated ionic strengths 2 3 to 3 2 mmol kgw those can be attributed to previous winter service activities in the sampled area using a 2 submersible pump co grundfos groundwater was extracted from observation well fi 7 fig 1 tracer test field hereafter referred to as pirna groundwater it was employed as reference water the groundwater sample has an ionic strength of 8 7 mmol kgw its chemical composition is given in the the electronic supplementary material esm s1 note that further samples from g1 to g23 were included in the analysis both snowmelt samples are isotopically depleted relative to the groundwater while the rain samples are isotopically enriched additionally direct artificial isotope labelling was applied for that purpose small amounts of 2h2o co deutero 4 µl l isotopic purity of 99 9at and h2 18o co sigma aldrich 120 µl l 10 0at were equilibrated with groundwater to simulate isotope values of precipitation as observed on site here deviations relative to the groundwater range from 30 to 40 for δ2h and from 4 to 6 for δ18o tritschler et al 2019 from this data pool a sample from a heavy rainfall event in late summer 2016 was selected to serve as template aside from the artificial isotope labeling this synthetic rain and the groundwater are identical which allowed this study to focus on signature changes 3 laboratory experiments 3 1 overview of the experimental setup the laboratory investigations consisted of two main parts firstly a batch reactor study was performed to assess the hydrochemical and isotopic short term stability of natural and synthetic precipitation waters in contact with the test sediments secondly tracer experiments in sediment packed columns were performed to assess their transport behavior uranine nacl and kbr were employed as reference tracers all experiments were placed in a climate chamber co viessmann to simulate groundwater temperatures and to create a dark environment avoiding uv degradation of uranine all water samples were stored in gas dense composite material pouches made of aluminum polyethylene and polypropylene layers co tesseraux spezialverpackungen in order to reduce any bias induced by potential changes in isotope signatures and chemical compositions during storage all reported values in this study refer to conditions found shortly i e within a few hours before the start of the respective experiments experimental setup schemes are provided in the esm s1 δ2h and δ18o values were determined using a high precision isotope ratio mass spectroscopy irms system mat 253 co thermo fisher scientific coupled to a high temperature pyrolysis furnace co hekatech water salinities were measured using a 4 pole ec sensor co wtw while a bromide ion selective electrode ise co wtw and an ion chromatography system ic co dionex were employed for ion analysis uranine induced fluorescence was determined using a spectral fluorimeter co albilia 3 2 short term batch stability experiments 3 2 1 experimental procedure for the 24 hour short term stability tests the sediments were air dried pore water contents below 2 and filled into borosilicate glass bottles then either labelled or non labelled waters the latter as reference were added in a ratio of 0 5 kgsediment lwater as suggested for natural sediments e g limousin et al 2007 applied concentration levels isotope signatures and precipitation water mixtures are listed in table 3 after set up all sediment water suspensions were equilibrated using an overhead shaker 24 h 6 rpm extraction of pore water was performed by centrifugation 5000 rpm followed by filtration through a cme membrane cellulose mixed ester 0 2 µm the extracts were analyzed for their hydrochemical compositions and isotope signatures 3 2 2 data analysis the short term stabilities were determined by first calculating the residuals between the initial concentration c init and the concentration recorded after 24 h c equil a dimensionless batch stability criterion hereafter referred to as y batch b was then defined using an adapted version of the normalized root mean square error with 1 γ b a t c h b i 1 u c e q u i l i c

perfect stability ec values were considered in a logarithmic form as these cover three orders of magnitude in the experiments as most laboratories report stable isotope analysis results in delta notation isotope values were also considered in this notation and not as real abundancies of the rare isotope 3 3 column transport experiments 3 3 1 experimental procedure a series of column experiments was conducted to assess the suitability of precipitation waters as active tracers under consideration of the various technical limitations such as irms precision four separate columns id 7 cm length 40 cm were wet packed with the test sediments after set up and prior to the first tracer application all columns were slowly flushed with non labelled pirna groundwater for 30 total pore volumes to ensure that complete water saturation as well as geochemical equilibrium conditions were attained furthermore custom build automatic sampling devices were attached directly to the column effluent ends to minimize sampling errors first the transport performance of the synthetic rain i e the artificial mixture of 2h2o and h2 18o was compared for all four sediments against the reference tracer substances table 4 for this three experiments e1 e3 injecting short pulses of nacl e1 synthetic rain e2 and lastly kbr and uranine e3 were performed for the subsequent experiments one natural snowmelt sample e4 and two natural rain samples e5 and e6 were successively injected into the column packed with the well graded sand table 4 the intermediate step that employed the synthetic rain sample e2 was included to focus on elucidating the migration behavior of the isotopes while avoiding for example the impact of mineral reactions due to chemical differences between tracer and background the new snow sample was not injected as the focus was not on extreme scenarios but on assessing precision related uncertainties however a column flow experiment employing an also noticeably depleted snowmelt sample with initial tracer snrs of 61 δ2h and 55 δ18o is documented in binder et al 2019a all experiments consisted of 24 h tracer or precipitation water injections respectively followed by a continuous injection of non labelled groundwater until the initial equilibrium conditions were restored mean darcy velocities table 5 varied between the columns due to the significant differences in hydraulic conductivity and varying contact pressures of the separate flow channels of the peristaltic pump used co ismatec the darcy velocities that resulted from this setup reflect the lower range of the velocities that typically prevail at our site 3 3 2 data analysis sampling times as well as the averaged analytical values a in eqs 2 and 3 were considered on normalized scales to allow for a direct comparison as the initial snrs were sufficiently pronounced in the experiments e1 to e3 measurement errors were neglected for observed concentrations for sum parameter ec and for

plausibility by reproducing the experimentally obtained breakthrough curves btc with a 1 d analytical model specifically the dual domain mass transfer approach ddmt van genuchten and wierenga 1976 was employed for the solute transport simulation four relevant transport parameters were determined while minimizing the residuals between simulated and measured btcs mobile porosity immobile porosity longitudinal dispersivity and the dual domain mass transfer coefficient in order to effectively quantify uncertainties introduced by the different tracer signals a comparative statistical analysis was done by calculating four selected quality criterions specifically the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the weighted coefficient of determination wr2 and the index of agreement as well as by performing a linear regression analysis for all possible tracer combinations further details are provided in esm s2 parameter estimation and esm s3 statistical analysis 4 experimental results and basic analysis 4 1 short term batch stability experiments the observed δ2h values before and after equilibration with all tested sediments were very similar fig 2 a suggesting that neither the artificially isotope labelled waters nor the natural precipitation water were affected by any detrimental impacts within the selected experimental duration of 24 h y batch δ2h 0 01 this finding is expected to remain valid for applications with slightly increased experimental periods as no fractionation processes should be relevant for this short timescale aside from mixing with remains of indigenous pore water similar findings apply to the measured δ18o values fig 2b although slight deviations from the 1 1 line were observed especially in the range between 8 and 11 5 this leads to a slightly higher value for y batch δ18o of 0 02 however as most samples remained within the error margin of the irms precision δ18o can also be considered as a highly stable tracer for short term applications as precipitation waters typically have a rather low ionic strength compared to the groundwater monitoring the ec potentially provides complementary information especially as it can be effectively monitored at low cost and nowadays even in situ and adaptively vienken et al 2017 however the ec batch results with the low mineralized waters frequently deviated from the 1 1 line especially in the ec range below 300 µs cm indicating a systematic modification fig 2c furthermore these batch samples showed a steady turbidity increase in the water phase this can presumably be attributed to changes in the sediment s coagulation capabilities which in turn may be an indicator for a detrimental impact on the porous media itself note that the lowest and highest effect in this regard was observed for the well graded sand and the sample with montmorillonite respectively and that the y batch log eclow value of 0 58 that was determined for these waters was the maximum value in this study these observations can be explained by water sediment reactions by replacing the natural pore water with precipitation water i e with a typically under saturated solution mineral dissolution and to a minor extent also ion exchange may increase the pore water s ec during re equilibration e g appelo and postma 2010 representing the natural conditions no significant change was observed for the ec batch experiments with unaltered pirna groundwater the symbols are almost on the 1 1 line except for the non native sediment sample with montmorillonite where ec increased drastically to 1 ms cm waters with higher initial ionic strengths were found to remain stable i e the difference between initially applied and measured ec remained negligible compared to its absolute value for example the y batch log ecnacl value was only 0 10 for these experiments with nacl added to the groundwater in comparison uranine results were affected by sorption y batch uranine value of 0 21 fig 2d as previously observed fichtner et al 2015 furthermore the fluorescence signal itself showed a non ideal behavior specifically a signal increase beyond the initial value was observed for the samples containing montmorillonite black upwards triangles in fig 2d highlighting a strong relationship between the measured fluorescence and the solutions ph value here an increase from ph 7 to near ph 10 was observed for all samples which can be explained by the nahco3 pre treatment of the friedländer blauton finally kbr showed a relatively high stability even though the concentration dependent accuracy of the ise method employed is clearly visible fig 2e this is expressed by the still small y batch kbr value of 0 08 this result lies in between the results observed for the isotopes nacl and uranine and far below the inverse ec based stability values reference measurements employing the ic method for selected samples point towards lower y batch values data not shown 4 2 column transport experiments e1 to e3 results for the experiments e1 to e3 are shown as concentration normalized btcs in fig 3 together with the corresponding results of the inverse model simulations esm s2 almost all applied tracers achieved a full breakthrough within the primary experimental period of 8 days which corresponds to 4 exchanged total pore volumes the only exemption was uranine in the silty sand column which showed excessive tailing as expected the btcs for well graded sand fig 3 1st column have the narrowest shape and highest peak values where the normalized concentration peak value reached almost 100 of the amended tracer amplitude furthermore the btc shape widens for the poorly graded sand 2nd column and even further for both the silty sands without 3rd column and with kaolinite clay 4th column owing to the increasing hydrodynamic dispersion caused by the increased pore scale variability of k values and thus also flow velocities correspondingly observed peak concentrations as well as first arrival times decrease with increasing non uniformity of the sediments in terms of the tracer specific migration behavior the results of the column experiments largely reflect the results from the batch experiments as expected the breakthrough of the isotopically enriched synthetic rain e2 was associated with increased δ2h and δ18o values fig 3 1st and 2nd row however isolated values slightly exceeded the expected range spanned by the background s and tracer s signature in the silty sand experiment the isotope peak was slightly retarded and the peak value was reduced compared to both nacl and kbr while the times of first arrival did not differ a possible explanation might be a higher matrix diffusion rate as the water molecules are smaller in size although there were no negative observations for kbr 4th row it should be noted that the more accurate ic method was employed here while the ise method was used for the batch tests extended tailing was observed for the nacl application in the well graded sand 3rd row separately marked furthermore the normalized ec peak for the silty sand experiment with clay was significantly higher compared to the other studied tracers this can be explained by cation exchange reactions on the sediments combined with ion specific sorption as previously reported mastrocicco et al 2011 singha et al 2011 nevertheless despite this slightly non ideal behavior of nacl and method specific uncertainties of kbr both salt based tracers can still be considered as effectively stable tracer substances in contrast the uranine breakthrough was strongly affected by non ideal physicochemical behavior including a retarded arrival a smaller peak value and stronger tailing fig 3 5th row this suggests that uranine transport was most likely affected by sorption even in the experiments with the well graded sand this behavior was even more exaggerated for the poorly graded sand and the silty sand in addition the calculated mass recoveries were limited to 65 and 70 respectively the breakthrough in the kaolinite sample was less affected this phenomenon may be mainly attributed to different sediment compositions table 1 and fig 2d overall uranine performed in an unpredictable manner and must be classified as a non suitable tracer at least in the context of the conditions for the groundwater and mineralogy being present in pirna in general the relatively small differences in concentration peak value and tailing behavior among the investigated tracers resulted in correspondingly small ranges for the transport parameters obtained by the inverse modeling procedure for the respective sediments in particular the immobile porosity dispersivity and mass transfer values obtained for the δ2h and δ18o data were mostly close to the mean value obtained for all tracers with a slight tendency towards the respective observed minimum values esm s2 all quality criteria showed a good fit among the tracers with exception of uranine based on the normalized btcs the average rmse was 5 6 min 2 4 max 11 3 and mae was 4 2 min 1 9 max 8 6 while wr2 spanned a range from 0 73 to 0 98 x 0 86 and the index of agreement from 0 95 to 1 00 x 0 98 uranine datasets were again excluded as they differed significantly linear regression line slopes were found to be between 0 79 and 1 20 with a mean value of 0 97 being near to the optimal value of 1 again except for uranine more details including the omitted uranine values are provided in esm s3 4 3 column transport experiments e4 to e6 the overall results of the natural precipitation water experiments e4 to e6 fig 4 were generally similar to the results obtained for the synthetic rain sample using stable isotope analysis e2 and for the nacl application using ec for breakthrough detection e1 however as the absolute isotopic shift of the injection water was much less pronounced compared to the e2 experiment a much coarser resolution of the btcs was observed similar to e1 the breakthroughs of the precipitation waters were associated with significant ec changes however this time in the opposite direction fig 4c while ec peaks were observed at almost the same time as the isotopes an information loss was evident as the normalized peak value of these inverse ec btcs reached only 80 to 90 of the corresponding isotope peak see theoretical peak values in fig 4c both observed transport phenomena are therefore further discussed 5 detailed analysis of the observed transport phenomena 5 1 influence of stable isotope analysis precision for the synthetic rain sample experiment e2 the tracer s snr values for δ2h and δ18o were 26 and 28 5 respectively which resulted in high resolution btcs fig 3 except for some minor outliers this snr calculation was based on an initial tracer shift of δ δ2h 26 and δ δ18o 5 7 versus the reported irms precision of 1 δ2h and 0 2 δ18o respectively the tracer snrs within the series with natural precipitation waters however decreased to significantly smaller values in some cases to values close to and even below 10 given these conceptional differences irms precision was included in the btc normalization procedure using eq 3 instead of eq 2 the resulting normalized btcs and the corresponding precision confidence intervals are shown in fig 5 the btc shapes of the old snow of the mountain rain and accepting a slightly higher uncertainty also of the δ2h component of the summer rain are still smooth and characterized by a rather small error margin in contrast the normalized btc for the summer rain δ18o experiment characterized by the low initial snr became highly unstable and noticeably exceeded the possible mixing fraction range 0 to 1 it is evident that even slight deviations from the true value can lead to an inaccurate and unsteady normalization eventually this is attributed to the technical limitations in terms of accuracy and repeatability such small deviations can also be caused among other reasons by random and unavoidable errors during sampling itself and by simple rounding errors due to the device limited measurement resolution in order to illustrate the effects of low snrs on the quality of parameter estimation a transport parameter calibration was performed for the old snow experiment and multiple snr scenarios table 7 each constrained by the observed δ2h breakthrough data marked in fig 5 for this purpose the standard advection dispersion equation ade was applied in combination with a simple monte carlo approach a large range of btcs 5300 simulations each based on mobile porosity and longitudinal dispersivity values randomly selected from a predefined range was generated and eventually superimposed to define the btc envelopes the parameter range definition was manually adjusted until these envelopes approximately matched most of the measured data points during the peak including their error margins the experiments demonstrate the importance of providing a clear isotopic contrast between injection and background water in order to obtain a sufficiently resolved breakthrough signal at the sample location any increase or decrease of measurement uncertainty here the irms precision clearly affects the shape of each analyzed btc errors are then further propagated which influences the parameter calibration process eventually leading to an increased or decreased bandwidth for all transport parameters respectively the actual impact however also depends on the examined parameter specifically the results of the parameter estimation procedure table 7 show that the influence of the precision is much smaller for the mobile porosity than for the longitudinal dispersivity especially for values representing higher laboratory errors considering the results a minimum snr during the peak breakthrough of at least 10 preferably higher is suggested to effectively limit uncertainty during parameter estimation for advection dominated 1 d systems sand column and assuming sufficient amounts of injected tracer mass peak values may only be slightly decreased as compared to the initial isotopic shift relative to the background hence the previously mentioned ratio may be directly applied to the initial shift however higher initial snrs during tracer application are required for columns with increased dispersive and non equilibrium transport components e g both silty sand columns in order to obtain btcs with reasonable resolutions note that this laboratory derived recommendation for minimum snrs may not be directly applicable for field scale applications as the tracer mass here the amount of precipitation water required to achieve a reasonable resolution may increase beyond technical feasibility at least for realistic isotopic shifts of natural waters the only exception to this finding may apply to short term and short distance applications such as a push pull test for the pirna study site one such example has been analyzed documented in esm s4 by employing a 2 d flow and transport model the numerical findings were compared to those from an injection test with following drift phase and from a two well test while mainly depending on the envisaged btc resolution during the peak and on the technically feasible initial isotopic shift the conservative modeling results indicate in turn that the amount of required injection water also depends on the injection method itself 5 2 reaction induced modifications of electrical conductivity by employing the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 a series of 1 d numerical experiments was performed to reproduce the ec information loss i e the reduction of the normalized peak value as observed in the transport experiments e4 to e6 fig 4c for these simulations a virtual 1 d column was set up discretized into 200 equidistant mobile cells and each linked to a stagnant cell representing the immobile zone the initial pore water chemistry was defined according to the chemical composition of the pirna groundwater esm s1 initial ion exchanger compositions and mineral saturation states were calculated assuming equilibrium with the pore water the actual transport simulations were then performed as 1 day injection pulses of water with low ionic strength comparable to the employed rain in the laboratory experiments composition adapted from appelo and postma 2010 the injection of virtual rain was followed by the simulation of a continuous flushing period with pirna groundwater note that this numerical investigation focused solely on the variation of selected reaction types as already implemented in the standard reaction database of phreeqc specifically carbonate mineral reactions ion exchange and dual domain mass transfer were analyzed regarding their potential impact on the model result reaction parameters including ph value were varied as listed in table 8 physical transport parameters e g porosities were taken from the parameter estimation results for the well graded sand experiment esm s2 and kept constant for all model runs further reaction induced variations of the porous media properties were not considered as this would require thermal hydraulic mechanical chemical i e thmc capabilities of the reaction code in general the model output indicates that mineral reactions in combination with a sufficiently pronounced ph value offset relative to the ambient pore water are most likely the main contributors to the observed ec modifications even for ph value offsets below 1 and comparably low mineral phase concentrations up to 1 mmol l i e a still realistic range for the investigated sand column setup and the applied rainwater groundwater combination the ec modification is already significant table 9 calculated information losses i e the relative reductions in the peak value cover a range between 5 and 19 which fits the experimentally observed values this behavior is further intensified with increasing ph value offset data not shown for example the reductions were 30 and 40 in the scenarios with mineral phase concentrations of 2 mmol l and ph value offsets of 1 2 and 1 4 respectively there is a transition range between 0 06 and 0 2 mmol l where the simulation of the mineral reaction proceeds stepwise eventually leading to two superimposing sometimes still distinguishable btc peaks table 9 note that for the investigated ph range peak reductions remained stable also for scenarios with higher mineral phase concentrations up to 200 mmol l contrary the information loss is negligible 2 for all scenarios with mineral concentrations lower than 0 04 mmol l the normalized ec signal is further modified when ion exchange is additionally simulated with relative changes up to 5 observed at a ph offset of 1 4 however exchanger capacities of more than 60 mmol l have no additional effect on the simulation results and systems without mineral reactions seem to be not affected at all by ion exchange at least for the simulated sand column small immobile fraction the influence of dual domain mass transfer on the ec information loss is negligible with deviations of less than 1 not shown in table 9 almost the same applies for the ionic strength of the injected rainwater pulse on a relative scale higher ionic strengths of the pulsed injection water may eventually lead to a slightly more dampened normalized ec signal however the effective differences in the information loss are below 2 when comparing the two investigated ionic strengths in summary the discussed processes form a rather complex reaction system showing a non linear correlation between the parameters and their contribution to the accompanying ec modification nevertheless additional ec measurements can eventually assist to slightly increase the accuracy that is achievable by parameter estimation at least indirectly as the ec observations due to precipitation water migration can serve as simultaneous constraints 6 conclusions this study showed that precipitation waters are generally suitable as injection waters in artificial tracer tests for characterizing the flow and transport conditions in groundwater systems over short distances and where experiments are limited to a relatively short duration here they can be employed as valid substitutes to pure deuterium oxide or water 18o avoiding an extensive everyday use of these often highly concentrated isotope tracers in order to preserve the natural signatures that persist in the environment the experimental results confirm the strongly conservative behavior of the two water isotope tracer components while in contrast the benefit of measuring and interpreting ec signals is far less clear even as an auxiliary tracer this results mostly from the occurrence of water sediment reactions that would typically be triggered by the mineral under saturation of the precipitation water the isotope related simulations illustrate the need for considering the uncertainties induced by the technical limitations of stable isotope analysis as they clearly affect the inversion process that extracts the hydrogeological properties from the collected multi tracer data a universally valid recommendation for the required initial isotopic difference between tracer and background cannot be provided however a suggestion for this required difference can be derived from pre experimental conservative model simulations hereby approximately a snr of 10 as target value during the breakthrough peak might be considered as a possible rule of thumb the supporting ec related model simulations clearly confirmed the need for using appropriate reactive transport codes to include the peak modifications if ec is employed as an additional constraint future research should focus on the influence of analytical precision for parameter estimation in the context of field scale tracer applications in heterogeneous aquifers due to the relatively high analytical costs that are associated at least with the still prevalent irms systems a data worth analysis e g wallis et al 2014 should be performed to define optimized sample amounts and frequencies finally more detailed investigations should be envisaged to clarify possible ec signal changes during the use of precipitation waters for systems with more

6244,in this study the suitability of precipitation waters as semi artificial and multi component groundwater tracers is investigated and potential applications as well as limitations are discussed specifically we analyzed their migration behavior during laboratory scale experiments with groundwater saturated porous media artificially 2h and 18o labelled water as well as natural precipitation waters were injected into sediment packed columns and traced via stable isotope analysis their migration behavior was compared to that of widely used tracers these flow through experiments were underpinned by a batch reactor study and by hydrogeochemical modeling while most artificial isotope applications showed a high stability and conservative transport behavior for all tested sediments the breakthrough curves observed in some experiments with rain and snowmelt were unsteady this was most likely caused by the small ratio between the tracer s isotopic difference compared to the background signal and the available analytical precision the minimum ratio required for effectively reducing uncertainties during data evaluation showed to depend significantly on experimental conditions but should not decrease below 10 during peak breakthrough and preferably be higher furthermore our study illustrates that measurements based on using the precipitation waters inherent low electrical conductivity can be significantly biased by water sediment reactions the batch study and reactive transport simulations confirmed this observation while revealing mineral reactions and to a minor extent also ion exchange as the underlying processes keywords precipitation water tracer groundwater deuterium oxygen 18 electrical conductivity 1 introduction in hydrogeology tracer tests are routinely used to reveal the fundamental transport characteristics of aquifers davis et al 1980 the value of any tracer whether induced intentionally to the subsurface artificial tracer or naturally abundant environmental tracer depends on many different factors including the tracer characteristics the aquifer characteristics and the employed experimental design most tracer test techniques rely on the assumption of a strictly conservative behavior of the traced signal davis et al 1980 käss 2004 i e the tracer should be physically and chemically inert such that it mimics the migration of the water molecules becker and coplen 2001 additionally tracers should be non toxic easy to use and clearly distinguishable from the ambient groundwater e g käss 2004 i e a sufficiently pronounced signal to noise ratio snr is required among others a wide selection of salts such as sodium chloride nacl or potassium bromide kbr dyes e g sodium fluorescein i e uranine as well as stable or radioactive isotopes but alternatively also sum parameters such as electrical conductivity ec can be employed in artificial tracer studies davis et al 1980 käss 2004 further traceable substances such as persistent pharmaceutical compounds arye et al 2011 or properties such as temperature greskowiak et al 2006 seibert et al 2014 have been successfully used as environmental tracers e g in the context of monitoring soil aquifer treatment or managed aquifer recharge systems however under unfavorable conditions most of these tracers can change their expected behavior due to environmental factors and their variability for example the inert behavior of uranine persists only for a limited groundwater ph range käss 2004 the stable isotopes of the water molecule elements are deemed to be the most ideal water tracers as they resemble the water molecule both physically and chemically becker and coplen 2001 signatures of natural waters which are typically reported as delta notations i e as δ2h deuterium and as δ18o oxygen 18 in vs vsmow2 vienna standard mean ocean water depend strongly on climatic factors e g mook and de vries 2001 therefore they can vary significantly with covered ranges of δ δ2h 400 and δ δ18o 40 dansgaard 1964 respectively numerous environmental tracer studies have exploited such differences in the isotopic fingerprint for among others recharge estimation e g adomako et al 2010 flow and discharge pattern identification e g james et al 2000 as well as the analysis of groundwater origins and evolution e g tsujimura et al 2007 studies that employed artificial isotope labelling relied mostly on deuterium oxide 2h2o i e artificially 2h enriched water to determine flow and transport parameters in aquifers e g garnier et al 1985 maloszewski et al 1999 luhmann et al 2012 and to actively investigate infiltration processes in the vadose zone e g hangen et al 2005 mali et al 2007 schoen et al 1999 koeniger et al 2010 also used artificially 18o enriched water i e h2 18o to investigate snowmelt infiltration recently precipitation waters were employed as injection waters in two artificial tracer tests on small field scale binder et al 2019a tritschler et al 2019 thereby intentionally exploiting the existing inherent offset of δ2h δ18o and ec as detectable entities in binder et al 2019a for example the isotopes conservative behavior of a significantly depleted snowmelt was compared to variations in the ec that were simultaneously induced by the active injection of meltwater into a fluviatile aquifer both isotope signal components were recovered during extraction in the form of clearly measurable perturbations with snrs during the peak between 21 δ2h and 24 δ18o these results however indicate that the currently available precision of stable isotope analysis may limit the information content of a breakthrough signal in cases where the isotopic shift is less pronounced furthermore the observed behavior of the ec signal in particular a slightly reduced peak value suggested that geochemical reactions may have influenced the migration both aspects need to be better understood in order to clarify the usefulness of precipitation waters as active multi component tracers for aquifers i e ground water saturated porous media systems therefore we performed comparative laboratory scale experiments with controlled precipitation water applications to investigate their stability and to what extent they behaved truly conservatively finally we performed transport simulations to investigate measurement uncertainties and to explain observed ec modifications 2 study site the site selected for this study is located in pirna saxony germany in close vicinity to the elbe river fig 1 pirna is characterized by a humid temperate climate with an annual precipitation slightly below 700 mm e g tritschler et al 2019 four types of sediments table 1 were prepared to represent the characteristics of this site s lithology with a particular focus on the sediments from the upper most semi confined aquifer this aquifer zone consists of two distinct sub sections dietze and dietrich 2012 händel et al 2016 i an overlying section of relatively low permeability hydraulic conductivities i e k values are below 10 6 m s with anthropogenic fillings and varying content of fines originating from flood events of the elbe river as well as ii an underlying highly permeable section k values mostly between 10 4 m s and 10 3 m s consisting of sand and gravel all materials were obtained from nearby gravel sand pits pratzschwitz germany and excavations heidenau germany where needed samples were amended with kaolinite loam powder to more closely mimic the fines found at the study site especially with respect to the particle size distribution note that multiple detrimental impacts on the stability of uranine such as a slight sorption desorption hysteresis were previously observed for these sediments especially for the heidenau material component fichtner et al 2015 a fifth sediment type not shown in table 1 comparable to the kaolinite sample was included to identify the potential influence of clay type e g brady and weil 2002 on tracer stability this sediment contained 2 montmorillonite clay instead of kaolinite using an artificial material called friedländer blauton which was pretreated with sodium bicarbonate i e nahco3 during the manufacturing process four precipitation water samples table 2 were selected to act as proxies for the multitude of waters in the region of central and eastern saxony fig 1 small grey map the employed totalizers were protected from evaporation losses and other environmental influences by using a combination of the table tennis ball and paraffin oil methods as suggested by the international atomic energy agency iaea gnip 2014 both rain samples were characterized by comparably low ionic strengths 0 4 to 0 6 mmol kgw and low buffering capacities e g burton and pitt 2001 contrary the two snow samples had elevated ionic strengths 2 3 to 3 2 mmol kgw those can be attributed to previous winter service activities in the sampled area using a 2 submersible pump co grundfos groundwater was extracted from observation well fi 7 fig 1 tracer test field hereafter referred to as pirna groundwater it was employed as reference water the groundwater sample has an ionic strength of 8 7 mmol kgw its chemical composition is given in the the electronic supplementary material esm s1 note that further samples from g1 to g23 were included in the analysis both snowmelt samples are isotopically depleted relative to the groundwater while the rain samples are isotopically enriched additionally direct artificial isotope labelling was applied for that purpose small amounts of 2h2o co deutero 4 µl l isotopic purity of 99 9at and h2 18o co sigma aldrich 120 µl l 10 0at were equilibrated with groundwater to simulate isotope values of precipitation as observed on site here deviations relative to the groundwater range from 30 to 40 for δ2h and from 4 to 6 for δ18o tritschler et al 2019 from this data pool a sample from a heavy rainfall event in late summer 2016 was selected to serve as template aside from the artificial isotope labeling this synthetic rain and the groundwater are identical which allowed this study to focus on signature changes 3 laboratory experiments 3 1 overview of the experimental setup the laboratory investigations consisted of two main parts firstly a batch reactor study was performed to assess the hydrochemical and isotopic short term stability of natural and synthetic precipitation waters in contact with the test sediments secondly tracer experiments in sediment packed columns were performed to assess their transport behavior uranine nacl and kbr were employed as reference tracers all experiments were placed in a climate chamber co viessmann to simulate groundwater temperatures and to create a dark environment avoiding uv degradation of uranine all water samples were stored in gas dense composite material pouches made of aluminum polyethylene and polypropylene layers co tesseraux spezialverpackungen in order to reduce any bias induced by potential changes in isotope signatures and chemical compositions during storage all reported values in this study refer to conditions found shortly i e within a few hours before the start of the respective experiments experimental setup schemes are provided in the esm s1 δ2h and δ18o values were determined using a high precision isotope ratio mass spectroscopy irms system mat 253 co thermo fisher scientific coupled to a high temperature pyrolysis furnace co hekatech water salinities were measured using a 4 pole ec sensor co wtw while a bromide ion selective electrode ise co wtw and an ion chromatography system ic co dionex were employed for ion analysis uranine induced fluorescence was determined using a spectral fluorimeter co albilia 3 2 short term batch stability experiments 3 2 1 experimental procedure for the 24 hour short term stability tests the sediments were air dried pore water contents below 2 and filled into borosilicate glass bottles then either labelled or non labelled waters the latter as reference were added in a ratio of 0 5 kgsediment lwater as suggested for natural sediments e g limousin et al 2007 applied concentration levels isotope signatures and precipitation water mixtures are listed in table 3 after set up all sediment water suspensions were equilibrated using an overhead shaker 24 h 6 rpm extraction of pore water was performed by centrifugation 5000 rpm followed by filtration through a cme membrane cellulose mixed ester 0 2 µm the extracts were analyzed for their hydrochemical compositions and isotope signatures 3 2 2 data analysis the short term stabilities were determined by first calculating the residuals between the initial concentration c init and the concentration recorded after 24 h c equil a dimensionless batch stability criterion hereafter referred to as y batch b was then defined using an adapted version of the normalized root mean square error with 1 γ b a t c h b i 1 u c e q u i l i c i n i t i 1 2 u for a total of u samples related to a specific detection parameter b e g δ2h a low value for y batch b indicates a high stability for the analyzed substance with 0 equaling quasi perfect stability ec values were considered in a logarithmic form as these cover three orders of magnitude in the experiments as most laboratories report stable isotope analysis results in delta notation isotope values were also considered in this notation and not as real abundancies of the rare isotope 3 3 column transport experiments 3 3 1 experimental procedure a series of column experiments was conducted to assess the suitability of precipitation waters as active tracers under consideration of the various technical limitations such as irms precision four separate columns id 7 cm length 40 cm were wet packed with the test sediments after set up and prior to the first tracer application all columns were slowly flushed with non labelled pirna groundwater for 30 total pore volumes to ensure that complete water saturation as well as geochemical equilibrium conditions were attained furthermore custom build automatic sampling devices were attached directly to the column effluent ends to minimize sampling errors first the transport performance of the synthetic rain i e the artificial mixture of 2h2o and h2 18o was compared for all four sediments against the reference tracer substances table 4 for this three experiments e1 e3 injecting short pulses of nacl e1 synthetic rain e2 and lastly kbr and uranine e3 were performed for the subsequent experiments one natural snowmelt sample e4 and two natural rain samples e5 and e6 were successively injected into the column packed with the well graded sand table 4 the intermediate step that employed the synthetic rain sample e2 was included to focus on elucidating the migration behavior of the isotopes while avoiding for example the impact of mineral reactions due to chemical differences between tracer and background the new snow sample was not injected as the focus was not on extreme scenarios but on assessing precision related uncertainties however a column flow experiment employing an also noticeably depleted snowmelt sample with initial tracer snrs of 61 δ2h and 55 δ18o is documented in binder et al 2019a all experiments consisted of 24 h tracer or precipitation water injections respectively followed by a continuous injection of non labelled groundwater until the initial equilibrium conditions were restored mean darcy velocities table 5 varied between the columns due to the significant differences in hydraulic conductivity and varying contact pressures of the separate flow channels of the peristaltic pump used co ismatec the darcy velocities that resulted from this setup reflect the lower range of the velocities that typically prevail at our site 3 3 2 data analysis sampling times as well as the averaged analytical values a in eqs 2 and 3 were considered on normalized scales to allow for a direct comparison as the initial snrs were sufficiently pronounced in the experiments e1 to e3 measurement errors were neglected for observed concentrations for sum parameter ec and for

plausibility by reproducing the experimentally obtained breakthrough curves btc with a 1 d analytical model specifically the dual domain mass transfer approach ddmt van genuchten and wierenga 1976 was employed for the solute transport simulation four relevant transport parameters were determined while minimizing the residuals between simulated and measured btcs mobile porosity immobile porosity longitudinal dispersivity and the dual domain mass transfer coefficient in order to effectively quantify uncertainties introduced by the different tracer signals a comparative statistical analysis was done by calculating four selected quality criterions specifically the root mean square error rmse the mean absolute error mae the weighted coefficient of determination wr2 and the index of agreement as well as by performing a linear regression analysis for all possible tracer combinations further details are provided in esm s2 parameter estimation and esm s3 statistical analysis 4 experimental results and basic analysis 4 1 short term batch stability experiments the observed δ2h values before and after equilibration with all tested sediments were very similar fig 2 a suggesting that neither the artificially isotope labelled waters nor the natural precipitation water were affected by any detrimental impacts within the selected experimental duration of 24 h y batch δ2h 0 01 this finding is expected to remain valid for applications with slightly increased experimental periods as no fractionation processes should be relevant for this short timescale aside from mixing with remains of indigenous pore water similar findings apply to the measured δ18o values fig 2b although slight deviations from the 1 1 line were observed especially in the range between 8 and 11 5 this leads to a slightly higher value for y batch δ18o of 0 02 however as most samples remained within the error margin of the irms precision δ18o can also be considered as a highly stable tracer for short term applications as precipitation waters typically have a rather low ionic strength compared to the groundwater monitoring the ec potentially provides complementary information especially as it can be effectively monitored at low cost and nowadays even in situ and adaptively vienken et al 2017 however the ec batch results with the low mineralized waters frequently deviated from the 1 1 line especially in the ec range below 300 µs cm indicating a systematic modification fig 2c furthermore these batch samples showed a steady turbidity increase in the water phase this can presumably be attributed to changes in the sediment s coagulation capabilities which in turn may be an indicator for a detrimental impact on the porous media itself note that the lowest and highest effect in this regard was observed for the well graded sand and the sample with montmorillonite respectively and that the y batch log eclow value of 0 58 that was determined for these waters was the maximum value in this study these observations can be explained by water sediment reactions by replacing the natural pore water with precipitation water i e with a typically under saturated solution mineral dissolution and to a minor extent also ion exchange may increase the pore water s ec during re equilibration e g appelo and postma 2010 representing the natural conditions no significant change was observed for the ec batch experiments with unaltered pirna groundwater the symbols are almost on the 1 1 line except for the non native sediment sample with montmorillonite where ec increased drastically to 1 ms cm waters with higher initial ionic strengths were found to remain stable i e the difference between initially applied and measured ec remained negligible compared to its absolute value for example the y batch log ecnacl value was only 0 10 for these experiments with nacl added to the groundwater in comparison uranine results were affected by sorption y batch uranine value of 0 21 fig 2d as previously observed fichtner et al 2015 furthermore the fluorescence signal itself showed a non ideal behavior specifically a signal increase beyond the initial value was observed for the samples containing montmorillonite black upwards triangles in fig 2d highlighting a strong relationship between the measured fluorescence and the solutions ph value here an increase from ph 7 to near ph 10 was observed for all samples which can be explained by the nahco3 pre treatment of the friedländer blauton finally kbr showed a relatively high stability even though the concentration dependent accuracy of the ise method employed is clearly visible fig 2e this is expressed by the still small y batch kbr value of 0 08 this result lies in between the results observed for the isotopes nacl and uranine and far below the inverse ec based stability values reference measurements employing the ic method for selected samples point towards lower y batch values data not shown 4 2 column transport experiments e1 to e3 results for the experiments e1 to e3 are shown as concentration normalized btcs in fig 3 together with the corresponding results of the inverse model simulations esm s2 almost all applied tracers achieved a full breakthrough within the primary experimental period of 8 days which corresponds to 4 exchanged total pore volumes the only exemption was uranine in the silty sand column which showed excessive tailing as expected the btcs for well graded sand fig 3 1st column have the narrowest shape and highest peak values where the normalized concentration peak value reached almost 100 of the amended tracer amplitude furthermore the btc shape widens for the poorly graded sand 2nd column and even further for both the silty sands without 3rd column and with kaolinite clay 4th column owing to the increasing hydrodynamic dispersion caused by the increased pore scale variability of k values and thus also flow velocities correspondingly observed peak concentrations as well as first arrival times decrease with increasing non uniformity of the sediments in terms of the tracer specific migration behavior the results of the column experiments largely reflect the results from the batch experiments as expected the breakthrough of the isotopically enriched synthetic rain e2 was associated with increased δ2h and δ18o values fig 3 1st and 2nd row however isolated values slightly exceeded the expected range spanned by the background s and tracer s signature in the silty sand experiment the isotope peak was slightly retarded and the peak value was reduced compared to both nacl and kbr while the times of first arrival did not differ a possible explanation might be a higher matrix diffusion rate as the water molecules are smaller in size although there were no negative observations for kbr 4th row it should be noted that the more accurate ic method was employed here while the ise method was used for the batch tests extended tailing was observed for the nacl application in the well graded sand 3rd row separately marked furthermore the normalized ec peak for the silty sand experiment with clay was significantly higher compared to the other studied tracers this can be explained by cation exchange reactions on the sediments combined with ion specific sorption as previously reported mastrocicco et al 2011 singha et al 2011 nevertheless despite this slightly non ideal behavior of nacl and method specific uncertainties of kbr both salt based tracers can still be considered as effectively stable tracer substances in contrast the uranine breakthrough was strongly affected by non ideal physicochemical behavior including a retarded arrival a smaller peak value and stronger tailing fig 3 5th row this suggests that uranine transport was most likely affected by sorption even in the experiments with the well graded sand this behavior was even more exaggerated for the poorly graded sand and the silty sand in addition the calculated mass recoveries were limited to 65 and 70 respectively the breakthrough in the kaolinite sample was less affected this phenomenon may be mainly attributed to different sediment compositions table 1 and fig 2d overall uranine performed in an unpredictable manner and must be classified as a non suitable tracer at least in the context of the conditions for the groundwater and mineralogy being present in pirna in general the relatively small differences in concentration peak value and tailing behavior among the investigated tracers resulted in correspondingly small ranges for the transport parameters obtained by the inverse modeling procedure for the respective sediments in particular the immobile porosity dispersivity and mass transfer values obtained for the δ2h and δ18o data were mostly close to the mean value obtained for all tracers with a slight tendency towards the respective observed minimum values esm s2 all quality criteria showed a good fit among the tracers with exception of uranine based on the normalized btcs the average rmse was 5 6 min 2 4 max 11 3 and mae was 4 2 min 1 9 max 8 6 while wr2 spanned a range from 0 73 to 0 98 x 0 86 and the index of agreement from 0 95 to 1 00 x 0 98 uranine datasets were again excluded as they differed significantly linear regression line slopes were found to be between 0 79 and 1 20 with a mean value of 0 97 being near to the optimal value of 1 again except for uranine more details including the omitted uranine values are provided in esm s3 4 3 column transport experiments e4 to e6 the overall results of the natural precipitation water experiments e4 to e6 fig 4 were generally similar to the results obtained for the synthetic rain sample using stable isotope analysis e2 and for the nacl application using ec for breakthrough detection e1 however as the absolute isotopic shift of the injection water was much less pronounced compared to the e2 experiment a much coarser resolution of the btcs was observed similar to e1 the breakthroughs of the precipitation waters were associated with significant ec changes however this time in the opposite direction fig 4c while ec peaks were observed at almost the same time as the isotopes an information loss was evident as the normalized peak value of these inverse ec btcs reached only 80 to 90 of the corresponding isotope peak see theoretical peak values in fig 4c both observed transport phenomena are therefore further discussed 5 detailed analysis of the observed transport phenomena 5 1 influence of stable isotope analysis precision for the synthetic rain sample experiment e2 the tracer s snr values for δ2h and δ18o were 26 and 28 5 respectively which resulted in high resolution btcs fig 3 except for some minor outliers this snr calculation was based on an initial tracer shift of δ δ2h 26 and δ δ18o 5 7 versus the reported irms precision of 1 δ2h and 0 2 δ18o respectively the tracer snrs within the series with natural precipitation waters however decreased to significantly smaller values in some cases to values close to and even below 10 given these conceptional differences irms precision was included in the btc normalization procedure using eq 3 instead of eq 2 the resulting normalized btcs and the corresponding precision confidence intervals are shown in fig 5 the btc shapes of the old snow of the mountain rain and accepting a slightly higher uncertainty also of the δ2h component of the summer rain are still smooth and characterized by a rather small error margin in contrast the normalized btc for the summer rain δ18o experiment characterized by the low initial snr became highly unstable and noticeably exceeded the possible mixing fraction range 0 to 1 it is evident that even slight deviations from the true value can lead to an inaccurate and unsteady normalization eventually this is attributed to the technical limitations in terms of accuracy and repeatability such small deviations can also be caused among other reasons by random and unavoidable errors during sampling itself and by simple rounding errors due to the device limited measurement resolution in order to illustrate the effects of low snrs on the quality of parameter estimation a transport parameter calibration was performed for the old snow experiment and multiple snr scenarios table 7 each constrained by the observed δ2h breakthrough data marked in fig 5 for this purpose the standard advection dispersion equation ade was applied in combination with a simple monte carlo approach a large range of btcs 5300 simulations each based on mobile porosity and longitudinal dispersivity values randomly selected from a predefined range was generated and eventually superimposed to define the btc envelopes the parameter range definition was manually adjusted until these envelopes approximately matched most of the measured data points during the peak including their error margins the experiments demonstrate the importance of providing a clear isotopic contrast between injection and background water in order to obtain a sufficiently resolved breakthrough signal at the sample location any increase or decrease of measurement uncertainty here the irms precision clearly affects the shape of each analyzed btc errors are then further propagated which influences the parameter calibration process eventually leading to an increased or decreased bandwidth for all transport parameters respectively the actual impact however also depends on the examined parameter specifically the results of the parameter estimation procedure table 7 show that the influence of the precision is much smaller for the mobile porosity than for the longitudinal dispersivity especially for values representing higher laboratory errors considering the results a minimum snr during the peak breakthrough of at least 10 preferably higher is suggested to effectively limit uncertainty during parameter estimation for advection dominated 1 d systems sand column and assuming sufficient amounts of injected tracer mass peak values may only be slightly decreased as compared to the initial isotopic shift relative to the background hence the previously mentioned ratio may be directly applied to the initial shift however higher initial snrs during tracer application are required for columns with increased dispersive and non equilibrium transport components e g both silty sand columns in order to obtain btcs with reasonable resolutions note that this laboratory derived recommendation for minimum snrs may not be directly applicable for field scale applications as the tracer mass here the amount of precipitation water required to achieve a reasonable resolution may increase beyond technical feasibility at least for realistic isotopic shifts of natural waters the only exception to this finding may apply to short term and short distance applications such as a push pull test for the pirna study site one such example has been analyzed documented in esm s4 by employing a 2 d flow and transport model the numerical findings were compared to those from an injection test with following drift phase and from a two well test while mainly depending on the envisaged btc resolution during the peak and on the technically feasible initial isotopic shift the conservative modeling results indicate in turn that the amount of required injection water also depends on the injection method itself 5 2 reaction induced modifications of electrical conductivity by employing the hydrogeochemical simulation software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 2013 a series of 1 d numerical experiments was performed to reproduce the ec information loss i e the reduction of the normalized peak value as observed in the transport experiments e4 to e6 fig 4c for these simulations a virtual 1 d column was set up discretized into 200 equidistant mobile cells and each linked to a stagnant cell representing the immobile zone the initial pore water chemistry was defined according to the chemical composition of the pirna groundwater esm s1 initial ion exchanger compositions and mineral saturation states were calculated assuming equilibrium with the pore water the actual transport simulations were then performed as 1 day injection pulses of water with low ionic strength comparable to the employed rain in the laboratory experiments composition adapted from appelo and postma 2010 the injection of virtual rain was followed by the simulation of a continuous flushing period with pirna groundwater note that this numerical investigation focused solely on the variation of selected reaction types as already implemented in the standard reaction database of phreeqc specifically carbonate mineral reactions ion exchange and dual domain mass transfer were analyzed regarding their potential impact on the model result reaction parameters including ph value were varied as listed in table 8 physical transport parameters e g porosities were taken from the parameter estimation results for the well graded sand experiment esm s2 and kept constant for all model runs further reaction induced variations of the porous media properties were not considered as this would require thermal hydraulic mechanical chemical i e thmc capabilities of the reaction code in general the model output indicates that mineral reactions in combination with a sufficiently pronounced ph value offset relative to the ambient pore water are most likely the main contributors to the observed ec modifications even for ph value offsets below 1 and comparably low mineral phase concentrations up to 1 mmol l i e a still realistic range for the investigated sand column setup and the applied rainwater groundwater combination the ec modification is already significant table 9 calculated information losses i e the relative reductions in the peak value cover a range between 5 and 19 which fits the experimentally observed values this behavior is further intensified with increasing ph value offset data not shown for example the reductions were 30 and 40 in the scenarios with mineral phase concentrations of 2 mmol l and ph value offsets of 1 2 and 1 4 respectively there is a transition range between 0 06 and 0 2 mmol l where the simulation of the mineral reaction proceeds stepwise eventually leading to two superimposing sometimes still distinguishable btc peaks table 9 note that for the investigated ph range peak reductions remained stable also for scenarios with higher mineral phase concentrations up to 200 mmol l contrary the information loss is negligible 2 for all scenarios with mineral concentrations lower than 0 04 mmol l the normalized ec signal is further modified when ion exchange is additionally simulated with relative changes up to 5 observed at a ph offset of 1 4 however exchanger capacities of more than 60 mmol l have no additional effect on the simulation results and systems without mineral reactions seem to be not affected at all by ion exchange at least for the simulated sand column small immobile fraction the influence of dual domain mass transfer on the ec information loss is negligible with deviations of less than 1 not shown in table 9 almost the same applies for the ionic strength of the injected rainwater pulse on a relative scale higher ionic strengths of the pulsed injection water may eventually lead to a slightly more dampened normalized ec signal however the effective differences in the information loss are below 2 when comparing the two investigated ionic strengths in summary the discussed processes form a rather complex reaction system showing a non linear correlation between the parameters and their contribution to the accompanying ec modification nevertheless additional ec measurements can eventually assist to slightly increase the accuracy that is achievable by parameter estimation at least indirectly as the ec observations due to precipitation water migration can serve as simultaneous constraints 6 conclusions this study showed that precipitation waters are generally suitable as injection waters in artificial tracer tests for characterizing the flow and transport conditions in groundwater systems over short distances and where experiments are limited to a relatively short duration here they can be employed as valid substitutes to pure deuterium oxide or water 18o avoiding an extensive everyday use of these often highly concentrated isotope tracers in order to preserve the natural signatures that persist in the environment the experimental results confirm the strongly conservative behavior of the two water isotope tracer components while in contrast the benefit of measuring and interpreting ec signals is far less clear even as an auxiliary tracer this results mostly from the occurrence of water sediment reactions that would typically be triggered by the mineral under saturation of the precipitation water the isotope related simulations illustrate the need for considering the uncertainties induced by the technical limitations of stable isotope analysis as they clearly affect the inversion process that extracts the hydrogeological properties from the collected multi tracer data a universally valid recommendation for the required initial isotopic difference between tracer and background cannot be provided however a suggestion for this required difference can be derived from pre experimental conservative model simulations hereby approximately a snr of 10 as target value during the breakthrough peak might be considered as a possible rule of thumb the supporting ec related model simulations clearly confirmed the need for using appropriate reactive transport codes to include the peak modifications if ec is employed as an additional constraint future research should focus on the influence of analytical precision for parameter estimation in the context of field scale tracer applications in heterogeneous aquifers due to the relatively high analytical costs that are associated at least with the still prevalent irms systems a data worth analysis e g wallis et al 2014 should be performed to define optimized sample amounts and frequencies finally more detailed investigations should be envisaged to clarify possible ec signal changes during the use of precipitation waters for systems with more
