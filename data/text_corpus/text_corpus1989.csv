9945,irrigation return flow rf in arid areas has a significant lag and current rf prediction models have an inadequate consideration of this this study proposed the concepts of lag time contour ltc and area frequency curve afc both of which can be used for describing the spatial distribution of rf lag time in an arid area afc can be determined from ltc or obtained from rf observations and use of the trial and error method a new rf prediction model was developed for arid regions based on ltc and afc and the model couples deep percolation dp and lag time in order to achieve the prediction of rf this model was applied in the eastern part of the jingdian irrigation district in northwest china and the results indicate that the model predictions fit well with the observations and that the model is reliable analysis of dp and rf in the study area between 2000 and 2020 proved that when lag time is not greater than half a year the main factor that influences yearly scale rf is dp and when lag time is greater than one year the factors that influence yearly scale rf are dp and lag time the main influences on monthly scale rf are dp and lag time but this is to a lesser extent than their influence on yearly scale rf ltc and afc help understand the process of rf production in arid regions and the influence lag time has on rf additionally the rf prediction model developed for this study is suitable for rf prediction at different time scales and also for rf predictions in arid areas where there is insufficient hydrogeological data this is of great significance for the efficient use of water resources in arid regions irrigation areas keywords irrigation return flow lag time deep percolation arid area 1 introduction in the past 50 years the amount of irrigated area throughout the world particularly in asia has continued to increase asian development bank 2016 wang et al 2021 in some developing countries irrigation water consumption exceeds 90 of the country s total water consumption siebert et al 2005 water withdrawal has exceeded available renewable freshwater resources in many areas which has caused a great number of river tributaries to lose their ability of maintaining human activities and ecosystem functions asian development bank 2013 due to the increasing demand for irrigation water the pressure on global water resources has become much greater and is of increasing significance rossman et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 wada et al 2016 in arid areas due to a relatively small amount of rainfall agricultural irrigation areas are reliant on large amounts of water for irrigation in order to survive and develop large scale irrigation with surface water significantly affects local and regional surface and underground hydrological processes ii et al 2005 leng et al 2014 agricultural water use has increased significantly as the amount of irrigated area has increased leading to an increasingly serious water shortage problem in arid areas elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2011 wang et al 2019 it is therefore urgent that irrigation water use efficiency is improved in arid areas as rf is a vital part of the water cycle in irrigation areas the reuse of rf or the use of it for other beneficial purposes will improve irrigation efficiency simons et al 2015 therefore the accurate prediction of the amount of rf is essential and this is of particular significance for the management of water resources in irrigation areas jafari et al 2012 wang et al 2016 irrigation return flow is the amount of reusable water which leaves an irrigated field in the form of surface runoff deep leakage or underground runoff and enters drainage channels rivers lakes and other bodies of water following rainfall or irrigation wu et al 2019 hurley 1968 proposed a method to calculate rf using a transfer function in this method it is assumed that the rf is a function of dp and changes in storage the rf can be estimated by multiplying the preceding dp and changes in storage in fact the transfer function reflects the redistribution process of dp this method is suitable for arid areas and can reflect the lag of rf but the determination of the transfer function needs a lot of data to determine so it is difficult to apply in addition regression methods such as univariate linear regression lei et al 2002 multivariate regression ito et al 1980 and multivariate stepwise regression mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 are often used to predict rf these methods are based on measurement data to establish the empirical relationship between rf and its influencing factors to achieve the prediction of rf due to the complex factors influencing the rf these methods do not predict the rf with high accuracy and cannot reveal the mechanism of rf besides regression methods neural networks zhao et al 2006 and support vector machines li et al 2020a have been used for the prediction of rf although these two methods can improve the rf prediction accuracy they require a large amount of observed data for training and validation of the model furthermore for arid areas with significant rf lags none of the above prediction methods has high accuracy because none of these methods takes into account the effect of lag time on rf when establishing the model in arid areas the groundwater depth is large the thickness of the vadose zone can usually reach several tens to hundreds of meters due to the long infiltration path for soil water from the ground surface to groundwater it takes a long time to reach gr in addition gr has a long runoff time in the aquifer so the process of rf needs a significant time lag de vries and simmers 2002 it is therefore of great importance to consider the lag time when studying rf hubbell et al 2004 turkeltaub et al 2014 with the rapid development of hydrological models swap soil water atmosphere plant model anuraga et al 2006 swat soil water assessment tool model awan and ismaeel 2014 and hydrus model jiménez martínez et al 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 are also used for the prediction of rf although these hydrological models consider interactions between soil water and groundwater to varying degrees and have the ability to predict the lag of rf to a certain extent most hydrological models are currently focused on the mechanism of runoff yield and concentration these models simplify the water exchange between groundwater and surface water and the conversion between soil water and groundwater in the vadose zone jia et al 2005 in addition the determination and verification of the model s parameters are quite complex there are problems such as different parameters having the same effect huang 2010 such bottlenecks limit the application of the hydrological model for the prediction of rf in arid areas where there is a data shortage in summary many methods have certain shortcomings in predicting rf in arid areas the water balance method is a simple and efficient method of calculation guswa et al 2002 developed a bucket model for estimating dp this model is to compute dp by simulating the water storage capacity of the root zone water is assumed to be held in storage in the root zone as soil moisture until the maximum storage capacity is exceeded when the net infiltration difference between effective rainfall and evapotranspiration exceeds the storable storage capacity difference between maximum storage capacity and soil water amount in the root zone dp is greater than zero otherwise dp is equal to 0 the model can be calculated using the water balance method to obtain dp but there is a significant time lag between the conversion of dp to rf rossman et al 2014 therefore in order to calculate the rf it is also necessary to calculate the lag time for the conversion of dp to rf the lag time of the rf process is influenced by the velocity of horizontal movement of groundwater and the velocity of vertical movement of water in the vadose zone among them the groundwater movement velocity is usually calculated based on darcy velocity while the vertical movement velocity of water in the vadose zone can be determined in many ways such as the green ampt formula and the richards formula etc the green ampt formula for soil water transport is used assuming square wave type seepage water content profiles with time and depth which is usually used for the calculation of soil moisture movement under ideal conditions and this method is applicable to homogeneous soils and with sufficient parameters due to these constraints the green ampt formula is difficult to apply at the watershed scale the richards formula on the other hand is not constrained by these conditions since there is no analytical solution the richards formula is often used in numerical simulations of soil water transport however grismer 2012 developed a simple two parameter specific yield and pore size distribution index one dimensional unsaturated flow model from simplifications of the richards equation using the brooks corey relationships to determine lag time from dp to groundwater recharge gr it has been verified that the method is able to estimate soil water lag time for arid areas rossman et al 2014 developed an equation to estimate the soil water lag time using a kinematic wave approximation of richards equation the method is applicable to the calculation of the soil water lag time of arid areas on a large time scale however the rf lag time also has strong spatial variability due to the large spatial variation in the groundwater depth in arid regions therefore it is necessary to couple the dp calculated by the water balance equation with the spatial distribution of the rf lag time to achieve the prediction of rf to solve this problem the concepts of ltc and afc are proposed in this paper and the rf prediction model is developed by combining the water balance equation furthermore the model was applied for the prediction of rf in jingdian irrigation district gansu province china and influencing factors of the dp lag time and rf were all analyzed 2 methods and study area 2 1 lag time contour method the amount of rainfall in arid areas is relatively low and river water has become the primary irrigation water source in many irrigation regions due to the great depth of the groundwater table in arid areas the amount of water not consumed by crops often requires a certain lag time in order to produce rf in the drainage channels as fig 1 shows the process of rf can be divided into three stages in the initial stage irrigation water and effective precipitation infiltrate into the root zone where it is partly consumed by evaporation and transpiration the other part infiltrating from the bottom of the root zone to the vadose zone and producing dp the second stage is the vadose zone lag stage where dp penetrates from the bottom of the root zone down through the vadose zone and infiltrates into the groundwater surface which is then converted into gr the third stage is the aquifer lag stage where gr is discharged into the drainage river in the form of groundwater runoff which produces rf in the crop root zone the difference between surface infiltration amount and evapotranspiration equals dp nazarieh et al 2018 the soil water changes a little before and after due to timely irrigation so soil moisture change is ignored li et al 2020b the principle of water balance means that the amount of dp in the t th period can be expressed as 1 dp t i n t p e t et c t i n t p e t et c t 0 0 i n t p e t et c t 0 where t represents the serial number of the time period and when the month is the time period it represents the t th month dp represents the amount of deep percolation below the root zone m3 i n represents the net irrigation amount which is calculated based on the amount of irrigation water diversion i and the canal system water use coefficient η i n can be expressed as follow 2 i n η i p e represents the effective precipitation which is calculated using the empirical coefficient method wang 2009 3 p e 1000 σ p a where p is precipitation mm σ is effective utilization coefficient of precipitation when p 50 mm σ 0 8 when p 5 50 mm σ 1 when p 5 mm σ 0 a is the crop planting area km2 it should be noted that the units of p e in eq 1 are m3 and the unit of precipitation is usually mm therefore the unit on the right side of eq 3 needs to be converted to a uniform unit according to the crop planting area et c is crop water requirement which is calculated using the single crop coefficient method 4 et c 1000 k c et 0 a where et 0 is the reference crop water requirement which can be calculated by the penman monteith equation and the crop coefficient k c recommended by fao allen et al 1998 the calculation formula of et 0 is as follows 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m day e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa eq 1 shows that with sufficient irrigation when the total amount of net irrigation and effective precipitation is greater than crop water requirement deep leakage occurs beneath the root zone when the total amount of net irrigation and effective precipitation is less than crop water requirement there is no deep leakage there is a significant time lag between the conversion of dp to gr and the conversion of gr to rf rossman et al 2014 assuming that the lag time of the vadose zone and aquifer in the irrigation area are independent of each other and the water at any point in the irrigation area does not interfere with them during the process of movement lag time at that point can be expressed in the following way 6 τ τ v τ a where τ is the total lag time of return flow at a certain point in the irrigation area τ v and τ a denote the lag time of the vadose zone and aquifer respectively and this can be expressed as 7 τ v d c v 8 τ a s c a where d is the thickness of the vadose zone and the thickness distribution of the vadose zone is determined based on the depth of groundwater s is the length of the groundwater seepage path which is determined based on the groundwater level using arcgis 10 2 c v and c a are the vertical velocity of soil water in the vadose zone and the horizontal velocity of groundwater in the aquifer respectively which can be calculated by appropriate methods according to the conditions of the study area for example green ampt formula and richards formula all can be used to determine the vadose zone lag time in this study c a is calculated based on darcy velocity q s i e c a q s θ s healy 2010 and c v is calculated based on the research results of rossman et al 2014 9 c v k s 1 s f m 2 2 θ s θ r s e 1 2 1 4 s e 1 m s f m 1 1 s f m s e θ θ r θ s θ r s f 1 s e 1 m where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of vadose zone soil m day θ s and θ r are saturated water content and residual water content cm3 cm3 m is a pore size distribution coefficient in the van genuchten mualem equation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 s e is relative saturation and s f is an intermediate parameter rf lag time can be calculated using a few simple soil parameters it is notable that as groundwater depth and soil moisture content change with the amount of dp lag time is not invariable however compared with the spatial difference the lag time difference that is caused by groundwater depth and soil moisture content is very small so it can be ignored considering the spatial distribution of lag time the lag time results are different at each point of the irrigation region due to differences in soil texture soil moisture content vadose zone thickness and aquifer properties therefore a method to describe the spatial distribution of lag time using an ltc is proposed lag times at different points in the irrigation region can be calculated using eq 6 and the ltc map which is shown in fig 2 can be drawn using an interpolation tool in arcgis if the interval of isolines is δτ the entire irrigation region can be divided into n 1 sub regions by n isolines according to the ltc map the lag time value of the k th sub region is between k 1 δτ and k δτ so the amount of rf from the k th sub region at the i th period is expressed as 10 rf k i dp k i k 1 where rf k i is the amount of irrigation return flow from the k th sub region in the i th period m3 dp k i is the amount of deep percolation from the k th sub region in the i th period m3 total amount of rf at an any period is the sum of dp of each sub region from an early corresponding period this provides formula for the total amount of return flow in the irrigation area for any chosen period 11 rf i k 1 n 1 dp k i k 1 where rf i is the amount of irrigation return flow of the entire irrigation region in the i th period m3 eq 11 shows that if the irrigation region s maximum lag time is n 1 δτ determining dp in the latest n periods is necessary before calculating the total rf to summarize the ltc method has been developed for the prediction of rf in arid areas which can be summarized in the following three steps step 1 based on meteorological data and irrigation data for the irrigation region eq 1 is used for calculating the dp in different periods step 2 based on the parameters of the vadose zone and aquifer in the irrigation region eq 6 is used for calculating the rf lag time and arcgis or other software is used to produce an ltc map from the ltc map the irrigation district is then divided into several sub regions in this step we can use a suitable method green ampt formula richards formula to calculate the vadose zone lag time according to the available data in the study area step 3 eq 11 is used for calculating the return flow of the irrigation district in different periods 2 2 area frequency curve method the ltc method from section 2 1 can be used for the prediction of the amount of rf in different periods however the rf lag time varies from several months to several decades in different areas grismer 2012 scanlon et al 2005 sophocleous 2005 to predict the change of rf in different time scales a new concept of afc is proposed this is the curve of the area proportion of different sub regions that changes with the lag time afc can be obtained from the ltc map according to the definition of afc arcgis 10 2 can be used to calculate the proportion of the area corresponding to different lag times in the ltc map to the total area so that the afc can be drawn it is notable a point on the afc is only meaningful when the lag time is an integer it can therefore be regarded as a discrete distribution the afc for three different watersheds is displayed in fig 3 as for lag time increases the area proportion of sub regions of all curves first increases and then decreases the shape of afc differs according to different groundwater depths when groundwater depth is small lag time is short and afc is steep conversely when groundwater depth is large lag time is long and afc is gentle the scale transformation of afc can be used for the calculation of the rf for different time scales but the cumulative frequency for each point with integer lag time on the curve should be 1 therefore when the time scale is transformed from δτ to m δτ the function of afc is transformed into 12 f a τ 1 m f b 1 m τ where f b τ and f a τ represent the afc function before and after time scale transformation for calculation of the rf in different time scales eq 11 is transformed into the form of afc 13 rf i k 1 n 1 dp ω i k 1 f a k where dp ω i is the amount of deep percolation for the entire irrigation region in the i th period m3 compared to eq 11 eq 13 is simpler and more applicable and it can be used to calculate the amount of rf for different time scales in addition if the time series of rf is known the trial and error method can be used for deducing the afc based on eq 13 obtaining the parameters and determining lag time can be difficult due to the thickness of the vadose zone in arid areas so it is of great significance to deduce the afc of lag time using the measured time series of rf in this section the concept of afc is proposed based on the ltc for the prediction of rf in arid areas compared to the ltc method the afc method only requires some observation data for the prediction of rf in different time scales and different time scales of rf can be calculated by transforming the time scale of afc in addition with a lack of hydrogeological data it has application potential for the deduction of the afc and prediction of rf using the trial and error method 2 3 trial and error method the trial and error method is based on the ordinary least squares and the residuals between the rf calculation results and the observed values are minimized by continuously adjusting the afc curve the residual function can be expressed as follows 14 φ n a k b i 1 m rf obs i rf cal i 2 where rf obs and rf cal are the measured and calculated values of rf respectively m is the total number of computed time periods afc is a curve that reflects the characteristics of the regional lag time distribution in order to determine the afc using the trial and error method a function can be used to represent the afc the area enclosed by the afc function and the x axis should be satisfied as 1 and the function should be single peaked when choosing the function type refer to the afc obtained from ltc the probability density function of gamma distribution was chosen to represent the afc in this paper which can be expressed as 15 f a x β α γ α x α 1 e β x where α is the shape parameter and β is the inverse scale parameter the afc function is determined by adjusting the parameters α and β to minimize the residuals in eq 14 2 4 study area the study area is the eastern part of jingdian irrigation district jingtai county gansu province china fig 4 it is a typical dryland and agricultural water diversion irrigation district the irrigation method used in the study area is electric power irrigation and the water source is the yellow river the study area s average multi year precipitation is 186 mm and its average multi year water surface evaporation intensity is 2123 mm so it can be seen that water resources are extremely scarce the study area is part of the yellow river system and rf flows into the eastern drainage rivers and into the yellow river as groundwater runoff the study area s total area is 351 3 km2 and according to the control area of the irrigation canal system it can be divided into four sub irrigation areas zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii there is a scarcity of both surface water and groundwater sources in the study area and with the exception of a few drainage rivers in the southwest of the downstream all rivers are generally dry and waterless only when there is heavy rainfall during the summer and autumn months each year can ditch floods form but the duration of this is short the study area s groundwater flows from west to east and the main source of gr is irrigation infiltration which is not abundant in gr conditions therefore the amount of groundwater is small it is deep underground and its quality is poor also according to the hydrogeological borehole data fig 5 the lithology of the study area s vadose zone and aquifer is mainly silt loam sandy loam and sand the vadose zone and aquifer s structure is simple there is no obvious water barrier and the aquifer type is unconfined yellow river institute of hydrology and water resources 2018 2 5 data sources meteorological data used in this study was obtained from jingtai county national weather station and china meteorological administration and includes daily precipitation mm average temperature wind speed m s relative humidity and sunshine hours h from 2000 to 2020 data on the planting area planting structure crop type and fertility period net irrigation amount and canal system water use coefficient from 2000 to 2020 were obtained from by jingdian irrigation bureau the lithology of the vadose zone and aquifer were determined using hydrogeological borehole data and the parameters were determined based on the handbook of hydrogeology china geological survey 2012 from november 2017 to october 2020 the groundwater depth and rf of the drainage river were monitored by the long term monitoring of nine hydrogeological boreholes and six measuring weirs within the study area 3 results 3 1 time series and influencing factors of deep percolation calculating dp is for the calculation rf based on the precipitation irrigation and crop water requirement data for the study area dp can be calculated using eq 1 fig 6 a shows the relationship between dp and irrigation water diversion effective precipitation and crop water requirement on a yearly scale for the period 2000 2020 as the figure shows the total irrigation water diversion varies irregularly from 2000 to 2020 jafari et al 2012 noted out that irregular variations in total irrigation water diversion can be due to farmers management practices variations in irrigation intervals and a lack of scientific calculations of water requirements the contribution of dp are from xigan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase i zonggan in phase ii in descending order which is mainly influenced by the sub irrigation area s crop cultivation area dp varies irregularly between 2000 and 2020 which is due to the irregular variation of the total net irrigation amount fig 6 b shows the relationship between monthly average dp irrigation water diversion effective precipitation and crop water requirement for 2000 2020 as the graph shows dp is mainly concentrated in winter october november and autumn july august irrigation each year and accounts for 77 48 and 19 77 of the total annual dp respectively effective precipitation varies unimodally throughout the year with its peak august coinciding with autumn irrigation dp which suggests that autumn irrigation dp is mostly influenced by effective precipitation this is due to trends in net irrigation amount and crop water consumption during autumn irrigation being more or less the same where a large amount of irrigation water is consumed by the crop and less dp is produced by irrigation water therefore almost all of the dp during autumn irrigation is produced by effective short term precipitation the net irrigation amount varies bimodally during the year and there are two peaks in june and november the november peak coincides with the timing of winter irrigation dp which suggests that winter irrigation dp is mostly influenced by the winter net irrigation amount the june peak has less influence on dp as during the crop growing period of march to september the net irrigation amount is mainly consumed by the crop and therefore less dp is produced to perform a quantitative analysis of the degree of influence of effective precipitation net irrigation amount and crop water requirement on dp the correlation coefficients between each factor and dp were analyzed using the pearson test table 1 shows that net irrigation amount and crop water requirement have a significant correlation with dp on both the yearly scale and monthly scale while the correlation between effective precipitation and dp is not significant the magnitude of the correlation coefficients indicates that the influence on dp is in descending order of net irrigation amount crop water requirement and effective precipitation this is due to the study area s water source for crop growth mainly coming from irrigation water and the effective precipitation being concentrated in june and july each year therefore effective precipitation has less influence on dp than net irrigation amount additionally the actual crop water consumption is less than the crop water requirement in some periods due to irrigation limitation and precipitation amount so crop water requirement has the least influence on the dp regarding time scale the absolute values of the correlation coefficients at the yearly scale were all greater than those of the monthly scale which indicates the three influencing factors were more strongly correlated with dp at the yearly scale than the monthly scale this is potentially due to the soil in the root zone having a moderating effect on irrigation water and precipitation making the correlation between net irrigation amount effective precipitation and dp weaker at the monthly scale 3 2 spatial variations and influencing factors of lag time rf is not only influenced by dp it is also related to lag time fig 7 shows the calculation results for the vadose zone aquifer and total lag time in the study area the vadose zone lag time ranges from 0 to 7 months and gradually increases from east to west the reason for this is that the vadose zone lag time is mainly influenced by the groundwater depth vadose zone thickness and the vadose zone thickness gradually increases from east to west the aquifer lag time ranges from 0 to 14 months and gradually increases from east to west the reason for this is that the aquifer lag time is mainly influenced by the distance to the drainage river and the groundwater seepage path length gradually increases from east to west the total lag time ranges from 0 to 20 months the spatial distribution law is similar to that of the aquifer lag time the reason is that the aquifer lag time accounts for a larger proportion about 67 of the total lag time and the total lag time is influenced by the aquifer lag time showing a gradual increase from east to west the vadose zone lag time in xigan in phase i is the largest followed by beigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii and the smallest is zonggan in phase i to accurately analyze the effects of each factor on lag time parameters relating to lag time for the study area s nine groundwater level observation holes are displayed in table 2 the correlation coefficients with lag time from largest to smallest were groundwater seepage path length vadose zone thickness silt loam thickness the correlation coefficient of the groundwater seepage path length is the largest because the lag time of the aquifer is greater than that of the vadose zone although groundwater flow rate is much greater than the flow rate of the vadose zone groundwater s influence on lag time is greater than that of the vadose zone as the groundwater seepage path length is several orders of magnitude greater several kilometers than the thickness of vadose zone several tens of meters 3 3 calibration and validation of prediction model for irrigation return flow the afc of lag time for each sub irrigation district is determined from the distribution of lag times the ltc method and trial and error method using eq 13 were used for the calculation of the afc which is shown in fig 8 the shape of afc that was obtained using the two methods largely matched each other with the root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 015 to 0 023 for the four sub irrigation areas the best fit was zonggan in phase i and beigan in phase i with r2 0 9 followed by zonggan in phase ii with r2 0 858 and the worst fit was xigan in phase i with r2 0 684 four curves with peaks between 0 11 and 0 27 the afc peaks are from largest to smallest zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase ii and xigan in phase i as the afc flattens out the average lag time becomes greater the sum of the area frequency values corresponding to different lag times should be 1 i e the area enclosed by the afc curve and the x axis is 1 therefore the larger the lag time the smaller the peak monthly scale rfs were calculated for drainage rivers from november 2017 to october 2020 using the ltc method and the trial and error method and november 2017 to october 2019 was the calibration period and november 2019 to october 2020 was the validation period a comparison between the rf calculated using the two methods and the observed rf can be seen in fig 9 the r2 for the trial and error method and the ltc method were 0 65 and 0 75 for the calibration period and 0 62 and 0 71 for the validation period which indicates that the results of the trial and error method more closely match the measured values there is a difference of 0 1 and 0 09 in the r2 values of calibration and validation of the ltc method and trial and error method which may be due to the difference in the afcs obtained by the two methods the afc obtained by the ltc method is calculated by the formula which may be affected by errors of topography and parameter so the obtained afc is not smooth there are some mutation points and there are some differences with the real situation the afc obtained by the trial and error method is based on the observed data and the curve is smoother and the points on the curve are asymptotic which may be closer to the real situation therefore the rf obtained by the two methods differs from the r2 of the observed values it is notable that in comparation to the ltc method the afc calculated using the trial and error method is not only in good agreement with the measured results it is also suitable for areas where hydrogeological data is lacking and has a much wider scope for application therefore in this study the afc obtained using the trial and error method with better fitting results was chosen for calculation of the rf from 2000 to 2020 3 4 time series and influencing factors of irrigation return flow following verification of the reliability of the rf prediction model that was developed for this study the rf time series for different time scales from 2000 to 2020 were calculated fig 10 a shows the relationship between rf and dp on a yearly scale the yearly rf and dp follow the same trend and reach a maximum value of 5494 104 m3 in 2010 and the contribution to rf is in descending order xigan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase i zonggan in phase ii fig 10 b shows the relationship between monthly scale rf and dp for zonggan in phase i dp peaks in november and rf peaks in january with an average lag time of approximately 2 months with beigan in phase i dp peaks in november and rf peaks in march with an average lag time of approximately 4 months xigan in phase i has a dp peak in november and rf peak is in october with an average lag time of approximately 11 months with zonggan in phase ii the dp peak is in november and the rf peak is in april and the average lag time approximately 5 months it can be seen that the average lag times for the four sub irrigation regions are quite close to the peaks of the four afc that are shown in fig 8 which indicates that the peaks of the afc reflect the average lag times for the area to a certain extent to analyze the effect of dp on rf at different time scales in the study area the correlation coefficients of each were analyzed using the pearson test the correlation coefficients were also analyzed separately for both cases both with and without any lag time consideration the results of this analysis are displayed in table 3 from this table it can be seen that the correlation coefficients of zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii on the yearly scale are all greater than 0 8 p 0 01 and are significantly correlated whereas the correlation coefficient of xigan in phase i on the yearly scale is only 0 319 p 0 05 which is not significant this is due to the average lag time of zonggan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii being less than half a year therefore the correlation between dp and rf is strong on the yearly scale conversely the average lag time for xigan in phase i was 11 months meaning that the correlation between dp and rf was weaker the correlation coefficient between dp and rf reached 0 994 p 0 01 when the rf on the yearly scale of phase i was moved forward one year indicating that the rf on the yearly scale of xigan in phase i is more significantly influenced by lag time the absolute values of the monthly scale correlation coefficients are all lower than 0 4 which indicates that the monthly scale dp is less correlated with rf if the lag of the monthly scale is considered the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 4 p 0 01 when the monthly scale rf of zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii were advanced by 2 4 11 and 5 months respectively which indicates that the monthly scale rf were all affected by lag time in addition after considering lag time the correlation coefficient between monthly scale dp and rf did not reach 0 8 thereby indicating that the correlation between monthly scale dp and rf is also not as strong as the yearly scale 4 discussion in the arid regions of northwest china there exist many water diversion irrigation projects that take water from the yellow river and deliver it to irrigation areas through large pumping stations which not only ensure local irrigation water promote local agriculture but also improve the ecological environment in and around the irrigation areas zhang 2015 wang et al 2006 pointed out that strong human activities in irrigation areas have changed the natural water cycle process in irrigated areas and the diversion irrigation percolation return water cycle process has played a dominant role in arid and semi arid areas with low precipitation based on this water cycle process this paper developed an rf prediction model for water diversion irrigation areas in arid regions the developed model in this paper can adequately respond to the lag of rf compared to the multiple regression method ito et al 1980 which has a larger error in drought areas where the lag is more pronounced furthermore hydrological models such as swat have also been used for the simulation of irrigation area diversions and withdrawals gosain et al 2005 despite the high accuracy of hydrological models in terms of surface water movement huang 2011 most hydrological models focus on the study of production and sink mechanisms with more simplifications in terms of water exchange between groundwater and surface water and conversion between soil water and groundwater in the unsaturated zone jia et al 2005 this drawback of the hydrological model is particularly significant in arid regions and the rf prediction model developed in this paper can better solve this problem in addition compared with the hydrological model the model developed in this paper requires less information and parameters and has better applicability therefore the rf prediction model developed in this paper has a certain significance for water resources management in the irrigation area with small rainfall and large difference in groundwater level the lag of rf in arid regions cannot be ignored wang et al 2021 lu et al 2011 demonstrated that in a coastal plain with a small groundwater depth the lag time for rf is generally no more than 1 or 2 days however in areas with a greater groundwater depth 10 m the lag time is approximately 18 35 days in our study area the maximum rf lag time reaches up to about 20 months fig 7c for areas where the water table is buried at greater depths the rf lag time can even reach several decades rossman 2014 table 3 shows a significant increase in the correlation of monthly scale rf with each influencing factor after accounting for lags which also indicates a significant influence of lags on rf in arid region s agricultural irrigation areas where large groundwater depth is a common phenomenon the influence of rf lag time must be considered as it is incredibly important particularly regarding the estimation of rf and different lag times corresponding to different groundwater depths must also be considered su 2018 jafari et al 2012 noted that the main factors which affect the rf lag time are preferential paths and soil texture and that flow through the macropores in coarse grained soil reduces the rf lag time however in arid areas this situation becomes more complicated as the thickness of the vadose zone and the length of the groundwater seepage path also affect rf lag time table 2 showed that the correlation coefficient of the vadose zone thickness was greater than fine grained soil silt loam thickness which suggests that fine grained soil thickness is not a key factor that affects the rf lag time but the total thickness of the vadose zone plays a more important role bronswijk et al 1995 and weaver et al 2005 reported that preferential flow through cracks of clay can lead to the rapid transportation of irrigation water these studies demonstrate that fine grained soil thickness has very little effect on rf lag time due to the existence of preferential flow these studies share the results of this paper and all show that the main factor of the vadose zone lag time was the vadose zone thickness rather than the fine grained soil thickness however different from the research results the length of the groundwater seepage path affects the rf lag time to a greater extent than the vadose zone thickness table 2 shows that the correlation coefficient between rf lag time and groundwater seepage path length is 0 978 p 0 01 the reason is that although groundwater flow rate is much greater than the flow rate of the vadose zone groundwater s influence on lag time is greater than that of the vadose zone as the groundwater seepage path length is several orders of magnitude greater several kilometers than the thickness of vadose zone several tens of meters dp is an important source for gr simons et al 2015 table 1 shows that the correlation coefficients between dp and net irrigation water and effective precipitation at the yearly scale in the study area were 0 837 p 0 01 and 0 229 p 0 05 respectively which indicates that yearly scale dp is largely influenced by irrigation water rather than precipitation fisher and healy 2008 studied the dp process in two irrigated farmlands in a semi arid region and showed that almost all dp occurred during the irrigation season while precipitation had less effect on dp which is the same as the results of this paper in addition fig 6 b shows that the monthly scale dp is concentrated in the winter and autumn irrigation seasons although irrigation season is the most important factor affecting dp unlike the results of fisher and healy 2008 dp during autumn irrigation in the study area is the result of a combination of net irrigation water crop water demand and effective rainfall although it only accounts for about one fifth of the annual dp compared with dp rf showed relatively flat fluctuations within the year fig 10b which is due to the spatial differences in lag time that dispersed dp which was relatively concentrated in the fall and winter irrigation seasons into rf in different periods which explains the small correlation coefficient table 3 between rf and dp at the monthly scale in addition yearly scale rf correlated significantly with dp when the lag time did not exceed 6 months according to research conducted by jafari et al 2012 the correlation coefficient of yearly scale rf and dp is 0 99 p 0 01 when the maximum lag time is three months which is the same as the results obtained by this paper the correlation between rf and dp increases when lag time is considered both on yearly and monthly scales which is further evidence that the correlation between rf and dp is strongly influenced by lag time in this paper the linkages and influencing factors of dp rf and lag time are considered at yearly and monthly scales respectively which are not much studied yet but are necessary for arid regions 5 conclusion ltc and afc concepts were proposed which can be used for describing the spatial distribution of lag time in the region rf prediction model considering lags was developed and the prediction results matched the measured results the results of the analysis of the past 20 years data in the study area showed that the yearly scale dp was mainly influenced by the net irrigation amount and the lag time greater than half a year the monthly scale dp was significantly influenced by the irrigation season the lag time is significantly influenced by the length of the groundwater seepage path and the thickness of the vadose zone rf is affected by dp and lag time together at both yearly and monthly scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9945,irrigation return flow rf in arid areas has a significant lag and current rf prediction models have an inadequate consideration of this this study proposed the concepts of lag time contour ltc and area frequency curve afc both of which can be used for describing the spatial distribution of rf lag time in an arid area afc can be determined from ltc or obtained from rf observations and use of the trial and error method a new rf prediction model was developed for arid regions based on ltc and afc and the model couples deep percolation dp and lag time in order to achieve the prediction of rf this model was applied in the eastern part of the jingdian irrigation district in northwest china and the results indicate that the model predictions fit well with the observations and that the model is reliable analysis of dp and rf in the study area between 2000 and 2020 proved that when lag time is not greater than half a year the main factor that influences yearly scale rf is dp and when lag time is greater than one year the factors that influence yearly scale rf are dp and lag time the main influences on monthly scale rf are dp and lag time but this is to a lesser extent than their influence on yearly scale rf ltc and afc help understand the process of rf production in arid regions and the influence lag time has on rf additionally the rf prediction model developed for this study is suitable for rf prediction at different time scales and also for rf predictions in arid areas where there is insufficient hydrogeological data this is of great significance for the efficient use of water resources in arid regions irrigation areas keywords irrigation return flow lag time deep percolation arid area 1 introduction in the past 50 years the amount of irrigated area throughout the world particularly in asia has continued to increase asian development bank 2016 wang et al 2021 in some developing countries irrigation water consumption exceeds 90 of the country s total water consumption siebert et al 2005 water withdrawal has exceeded available renewable freshwater resources in many areas which has caused a great number of river tributaries to lose their ability of maintaining human activities and ecosystem functions asian development bank 2013 due to the increasing demand for irrigation water the pressure on global water resources has become much greater and is of increasing significance rossman et al 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 wada et al 2016 in arid areas due to a relatively small amount of rainfall agricultural irrigation areas are reliant on large amounts of water for irrigation in order to survive and develop large scale irrigation with surface water significantly affects local and regional surface and underground hydrological processes ii et al 2005 leng et al 2014 agricultural water use has increased significantly as the amount of irrigated area has increased leading to an increasingly serious water shortage problem in arid areas elliott et al 2014 wada et al 2011 wang et al 2019 it is therefore urgent that irrigation water use efficiency is improved in arid areas as rf is a vital part of the water cycle in irrigation areas the reuse of rf or the use of it for other beneficial purposes will improve irrigation efficiency simons et al 2015 therefore the accurate prediction of the amount of rf is essential and this is of particular significance for the management of water resources in irrigation areas jafari et al 2012 wang et al 2016 irrigation return flow is the amount of reusable water which leaves an irrigated field in the form of surface runoff deep leakage or underground runoff and enters drainage channels rivers lakes and other bodies of water following rainfall or irrigation wu et al 2019 hurley 1968 proposed a method to calculate rf using a transfer function in this method it is assumed that the rf is a function of dp and changes in storage the rf can be estimated by multiplying the preceding dp and changes in storage in fact the transfer function reflects the redistribution process of dp this method is suitable for arid areas and can reflect the lag of rf but the determination of the transfer function needs a lot of data to determine so it is difficult to apply in addition regression methods such as univariate linear regression lei et al 2002 multivariate regression ito et al 1980 and multivariate stepwise regression mohan and vijayalakshmi 2009 are often used to predict rf these methods are based on measurement data to establish the empirical relationship between rf and its influencing factors to achieve the prediction of rf due to the complex factors influencing the rf these methods do not predict the rf with high accuracy and cannot reveal the mechanism of rf besides regression methods neural networks zhao et al 2006 and support vector machines li et al 2020a have been used for the prediction of rf although these two methods can improve the rf prediction accuracy they require a large amount of observed data for training and validation of the model furthermore for arid areas with significant rf lags none of the above prediction methods has high accuracy because none of these methods takes into account the effect of lag time on rf when establishing the model in arid areas the groundwater depth is large the thickness of the vadose zone can usually reach several tens to hundreds of meters due to the long infiltration path for soil water from the ground surface to groundwater it takes a long time to reach gr in addition gr has a long runoff time in the aquifer so the process of rf needs a significant time lag de vries and simmers 2002 it is therefore of great importance to consider the lag time when studying rf hubbell et al 2004 turkeltaub et al 2014 with the rapid development of hydrological models swap soil water atmosphere plant model anuraga et al 2006 swat soil water assessment tool model awan and ismaeel 2014 and hydrus model jiménez martínez et al 2009 poch massegú et al 2014 are also used for the prediction of rf although these hydrological models consider interactions between soil water and groundwater to varying degrees and have the ability to predict the lag of rf to a certain extent most hydrological models are currently focused on the mechanism of runoff yield and concentration these models simplify the water exchange between groundwater and surface water and the conversion between soil water and groundwater in the vadose zone jia et al 2005 in addition the determination and verification of the model s parameters are quite complex there are problems such as different parameters having the same effect huang 2010 such bottlenecks limit the application of the hydrological model for the prediction of rf in arid areas where there is a data shortage in summary many methods have certain shortcomings in predicting rf in arid areas the water balance method is a simple and efficient method of calculation guswa et al 2002 developed a bucket model for estimating dp this model is to compute dp by simulating the water storage capacity of the root zone water is assumed to be held in storage in the root zone as soil moisture until the maximum storage capacity is exceeded when the net infiltration difference between effective rainfall and evapotranspiration exceeds the storable storage capacity difference between maximum storage capacity and soil water amount in the root zone dp is greater than zero otherwise dp is equal to 0 the model can be calculated using the water balance method to obtain dp but there is a significant time lag between the conversion of dp to rf rossman et al 2014 therefore in order to calculate the rf it is also necessary to calculate the lag time for the conversion of dp to rf the lag time of the rf process is influenced by the velocity of horizontal movement of groundwater and the velocity of vertical movement of water in the vadose zone among them the groundwater movement velocity is usually calculated based on darcy velocity while the vertical movement velocity of water in the vadose zone can be determined in many ways such as the green ampt formula and the richards formula etc the green ampt formula for soil water transport is used assuming square wave type seepage water content profiles with time and depth which is usually used for the calculation of soil moisture movement under ideal conditions and this method is applicable to homogeneous soils and with sufficient parameters due to these constraints the green ampt formula is difficult to apply at the watershed scale the richards formula on the other hand is not constrained by these conditions since there is no analytical solution the richards formula is often used in numerical simulations of soil water transport however grismer 2012 developed a simple two parameter specific yield and pore size distribution index one dimensional unsaturated flow model from simplifications of the richards equation using the brooks corey relationships to determine lag time from dp to groundwater recharge gr it has been verified that the method is able to estimate soil water lag time for arid areas rossman et al 2014 developed an equation to estimate the soil water lag time using a kinematic wave approximation of richards equation the method is applicable to the calculation of the soil water lag time of arid areas on a large time scale however the rf lag time also has strong spatial variability due to the large spatial variation in the groundwater depth in arid regions therefore it is necessary to couple the dp calculated by the water balance equation with the spatial distribution of the rf lag time to achieve the prediction of rf to solve this problem the concepts of ltc and afc are proposed in this paper and the rf prediction model is developed by combining the water balance equation furthermore the model was applied for the prediction of rf in jingdian irrigation district gansu province china and influencing factors of the dp lag time and rf were all analyzed 2 methods and study area 2 1 lag time contour method the amount of rainfall in arid areas is relatively low and river water has become the primary irrigation water source in many irrigation regions due to the great depth of the groundwater table in arid areas the amount of water not consumed by crops often requires a certain lag time in order to produce rf in the drainage channels as fig 1 shows the process of rf can be divided into three stages in the initial stage irrigation water and effective precipitation infiltrate into the root zone where it is partly consumed by evaporation and transpiration the other part infiltrating from the bottom of the root zone to the vadose zone and producing dp the second stage is the vadose zone lag stage where dp penetrates from the bottom of the root zone down through the vadose zone and infiltrates into the groundwater surface which is then converted into gr the third stage is the aquifer lag stage where gr is discharged into the drainage river in the form of groundwater runoff which produces rf in the crop root zone the difference between surface infiltration amount and evapotranspiration equals dp nazarieh et al 2018 the soil water changes a little before and after due to timely irrigation so soil moisture change is ignored li et al 2020b the principle of water balance means that the amount of dp in the t th period can be expressed as 1 dp t i n t p e t et c t i n t p e t et c t 0 0 i n t p e t et c t 0 where t represents the serial number of the time period and when the month is the time period it represents the t th month dp represents the amount of deep percolation below the root zone m3 i n represents the net irrigation amount which is calculated based on the amount of irrigation water diversion i and the canal system water use coefficient η i n can be expressed as follow 2 i n η i p e represents the effective precipitation which is calculated using the empirical coefficient method wang 2009 3 p e 1000 σ p a where p is precipitation mm σ is effective utilization coefficient of precipitation when p 50 mm σ 0 8 when p 5 50 mm σ 1 when p 5 mm σ 0 a is the crop planting area km2 it should be noted that the units of p e in eq 1 are m3 and the unit of precipitation is usually mm therefore the unit on the right side of eq 3 needs to be converted to a uniform unit according to the crop planting area et c is crop water requirement which is calculated using the single crop coefficient method 4 et c 1000 k c et 0 a where et 0 is the reference crop water requirement which can be calculated by the penman monteith equation and the crop coefficient k c recommended by fao allen et al 1998 the calculation formula of et 0 is as follows 5 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n is the net radiation at the crop surface mj m2 day g is the soil heat flux density mj m2 day t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m day e s is the saturation vapor pressure kpa e a is the actual vapor pressure kpa δ is the slope vapor pressure curve kpa and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa eq 1 shows that with sufficient irrigation when the total amount of net irrigation and effective precipitation is greater than crop water requirement deep leakage occurs beneath the root zone when the total amount of net irrigation and effective precipitation is less than crop water requirement there is no deep leakage there is a significant time lag between the conversion of dp to gr and the conversion of gr to rf rossman et al 2014 assuming that the lag time of the vadose zone and aquifer in the irrigation area are independent of each other and the water at any point in the irrigation area does not interfere with them during the process of movement lag time at that point can be expressed in the following way 6 τ τ v τ a where τ is the total lag time of return flow at a certain point in the irrigation area τ v and τ a denote the lag time of the vadose zone and aquifer respectively and this can be expressed as 7 τ v d c v 8 τ a s c a where d is the thickness of the vadose zone and the thickness distribution of the vadose zone is determined based on the depth of groundwater s is the length of the groundwater seepage path which is determined based on the groundwater level using arcgis 10 2 c v and c a are the vertical velocity of soil water in the vadose zone and the horizontal velocity of groundwater in the aquifer respectively which can be calculated by appropriate methods according to the conditions of the study area for example green ampt formula and richards formula all can be used to determine the vadose zone lag time in this study c a is calculated based on darcy velocity q s i e c a q s θ s healy 2010 and c v is calculated based on the research results of rossman et al 2014 9 c v k s 1 s f m 2 2 θ s θ r s e 1 2 1 4 s e 1 m s f m 1 1 s f m s e θ θ r θ s θ r s f 1 s e 1 m where k s is the saturated hydraulic conductivity of vadose zone soil m day θ s and θ r are saturated water content and residual water content cm3 cm3 m is a pore size distribution coefficient in the van genuchten mualem equation mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 s e is relative saturation and s f is an intermediate parameter rf lag time can be calculated using a few simple soil parameters it is notable that as groundwater depth and soil moisture content change with the amount of dp lag time is not invariable however compared with the spatial difference the lag time difference that is caused by groundwater depth and soil moisture content is very small so it can be ignored considering the spatial distribution of lag time the lag time results are different at each point of the irrigation region due to differences in soil texture soil moisture content vadose zone thickness and aquifer properties therefore a method to describe the spatial distribution of lag time using an ltc is proposed lag times at different points in the irrigation region can be calculated using eq 6 and the ltc map which is shown in fig 2 can be drawn using an interpolation tool in arcgis if the interval of isolines is δτ the entire irrigation region can be divided into n 1 sub regions by n isolines according to the ltc map the lag time value of the k th sub region is between k 1 δτ and k δτ so the amount of rf from the k th sub region at the i th period is expressed as 10 rf k i dp k i k 1 where rf k i is the amount of irrigation return flow from the k th sub region in the i th period m3 dp k i is the amount of deep percolation from the k th sub region in the i th period m3 total amount of rf at an any period is the sum of dp of each sub region from an early corresponding period this provides formula for the total amount of return flow in the irrigation area for any chosen period 11 rf i k 1 n 1 dp k i k 1 where rf i is the amount of irrigation return flow of the entire irrigation region in the i th period m3 eq 11 shows that if the irrigation region s maximum lag time is n 1 δτ determining dp in the latest n periods is necessary before calculating the total rf to summarize the ltc method has been developed for the prediction of rf in arid areas which can be summarized in the following three steps step 1 based on meteorological data and irrigation data for the irrigation region eq 1 is used for calculating the dp in different periods step 2 based on the parameters of the vadose zone and aquifer in the irrigation region eq 6 is used for calculating the rf lag time and arcgis or other software is used to produce an ltc map from the ltc map the irrigation district is then divided into several sub regions in this step we can use a suitable method green ampt formula richards formula to calculate the vadose zone lag time according to the available data in the study area step 3 eq 11 is used for calculating the return flow of the irrigation district in different periods 2 2 area frequency curve method the ltc method from section 2 1 can be used for the prediction of the amount of rf in different periods however the rf lag time varies from several months to several decades in different areas grismer 2012 scanlon et al 2005 sophocleous 2005 to predict the change of rf in different time scales a new concept of afc is proposed this is the curve of the area proportion of different sub regions that changes with the lag time afc can be obtained from the ltc map according to the definition of afc arcgis 10 2 can be used to calculate the proportion of the area corresponding to different lag times in the ltc map to the total area so that the afc can be drawn it is notable a point on the afc is only meaningful when the lag time is an integer it can therefore be regarded as a discrete distribution the afc for three different watersheds is displayed in fig 3 as for lag time increases the area proportion of sub regions of all curves first increases and then decreases the shape of afc differs according to different groundwater depths when groundwater depth is small lag time is short and afc is steep conversely when groundwater depth is large lag time is long and afc is gentle the scale transformation of afc can be used for the calculation of the rf for different time scales but the cumulative frequency for each point with integer lag time on the curve should be 1 therefore when the time scale is transformed from δτ to m δτ the function of afc is transformed into 12 f a τ 1 m f b 1 m τ where f b τ and f a τ represent the afc function before and after time scale transformation for calculation of the rf in different time scales eq 11 is transformed into the form of afc 13 rf i k 1 n 1 dp ω i k 1 f a k where dp ω i is the amount of deep percolation for the entire irrigation region in the i th period m3 compared to eq 11 eq 13 is simpler and more applicable and it can be used to calculate the amount of rf for different time scales in addition if the time series of rf is known the trial and error method can be used for deducing the afc based on eq 13 obtaining the parameters and determining lag time can be difficult due to the thickness of the vadose zone in arid areas so it is of great significance to deduce the afc of lag time using the measured time series of rf in this section the concept of afc is proposed based on the ltc for the prediction of rf in arid areas compared to the ltc method the afc method only requires some observation data for the prediction of rf in different time scales and different time scales of rf can be calculated by transforming the time scale of afc in addition with a lack of hydrogeological data it has application potential for the deduction of the afc and prediction of rf using the trial and error method 2 3 trial and error method the trial and error method is based on the ordinary least squares and the residuals between the rf calculation results and the observed values are minimized by continuously adjusting the afc curve the residual function can be expressed as follows 14 φ n a k b i 1 m rf obs i rf cal i 2 where rf obs and rf cal are the measured and calculated values of rf respectively m is the total number of computed time periods afc is a curve that reflects the characteristics of the regional lag time distribution in order to determine the afc using the trial and error method a function can be used to represent the afc the area enclosed by the afc function and the x axis should be satisfied as 1 and the function should be single peaked when choosing the function type refer to the afc obtained from ltc the probability density function of gamma distribution was chosen to represent the afc in this paper which can be expressed as 15 f a x β α γ α x α 1 e β x where α is the shape parameter and β is the inverse scale parameter the afc function is determined by adjusting the parameters α and β to minimize the residuals in eq 14 2 4 study area the study area is the eastern part of jingdian irrigation district jingtai county gansu province china fig 4 it is a typical dryland and agricultural water diversion irrigation district the irrigation method used in the study area is electric power irrigation and the water source is the yellow river the study area s average multi year precipitation is 186 mm and its average multi year water surface evaporation intensity is 2123 mm so it can be seen that water resources are extremely scarce the study area is part of the yellow river system and rf flows into the eastern drainage rivers and into the yellow river as groundwater runoff the study area s total area is 351 3 km2 and according to the control area of the irrigation canal system it can be divided into four sub irrigation areas zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii there is a scarcity of both surface water and groundwater sources in the study area and with the exception of a few drainage rivers in the southwest of the downstream all rivers are generally dry and waterless only when there is heavy rainfall during the summer and autumn months each year can ditch floods form but the duration of this is short the study area s groundwater flows from west to east and the main source of gr is irrigation infiltration which is not abundant in gr conditions therefore the amount of groundwater is small it is deep underground and its quality is poor also according to the hydrogeological borehole data fig 5 the lithology of the study area s vadose zone and aquifer is mainly silt loam sandy loam and sand the vadose zone and aquifer s structure is simple there is no obvious water barrier and the aquifer type is unconfined yellow river institute of hydrology and water resources 2018 2 5 data sources meteorological data used in this study was obtained from jingtai county national weather station and china meteorological administration and includes daily precipitation mm average temperature wind speed m s relative humidity and sunshine hours h from 2000 to 2020 data on the planting area planting structure crop type and fertility period net irrigation amount and canal system water use coefficient from 2000 to 2020 were obtained from by jingdian irrigation bureau the lithology of the vadose zone and aquifer were determined using hydrogeological borehole data and the parameters were determined based on the handbook of hydrogeology china geological survey 2012 from november 2017 to october 2020 the groundwater depth and rf of the drainage river were monitored by the long term monitoring of nine hydrogeological boreholes and six measuring weirs within the study area 3 results 3 1 time series and influencing factors of deep percolation calculating dp is for the calculation rf based on the precipitation irrigation and crop water requirement data for the study area dp can be calculated using eq 1 fig 6 a shows the relationship between dp and irrigation water diversion effective precipitation and crop water requirement on a yearly scale for the period 2000 2020 as the figure shows the total irrigation water diversion varies irregularly from 2000 to 2020 jafari et al 2012 noted out that irregular variations in total irrigation water diversion can be due to farmers management practices variations in irrigation intervals and a lack of scientific calculations of water requirements the contribution of dp are from xigan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase i zonggan in phase ii in descending order which is mainly influenced by the sub irrigation area s crop cultivation area dp varies irregularly between 2000 and 2020 which is due to the irregular variation of the total net irrigation amount fig 6 b shows the relationship between monthly average dp irrigation water diversion effective precipitation and crop water requirement for 2000 2020 as the graph shows dp is mainly concentrated in winter october november and autumn july august irrigation each year and accounts for 77 48 and 19 77 of the total annual dp respectively effective precipitation varies unimodally throughout the year with its peak august coinciding with autumn irrigation dp which suggests that autumn irrigation dp is mostly influenced by effective precipitation this is due to trends in net irrigation amount and crop water consumption during autumn irrigation being more or less the same where a large amount of irrigation water is consumed by the crop and less dp is produced by irrigation water therefore almost all of the dp during autumn irrigation is produced by effective short term precipitation the net irrigation amount varies bimodally during the year and there are two peaks in june and november the november peak coincides with the timing of winter irrigation dp which suggests that winter irrigation dp is mostly influenced by the winter net irrigation amount the june peak has less influence on dp as during the crop growing period of march to september the net irrigation amount is mainly consumed by the crop and therefore less dp is produced to perform a quantitative analysis of the degree of influence of effective precipitation net irrigation amount and crop water requirement on dp the correlation coefficients between each factor and dp were analyzed using the pearson test table 1 shows that net irrigation amount and crop water requirement have a significant correlation with dp on both the yearly scale and monthly scale while the correlation between effective precipitation and dp is not significant the magnitude of the correlation coefficients indicates that the influence on dp is in descending order of net irrigation amount crop water requirement and effective precipitation this is due to the study area s water source for crop growth mainly coming from irrigation water and the effective precipitation being concentrated in june and july each year therefore effective precipitation has less influence on dp than net irrigation amount additionally the actual crop water consumption is less than the crop water requirement in some periods due to irrigation limitation and precipitation amount so crop water requirement has the least influence on the dp regarding time scale the absolute values of the correlation coefficients at the yearly scale were all greater than those of the monthly scale which indicates the three influencing factors were more strongly correlated with dp at the yearly scale than the monthly scale this is potentially due to the soil in the root zone having a moderating effect on irrigation water and precipitation making the correlation between net irrigation amount effective precipitation and dp weaker at the monthly scale 3 2 spatial variations and influencing factors of lag time rf is not only influenced by dp it is also related to lag time fig 7 shows the calculation results for the vadose zone aquifer and total lag time in the study area the vadose zone lag time ranges from 0 to 7 months and gradually increases from east to west the reason for this is that the vadose zone lag time is mainly influenced by the groundwater depth vadose zone thickness and the vadose zone thickness gradually increases from east to west the aquifer lag time ranges from 0 to 14 months and gradually increases from east to west the reason for this is that the aquifer lag time is mainly influenced by the distance to the drainage river and the groundwater seepage path length gradually increases from east to west the total lag time ranges from 0 to 20 months the spatial distribution law is similar to that of the aquifer lag time the reason is that the aquifer lag time accounts for a larger proportion about 67 of the total lag time and the total lag time is influenced by the aquifer lag time showing a gradual increase from east to west the vadose zone lag time in xigan in phase i is the largest followed by beigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii and the smallest is zonggan in phase i to accurately analyze the effects of each factor on lag time parameters relating to lag time for the study area s nine groundwater level observation holes are displayed in table 2 the correlation coefficients with lag time from largest to smallest were groundwater seepage path length vadose zone thickness silt loam thickness the correlation coefficient of the groundwater seepage path length is the largest because the lag time of the aquifer is greater than that of the vadose zone although groundwater flow rate is much greater than the flow rate of the vadose zone groundwater s influence on lag time is greater than that of the vadose zone as the groundwater seepage path length is several orders of magnitude greater several kilometers than the thickness of vadose zone several tens of meters 3 3 calibration and validation of prediction model for irrigation return flow the afc of lag time for each sub irrigation district is determined from the distribution of lag times the ltc method and trial and error method using eq 13 were used for the calculation of the afc which is shown in fig 8 the shape of afc that was obtained using the two methods largely matched each other with the root mean square error rmse ranging from 0 015 to 0 023 for the four sub irrigation areas the best fit was zonggan in phase i and beigan in phase i with r2 0 9 followed by zonggan in phase ii with r2 0 858 and the worst fit was xigan in phase i with r2 0 684 four curves with peaks between 0 11 and 0 27 the afc peaks are from largest to smallest zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase ii and xigan in phase i as the afc flattens out the average lag time becomes greater the sum of the area frequency values corresponding to different lag times should be 1 i e the area enclosed by the afc curve and the x axis is 1 therefore the larger the lag time the smaller the peak monthly scale rfs were calculated for drainage rivers from november 2017 to october 2020 using the ltc method and the trial and error method and november 2017 to october 2019 was the calibration period and november 2019 to october 2020 was the validation period a comparison between the rf calculated using the two methods and the observed rf can be seen in fig 9 the r2 for the trial and error method and the ltc method were 0 65 and 0 75 for the calibration period and 0 62 and 0 71 for the validation period which indicates that the results of the trial and error method more closely match the measured values there is a difference of 0 1 and 0 09 in the r2 values of calibration and validation of the ltc method and trial and error method which may be due to the difference in the afcs obtained by the two methods the afc obtained by the ltc method is calculated by the formula which may be affected by errors of topography and parameter so the obtained afc is not smooth there are some mutation points and there are some differences with the real situation the afc obtained by the trial and error method is based on the observed data and the curve is smoother and the points on the curve are asymptotic which may be closer to the real situation therefore the rf obtained by the two methods differs from the r2 of the observed values it is notable that in comparation to the ltc method the afc calculated using the trial and error method is not only in good agreement with the measured results it is also suitable for areas where hydrogeological data is lacking and has a much wider scope for application therefore in this study the afc obtained using the trial and error method with better fitting results was chosen for calculation of the rf from 2000 to 2020 3 4 time series and influencing factors of irrigation return flow following verification of the reliability of the rf prediction model that was developed for this study the rf time series for different time scales from 2000 to 2020 were calculated fig 10 a shows the relationship between rf and dp on a yearly scale the yearly rf and dp follow the same trend and reach a maximum value of 5494 104 m3 in 2010 and the contribution to rf is in descending order xigan in phase i beigan in phase i zonggan in phase i zonggan in phase ii fig 10 b shows the relationship between monthly scale rf and dp for zonggan in phase i dp peaks in november and rf peaks in january with an average lag time of approximately 2 months with beigan in phase i dp peaks in november and rf peaks in march with an average lag time of approximately 4 months xigan in phase i has a dp peak in november and rf peak is in october with an average lag time of approximately 11 months with zonggan in phase ii the dp peak is in november and the rf peak is in april and the average lag time approximately 5 months it can be seen that the average lag times for the four sub irrigation regions are quite close to the peaks of the four afc that are shown in fig 8 which indicates that the peaks of the afc reflect the average lag times for the area to a certain extent to analyze the effect of dp on rf at different time scales in the study area the correlation coefficients of each were analyzed using the pearson test the correlation coefficients were also analyzed separately for both cases both with and without any lag time consideration the results of this analysis are displayed in table 3 from this table it can be seen that the correlation coefficients of zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii on the yearly scale are all greater than 0 8 p 0 01 and are significantly correlated whereas the correlation coefficient of xigan in phase i on the yearly scale is only 0 319 p 0 05 which is not significant this is due to the average lag time of zonggan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii being less than half a year therefore the correlation between dp and rf is strong on the yearly scale conversely the average lag time for xigan in phase i was 11 months meaning that the correlation between dp and rf was weaker the correlation coefficient between dp and rf reached 0 994 p 0 01 when the rf on the yearly scale of phase i was moved forward one year indicating that the rf on the yearly scale of xigan in phase i is more significantly influenced by lag time the absolute values of the monthly scale correlation coefficients are all lower than 0 4 which indicates that the monthly scale dp is less correlated with rf if the lag of the monthly scale is considered the correlation coefficients were greater than 0 4 p 0 01 when the monthly scale rf of zonggan in phase i beigan in phase i xigan in phase i and zonggan in phase ii were advanced by 2 4 11 and 5 months respectively which indicates that the monthly scale rf were all affected by lag time in addition after considering lag time the correlation coefficient between monthly scale dp and rf did not reach 0 8 thereby indicating that the correlation between monthly scale dp and rf is also not as strong as the yearly scale 4 discussion in the arid regions of northwest china there exist many water diversion irrigation projects that take water from the yellow river and deliver it to irrigation areas through large pumping stations which not only ensure local irrigation water promote local agriculture but also improve the ecological environment in and around the irrigation areas zhang 2015 wang et al 2006 pointed out that strong human activities in irrigation areas have changed the natural water cycle process in irrigated areas and the diversion irrigation percolation return water cycle process has played a dominant role in arid and semi arid areas with low precipitation based on this water cycle process this paper developed an rf prediction model for water diversion irrigation areas in arid regions the developed model in this paper can adequately respond to the lag of rf compared to the multiple regression method ito et al 1980 which has a larger error in drought areas where the lag is more pronounced furthermore hydrological models such as swat have also been used for the simulation of irrigation area diversions and withdrawals gosain et al 2005 despite the high accuracy of hydrological models in terms of surface water movement huang 2011 most hydrological models focus on the study of production and sink mechanisms with more simplifications in terms of water exchange between groundwater and surface water and conversion between soil water and groundwater in the unsaturated zone jia et al 2005 this drawback of the hydrological model is particularly significant in arid regions and the rf prediction model developed in this paper can better solve this problem in addition compared with the hydrological model the model developed in this paper requires less information and parameters and has better applicability therefore the rf prediction model developed in this paper has a certain significance for water resources management in the irrigation area with small rainfall and large difference in groundwater level the lag of rf in arid regions cannot be ignored wang et al 2021 lu et al 2011 demonstrated that in a coastal plain with a small groundwater depth the lag time for rf is generally no more than 1 or 2 days however in areas with a greater groundwater depth 10 m the lag time is approximately 18 35 days in our study area the maximum rf lag time reaches up to about 20 months fig 7c for areas where the water table is buried at greater depths the rf lag time can even reach several decades rossman 2014 table 3 shows a significant increase in the correlation of monthly scale rf with each influencing factor after accounting for lags which also indicates a significant influence of lags on rf in arid region s agricultural irrigation areas where large groundwater depth is a common phenomenon the influence of rf lag time must be considered as it is incredibly important particularly regarding the estimation of rf and different lag times corresponding to different groundwater depths must also be considered su 2018 jafari et al 2012 noted that the main factors which affect the rf lag time are preferential paths and soil texture and that flow through the macropores in coarse grained soil reduces the rf lag time however in arid areas this situation becomes more complicated as the thickness of the vadose zone and the length of the groundwater seepage path also affect rf lag time table 2 showed that the correlation coefficient of the vadose zone thickness was greater than fine grained soil silt loam thickness which suggests that fine grained soil thickness is not a key factor that affects the rf lag time but the total thickness of the vadose zone plays a more important role bronswijk et al 1995 and weaver et al 2005 reported that preferential flow through cracks of clay can lead to the rapid transportation of irrigation water these studies demonstrate that fine grained soil thickness has very little effect on rf lag time due to the existence of preferential flow these studies share the results of this paper and all show that the main factor of the vadose zone lag time was the vadose zone thickness rather than the fine grained soil thickness however different from the research results the length of the groundwater seepage path affects the rf lag time to a greater extent than the vadose zone thickness table 2 shows that the correlation coefficient between rf lag time and groundwater seepage path length is 0 978 p 0 01 the reason is that although groundwater flow rate is much greater than the flow rate of the vadose zone groundwater s influence on lag time is greater than that of the vadose zone as the groundwater seepage path length is several orders of magnitude greater several kilometers than the thickness of vadose zone several tens of meters dp is an important source for gr simons et al 2015 table 1 shows that the correlation coefficients between dp and net irrigation water and effective precipitation at the yearly scale in the study area were 0 837 p 0 01 and 0 229 p 0 05 respectively which indicates that yearly scale dp is largely influenced by irrigation water rather than precipitation fisher and healy 2008 studied the dp process in two irrigated farmlands in a semi arid region and showed that almost all dp occurred during the irrigation season while precipitation had less effect on dp which is the same as the results of this paper in addition fig 6 b shows that the monthly scale dp is concentrated in the winter and autumn irrigation seasons although irrigation season is the most important factor affecting dp unlike the results of fisher and healy 2008 dp during autumn irrigation in the study area is the result of a combination of net irrigation water crop water demand and effective rainfall although it only accounts for about one fifth of the annual dp compared with dp rf showed relatively flat fluctuations within the year fig 10b which is due to the spatial differences in lag time that dispersed dp which was relatively concentrated in the fall and winter irrigation seasons into rf in different periods which explains the small correlation coefficient table 3 between rf and dp at the monthly scale in addition yearly scale rf correlated significantly with dp when the lag time did not exceed 6 months according to research conducted by jafari et al 2012 the correlation coefficient of yearly scale rf and dp is 0 99 p 0 01 when the maximum lag time is three months which is the same as the results obtained by this paper the correlation between rf and dp increases when lag time is considered both on yearly and monthly scales which is further evidence that the correlation between rf and dp is strongly influenced by lag time in this paper the linkages and influencing factors of dp rf and lag time are considered at yearly and monthly scales respectively which are not much studied yet but are necessary for arid regions 5 conclusion ltc and afc concepts were proposed which can be used for describing the spatial distribution of lag time in the region rf prediction model considering lags was developed and the prediction results matched the measured results the results of the analysis of the past 20 years data in the study area showed that the yearly scale dp was mainly influenced by the net irrigation amount and the lag time greater than half a year the monthly scale dp was significantly influenced by the irrigation season the lag time is significantly influenced by the length of the groundwater seepage path and the thickness of the vadose zone rf is affected by dp and lag time together at both yearly and monthly scales declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could

9946,a 4 yr study was conducted in a dry mediterranean region of the inland pacific northwest usa pnw to measure winter wheat ww triticum aestivum l stubble height and orientation effects on overwinter precipitation capture in the soil and subsequent water retention during ensuing dry summer months the stubble was left standing and undisturbed during the 13 mo fallow periods stubble height treatments were i short 8 cm ii medium 25 cm and iii tall 75 cm an additional treatment iv mow tall stubble in mid june was included in the final two years soil water measurements were obtained at the beginning middle and end of fallow in 15 cm increments to a depth of 180 cm additionally seed zone water content was measured at the end of fallow in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm near surface soil temperature was measured from june august on average tall and medium height stubble captured 34 and 32 mm p 0 002 more overwinter precipitation respectively than short stubble and these values were particularly pronounced 91 and 79 mm greater than short stubble during a winter of heavy snow drifting however from mid april until late august the tall stubble lost an average of 91 mm of soil water compared to 70 and 59 mm in the medium and short stubble treatments p 0 001 mowing tall stubble in mid june before the hot dry summer did not improved water retention continuous soil temperatures at 3 7 15 25 and 40 cm depths measured electronically from june august were coolest with the short mowed medium and tall stubble respectively with frequent significant differences of 1 c among treatments we speculate that soil in the tall treatment was warmest and lost the most over summer water because all stubble was standing and offered less soil shading than the other treatments at the end of fallow medium and tall stubble averaged 14 and 8 mm greater soil water respectively than the short treatment p 0 027 short stubble was a disadvantage for overwinter precipitation capture but was equal or better than the other treatments for retaining soil water from april to late august presumably because this treatment had the most residue lying flat on the soil surface for shading these findings offer opportunity to improve current models for soil water dynamics during fallow by incorporating stubble height for combined soil water retention and farm management factors medium

temperature soil water dynamics wheat 1 introduction stubble management to enhance soil water storage and reduce soil erosion has been studied for many decades as farm implements and farmers preferences evolve over time there is a need for new information on the effects of stubble management options in the past moldboard plow or other tillage practices that left soil bare of crop residue were the standard for comparison no till production is now common enough to be used as a baseline practice in the united states pnw machado et al 2015 and other mediterranean like dryland wheat production regions around the world giller et al 2015 the climate of the pnw is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers with occasional drought cycles about two thirds of annual precipitation occurs from october march with about one third as snow during this period one fourth of the annual precipitation occurs during april june with july september the driest and warmest

the 1890 s on about two million hectares in the low precipitation zone 350 mm and less of average annual precipitation of the pnw kirby et al 2017 on average precipitation storage efficiency in the soil is 65 70 in the winter of the fallow year but storage efficiency is reduced to around 30 by the end of fallow i e at time of ww sowing in late august early september mccall and wanser 1924 schillinger 2016 this stored soil water during fallow allows for timely sowing of ww and reduces the risk of crop failure from drought which enables stable and mostly profitable grain yields stöckle et al 2018 the question of ideal stubble height is largely focused on the potential to trap drifting snow during winter ries and power 1981 and likelihood to reduce evaporation during the dry warm summer the capacity of tall stubble to trap drifting snow is well established black and siddoway 1977 hoefer et al 1981 but the effect on stored soil water is dependent on weather conditions aase and siddoway 1980 black and bauer 1990 for example campbell et al 1992 measured only 3 out of 10 years where tall stubble provided greater overwinter soil water storage these studies were conducted in the great plains region of the northern us and southern canada where snow is the major form of winter precipitation in regions with milder winters blowing snow can be infrequent or represent minor amounts of precipitation in this case evaporation after rainfall events or in the spring become more important the hypothesis that tall stubble can reduce evaporation of stored soil water is complicated to evaluate theoretically the reduction in near surface wind speed and convection under tall versus short or no residue should reduce evaporation from the soil surface aase and siddoway 1980 tall stubble is also generally assumed to shade the soil surface more than short stubble to reflect heat energy horton et al 1996 aase and siddoway 1980 found that tall stubble improved snow capture but could find no direct evidence of less evaporation with standing stubble versus bare soil in their experiment no residue was left lying on the soil between rows cutforth et al 2011 measured enhanced wheat grain yields with increasing stubble maintained during the crop year which they considered an indication of less evaporation and more transpiration with stubble as tall as 45 cm in contrast baumhardt et al 2002 and flerchinger et al 2003 reported that evaporation differences among stubble heights were minor under dry conditions the quantity of surface soil water is a dominant factor in the amount of evaporation in some regions summer rainfall is significant but in mediterranean regions like the pnw the final two to three months of the fallow period are dry and warm and during this period treatments with greater near surface water will evaporate water faster than drier treatments until surface water contents are equal hammel 1996 idso et al 1974 flerchinger et al 2003 reported that standing wheat residue generally warmed soil sooner in the spring compared to flattened residue or bare soil this contradicts the theory that tall stubble provides shade which reduces solar heating bare soils tend to have warmer daytime temperatures but this begins after the soil surface dries and does not necessarily result in greater heat flux downward flerchinger et al 2003 dry surface soil and especially dry residue cover create poor conduction of heat downward and their high surface temperature creates significant radiation back to the atmosphere and conduction convection to the air cutforth and mcconkey 1997 complicating these relatively straightforward concepts on the effects of residue height is the quantity of residue laying horizontal on the soil surface swella et al 2015 in the absence of residue removal the height of residue left standing is inversely related to the amount of residue lying flat on the soil surface the tradeoff between standing residue and flattened surface residue is not easily determined and depends on the proportion of time the soil surface is dry baumhardt et al 2002 flat wheat residue produced the lowest evaporation in several climates but the differences in evaporation due to residue architecture tall vs short and amount flat on the soil were minor about 8 in dry climates flerchinger et al 2003 surface residue provides protection from wind and sun immediately after a precipitation event and this effect can extend for several weeks compared to bare soil wuest and schillinger 2011 in climates with low total precipitation and brief events of low intensity rainfall surface residue needs to be wet through before water reaches the soil surface once rainfall infiltrates into the surface soil the reduction in evaporative loss with surface residue vs bare soil results in a net increase in stored soil water for about a month following the rain event wuest and schillinger 2011 swella et al 2015 wuest 2017 mediterranean climatic regions have extended dry periods where cropland is sometimes left fallow for a year or longer there is often wide year to year variation in precipitation totals and crop residue produced therefore it is especially important to measure residue factors in combination with soil type and weather patterns through the full fallow cycle over several years flerchinger et al 2003 ward et al 2009 the objective of our study was to determine whether maximizing stubble height would improve fallow water storage in a 2 yr winter wheat fallow rotation in the drylands of the pnw 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview a 4 yr field experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2019 on the derek schafer farm near ritzville in east central washington 47 077825 118 522791 the objective was to assess ww stubble height and orientation on overwinter precipitation capture in the soil and subsequent water retention during the dry summer months of 13 month long fallow periods the fallow period began with ww grain harvest in early august and extended until ww planting in late august of the next year the study was conducted on a separate field each year on the schafer farm over the 4 yr period the soil at the experiment site is a ritzville silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic calcidic haploxeroll u s classification system also known as a haplic kastanozems fao unesco 1990 soil is more than 2 m deep with no rocks or restrictive layers and slope at the four sites ranged from 0 to 3 the four field sites were all located within a 4 km radius collaborating farmer schafer sowed a different semidwarf soft white winter wheat cultivar each year these cultivars were xerpha ars crescent otto and nw duet in 2015 2106 2017 and 2018 respectively these cultivars were sown in late august or early september with a custom built deep furrow drill with row spacing of 40 cm sowing rate each year was 55 kg ha excellent plant stands were achieved every year winter wheat grain yield in the fields prior to initiation of each year s experiment was measured by the collaborating farmer with the combine harvester s grain yield monitor as well as a grain elevator weigh scale these grain yields were 1880 5310 5010 and 6080 kg ha for years one to four respectively harvest index hi of semi dwarf ww averages 0 40 in the pnw donaldson et al 2001 and in other rainfed ww production regions of the us great plains and southern australia maeoka et al 2020 mature plant height of the ww cultivars sown ranged from 86 to 91 cm as hi is defined as the percentage of grain in the total above ground plant biomass ww straw production in our experiment was approximately 2600 7400 7000 and 8500 kg ha respectively over the four years a combine harvester equipped with a 11 m wide shelbourne reynolds xcv shelbourne reynolds ip31 2ar suffolk england uk stripper header cutting platform was used to harvest ww grain from fields every year the stripper header tado et al 1998 was equipped with a rotating stripping rotor with eight rows of fingers that strip the grain from the wheat spike leaving nearly the entire plant stem standing and attached to the ground after grain harvest with the stripper header a combine harvester with a 7 m wide conventional cutting platform was used to cut stubble to heights of 8 cm and 25 cm with the cut straw distributed across the width of the cutting platform behind the grain combine thus three stubble height treatments were established i short 8 cm ii medium 25 cm and iii tall 75 cm the experiment was expanded in years 3 and 4 to add a fourth treatment of mowing the 75 cm tall stubble close to the soil surface with a schulte rotary mower schulte industries englefeld sk canada in mid june before the onset of hot and dry weather the mowed treatment was added to determine if flattening the tall stubble before the hot summer months would facilitate soil water retention the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications size of individual plots every year was 7 60 m the treatments are visually presented in fig 1 the plots were kept virtually weed free throughout the fallow period by periodic application of glyphosate herbicide as needed the self propelled weed it precision sprayer weed it precision spraying hoge wesselink 8 the netherlands had a 36 m wide boom and was guided by gps so that wheel traffic was always in the same track to ensure that measurement areas within the plots were not disturbed four herbicide applications were required during each 13 mo fallow period 2 2 precipitation measurement computerized tipping bucket precipitation recording devices are commonly used to record precipitation at on farm experimental sites however tipping bucket recorders have been documented to underestimate actual precipitation by as much as 40 and or to stop recording altogether due to various causes sypka 2019 grossi et al 2017 therefore we report accurate and reliable precipitation data manually recorded from two locations near the field sites table 1 location 1 was the wsu lind dryland research station situated 7 km south of the field sites where daily precipitation and other climatic data was officially recorded for the us national weather service location 2 was 8 km ne of the field sites in the town of ritzville where daily precipitation was recorded by the adams conservation district 2 3 soil water measurement 2 3 1 total 180 cm profile measurement soil water was measured to a depth of 180 cm three times during the 13 mo fallow period these times were i in early august immediately after ww harvest ii in mid april and iii at the end of fallow in late august volumetric soil water content in the 0 to 30 cm depth was determined from two 15 cm core samples using gravimetric procedures described by topp and ferre 2002 using known soil bulk density values soil volumetric water content in the 30 180 cm depth was measured in 15 cm increments with an instrotek cpn 503 neutron moisture probe instrotek 1 triangle drive raleigh nc usa using methods defined by hignett and evett 2002 the neutron probe was calibrated and validated for the ritzville silt loam soils at the study sites 2 3 2 seed zone measurement seed zone volumetric water content was measured just prior to ww sowing in late august 2018 and early september 2019 in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm with an incremental soil sampler designed by wuest and schillinger 2008 adequate seed zone water for sowing ww is generally located from 10 to 15 cm below the soil surface this is considered some of the deepest seed placement in the world for sowing wheat donaldson 1996 we designed the incremental sampler to obtain seed zone volumetric water data to a depth of 26 cm as the water potential below the depth of actual seed placement is important for root hydration during seedling emergence and early growth lindstrom et al 1976 2 4 soil temperature measurement soil temperature was measured from mid june to mid to late august in two years as this period has the hottest and driest weather conditions during the fallow cycle and immediately precedes sowing of ww in 2018 campbell 616 temperature probes campbell scientific logan utah usa were placed at 10 cm in all plots these probes contain temperature sensors in the electronics housing near where one of the metal wave guides is attached when placed horizontally they measure soil temperature at that depth readings at hourly intervals were averaged and daily means recorded in 2019 soil temperature profiles were measured at 1 cm depth increments to 25 cm and at 30 35 and 40 cm depths as described by wuest 2013 temperature sensing thermistors were mounted in a glass reinforced plastic shaft that can be installed with very little soil disturbance data were measured at 5 min intervals and recorded as hourly averages soil temperature data were examined for trends attributable to treatments five day average temperatures from the early mid and late time periods were compared among treatments at the 10 cm depth in 2018 and 3 7 15 25 and 40 cm depths in 2019 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted for volumetric water content in the 180 cm soil profile all four years seed zone volumetric water content 2018 and 2019 and soil temperature 2018 and 2019 using a randomized complete block design anova for each year and a split plot in time anova across years with treatment as the fixed effect factor and year as the random effect factor tukey s honest significant difference hsd test was used to detect statistical differences in treatment means and control the experiment wise error rate for multiple comparisons all soil water data anova tests were done at the 5 level of significance whereas soil temperature tests were conducted at both the 5 and 10 level of significance the statstix 10 data analysis software analytical software 2105 miller landing rd tallahassee florida usa was used for all anova comparisons 3 results 3 1 precipitation over the 4 yr study fallow year sept 1 aug 31 precipitation at lind ranged from 224 to 376 mm and averaged 308 mm during the same period fallow year precipitation at ritzville ranged from 320 to 439 mm and averaged 377 mm table 1 long term 100 yr average annual precipitation at lind is 244 mm and at ritzville 292 mm therefore only in 2019 was annual precipitation less than normal at lind and all four years were wetter than normal at ritzville table 1 as the study sites were located essentially equidistance between lind and ritzville precipitation values at the sites were likely greater than those at lind and less than at ritzville 3 2 water in 180 cm soil profile 3 2 1 beginning of fallow at time of grain harvest i e beginning of fallow ww in the pnw depletes near surface soil water down to 5 by volume but plant soil water extraction generally diminishes with depth to 10 by volume at 150 cm soil depth schillinger and young 2000 winter wheat extracts water somewhat less efficiently from soil depths 150 cm in all four years most plant available soil water as defined above was depleted from the soil profile by the time of ww grain harvest as indicated by the baseline start of fallow water distribution data shown in solid black circles in fig 2 the one exception was at the start of the 2018 fallow year where 50 mm of available water was present from 150 to 180 cm table 2 fig 2c this likely occurred because the 2018 study site was located in a basin where soil water storage is frequently greater than other landscape positions logically and as expected there were never any within year differences in baseline soil water table 2 as these measurements were obtained immediately after the stubble height treatments were imposed 3 2 2 overwinter soil water recharge statistically significant differences in overwinter soil water recharge were measured in 3 of 4 years table 2 averaged over the 4 years there were no differences between the medium and tall treatments and both were significantly greater p 0 002 than the short stubble table 2 in 2016 the overwinter water gain for the medium treatment was significantly greater than the tall but not compared to the short treatment table 2 treatment differences were minor among treatments likely because baseline residue from the preceding ww crop was sparce 2600 kg ha soil water content among treatments in april at all measurement increments down to 180 cm were almost identical solid colored circles in fig 2a for the 2017 fallow cycle dry straw biomass from the preceding ww crop was 7400 kg ha nearly 3x greater than the previous year the 2017 winter was one of high precipitation with much falling as snow and there was extensive snow drifting there were 77 days of continuous snow cover at lind that set a 101 yr record for that location weaver 2017 the medium and tall stubble treatments were much more effective than the short treatment in trapping drifting snow which was likely the reason the short stubble had 79 and 91 mm less overwinter soil water gain than the medium and tall treatments respectively p 0 001 table 2 the large differences in overwinter water storage among treatments and the spatial distribution of soil water by depth were consistent among treatments these data are clearly illustrated in fig 2 b for the 2018 fallow year residue produced by the previous ww crop was 7000 kg ha only slightly less than residue estimations for the previous year the winter was relatively mild with only a few days with snow covering the ground no frozen soil runoff was observed in any fallowed fields in the region overwinter water recharge into the soil was high and there were no significant differences in overwinter soil water gain among treatments table 2 nor in the spatial water distribution pattern in the soil profile fig 2c the approximate ww straw biomass of 8500 kg ha in 2019 was the greatest for the 4 yr study in the winter there was ample snow cover with high winds that gusted to 65 km h which created substantial snow drifting in february soil water content in mid april was significantly higher p 0 001 in the tall compared to the medium and short treatments table 2 and overwinter soil water gain was tall medium short the enhanced overwinter water gain with tall stubble at soil depths 60 cm is clearly pronounced in fig 2 d water at deeper soil depths especially benefits wheat grain yield during the kernel fill stage of development when available water in upper portions of the profile has been depleted sciarresi et al 2019 flohr et al 2020 precipitation during the 2019 fallow year was the lowest of the four years table 1 averaged over four years overwinter soil water gain was the same for medium and tall stubble table 2 overwinter soil water gain in short stubble was reduced by 30 mm compared to the medium and tall treatments p 0 002 table 2 3 2 3 april through august soil water loss statistically significant differences in water loss from mid april to late august were measured in two years as well as the 4 yr average table 2 there were no differences among treatments in 2016 table 2 presumably because residue levels were so low due to low ww grain yield during the preceding crop year soil profile water distribution at each depth was almost identical among treatments in late august fig 2a in 2017 following a winter of heavy snow drifting highly significant differences of over summer water loss occurred in the order of tall medium short treatments p 0 001 table 2 overwinter water storage in the short stubble was comparatively low see section 3 2 2 thus there was considerably less water to be lost although mid april water content in the medium and tall stubble were the same april to august loss for these treatments was 80 and 127 mm respectively table 2 despite the huge overwinter water storage advantage of tall vs short stubble end of fallow water content was the same table 2 fig 2b conversely the medium treatment had 25 mm more water retained by late august than the short and tall stubble which can be clearly visualized in the 50 180 cm depth in fig 2 b like the mid april 2018 water data there were also no differences among treatments in late august including from the mowed treatment as described in section 2 1 and shown in fig 1c that was imposed for the first time in mid june table 2 there was very little temporal variation in profile water distribution among treatments in mid april and late august fig 2c in 2019 highly significant differences p 0 005 in soil profile water were recorded in late august in the order of tall mowed medium short although the tall stubble was the only treatment significantly different than the short stubble table 2 there were no significant late august differences among the tall medium and mowed treatments averaged over the four years there were few differences in late august soil water content among the tall medium and short treatments although the medium stubble was significantly greater than the short stubble p 0 027 table 2 although the tall and medium stubble stored the most overwinter precipitation they also lost more water than the short stubble during the summer there was no water retention advantage in mowing the tall stubble in mid june prior to the onset of hot summer temperatures in 2018 and 2019 3 3 seed zone water at time of sowing in late august during july and august 2018 only minor traces of rain occurred table 1 july and august are historically the hottest and the driest months in the pnw karimi et al 2018 thus 2018 is considered typical the distribution of seed zone volumetric soil water in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm among treatments in late august is presented in fig 3 a these data show that the short and the mowed treatments trended highest from the 9 to 17 cm depth the medium stubble was deficient in water from the 5 cm near surface to 17 cm fig 3a the tall treatment was especially dry in the lower seed zone increments in 2019 considerable and unusual rain occurred in july and august table 1 these rains negated any differences in seed zone volumetric soil water among treatments fig 3b 3 4 soil temperature from june to august in 2018 and 2019 the 10 cm average daily soil temperatures following the mid june mowing treatment are shown for 2018 fig 4a and 2019 fig 4d when time segments of several days were averaged and compared for 2018 there were no significant differences among treatments this was due to high variation between replicates in 2018 however the temperature means trended similarly to 2019 with short and mowed treatments averaging about 1 c cooler than the medium and tall stubble during the first half of the measurement period fig 4 daily maximum fig 4b and e and minimum fig 4c and f soil temperatures at 10 cm are presented for 2018 and 2019 the tall stubble produced the greatest maximums and short and mowed the lowest maximums apparent treatment effects on the minimum daily temperatures were very small or nonexistent in 2019 making 2 yr trend comparisons at 10 cm difficult in 2019 the temperature probes included multiple depths and were driven into the soil with little soil or residue disturbance there was substantial variability among replicate plots but when comparing the average temperature over 5 d periods statistically significant differences were found among the short stubble and the medium and tall stubble at several depths fig 5 in mid june the short treatment was significantly cooler than the medium and tall treatments at 3 7 15 and 40 cm depths in mid july the short treatment was significantly cooler than the medium treatment at 7 cm depth and cooler than the tall treatment at 7 15 and 25 cm depth the differences decreased in magnitude over the summer and were not statistically significant by august 4 discussion 4 1 profile soil water soil temperature and seed zone water the effectiveness of tall versus short stubble in trapping drifting snow by reducing surface wind velocity has been documented in several studies for example mcmaster et al 2000 reported a large reduction in soil surface friction velocity when residue height was increased from 5 to 10 cm a smaller reduction when residue height increased from 10 to 30 cm and only a slight reduction when residue height increased from 30 to 50 cm soil temperatures from june to august were coolest at almost all depths in the order of short mowed medium tall figs 4 and 5 clearly the tall residue provided lower albedo or shade for the soil surface daily maximum temperatures appear to be the major treatment difference this indicates that more solar radiation is reaching and being absorbed by the soil surface during the hot part of the day as might be expected when almost all the residue is vertical the resulting increase in average soil temperature means that the increase in absorbed radiation was not compensated by increased heat loss at night this logically leads to soil warming at all depths our measurements indicated that at least the top 25 cm of soil was affected even brief daily periods of direct radiation on consolidated soil might provide energy for increased water flow and evaporation especially after sundown when the soil is warmer than the air pikul et al 1985 the decrease in treatment differences over the temperature measurement period june august might be explained by the decrease in soil water content the gradient in temperature between the 3 and 7 cm depth fig 5 in june is steepest for the tall and medium stubble heights all treatment gradients become steeper with time and the four treatment profiles became similar with time the surface soil water content was not measured repeatedly over time but we know that it decreased between the april and the end of august measurements fig 2 while not statistically significant mowing appears to have influenced soil temperature very quickly after the tall stubble was mowed in mid june before mowing the plots were presumably identical to the tall stubble also note that the influence of treatments on soil temperatures runs deep to a least 40 cm especially in early summer fig 5 cut residue in the short treatment was lying flat on the soil surface where it would have been flattened and compressed by snow and rain during winter even if mowing the tall stubble in the mid june produced equivalent standing stubble height and the same amount of horizontal stubble much of the mowed residues did not lie flat on the soil surface and was not softened and compressed against the soil surface by the action of rain and snow another possible difference between treatments was the amount of bare soil exposed to the impacts of rain and freeze thaw cycles this could affect porosity and subsequent heat and water flow flerchinger et al 2003 the barest soil was in the tall stubble and the least bare soil was in the short stubble water in the seed zone at the end of fallow i e time of ww sowing is critical for stand establishment in the pnw drylands farmers use deep furrow drills to place wheat seed 15 cm or deeper into the soil to reach adequate water for germination and emergence donaldson 1996 lack of adequate seed zone water means that farmers need to delay sowing until the onset of fall rains in mid october or later which results in a 30 40 grain yield decline compared to early sown ww higginbotham et al 2011 essentially no rain occurred in july and august 2018 this being the predominant pattern for the pnw based on data collected over several decades empirical and mechanistic models have been developed in the pnw drylands on available soil water in fallow at the time of planting ww and its relationship with ww grain yield stöckle et al 2003 schillinger et al 2008 karimi et al 2018 these models show that each additional 1 cm of available soil water at the end of fallow above that needed to achieve plant establishment will result in 176 kg ha increase in ww grain yield schillinger et al 2008 4 2 pros and cons of tall stubble for dryland wheat farmers use of a stripper header allows farmers to combine 30 40 greater land area per day compared with a conventional header spokas and steponavicius 2010 because only wheat spikes pass through the combine harvester i e no straw for example with the average ww grain yield of 4570 kg ha in our 4 yr study collaborator derek schafer with a modern john deere s680 john deere co moline il usa combine harvested on average 65 ha day with a 11 m wide stripper header versus 45 ha day with a conventional header of the same width a second important advantage of using a stripper header is a 30 40 reduction in wear to the combine harvester s internal grain separation components due to the huge reduction of volume of material passing through the machine there are four negative aspects of using a stripper header versus a conventional header d schafer personal communication first the tall wheat stubble is very difficult to sow through with a deep furrow drill due to plugging issues schafer dealt with the problem by cutting the stubble into smaller pieces using a heavy summers supercoulter vertical tillage implement https summersmfg com tillage supercoulter for 2 3 operations prior to sowing in contrast ww can be direct sown into medium height stubble i e 25 cm tall without the need for the coulter implement second the repair maintenance costs for operating a stripper header are high the fingers that grab and detach the wheat spikes need to be replaced at a cost of us 7000 after cutting 2000 ha and the labor to replace the fingers requires two people a full 10 hr day to accomplish third collaborator schafer reported that more wheat spikes fell to the ground in front of the stripper header compared to that with a conventional header fourth the tall stubble causes accelerated wear on the underside of combines tractors sprayers and seed drills by rubbing through wiring harnesses and hydraulic hoses 5 conclusions in our study medium and tall stubble had equal overwinter soil precipitation storage efficiency which exceeded that with short stubble there was no advantage to mowing the tall stubble in mid june during the high evaporative demand of summer tall stubble lost significantly more soil water than the short and medium treatments presumably this was at least partially due to higher soil temperatures with tall and medium stubble that lacked flat lying residue along with greater water contents available at the start of the summer season these novel data on wheat stubble height and orientation offer opportunity to improve empirical and mechanistic models on soil water storage and retention during long fallow periods in mediterranean climates our data combined with detailed discussions with farmers in the pnw drylands suggest that the best stubble cutting height is the medium 25 cm treatment as it provides the best overall benefit for soil capture of overwinter precipitation and for retention of stored soil water during the dry summer medium height stubble also allows for direct sowing of ww with deep furrow drills without undue drill plugging problems funding funding was provided by the washington state university usa

9946,a 4 yr study was conducted in a dry mediterranean region of the inland pacific northwest usa pnw to measure winter wheat ww triticum aestivum l stubble height and orientation effects on overwinter precipitation capture in the soil and subsequent water retention during ensuing dry summer months the stubble was left standing and undisturbed during the 13 mo fallow periods stubble height treatments were i short 8 cm ii medium 25 cm and iii tall 75 cm an additional treatment iv mow tall stubble in mid june was included in the final two years soil water measurements were obtained at the beginning middle and end of fallow in 15 cm increments to a depth of 180 cm additionally seed zone water content was measured at the end of fallow in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm near surface soil temperature was measured from june august on average tall and medium height stubble captured 34 and 32 mm p 0 002 more overwinter precipitation respectively than short stubble and these values were particularly pronounced 91 and 79 mm greater than short stubble during a winter of heavy snow drifting however from mid april until late august the tall stubble lost an average of 91 mm of soil water compared to 70 and 59 mm in the medium and short stubble treatments p 0 001 mowing tall stubble in mid june before the hot dry summer did not improved water retention continuous soil temperatures at 3 7 15 25 and 40 cm depths measured electronically from june august were coolest with the short mowed medium and tall stubble respectively with frequent significant differences of 1 c among treatments we speculate that soil in the tall treatment was warmest and lost the most over summer water because all stubble was standing and offered less soil shading than the other treatments at the end of fallow medium and tall stubble averaged 14 and 8 mm greater soil water respectively than the short treatment p 0 027 short stubble was a disadvantage for overwinter precipitation capture but was equal or better than the other treatments for retaining soil water from april to late august presumably because this treatment had the most residue lying flat on the soil surface for shading

preferences evolve over time there is a need for new information on the effects of stubble management options in the past moldboard plow or other tillage practices that left soil bare of crop residue were the standard for comparison no till production is now common enough to be used as a baseline practice in the united states pnw machado et al 2015 and other mediterranean like dryland wheat production regions around the world giller et al 2015 the climate of the pnw is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers with occasional drought cycles about two thirds of annual precipitation occurs from october march with about one third as snow during this period one fourth of the annual precipitation occurs during april june with july september the driest and warmest

the 1890 s on about two million hectares in the low precipitation zone 350 mm and less of average annual precipitation of the pnw kirby et al 2017 on average precipitation storage efficiency in the soil is 65 70 in the winter of the fallow year but storage efficiency is reduced to around 30 by the end of fallow i e at time of ww sowing in late august early september mccall and wanser 1924 schillinger 2016 this stored soil water during fallow allows for timely sowing of ww and reduces the risk of crop failure from drought which enables stable and mostly profitable grain yields stöckle et al 2018 the question of ideal stubble height is largely focused on the potential to trap drifting snow during winter ries and power 1981 and likelihood to reduce evaporation during the dry warm summer the capacity of tall stubble to trap drifting snow is well established black and siddoway 1977 hoefer et al 1981 but the effect on stored soil water is dependent on weather conditions aase and siddoway 1980 black and bauer 1990 for example campbell et al 1992 measured only 3 out of 10 years where tall stubble provided greater overwinter soil water storage these studies were conducted in the great plains region of the northern us and southern canada where snow is the major form of winter precipitation in regions with milder winters blowing snow can be infrequent or represent minor amounts of precipitation in this case evaporation after rainfall events or in the spring become more important the hypothesis that tall stubble can reduce evaporation of stored soil water is complicated to evaluate theoretically the reduction in near surface wind speed and convection under tall versus short or no residue should reduce evaporation from the soil surface aase and siddoway 1980 tall stubble is also generally assumed to shade the soil surface more than short stubble to reflect heat energy horton et al 1996 aase and siddoway 1980 found that tall stubble improved snow capture but could find no direct evidence of less evaporation with standing stubble versus bare soil in their experiment no residue was left lying on the soil between rows cutforth et al 2011 measured enhanced wheat grain yields with increasing stubble maintained during the crop year which they considered an indication of less evaporation and more transpiration with stubble as tall as 45 cm in contrast baumhardt et al 2002 and flerchinger et al 2003 reported that evaporation differences among stubble heights were minor under dry conditions the quantity of surface soil water is a dominant factor in the amount of evaporation in some regions summer rainfall is significant but in mediterranean regions like the pnw the final two to three months of the fallow period are dry and warm and during this period treatments with greater near surface water will evaporate water faster than drier treatments until surface water contents are equal hammel 1996 idso et al 1974 flerchinger et al 2003 reported that standing wheat residue generally warmed soil sooner in the spring compared to flattened residue or bare soil this contradicts the theory that tall stubble provides shade which reduces solar heating bare soils tend to have warmer daytime temperatures but this begins after the soil surface dries and does not necessarily result in greater heat flux downward flerchinger et al 2003 dry surface soil and especially dry residue cover create poor conduction of heat downward and their high surface temperature creates significant radiation back to the atmosphere and conduction convection to the air cutforth and mcconkey 1997 complicating these relatively straightforward concepts on the effects of residue height is the quantity of residue laying horizontal on the soil surface swella et al 2015 in the absence of residue removal the height of residue left standing is inversely related to the amount of residue lying flat on the soil surface the tradeoff between standing residue and flattened surface residue is not easily determined and depends on the proportion of time the soil surface is dry baumhardt et al 2002 flat wheat residue produced the lowest evaporation in several climates but the differences in evaporation due to residue architecture tall vs short and amount flat on the soil were minor about 8 in dry climates flerchinger et al 2003 surface residue provides protection from wind and sun immediately after a precipitation event and this effect can extend for several weeks compared to bare soil wuest and schillinger 2011 in climates with low total precipitation and brief events of low intensity rainfall surface residue needs to be wet through before water reaches the soil surface once rainfall infiltrates into the surface soil the reduction in evaporative loss with surface residue vs bare soil results in a net increase in stored soil water for about a month following the rain event wuest and schillinger 2011 swella et al 2015 wuest 2017 mediterranean climatic regions have extended dry periods where cropland is sometimes left fallow for a year or longer there is often wide year to year variation in precipitation totals and crop residue produced therefore it is especially important to measure residue factors in combination with soil type and weather patterns through the full fallow cycle over several years flerchinger et al 2003 ward et al 2009 the objective of our study was to determine whether maximizing stubble height would improve fallow water storage in a 2 yr winter wheat fallow rotation in the drylands of the pnw 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview a 4 yr field experiment was conducted from 2015 to 2019 on the derek schafer farm near ritzville in east central washington 47 077825 118 522791 the objective was to assess ww stubble height and orientation on overwinter precipitation capture in the soil and subsequent water retention during the dry summer months of 13 month long fallow periods the fallow period began with ww grain harvest in early august and extended until ww planting in late august of the next year the study was conducted on a separate field each year on the schafer farm over the 4 yr period the soil at the experiment site is a ritzville silt loam coarse silty mixed superactive mesic calcidic haploxeroll u s classification system also known as a haplic kastanozems fao unesco 1990 soil is more than 2 m deep with no rocks or restrictive layers and slope at the four sites ranged from 0 to 3 the four field sites were all located within a 4 km radius collaborating farmer schafer sowed a different semidwarf soft white winter wheat cultivar each year these cultivars were xerpha ars crescent otto and nw duet in 2015 2106 2017 and 2018 respectively these cultivars were sown in late august or early september with a custom built deep furrow drill with row spacing of 40 cm sowing rate each year was 55 kg ha excellent plant stands were achieved every year winter wheat grain yield in the fields prior to initiation of each year s experiment was measured by the collaborating farmer with the combine harvester s grain yield monitor as well as a grain elevator weigh scale these grain yields were 1880 5310 5010 and 6080 kg ha for years one to four respectively harvest index hi of semi dwarf ww averages 0 40 in the pnw donaldson et al 2001 and in other rainfed ww production regions of the us great plains and southern australia maeoka et al 2020 mature plant height of the ww cultivars sown ranged from 86 to 91 cm as hi is defined as the percentage of grain in the total above ground plant biomass ww straw production in our experiment was approximately 2600 7400 7000 and 8500 kg ha respectively over the four years a combine harvester equipped with a 11 m wide shelbourne reynolds xcv shelbourne reynolds ip31 2ar suffolk england uk stripper header cutting platform was used to harvest ww grain from fields every year the stripper header tado et al 1998 was equipped with a rotating stripping rotor with eight rows of fingers that strip the grain from the wheat spike leaving nearly the entire plant stem standing and attached to the ground after grain harvest with the stripper header a combine harvester with a 7 m wide conventional cutting platform was used to cut stubble to heights of 8 cm and 25 cm with the cut straw distributed across the width of the cutting platform behind the grain combine thus three stubble height treatments were established i short 8 cm ii medium 25 cm and iii tall 75 cm the experiment was expanded in years 3 and 4 to add a fourth treatment of mowing the 75 cm tall stubble close to the soil surface with a schulte rotary mower schulte industries englefeld sk canada in mid june before the onset of hot and dry weather the mowed treatment was added to determine if flattening the tall stubble before the hot summer months would facilitate soil water retention the experimental design was a randomized complete block with four replications size of individual plots every year was 7 60 m the treatments are visually presented in fig 1 the plots were kept virtually weed free throughout the fallow period by periodic application of glyphosate herbicide as needed the self propelled weed it precision sprayer weed it precision spraying hoge wesselink 8 the netherlands had a 36 m wide boom and was guided by gps so that wheel traffic was always in the same track to ensure that measurement areas within the plots were not disturbed four herbicide applications were required during each 13 mo fallow period 2 2 precipitation measurement computerized tipping bucket precipitation recording devices are commonly used to record precipitation at on farm experimental sites however tipping bucket recorders have been documented to underestimate actual precipitation by as much as 40 and or to stop recording altogether due to various causes sypka 2019 grossi et al 2017 therefore we report accurate and reliable precipitation data manually recorded from two locations near the field sites table 1 location 1 was the wsu lind dryland research station situated 7 km south of the field sites where daily precipitation and other climatic data was officially recorded for the us national weather service location 2 was 8 km ne of the field sites in the town of ritzville where daily precipitation was recorded by the adams conservation district 2 3 soil water measurement 2 3 1 total 180 cm profile measurement soil water was measured to a depth of 180 cm three times during the 13 mo fallow period these times were i in early august immediately after ww harvest ii in mid april and iii at the end of fallow in late august volumetric soil water content in the 0 to 30 cm depth was determined from two 15 cm core samples using gravimetric procedures described by topp and ferre 2002 using known soil bulk density values soil volumetric water content in the 30 180 cm depth was measured in 15 cm increments with an instrotek cpn 503 neutron moisture probe instrotek 1 triangle drive raleigh nc usa using methods defined by hignett and evett 2002 the neutron probe was calibrated and validated for the ritzville silt loam soils at the study sites 2 3 2 seed zone measurement seed zone volumetric water content was measured just prior to ww sowing in late august 2018 and early september 2019 in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm with an incremental soil sampler designed by wuest and schillinger 2008 adequate seed zone water for sowing ww is generally located from 10 to 15 cm below the soil surface this is considered some of the deepest seed placement in the world for sowing wheat donaldson 1996 we designed the incremental sampler to obtain seed zone volumetric water data to a depth of 26 cm as the water potential below the depth of actual seed placement is important for root hydration during seedling emergence and early growth lindstrom et al 1976 2 4 soil temperature measurement soil temperature was measured from mid june to mid to late august in two years as this period has the hottest and driest weather conditions during the fallow cycle and immediately precedes sowing of ww in 2018 campbell 616 temperature probes campbell scientific logan utah usa were placed at 10 cm in all plots these probes contain temperature sensors in the electronics housing near where one of the metal wave guides is attached when placed horizontally they measure soil temperature at that depth readings at hourly intervals were averaged and daily means recorded in 2019 soil temperature profiles were measured at 1 cm depth increments to 25 cm and at 30 35 and 40 cm depths as described by wuest 2013 temperature sensing thermistors were mounted in a glass reinforced plastic shaft that can be installed with very little soil disturbance data were measured at 5 min intervals and recorded as hourly averages soil temperature data were examined for trends attributable to treatments five day average temperatures from the early mid and late time periods were compared among treatments at the 10 cm depth in 2018 and 3 7 15 25 and 40 cm depths in 2019 2 5 statistical analysis analysis of variance anova was conducted for volumetric water content in the 180 cm soil profile all four years seed zone volumetric water content 2018 and 2019 and soil temperature 2018 and 2019 using a randomized complete block design anova for each year and a split plot in time anova across years with treatment as the fixed effect factor and year as the random effect factor tukey s honest significant difference hsd test was used to detect statistical differences in treatment means and control the experiment wise error rate for multiple comparisons all soil water data anova tests were done at the 5 level of significance whereas soil temperature tests were conducted at both the 5 and 10 level of significance the statstix 10 data analysis software analytical software 2105 miller landing rd tallahassee florida usa was used for all anova comparisons 3 results 3 1 precipitation over the 4 yr study fallow year sept 1 aug 31 precipitation at lind ranged from 224 to 376 mm and averaged 308 mm during the same period fallow year precipitation at ritzville ranged from 320 to 439 mm and averaged 377 mm table 1 long term 100 yr average annual precipitation at lind is 244 mm and at ritzville 292 mm therefore only in 2019 was annual precipitation less than normal at lind and all four years were wetter than normal at ritzville table 1 as the study sites were located essentially equidistance between lind and ritzville precipitation values at the sites were likely greater than those at lind and less than at ritzville 3 2 water in 180 cm soil profile 3 2 1 beginning of fallow at time of grain harvest i e beginning of fallow ww in the pnw depletes near surface soil water down to 5 by volume but plant soil water extraction generally diminishes with depth to 10 by volume at 150 cm soil depth schillinger and young 2000 winter wheat extracts water somewhat less efficiently from soil depths 150 cm in all four years most plant available soil water as defined above was depleted from the soil profile by the time of ww grain harvest as indicated by the baseline start of fallow water distribution data shown in solid black circles in fig 2 the one exception was at the start of the 2018 fallow year where 50 mm of available water was present from 150 to 180 cm table 2 fig 2c this likely occurred because the 2018 study site was located in a basin where soil water storage is frequently greater than other landscape positions logically and as expected there were never any within year differences in baseline soil water table 2 as these measurements were obtained immediately after the stubble height treatments were imposed 3 2 2 overwinter soil water recharge statistically significant differences in overwinter soil water recharge were measured in 3 of 4 years table 2 averaged over the 4 years there were no differences between the medium and tall treatments and both were significantly greater p 0 002 than the short stubble table 2 in 2016 the overwinter water gain for the medium treatment was significantly greater than the tall but not compared to the short treatment table 2 treatment differences were minor among treatments likely because baseline residue from the preceding ww crop was sparce 2600 kg ha soil water content among treatments in april at all measurement increments down to 180 cm were almost identical solid colored circles in fig 2a for the 2017 fallow cycle dry straw biomass from the preceding ww crop was 7400 kg ha nearly 3x greater than the previous year the 2017 winter was one of high precipitation with much falling as snow and there was extensive snow drifting there were 77 days of continuous snow cover at lind that set a 101 yr record for that location weaver 2017 the medium and tall stubble treatments were much more effective than the short treatment in trapping drifting snow which was likely the reason the short stubble had 79 and 91 mm less overwinter soil water gain than the medium and tall treatments respectively p 0 001 table 2 the large differences in overwinter water storage among treatments and the spatial distribution of soil water by depth were consistent among treatments these data are clearly illustrated in fig 2 b for the 2018 fallow year residue produced by the previous ww crop was 7000 kg ha only slightly less than residue estimations for the previous year the winter was relatively mild with only a few days with snow covering the ground no frozen soil runoff was observed in any fallowed fields in the region overwinter water recharge into the soil was high and there were no significant differences in overwinter soil water gain among treatments table 2 nor in the spatial water distribution pattern in the soil profile fig 2c the approximate ww straw biomass of 8500 kg ha in 2019 was the greatest for the 4 yr study in the winter there was ample snow cover with high winds that gusted to 65 km h which created substantial snow drifting in february soil water content in mid april was significantly higher p 0 001 in the tall compared to the medium and short treatments table 2 and overwinter soil water gain was tall medium short the enhanced overwinter water gain with tall stubble at soil depths 60 cm is clearly pronounced in fig 2 d water at deeper soil depths especially benefits wheat grain yield during the kernel fill stage of development when available water in upper portions of the profile has been depleted sciarresi et al 2019 flohr et al 2020 precipitation during the 2019 fallow year was the lowest of the four years table 1 averaged over four years overwinter soil water gain was the same for medium and tall stubble table 2 overwinter soil water gain in short stubble was reduced by 30 mm compared to the medium and tall treatments p 0 002 table 2 3 2 3 april through august soil water loss statistically significant differences in water loss from mid april to late august were measured in two years as well as the 4 yr average table 2 there were no differences among treatments in 2016 table 2 presumably because residue levels were so low due to low ww grain yield during the preceding crop year soil profile water distribution at each depth was almost identical among treatments in late august fig 2a in 2017 following a winter of heavy snow drifting highly significant differences of over summer water loss occurred in the order of tall medium short treatments p 0 001 table 2 overwinter water storage in the short stubble was comparatively low see section 3 2 2 thus there was considerably less water to be lost although mid april water content in the medium and tall stubble were the same april to august loss for these treatments was 80 and 127 mm respectively table 2 despite the huge overwinter water storage advantage of tall vs short stubble end of fallow water content was the same table 2 fig 2b conversely the medium treatment had 25 mm more water retained by late august than the short and tall stubble which can be clearly visualized in the 50 180 cm depth in fig 2 b like the mid april 2018 water data there were also no differences among treatments in late august including from the mowed treatment as described in section 2 1 and shown in fig 1c that was imposed for the first time in mid june table 2 there was very little temporal variation in profile water distribution among treatments in mid april and late august fig 2c in 2019 highly significant differences p 0 005 in soil profile water were recorded in late august in the order of tall mowed medium short although the tall stubble was the only treatment significantly different than the short stubble table 2 there were no significant late august differences among the tall medium and mowed treatments averaged over the four years there were few differences in late august soil water content among the tall medium and short treatments although the medium stubble was significantly greater than the short stubble p 0 027 table 2 although the tall and medium stubble stored the most overwinter precipitation they also lost more water than the short stubble during the summer there was no water retention advantage in mowing the tall stubble in mid june prior to the onset of hot summer temperatures in 2018 and 2019 3 3 seed zone water at time of sowing in late august during july and august 2018 only minor traces of rain occurred table 1 july and august are historically the hottest and the driest months in the pnw karimi et al 2018 thus 2018 is considered typical the distribution of seed zone volumetric soil water in 2 cm increments to a depth of 26 cm among treatments in late august is presented in fig 3 a these data show that the short and the mowed treatments trended highest from the 9 to 17 cm depth the medium stubble was deficient in water from the 5 cm near surface to 17 cm fig 3a the tall treatment was especially dry in the lower seed zone increments in 2019 considerable and unusual rain occurred in july and august table 1 these rains negated any differences in seed zone volumetric soil water among treatments fig 3b 3 4 soil temperature from june to august in 2018 and 2019 the 10 cm average daily soil temperatures following the mid june mowing treatment are shown for 2018 fig 4a and 2019 fig 4d when time segments of several days were averaged and compared for 2018 there were no significant differences among treatments this was due to high variation between replicates in 2018 however the temperature means trended similarly to 2019 with short and mowed treatments averaging about 1 c cooler than the medium and tall stubble during the first half of the measurement period fig 4 daily maximum fig 4b and e and minimum fig 4c and f soil temperatures at 10 cm are presented for 2018 and 2019 the tall stubble produced the greatest maximums and short and mowed the lowest maximums apparent treatment effects on the minimum daily temperatures were very small or nonexistent in 2019 making 2 yr trend comparisons at 10 cm difficult in 2019 the temperature probes included multiple depths and were driven into the soil with little soil or residue disturbance there was substantial variability among replicate plots but when comparing the average temperature over 5 d periods statistically significant differences were found among the short stubble and the medium and tall stubble at several depths fig 5 in mid june the short treatment was significantly cooler than the medium and tall treatments at 3 7 15 and 40 cm depths in mid july the short treatment was significantly cooler than the medium treatment at 7 cm depth and cooler than the tall treatment at 7 15 and 25 cm depth the differences decreased in magnitude over the summer and were not statistically significant by august 4 discussion 4 1 profile soil water soil temperature and seed zone water the effectiveness of tall versus short stubble in trapping drifting snow by reducing surface wind velocity has been documented in several studies for example mcmaster et al 2000 reported a large reduction in soil surface friction velocity when residue height was increased from 5 to 10 cm a smaller reduction when residue height increased from 10 to 30 cm and only a slight reduction when residue height increased from 30 to 50 cm soil temperatures from june to august were coolest at almost all depths in the order of short mowed medium tall figs 4 and 5 clearly the tall residue provided lower albedo or shade for the soil surface daily maximum temperatures appear to be the major treatment difference this indicates that more solar radiation is reaching and being absorbed by the soil surface during the hot part of the day as might be expected when almost all the residue is vertical the resulting increase in average soil temperature means that the increase in absorbed radiation was not compensated by increased heat loss at night this logically leads to soil warming at all depths our measurements indicated that at least the top 25 cm of soil was affected even brief daily periods of direct radiation on consolidated soil might provide energy for increased water flow and evaporation especially after sundown when the soil is warmer than the air pikul et al 1985 the decrease in treatment differences over the temperature measurement period june august might be explained by the decrease in soil water content the gradient in temperature between the 3 and 7 cm depth fig 5 in june is steepest for the tall and medium stubble heights all treatment gradients become steeper with time and the four treatment profiles became similar with time the surface soil water content was not measured repeatedly over time but we know that it decreased between the april and the end of august measurements fig 2 while not statistically significant mowing appears to have influenced soil temperature very quickly after the tall stubble was mowed in mid june before mowing the plots were presumably identical to the tall stubble also note that the influence of treatments on soil temperatures runs deep to a least 40 cm especially in early summer fig 5 cut residue in the short treatment was lying flat on the soil surface where it would have been flattened and compressed by snow and rain during winter even if mowing the tall stubble in the mid june produced equivalent standing stubble height and the same amount of horizontal stubble much of the mowed residues did not lie flat on the soil surface and was not softened and compressed against the soil surface by the action of rain and snow another possible difference between treatments was the amount of bare soil exposed to the impacts of rain and freeze thaw cycles this could affect porosity and subsequent heat and water flow flerchinger et al 2003 the barest soil was in the tall stubble and the least bare soil was in the short stubble water in the seed zone at the end of fallow i e time of ww sowing is critical for stand establishment in the pnw drylands farmers use deep furrow drills to place wheat seed 15 cm or deeper into the soil to reach adequate water for germination and emergence donaldson 1996 lack of adequate seed zone water means that farmers need to delay sowing until the onset of fall rains in mid october or later which results in a 30 40 grain yield decline compared to early sown ww higginbotham et al 2011 essentially no rain occurred in july and august 2018 this being the predominant pattern for the pnw based on data collected over several decades empirical and mechanistic models have been developed in the pnw drylands on available soil water in fallow at the time of planting ww and its relationship with ww grain yield stöckle et al 2003 schillinger et al 2008 karimi et al 2018 these models show that each additional 1 cm of available soil water at the end of fallow above that needed to achieve plant establishment will result in 176 kg ha increase in ww grain yield schillinger et al 2008 4 2 pros and cons of tall stubble for dryland wheat farmers use of a stripper header allows farmers to combine 30 40 greater land area per day compared with a conventional header spokas and steponavicius 2010 because only wheat spikes pass through the combine harvester i e no straw for example with the average ww grain yield of 4570 kg ha in our 4 yr study collaborator derek schafer with a modern john deere s680 john deere co moline il usa combine harvested on average 65 ha day with a 11 m wide stripper header versus 45 ha day with a conventional header of the same width a second important advantage of using a stripper header is a 30 40 reduction in wear to the combine harvester s internal grain separation components due to the huge reduction of volume of material passing through the machine there are four negative aspects of using a stripper header versus a conventional header d schafer personal communication first the tall wheat stubble is very difficult to sow through with a deep furrow drill due to plugging issues schafer dealt with the problem by cutting the stubble into smaller pieces using a heavy summers supercoulter vertical tillage implement https summersmfg com tillage supercoulter for 2 3 operations prior to sowing in contrast ww can be direct sown into medium height stubble i e 25 cm tall without the need for the coulter implement second the repair maintenance costs for operating a stripper header are high the fingers that grab and detach the wheat spikes need to be replaced at a cost of us 7000 after cutting 2000 ha and the labor to replace the fingers requires two people a full 10 hr day to accomplish third collaborator schafer reported that more wheat spikes fell to the ground in front of the stripper header compared to that with a conventional header fourth the tall stubble causes accelerated wear on the underside of combines tractors sprayers and seed drills by rubbing through wiring harnesses and hydraulic hoses 5 conclusions in our study medium and tall stubble had equal overwinter soil precipitation storage efficiency which exceeded that with short stubble there was no advantage to mowing the tall stubble in mid june during the high evaporative demand of summer tall stubble lost significantly more soil water than the short and medium treatments presumably this was at least partially due to higher soil temperatures with tall and medium stubble that lacked flat lying residue along with greater water contents available at the start of the summer season these novel data on wheat stubble height and orientation offer opportunity to improve empirical and mechanistic models on soil water storage and retention during long fallow periods in mediterranean climates our data combined with detailed discussions with farmers in the pnw drylands suggest that the best stubble cutting height is the medium 25 cm treatment as it provides the best overall benefit for soil capture of overwinter precipitation and for retention of stored soil water during the dry summer medium height stubble also allows for direct sowing of ww with deep furrow drills without undue drill plugging problems funding funding was provided by the washington state university usa

9947,kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states in the united states where agricultural irrigation is a primary user of underground and surface water because of low precipitation and declining groundwater levels in western and central kansas sustainable management of irrigation water resources is a critical issue in the agricultural productivity of the state the objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of kansas using satellite observations meteorological data and in situ irrigation water use records we used actual evapotranspiration eta precipitation soil moisture and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for kansas in 2015 at scales of counties climatic divisions and groundwater management districts gmd the operational simplified surface energy balance model was implemented to estimate 30 m resolution eta results showed that the seasonal may september precipitation soil water storage change and eta are 528 mm 80 mm and 555 mm respectively on average of all croplands in the state the annual net irrigation water consumption was 293 mm for irrigated croplands indicating that irrigation water constitutes an substantial portion of the water supply in the state the total volumetric irrigation water use was 3 24 km3 for all croplands within five gmds in western and south central kansas while only 0 38 km3 was outside of gmds the multiple regression models of eta against precipitation and irrigation water use were statistically significant with r 2 values of 0 71 and 0 87 respectively at county and climate division scales regression models also indicated a higher rate of eta response to irrigation water use than that to precipitation our study demonstrated the spatial patterns of crop water use and water balance in kansas which could provide useful information for management of irrigation agriculture and water resources for the state keywords evapotranspiration irrigation water use landsat data soil water storage ssebop model water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest land use in kansas accounting for 88 of the land area in the state irrigation within the agriculture sector makes important contributions to the total economy of kansas according to the 2017 census of agriculture there are 9974 km2 of harvested irrigated croplands including corn wheat alfalfa soybeans and multiple crops representing 11 of all harvested croplands in the state usda national agricultural statistics service 2019a irrigation is also responsible for the largest water use in kansas accounting for 84 of non domestic consumptive use kansas department of agriculture 2018 because of the generally dry climate in western and central kansas where average annual rainfall is normally less than 500 mm irrigation practices compensate for the lack of precipitation in 2017 the prevalent irrigation systems are center pivots with drop nozzles and center pivots that account for 82 3 and 10 0 respectively of all irrigation systems kansas department of agriculture 2018 the history of irrigated agriculture in kansas can trace back to the 1880s but it expanded rapidly after 1945 peaked at over 12 000 km2 in the 1970s and remained relatively stable afterward rogers and lamm 2012 rogers and aguilar 2017 the high plains aquifer is the major source of irrigation water in kansas most irrigation points of diversion are located within the extent of the aquifer that underlies much of the area in western and south central kansas kenny and juracek 2013 perry 2006 however water levels of the high plains aquifer have declined steadily over the past several decades because the mean annual water withdrawals exceeds the recharge kenny and juracek 2013 mcguire 2017 scanlon et al 2012 rudnick et al 2019 evett et al 2020 scanlon et al 2012 estimated a depletion of about 4 m on average for the entire high plains aquifer and about 7 m in the central and southern aquifer much area of kansas and texas since the 1950s it is documented that although acreage of irrigated lands in kansas remained consistent since the late 1980s irrigation water diversions varied substantially depending on climatic fluctuations perry 2006 kenny and juracek 2013 rogers and aguilar 2017 kansas department of agriculture 2018 rogers and aguilar 2017 reported a small reduction in amount of pumping water from 1989 to 2014 due to the conversion of flood irrigation to center pivot system improvement of irrigation efficiency and continuing decline of underground water tables in kansas especially in western and central regions there is a contradiction between high demand of irrigation water use and depletion of the high plains aquifer groundwater the decline of the aquifer groundwater table has been a serious concern to farmers and local governments as crop production is heavily dependent on the water source sophocleous 2005 new irrigation strategies and technologies have been developed and promoted over the last two decades to conserve and protect limited water resources while maintaining agricultural economic profits kenny and juracek 2013 araya et al 2017 rogers and aguilar 2017 kansas department of agriculture 2018 the census of irrigation reported that the areas of micro irrigation systems and sprinkler systems increased by 48 7 and 1 2 respectively while the area of gravity systems decreased by 76 2 from 2003 to 2018 in kansas usda national agricultural statistics service 2004 2019b therefore estimation and evaluation of the water use and water balance in kansas croplands provide important information for understanding the relationships between water resources such as rainfall soil moisture streams and aquifers and irrigation practices such as irrigation acreage irrigation systems and technologies crop types and water use policies evapotranspiration et is a key component in the hydrological cycle and balance measurement and estimation of

investigation of agricultural water use becomes an important research subject by integrating with climate data and irrigation water use data satellite based et estimation provides an efficient tool for analyzing water use status and dynamics and therefore useful information for irrigation water resource management in kansas the objective of the study was to evaluate the irrigation water use and water balance for croplands in kansas using et and meteorological data specifically our goals were 1 estimating water use amount for cropland irrigation in all counties and climatic regions 2 evaluating water balance using precipitation water use and et data and 3 exploring how et responds spatially to precipitation and irrigation water use our primary interest in this study was on the spatial pattern of the agricultural water use and water balance across kansas focusing on the comparison between irrigated and rainfed croplands in different climatic regions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the state of kansas lies amid the flatlands of the southern northern great plains featured by eastward slopes from 1232 m to 207 m in elevation according to the national land cover database

1981 2010 normals derived from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism https prism oregonstate edu normals statewide annual total precipitation is 732 mm ranging from more than 1010 mm in the southeastern part of the state to less than 40 mm in the southwest statewide annual mean temperature is 12 5 c but follows an east west gradient ranging from around 11 c around the northwestern corner of the state to less than 15 c near the southeast border in this study we used the climate division cd and the kansas groundwater management district gmd zones to examine and summarize the regional variations of agricultural water use and water balance in kansas the cds are used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc for near real time climate monitoring long term climate change assessments and statistical climate predictions guttman and quayle 1996 kansas comprises nine cds northwest 1 north central 2 northeast 3 west central 4 central 5 east central 6 southwest 7 south central 8 and southeast 9 fig 1c five gmds were created in the 1970s for the western and central parts of the state where the primary use of groundwater is agricultural irrigation governed by local boards the districts are instrumental in providing information and identifying research and regulatory needs within their boundaries perry 2006 the five gmds are named as gmd 1 western kansas gmd 2 equus beds gmd 3 southwest kansas gmd 4 northwest kansas and gmd 5 big bend fig 1d 2 2 water use data the water information management and analysis system wimas program administered by the kansas department of agriculture division of water resources kda dwr provides a geographic information system based application that allows users to query kansas water right information wilson et al 2005 we acquired the irrigation water use data through the open record request from the kansas department of agriculture https agriculture ks gov document services open records request the requested geodatabase contains several shapefiles and tables as listed below 1 point shapefile point of diversion pod with attributes of coordinate water right identification source of water supply surface water or groundwater use made of water limited to irrigation in this study and county name etc a pod is a location from which water is obtained for a place of use pou by the water right holder surface water is usually diverted by means of a dam canal or pump groundwater is usually abstracted by means of a well water right is the real property

reprojected from original geographic coordinates to the albers conical equal area acea projection for this study we only used the kansas irrigation water data for the year 2015 according to the wimas geodatabase there were 22 509 active pods across kansas in 2015 including 20 507 groundwater pods and 2002 surface water pods and 249 834 quarter quarters of pous equivalent to a total area of 40 442 km2 most pods and pous are distributed in the western and south central kansas underlain by the high plains aquifer the five gmds encompass the croplands with a high density of pods and a large area of pous fig 2 2 3 ssebop eta data in this study the eta dataset was generated using the ssebop model that integrates landsat thermal data and model assimilated weather data the eta in ssebop is calculated by 1 eta etf k etr where eta is the actual et mm etf is the et fraction etr is alfalfa reference et mm and k 0 85 is the bias correction coefficient to adjust the gridded etr in relation to station based etr bawa et al 2020 here etf is computed from 2 etf 1 γ s ts tc where γ s is the surface psychrometric constant ts is lst and tc is the cold wetlimiting surface temperature derived from 3 tc c ta where c is the correction coefficient c factor and ta is the daily maximum air temperature the procedure of the ssebop eta production is described in detail in senay et al 2013 2016 2017 and senay 2018 in the ssebop computation lst was derived from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 thermal infrared bands using emissivity parameterized with the normalized difference vegetation index parameter ta was derived from daymet developed at oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center https daymet ornl gov daymet is a gridded product based on daily meteorological observations used to produce daily weather parameters at 1 km resolution covering north america from 1980 to present thornton et al 2018 but daily climatology ta 1980 2018 was used in this study etr was derived from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet developed by the university of idaho http www climatologylab org gridmet html abatzoglou 2013 gridmet is a gridded dataset of daily surface meteorological variables at 4 km resolution covering the conterminous united states from 1979 to present although daily climatology etr 1980 2017 was used here we implemented the ssebop model in the google earth engine gee processing environment for generating the 2015 growing season may to september eta in kansas the gee python api utilized cloud based data collection and computing routines for the eta modeling procedures including satellite and weather data handling per image modeling operations and time integrated outputs the final eta dataset was resampled to a 30 m resolution image in the acea projection we validated the ssebop eta estimates in kansas using eddy covariance measurements available from two ameriflux sites for the year 2015 1 kansas field station site id us kfs coordinate 39 3 21 96 n 95 11 26 52 w vegetation cover grasslands 2 kansas land institute site id us kls coordinate 38 46 28 2 n 97 34 6 24 w vegetation cover grasslands fig 1 we downloaded and processed the eddy covariance data https ameriflux lbl gov then compared the monthly eta estimated from the eddy covariance measurements with the eta derived from the ssebop model for the ssebop eta we used the mean value of 3 3 pixels centered at the flux tower location roughly equivalent to a 45 m radius to account for the differing fetch area of the tower 2 4 precipitation data one of the variables we used to calculate water balance is the monthly gridded precipitation derived from prism daly et al 2008 the prism product includes a suite of timeseries 2 5 or 4 km and long term normal 30 or 800 m products of meteorological variables we downloaded the an81m monthly precipitation product 2 5 for the year 2015 from the prism climate group website http www prism oregonstate edu the monthly precipitation from may to september was used to calculate seasonal total precipitation additionally 30 year 1981 2010 normals of precipitation and temperature at 30 norm81m were obtained to compute the regional climatology at pixel scale all prism datasets used in the study were subset to kansas area and remapped from original geographic coordinates to the acea projection 2 5 soil moisture data we obtained soil moisture data from the soil climate analysis network scan the scan system administered by the national water and climate center is a soil climate monitoring program consisting of automated data collection sites across the united states www wcc nrcs usda gov scan the scan system contains over 200 stations focusing on agricultural areas of the united states a typical scan site monitors soil moisture content hourly at several depths 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 1 m where possible using dielectric constant measuring devices with reported precision of 0 5 https www wcc nrcs usda gov about mon scan html there are four scan stations in kansas and all of them have daily soil moisture data since 2004 abrams centralia lake and phillipsburg or 2008 ku nesa fig 2 table 1 because centralia lake station is close to a lake and the soil is saturated with water about 40 at all depths 20 cm consistently over a year period the station was not included in this study 2 6 cropland data layer data the cdl created by the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service nass provides annual crop specific land cover raster data at 30 m resolution for the united states boryan et al 2011 the 2015 cdl was produced using satellite imagery from landsat 8 sensors disaster monitoring constellation dmc deimos 1 and dmc 2 sensors supplementary data sources and agricultural ground truth we acquired the 2015 cdl data with acea projection through cropscape https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape and clipped the data to the map extent of kansas fig 1b the 2015 kansas cdl data consist of 61 crop types including food crops cereals vegetables and fruits oilseed crops and feed crops our study focuses on seven major crops planted in large area i e corn sorghum soybeans winter wheat alfalfa hay double crops and fallow idle cropland and combines all other minor crops into other crops fig 1b 3 methods 3 1 processing of water use data to retrieve irrigation water use information we compiled and processed the wimas geodatabase files though the following procedure 1 we built the relationships between pods and pous through the look up key of water rights the basic land parcel of a pou is the plss quarter quarter section that has water right to legally obtain irrigation water from associated pods a pou consists of one or more quarter quarter sections under one water right in most circumstances 83 3 a pou is a section about 640 acres or 2 59 km2 that includes 16 quarter quarter sections while other pous are either smaller or larger than a section the relationship between pods and pous is normally many to many that is a single pou may have multiple water rights to obtain water from multiple pods 2 the water use table contains the attribute af used acre feet of water used for irrigation in a year for all water rights the af used is calculated from attribute meter quant metered quantity of water used for irrigation in the year for each pou we calculated total volume of used irrigation water obtained from corresponding pods in the year in the analysis we summed the water volume used in the croplands for each county cd and gmd the af used was converted to cubic meter m3 or cubic kilometer km3 in si unit 3 the data records from the wimas geodatabase may contain inherent uncertainties possibly resulting from type error data model structure or method of data collection wilson et al 2005 to prevent influences of possible erroneous records on the data analysis we performed a quality control procedure on the records any abnormal data values were flagged and examined such as extremely high af used values large area of pous and long distance from pod to pou we found unrealistic large values for the distance between a pod and corresponding pous because we lacked enough evidences to verify the erroneous values from the geodatabase we used two standard deviation threshold to remove records of extremely long pod to pou distances specifically we calculated mean standard deviation of the pod to pou distances for all 22 509 active pods as a result 42 records with the distance value greater than mean plus 2 standard deviations were treated as false records and excluded from analysis 3 2 calculation of water balance we used a simple water balance equation to express the seasonal water use and water balance for the croplands of kansas 4 wb ppt irr eta δsm where wb is water balance ppt is seasonal total precipitation may to september irr is amount of annual irrigation water eta is seasonal total actual et and δsm is the change in soil moisture or soil moisture difference between the end and the start of the growing season the water balance equation does not include the surface runoff component which tends to be relatively small over irrigated areas thus a positive wb could indicate runoff generation potential the water balance equation was calculated using metrics of water depth mm or water volume km3 at a region level e g county cd gmd or state as abovementioned we calculated the seasonal total eta in mm based on the ssebop model and seasonal total precipitation in mm based on the prism product for 2015 from the eta and precipitation data we estimated seasonal eta depth and precipitation depth only for the croplands based on the cdl map fig 1b the volumetric eta km3 was calculated as multiplying the eta depth mm by the area km2 of all croplands in a region likewise the volumetric precipitation km3 was calculated as multiplying precipitation depth by the area of all croplands in a region the amount of irrigation water was directly calculated from the wimas geodatabase for each county we summed the total amount of irrigation water used in all pous within a county and aggregated to a larger region i e cd gmd and state for 2015 additionally we divided the irrigation water volume by the cdl derived cropland area to obtain the irrigation water depth in millimeter for a region because high resolution gridded soil moisture data are not available for the study area we used the soil moisture data 2005 2019 measured from the scan stations to estimate the δsm item in the water balance equation eq 4 for each of the three scan sites i e abrams ku nesa and phillipsburg we used the average value of the soil moisture measurements at depths of 20 cm and 50 cm to represent water content of the soil layer we calculated 10 day average soil moisture based on the daily soil moisture records from 2005 to 2019 and then calculated a 15 year average of the 10 day soil moisture at each site finally the change of soil moisture was derived as 5 δsm sm t2 sm t1 where sm t1 and sm t2 are the soil moisture measured at the beginning and end of the season respectively specifically we used the 10 day soil moistures from the last 10 days of april and the last 10 days of september to represent sm t1 and sm t2 respectively as a result the mean δsm value of the three scan stations is 8 that is soil moisture at the end of season is 8 less than that at the beginning of the season as an average of the three scan stations the soil layer including topsoil and subsoil is about 0 8 1 8 m thick in kansas usda national agricultural statistics service 2006 if we take crop rooting depth into consideration which is about 1 m for most crops including corn soybeans sorghum and wheat we can roughly estimate δsm in depth mm in this case 8 of soil moisture is equivalent to 80 mm of water stored in 1 m thick soil layer we estimated δsm 80 mm in eq 4 namely water storage reduces for 80 mm in soil layer from the beginning to the end of the growing season when the water balance eq 4 is calculated for the quantities in volume the volumetric δsm km3 is calculated by multiplying δsm depth 80 mm by the area of all croplands in a region in kansas the peak months for soil moisture are march april and may while the lowest moisture occurs in july august and september based on the monthly soil moisture averaged from 15 year 2005 2019 records mean value of soil moisture at depths of 20 cm and 50 cm at the three scan sites fig 3 comparing to that the monthly precipitation using the prism 30 year normal 1981 2010 indicates the peak months for precipitation are may and june fig 3 but the highest et process occurs in june to august based on the 30 year 1981 2010 reference et normal derived from gridmet fig 3 therefore soil water in kansas is recharged from snowmelt water and rainfall in spring and is utilized through et processes in early summer through early autumn due to high temperature strong solar radiation and intensive vegetation growth 3 3 statistical analysis of eta precipitation and irrigation water use to quantify and understand the responses of eta to precipitation and irrigation water use we performed regression analyses for the variables the linear and nonlinear regression models were developed for eta ppt and irr measured in depth as shown in table 2 in all regression models we set eta as the response variable and ppt irr or ppt irr as the predictor variable we used two sets of samples separately in the regression analyses ppt irr and eta depth at county level table 2a and at cd level table 2b each sample is the spatial mean values of eta ppt and irr depths of all croplands within a county or cd models 1 6 are the univariate regressions of eta vs ppt irr or ppt irr to achieve the best fitting model we applied both linear and nonlinear regressions to the data the nonlinear models include the quadratic model and the exponential growth model model 7 is the multiple linear regression of eta vs ppt and irr for the linear univariate linear bivariate and quadratic models the regression coefficients were estimated using the ordinary least square method the gauss newton method was applied to estimate the regression coefficients in the exponential model we used the f test coefficient of determination r 2 or pseudo r 2 for exponential model and root mean square error rmse to evaluate the goodness of fit of the regression models and to assess the sensitivity of crop water consumption to water availability the procedure for analyzing and assessing the water balance and the relationships between cropland water input and water consumption is summarized as a flowchart shown in fig 4 4 results 4 1 validation of ssebop eta estimation validation of the ssebop eta was performed using the covariance measurements obtained from two ameriflux sites the comparisons between the two datasets are shown in the timeseries plots and scatter plots fig 5 at the two sites the monthly ssebop eta and the eddy covariance eta agree well in magnitude and seasonal pattern in the timeseries plots fig 5 the results of the statistical comparisons are 1 us kfs r 2 0 930 bias 5 5 mm rmse 18 9 mm and 2 us kls r 2 0 870 bias 5 7 mm rmse 20 3 mm the ssebop eta overestimates the flux tower eta in the peak growing season at both towers after investigation we found that the overestimation at the us kfs site was a result of the choice of etr dataset that introduced a bias for that location for the us kls site the overestimation in july is due to cloud contamination in the ssebop et fraction because the failure of the landsat quality assurance band for masking cloud shadows created artificially low lst however despite these uncertainties the ssebop eta still performs reasonably well with the flux tower eta at the monthly scale when we compared the seasonal may september eta between ssebop and flux towers we found that the us kfs site has rmse of 23 5 mm and bias of 16 0 mm ssebop eta 133 1 mm flux tower 117 1 mm and us kls site has rmse of 30 5 mm and bias of 14 4 mm ssebop eta 129 1 mm flux tower 114 7 mm as a result the validation of the ssebop eta estimations at seasonal scale at the two flux tower sites indicates a satisfactory accuracy the landsat based ssebop eta products have been validated in various ecosystems using eddy covariance flux data from the ameriflux network e g singh et al 2014 bhattarai et al 2016 senay et al 2016 singh and senay 2016 senay et al 2019 velpuri et al 2020 in the colorado river basin validation of monthly ssebop eta estimates at two flux towers showed good accuracy with r 2 of 0 85 0 9 bias of 9 7 0 6 mm and rmse of 7 8 13 0 mm senay et al 2016 here bias is the difference between mean of estimations ssebop eta and mean of observations eddy covariance measurements senay et al 2019 compared monthly ssebop eta timeseries from 1986 to 2015 to eddy covariance measurements at six ameriflux stations located at forest shrubland and grassland sites in the upper rio grande basin and observed averaged r 2 of 0 85 bias of 0 55 mm and rmse of 11 7 mm evaluation of ssebop eta 2008 2009 at monthly scale for the upper klamath lake basin in southern oregon using eddy covariance data from two ameriflux flux towers indicated a high agreement r 2 0 92 0 93 bias 11 15 mm and rmse 21 22 mm velpuri et al 2020 although all those validations of ssebop model found a certain level of uncertainties in the eta estimates due to various reasons reasonable accuracies of the eta estimations have been achieved senay et al 2016 senay et al 2019 velpuri et al 2020 4 2 water balance depth in the croplands of kansas we calculated the water balance for all kansas counties in 2015 using seasonal may september precipitation seasonal eta irrigation water use and soil moisture data fig 6 shows the maps of ppt irr eta and wb measured by water depth in all croplands of 105 counties in 2015 ppt is 572 mm on average in the state but it ranges from 324 mm to 890 mm showing a gradient from the west to the east fig 6a higher ppt 600 mm occurs in eastern kansas and lower ppt 600 mm is in western kansas ppt in the southwest 440 570 mm is slightly higher than the northwest 340 440 mm irr ranges from 0 mm to 228 mm with a mean of 28 mm for the entire state higher irr 20 mm appears in the counties of the western and south central regions i e cds 1 4 7 and 8 while lower irr occurs in most counties in the eastern and north central regions fig 6b basically the counties with higher irr 47 132 mm occur mainly within the five gmds that enclose a large area of pods and pous fig 2 among the five districts gmds 3 4 and 5 have relatively high irr than the other two gmds irr is very low 5 mm on average in the regions outside of gmds ppt irr has a mean value of 600 mm ranging from 338 mm to 896 mm across the state fig 6c which displays the similar pattern as ppt fig 6a however when adding irr into ppt the total water input increases slightly in the western and south central regions cds 4 7 and 8 fig 6c the map of seasonal eta indicates higher values in the east and south i e cds 3 6 7 8 and 9 than other areas fig 6d the eta value of all counties is 568 mm on average varying from 426 mm to 715 mm but the general pattern of eta over the state is similar to ppt irr wb shows an overall positive balance in the state with a mean value of 112 mm ranging from 89 mm to 351 mm fig 6e in general wb is higher in the east and southeast several counties indicating negative water balance are mainly in the northwest cds 1 2 4 and 5 due to overestimation of eta or underestimation of ppt and or irr it is noticed that the counties with more irrigated lands outlined by gmds show slightly higher wb than their nearby counties our analysis of water balance eq 4 does not include the runoff component due to lack of county level or gridded streamflow data however if we neglect other unknown components in the water balance equation wb can roughly account for runoff for all croplands in the 2015 growing season our estimation of wb is 91 mm on average based on the runoff data from the us geological survey 2020 the annual average runoff streamflow per unit area in kansas for the 2015 water year from 1 october 2014 30 september 2015 is 81 4 mm the state level runoff is calculated as weighted average of hydrologic unit code level 2 huc2 and generated by combining flow data collected at streamgages the drainage basins of the streamgages and the boundaries of the hucs us geological survey 2020 this state level runoff record is close to our estimation of runoff using the water balance method although the timescales water year vs growing season are different the cropland water balance measured in depth is summarized by cds and gmds shown in the bar charts fig 7 over the nine cds ppt is higher 699 730 mm in the three eastern cds and lower in the three western cds 375 506 mm irr is the highest in cd 7 109 mm followed by cd 8 48 mm cd 1 41 mm and cd 4 19 mm three cds in the east have the lowest irr 3 mm because of few pods and pous in the area wb is higher 189 197 mm in the three cds of eastern kansas than other cds 5 109 mm which causes more runoff in the east comparison among five gmds demonstrates that all gmds have similar ppt 369 573 mm though gmd 4 in the northwest is slightly lower 369 mm although irr is high 47 132 mm in all gmds the highest irr amount occurs in gmd 3 132 mm and gmd 5 97 mm wb is higher 58 117 mm in the gmds 1 2 3 and 5 but lower 14 mm in gmd 4 located in the dry northwestern region fig 7 it should be noted that the water balance depth in the analysis was calculated for all croplands including irrigated and rainfed croplands within a county cd or gmd due to the lack of high resolution irrigation raster data for 2015 we were not able to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed croplands at the pixel scale if the water balance could be calculated based on only irrigated croplands irr would be much greater than the average value of irrigated and rainfed croplands likewise eta would be higher in the irrigated croplands than other lands at the state scale the total irrigated area in 2017 was 12 377 km2 as reported by kansas department of agriculture 2018 the total irr volume in kansas was calculated as 3 63 km3 described in section 4 3 that was equivalent to irr depth of 293 mm in irrigated croplands 3 62 km3 divided by 12 377 km2 thus the irr accounts for a substantial water depth 53 of the eta 555 mm on average in the irrigated croplands of the state 4 3 water balance volume in the croplands of kansas the maps of volumetric precipitation irrigation water amount eta and water balance in 2015 are shown in fig 8 the regional summaries of these variables by cd and gmd are shown in the bar charts fig 9 because the volumetric measurement of water amount is proportional to the area of the croplands in a county patterns of the volumetric ppt irr and eta are different from their corresponding water depth measurements figs 6 and 7 the total irr used in the croplands of the state is 3 62 km3 2 94 million acre feet but it is relatively high in cds 1 7 and 8 where irrigation agriculture is intense and common figs 7b and 8 the total volumetric ppt and eta are 50 9 km3 41 3 million acre feet and 53 4 km3 43 3 million acre feet respectively in the state but they are lower in east especially in cds 6 and 9 due to fewer croplands figs 7a c and 8 of the five gmds gmd 3 has the highest volumetric ppt irr and eta followed by gmds 4 and 5 because of larger cropland area in the districts fig 9c the total volumetric irr is 3 24 km3 2 6 million acre feet within five gmds while only 0 38 km3 0 31 million acre feet outside of gmds 4 4 statistical relationships between precipitation irrigation water and eta responses of eta to precipitation and irrigation water can be quantified using linear and nonlinear regression models table 2 we performed the regression analyses separately using two sets of samples 105 counties table 2a and 9 cds table 2b for the samples of counties the linear regression of eta vs ppt model 1 shows a significant positive relationship fig 10a table 2a the regression slope b is 0 318 implying that the rate of eta change is much lower than that of ppt that is one unit increase in eta corresponds to almost three times of increase in ppt the exponential growth model of eta against ppt model 2 indicates a slightly better goodness of it than the linear model fig 10a table 2a the exponential model shows that the rate of eta change increases gradually with the increasing ppt obviously response of eta to ppt is faster in the drier regions ppt 600 mm than the wetter regions ppt 600 mm for the relationship between eta and irr the linear regression model model 3 is marginally insignificant p value 0 0503 fig 10b table 2a however the relationship can be fit significantly p value 0 0001 by using a quadratic model model 4 the quadratic function shows a u shaped parabola curve with low eta values around irr of 50 65 mm the slope of quadratic function is negative at region of irr 50 mm flattened between 50 and 65 mm and positive over irr 65 mm in the counties where rainfall is abundant ppt is the dominant water source in the agriculture of the state in these regions irr decreases where ppt increases while ppt is positively correlated to eta therefore the negative correlation between eta and irr in the humid environment is mainly controlled by ppt for the counties with irr 65 mm where rainfall is insufficient irrigation provides a supplementary water supply for crop production in these regions eta is positively correlated to both ppt and irr the linear model of eta against ppt irr model 5 indicates higher goodness of fit r 2 0 684 than the linear model of eta against ppt only r 2 0 523 fig 10c the scatter plot of eta vs ppt irr shows that the sample points are located more closely along the regression line the slope 0 383 for the regression of eta against ppt irr is slightly higher than the slope 0 318 for the regression of eta against ppt which implies that eta is more sensitive to ppt irr than ppt only because of the curvature feature of the sample points in the scatter plot an exponential growth model model 6 fits the data slightly better than the linear model model 5 fig 10c the exponential model shows that the rate of eta change increases steadily with increasing ppt irr the multiple regression of eta against ppt and irr model 7 generates a better goodness of fit r 2 0 717 r adj 2 0 712 rmse 33 5 mm than all other linear and nonlinear univariate regressions table 2a the slope of ppt b1 0 382 is much smaller than the slope of irr b2 0 630 that explains that the response of eta to irr is 65 stronger than eta to ppt based on the regression analysis irrigation water is used more by crop production compared to rainfall water therefore irrigation water use is considered more efficient in crop growth than rainfall the regressions using nine cds as samples in the model show similar results as those using the county samples table 2b the scatter plots of eta vs ppt and irr demonstrate the relationships between the variables for nine cd samples fig 10d f however because each cd is grouped from several counties the analysis using the cd samples reduces the data variability or random errors in the models using the county samples apparently the regression models with the cd samples indicate better goodness of fit than those with county samples like the county samples the relationship of eta vs ppt and irr can be estimated using linear or nonlinear quadratic or exponential models table 2b fig 10d f because of the curvature feature nonlinear univariate models model 2 4 and 6 fit the data better than linear univariate models models 1 3 and 5 for the relationship of eta vs irr the linear model model 3 is not significant but a quadratic function model 4 represents for a better model to fit the u shaped pattern fig 10e the exponential model of eta vs ppt irr model 6 shows high goodness of fit pseudo r 2 0 877 rmse 16 5 mm which is even better than the linear bivariate model model 7 r adj 2 0 827 rmse 20 7 mm comparing the scatter plots of eta vs ppt and eta vs ppt irr by cd fig 10d and f we noticed the difference in the sample locations in the plots in the plot of eta vs ppt fig 10d three eastern cds cds 3 6 and 9 are located in the higher ppt region on the x axis and the northwest cd 1 and west central cd 4 are in the lower end with irr adding into the scatter plot fig 8f all cds shift toward the higher ppt region the greatest increase on the x axis is the southwest cd 7 and then the south central cd 8 and the northwest cd 1 the three eastern cds have only minor changes due to small amount of irrigation water 5 discussion 5 1 water balance and water use efficiency in kansas our analysis of water use and water balance indicates that precipitation is a major water source in the croplands of kansas while irrigation water provides a compensation to the water shortage in the western and south central portions of the state for all kansas percent of irrigation water use in total water input expressed as irr ppt irr is 6 6 however five gmds have much higher irr ppt irr than other regions using this ratio the gmds are ranked from high to low as gmd 3 18 3 gmd 5 15 8 gmd 4 10 8 gmd 1 7 6 and gmd 2 7 0 the average percentage of irr ppt irr in all areas outside of gmds is as low as 0 92 comparing among nine cds the four cds with more irrigation lands in the western and south central area have higher irr ppt irr ratios that are 17 7 9 8 7 8 and 4 1 for cds 7 1 8 and 4 respectively while the ratios are lower from 0 13 to 2 33 in other five cds the ratio of eta ppt irr δsm can be used to account for water use efficiency in the croplands in the equation the eta item indicates the total water consumption while the ppt irr δsm item indicates the total water input applied to croplands the concept of eta ppt irr δsm is similar to generalized efficiency defined as the ratio of total water consumption to total water inflow into an agricultural production system cao et al 2018 for the entire state the average eta ppt irr δsm is 0 86 the difference in the eta ppt irr δsm ratio is distinct among the nine cds three cds in the east have the lowest ratio of 0 76 and the cds in the western and central areas have the ratios greater than 0 84 while cd 1 has the highest ratio of 0 99 for the five gmds the eta ppt irr δsm ratio ranges from 0 83 cd 1 0 84 cd 3 0 85 cd 2 0 91 cd 5 to 0 97 cd 4 the spatial pattern in the eta ppt irr δsm ratio indicates that the crop water use is more efficient in the dry western and central kansas especially the northwestern than the wet eastern state an important factor is that surface runoff is higher in eastern kansas which decreases the efficiency of crop water use it is reported that the average runoff ranges from approximately 25 mm in the east to 0 25 mm in the west a 100 fold difference in the runoff across the state sophocleous 1998 it is noticeable from the maps of water balance figs 6e and 8e that wb is generally higher in the eastern kansas and lower in the western and central caused mainly by the distribution of the precipitation in the state groundwater discharge for irrigation adds a fair amount of water into croplands making wb to increase to some extent especially in the southeast e g cds 7 and 8 or gmds 3 and 5 however overall wb is still low in western and central kansas for example there are 25 counties where wb is less than 50 mm including 11 counties showing negative wb the negative wb specifies the regions where water supply comes primarily from the groundwater that is not recharged sufficiently by rainfall or water withdrawal for irrigation is more than recharge however possible overestimation of eta or underestimation of ppt and irr may cause false negative wb in these regions among the five gmds gmd 4 in the northeast has the lowest wb 14 mm figs 6e 7c 8e and 9c implying insufficiency of both rainfall and water withdrawal in the region although the other four gmds are also dry water supply from the groundwater considerably increases the water balance 5 2 uncertainty in soil moisture estimation for the water balance equation eq 4 the most uncertain item might be the change in soil moisture storage δsm because gridded soil moisture data at high resolution are not available we used the soil moisture data derived from the scan stations for estimating δsm as described in section 3 2 based on scan data and soil layer depth estimation we calculated that the water storage change in soil through the growing season is 80 mm in the croplands of kansas however this estimation is a simple approximation as we assumed a uniform soil property across the state to verify this estimation we used the surface soil moisture dataset developed at the copernicus climate change service c3s implemented by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https climate copernicus eu the c3s thematic climate data record tcdr dataset provides estimates of soil moisture at 25 km resolution over the globe from a large set of satellite sensors for this study we chose the combined css surface soil moisture product created by blending scatterometer and radiometer soil moisture products scanlon et al 2018 we downloaded and processed the volumetric soil moisture product which is defined as the content of liquid water m3 m3 in a surface soil layer of 2 5 cm depth we used the monthly volumetric soil moisture to calculate the soil moisture storage δsm during the 2015 growing season for kansas eq 5 specifically δsm is the volumetric soil moisture difference between may and october subtracting october from may as a result δsm has a spatial mean value of 0 050 m3 m3 and a standard deviation of 0 025 m3 m3 for the state the volumetric soil moisture of 0 05 m3 m3 is equivalent to 50 mm of water depth stored in the soil if soil layer is assumed to be 1 m thick however this estimation of δsm is lower than that of 80 mm calculated based on the scan soil moisture data one reason for the difference is that the satellite sensors only detect the soil moisture of surface soil layer therefore estimation of soil water storage change using the c3s data partially verified the results derived from the scan data 5 3 implication of water balance analysis in and beyond kansas in this study the spatial variability of the relative contribution of rainfall to seasonal water use was shown to decrease from western to eastern kansas it indicates heavier reliance of agriculture on non renewable groundwater water resources in the west than the east where water demands are lower and surface water provides supplemental irrigation water supply due to heavy dependence on groundwater water withdrawals from the high plain aquifer have caused large water level declines that threaten the viability of the aquifer as a continuing resource for irrigated agriculture in western kansas butler et al 2013 2016 steward et al 2013 however investigation using a water balance approach by butler et al 2016 reveals that modest reductions in annual pumping would have stabilized water levels over much of the aquifer in kansas a study by steward et al 2013 substantiates that groundwater use reduction today would result in increased net production due to projected future increases in crop water use efficiencies therefore quantifying the contributions of rainfall and irrigation water is important for sustainable management of water resources for agriculture our study highlights the power of remote sensing based water use estimation to quantify and understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop water consumption for improving water management the evaluation of water balance with remote sensing techniques is especially useful for the agricultural areas where supplemental irrigation from groundwater resources is in practice due to scarcity in rainfall and surface water supply kansas is a good representative of semi arid and humid climate zones where supplemental irrigation from groundwater and surface water compensates for water deficit thus our water balance approach can be applied to similar irrigation districts in other states and regions around the world to quantify and assess the relative contribution of rainfall groundwater and surface water to irrigation agriculture furthermore globally available remote sensing datasets with high spatial and temporal resolutions can be used effectively to quantify blue water precipitation and green water irrigation water contributions to total water use for better understanding of crop water use and irrigation efficiency velpuri and senay 2017 thornton et al 2018 6 conclusions our study used climate data satellite based et data and irrigation agriculture reports to analyze and characterize water use and water balance in the croplands of kansas the study focuses on the spatial patterns of water resources irrigation water use water consumption and water balance for the irrigated or rainfed agricultural lands all the analyses based on the geospatial datasets at grid and point levels are summarized by counties cds and gmds the study indicates that the ssebop model provides a powerful tool for the eta estimation used for quantifying total water use and irrigation water consumption our analysis shows that the irrigation makes an important contribution to the state s agriculture although irrigation water constitutes a relatively small portion of total water supply specifically on average for the croplands of the state in 2015 the seasonal precipitation eta and soil water storage change are 528 mm 555 m and 80 mm respectively and the annual irrigation water is 38 mm irrigation water use is 92 mm in the irrigated croplands located primarily in the western and south central kansas while it is 5 mm in most rainfed croplands in the east the water use efficiency expressed by the ratio of eta to total water input in agriculture including precipitation irrigation water and soil moisture storage change is relatively high in the west due to dry climate and poor streamflow the statistical analysis shows a significant regression model for the relationships of eta vs precipitation and irrigation water use with r 2 values of 0 71 and 0 87 respectively at county and climate division levels the regression models indicate more efficient responses of eta to irrigation water use than eta to precipitation our study on spatial patterns of the water use and water balance provides important information that can be used for water allocation risk management and irrigation system planning in kansas further study can be expanded to historical data analysis on temporal trends and variations in irrigation water use and their impact factors in kansas declaration of

9947,kansas is one of the most productive agricultural states in the united states where agricultural irrigation is a primary user of underground and surface water because of low precipitation and declining groundwater levels in western and central kansas sustainable management of irrigation water resources is a critical issue in the agricultural productivity of the state the objective of this study is to analyze and characterize the water use and water balance in the croplands of kansas using satellite observations meteorological data and in situ irrigation water use records we used actual evapotranspiration eta precipitation soil moisture and irrigation water use to calculate water balance for kansas in 2015 at scales of counties climatic divisions and groundwater management districts gmd the operational simplified surface energy balance model was implemented to estimate 30 m resolution eta results showed that the seasonal may september precipitation soil water storage change and eta are 528 mm 80 mm and 555 mm respectively on average of all croplands in the state the annual net irrigation water consumption was 293 mm for irrigated croplands indicating that irrigation water constitutes an substantial portion of the water supply in the state the total volumetric irrigation water use was 3 24 km3 for all croplands within five gmds in western and south central kansas while only 0 38 km3 was outside of gmds the multiple regression models of eta against precipitation and irrigation water use were statistically significant with r 2 values of 0 71 and 0 87 respectively at county and climate division scales regression models also indicated a higher rate of eta response to irrigation water use than that to precipitation our study demonstrated the spatial patterns of crop water use and water balance in kansas which could provide useful information for management of irrigation agriculture and water resources for the state keywords evapotranspiration irrigation water use landsat data soil water storage ssebop model water use efficiency 1 introduction agriculture is the largest land use in kansas accounting for 88 of the land area in the state irrigation within the agriculture sector makes important contributions to the total economy of kansas according to the 2017 census of agriculture there are 9974 km2 of harvested irrigated croplands including corn wheat alfalfa soybeans and multiple crops representing 11 of all harvested croplands in the state usda national agricultural statistics service 2019a irrigation is also responsible for the largest water use in kansas accounting for 84 of non domestic consumptive use kansas department of agriculture 2018 because of the generally dry climate in western and central kansas where average annual rainfall is normally less than 500 mm irrigation practices compensate for the lack of precipitation in 2017 the prevalent irrigation systems are center pivots with drop nozzles and center pivots that account for 82 3 and 10 0 respectively of all irrigation systems kansas department of agriculture 2018 the history of irrigated agriculture in kansas can trace back to the 1880s but it expanded rapidly after 1945 peaked at over 12 000 km2 in the 1970s and remained relatively stable afterward rogers and lamm 2012 rogers and aguilar 2017 the high plains aquifer is the major source of irrigation water in kansas most irrigation points of diversion are located within the extent of the aquifer that underlies much of the area in western and south central kansas kenny and juracek 2013 perry 2006 however water levels of the high plains aquifer have declined steadily over the past several decades because the mean annual water withdrawals exceeds the recharge kenny and juracek 2013 mcguire 2017 scanlon et al 2012 rudnick et al 2019 evett et al 2020 scanlon et al 2012 estimated a depletion of about 4 m on average for the entire high plains aquifer and about 7 m in the central and southern aquifer much area of kansas and texas since the 1950s it is documented that although acreage of irrigated lands in kansas remained consistent since the late 1980s irrigation water diversions varied substantially depending on climatic fluctuations perry 2006 kenny and juracek 2013 rogers and aguilar 2017 kansas department of agriculture 2018 rogers and aguilar 2017 reported a small reduction in amount of pumping water from 1989 to 2014 due to the conversion of flood irrigation to center pivot system improvement of irrigation efficiency and continuing decline of underground water tables in kansas especially in western and central regions there is a contradiction between high demand of irrigation water use and depletion of the high plains aquifer groundwater the decline of the aquifer groundwater table has been a serious concern to farmers and local governments as crop production is heavily dependent on the water source sophocleous 2005 new irrigation strategies and technologies have been developed and promoted over the last two decades to conserve and protect limited water resources while maintaining agricultural economic profits kenny and juracek 2013 araya et al 2017 rogers and aguilar 2017 kansas department of agriculture 2018 the census of irrigation reported that the areas of micro irrigation systems and sprinkler systems increased by 48 7 and 1 2 respectively while the area of gravity systems decreased by 76 2 from 2003 to 2018 in kansas usda national agricultural statistics service 2004 2019b therefore estimation and evaluation of the water use and water balance in kansas croplands provide important information for understanding the relationships between water resources such as rainfall soil moisture streams and aquifers and irrigation practices such as irrigation acreage irrigation systems and technologies crop types and water use policies evapotranspiration et is a key component in the hydrological cycle and balance measurement and estimation of et are essential and important for the investigation of irrigation agriculture and water resources management although direct et measurement can be implemented using water budget methods e g lysimeter soil moisture depletion and field experiment plot and water vapor transfer methods e g bowen ratio energy budget and eddy covariance the scale of the et measurements is only ground based rana and katerji 2000 satellite remote sensing techniques have become useful tools for et modeling since the last two decades because they provide spatiotemporally continuous observations of land surface parameters used for energy balance and water balance estimations norman et al 1995 bastiaanssen et al 1998 roerink et al 2000 su 2002 allen et al 2007 senay et al 2013 the operational simplified surface energy balance ssebop by senay et al 2013 2017 is a simplified thermal based surface energy model for estimating actual et eta based on the principles of satellite psychrometry that uses land surface temperature lst measured from satellite sensors to estimate the psychrometric surface equivalents of dry bulb and wet bulb air temperatures senay 2018 the u s geological survey usgs earth resources observation and science eros center routinely produces and releases historical and near real time eta maps at regional national and global level using the ssebop model senay et al 2020 these ssebop eta products have been comprehensively validated through various approaches including field scale assessment with flux tower data basin scale water balance assessment cross model comparison and model parameter evaluation with reasonable accuracies velpuri et al 2013 bhattarai et al 2016 chen et al 2016 senay et al 2016 singh and senay 2016 ji et al 2019 senkondo et al 2019 gebremedhin et al 2020 weerasinghe et al 2020 the 30 m resolution ssebop eta product developed based on landsat data has been used successfully for investigating crop water use in agriculture at regional and landscape scales senay et al 2016 2017 2019 schauer and senay 2019 singh et al 2020 with continued deficiency of irrigation water in western kansas due to gradual depletion of the high plains aquifer investigation of agricultural water use becomes an important research subject by integrating with climate data and irrigation water use data satellite based et estimation provides an efficient tool for analyzing water use status and dynamics and therefore useful information for irrigation water resource management in kansas the objective of the study was to evaluate the irrigation water use and water balance for croplands in kansas using et and meteorological data specifically our goals were 1 estimating water use amount for cropland irrigation in all counties and climatic regions 2 evaluating water balance using precipitation water use and et data and 3 exploring how et responds spatially to precipitation and irrigation water use our primary interest in this study was on the spatial pattern of the agricultural water use and water balance across kansas focusing on the comparison between irrigated and rainfed croplands in different climatic regions 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the state of kansas lies amid the flatlands of the southern northern great plains featured by eastward slopes from 1232 m to 207 m in elevation according to the national land cover database 2016 nlcd 2016 homer et al 2020 the major vegetation types in the state are cultivated crops 45 6 grasslands 34 0 hay pasture 8 63 and forests 4 5 fig 1a based on the 2017 census of agriculture kansas has an area of 117 867 km2 of total croplands 88 373 km2 of harvested croplands including 10 131 km2 of irrigated croplands or 8 5 of total croplands usda national agricultural statistics service 2019a from the 2015 cropland data layer cdl fig 1b winter wheat has the largest planting area 30 8 of all croplands in the state followed by corn 16 6 fallow idle cropland 14 0 sorghum 13 8 soybeans 12 8 alfalfa hay 3 9 and double crops 3 1 winter wheat and sorghum have more planting areas in western and central kansas than the east corn and soybeans are the two major crops in the east based on 1981 2010 normals derived from the parameter elevation regression on independent slopes model prism https prism oregonstate edu normals statewide annual total precipitation is 732 mm ranging from more than 1010 mm in the southeastern part of the state to less than 40 mm in the southwest statewide annual mean temperature is 12 5 c but follows an east west gradient ranging from around 11 c around the northwestern corner of the state to less than 15 c near the southeast border in this study we used the climate division cd and the kansas groundwater management district gmd zones to examine and summarize the regional variations of agricultural water use and water balance in kansas the cds are used by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa national climatic data center ncdc for near real time climate monitoring long term climate change assessments and statistical climate predictions guttman and quayle 1996 kansas comprises nine cds northwest 1 north central 2 northeast 3 west central 4 central 5 east central 6 southwest 7 south central 8 and southeast 9 fig 1c five gmds were created in the 1970s for the western and central parts of the state where the primary use of groundwater is agricultural irrigation governed by local boards the districts are instrumental in providing information and identifying research and regulatory needs within their boundaries perry 2006 the five gmds are named as gmd 1 western kansas gmd 2 equus beds gmd 3 southwest kansas gmd 4 northwest kansas and gmd 5 big bend fig 1d 2 2 water use data the water information management and analysis system wimas program administered by the kansas department of agriculture division of water resources kda dwr provides a geographic information system based application that allows users to query kansas water right information wilson et al 2005 we acquired the irrigation water use data through the open record request from the kansas department of agriculture https agriculture ks gov document services open records request the requested geodatabase contains several shapefiles and tables as listed below 1 point shapefile point of diversion pod with attributes of coordinate water right identification source of water supply surface water or groundwater use made of water limited to irrigation in this study and county name etc a pod is a location from which water is obtained for a place of use pou by the water right holder surface water is usually diverted by means of a dam canal or pump groundwater is usually abstracted by means of a well water right is the real property right to divert public waters and use them for irrigated land 2 polygon shapefile public land survey system plss township range section and quarter quarter trsqq section a quarter quarter defined by plss is an area nominally 40 acres 0 162 km2 the quarter quarter section is the basic pou associated with the water right for use of the water from pods 3 water right pou table with attributes of water right identification pou identification use made of water trsqq and authorized irrigation area for each quarter quarter section etc the pou consisting of one or multiple quarter quarter sections is the legal location where the water right is used 4 water use table with attributes of water right identification pod identification use made of water source of water supply county name amount of water used for irrigation in acre feet irrigated area in acre irrigated crop metered quantity of water used for irrigation depth to water measured and year of water use etc the geodatabase maps were reprojected from original geographic coordinates to the albers conical equal area acea projection for this study we only used the kansas irrigation water data for the year 2015 according to the wimas geodatabase there were 22 509 active pods across kansas in 2015 including 20 507 groundwater pods and 2002 surface water pods and 249 834 quarter quarters of pous equivalent to a total area of 40 442 km2 most pods and pous are distributed in the western and south central kansas underlain by the high plains aquifer the five gmds encompass the croplands with a high density of pods and a large area of pous fig 2 2 3 ssebop eta data in this study the eta dataset was generated using the ssebop model that integrates landsat thermal data and model assimilated weather data the eta in ssebop is calculated by 1 eta etf k etr where eta is the actual et mm etf is the et fraction etr is alfalfa reference et mm and k 0 85 is the bias correction coefficient to adjust the gridded etr in relation to station based etr bawa et al 2020 here etf is computed from 2 etf 1 γ s ts tc where γ s is the surface psychrometric constant ts is lst and tc is the cold wetlimiting surface temperature derived from 3 tc c ta where c is the correction coefficient c factor and ta is the daily maximum air temperature the procedure of the ssebop eta production is described in detail in senay et al 2013 2016 2017 and senay 2018 in the ssebop computation lst was derived from the landsat 7 and landsat 8 thermal infrared bands using emissivity parameterized with the normalized difference vegetation index parameter ta was derived from daymet developed at oak ridge national laboratory distributed active archive center https daymet ornl gov daymet is a gridded product based on daily meteorological observations used to produce daily weather parameters at 1 km resolution covering north america from 1980 to present thornton et al 2018 but daily climatology ta 1980 2018 was used in this study etr was derived from the gridded surface meteorological dataset gridmet developed by the university of idaho http www climatologylab org gridmet html abatzoglou 2013 gridmet is a gridded dataset of daily surface meteorological variables at 4 km resolution covering the conterminous united states from 1979 to present although daily climatology etr 1980 2017 was used here we implemented the ssebop model in the google earth engine gee processing environment for generating the 2015 growing season may to september eta in kansas the gee python api utilized cloud based data collection and computing routines for the eta modeling procedures including satellite and weather data handling per image modeling operations and time integrated outputs the final eta dataset was resampled to a 30 m resolution image in the acea projection we validated the ssebop eta estimates in kansas using eddy covariance measurements available from two ameriflux sites for the year 2015 1 kansas field station site id us kfs coordinate 39 3 21 96 n 95 11 26 52 w vegetation cover grasslands 2 kansas land institute site id us kls coordinate 38 46 28 2 n 97 34 6 24 w vegetation cover grasslands fig 1 we downloaded and processed the eddy covariance data https ameriflux lbl gov then compared the monthly eta estimated from the eddy covariance measurements with the eta derived from the ssebop model for the ssebop eta we used the mean value of 3 3 pixels centered at the flux tower location roughly equivalent to a 45 m radius to account for the differing fetch area of the tower 2 4 precipitation data one of the variables we used to calculate water balance is the monthly gridded precipitation derived from prism daly et al 2008 the prism product includes a suite of timeseries 2 5 or 4 km and long term normal 30 or 800 m products of meteorological variables we downloaded the an81m monthly precipitation product 2 5 for the year 2015 from the prism climate group website http www prism oregonstate edu the monthly precipitation from may to september was used to calculate seasonal total precipitation additionally 30 year 1981 2010 normals of precipitation and temperature at 30 norm81m were obtained to compute the regional climatology at pixel scale all prism datasets used in the study were subset to kansas area and remapped from original geographic coordinates to the acea projection 2 5 soil moisture data we obtained soil moisture data from the soil climate analysis network scan the scan system administered by the national water and climate center is a soil climate monitoring program consisting of automated data collection sites across the united states www wcc nrcs usda gov scan the scan system contains over 200 stations focusing on agricultural areas of the united states a typical scan site monitors soil moisture content hourly at several depths 5 cm 10 cm 20 cm 50 cm and 1 m where possible using dielectric constant measuring devices with reported precision of 0 5 https www wcc nrcs usda gov about mon scan html there are four scan stations in kansas and all of them have daily soil moisture data since 2004 abrams centralia lake and phillipsburg or 2008 ku nesa fig 2 table 1 because centralia lake station is close to a lake and the soil is saturated with water about 40 at all depths 20 cm consistently over a year period the station was not included in this study 2 6 cropland data layer data the cdl created by the u s department of agriculture national agricultural statistics service nass provides annual crop specific land cover raster data at 30 m resolution for the united states boryan et al 2011 the 2015 cdl was produced using satellite imagery from landsat 8 sensors disaster monitoring constellation dmc deimos 1 and dmc 2 sensors supplementary data sources and agricultural ground truth we acquired the 2015 cdl data with acea projection through cropscape https nassgeodata gmu edu cropscape and clipped the data to the map extent of kansas fig 1b the 2015 kansas cdl data consist of 61 crop types including food crops cereals vegetables and fruits oilseed crops and feed crops our study focuses on seven major crops planted in large area i e corn sorghum soybeans winter wheat alfalfa hay double crops and fallow idle cropland and combines all other minor crops into other crops fig 1b 3 methods 3 1 processing of water use data to retrieve irrigation water use information we compiled and processed the wimas geodatabase files though the following procedure 1 we built the relationships between pods and pous through the look up key of water rights the basic land parcel of a pou is the plss quarter quarter section that has water right to legally obtain irrigation water from associated pods a pou consists of one or more quarter quarter sections under one water right in most circumstances 83 3 a pou is a section about 640 acres or 2 59 km2 that includes 16 quarter quarter sections while other pous are either smaller or larger than a section the relationship between pods and pous is normally many to many that is a single pou may have multiple water rights to obtain water from multiple pods 2 the water use table contains the attribute af used acre feet of water used for irrigation in a year for all water rights the af used is calculated from attribute meter quant metered quantity of water used for irrigation in the year for each pou we calculated total volume of used irrigation water obtained from corresponding pods in the year in the analysis we summed the water volume used in the croplands for each county cd and gmd the af used was converted to cubic meter m3 or cubic kilometer km3 in si unit 3 the data records from the wimas geodatabase may contain inherent uncertainties possibly resulting from type error data model structure or method of data collection wilson et al 2005 to prevent influences of possible erroneous records on the data analysis we performed a quality control procedure on the records any abnormal data values were flagged and examined such as extremely high af used values large area of pous and long distance from pod to pou we found unrealistic large values for the distance between a pod and corresponding pous because we lacked enough evidences to verify the erroneous values from the geodatabase we used two standard deviation threshold to remove records of extremely long pod to pou distances specifically we calculated mean standard deviation of the pod to pou distances for all 22 509 active pods as a result 42 records with the distance value greater than mean plus 2 standard deviations were treated as false records and excluded from analysis 3 2 calculation of water balance we used a simple water balance equation to express the seasonal water use and water balance for the croplands of kansas 4 wb ppt irr eta δsm where wb is water balance ppt is seasonal total precipitation may to september irr is amount of annual irrigation water eta is seasonal total actual et and δsm is the change in soil moisture or soil moisture difference between the end and the start of the growing season the water balance equation does not include the surface runoff component which tends to be relatively small over irrigated areas thus a positive wb could indicate runoff generation potential the water balance equation was calculated using metrics of water depth mm or water volume km3 at a region level e g county cd gmd or state as abovementioned we calculated the seasonal total eta in mm based on the ssebop model and seasonal total precipitation in mm based on the prism product for 2015 from the eta and precipitation data we estimated seasonal eta depth and precipitation depth only for the croplands based on the cdl map fig 1b the volumetric eta km3 was calculated as multiplying the eta depth mm by the area km2 of all croplands in a region likewise the volumetric precipitation km3 was calculated as multiplying precipitation depth by the area of all croplands in a region the amount of irrigation water was directly calculated from the wimas geodatabase for each county we summed the total amount of irrigation water used in all pous within a county and aggregated to a larger region i e cd gmd and state for 2015 additionally we divided the irrigation water volume by the cdl derived cropland area to obtain the irrigation water depth in millimeter for a region because high resolution gridded soil moisture data are not available for the study area we used the soil moisture data 2005 2019 measured from the scan stations to estimate the δsm item in the water balance equation eq 4 for each of the three scan sites i e abrams ku nesa and phillipsburg we used the average value of the soil moisture measurements at depths of 20 cm and 50 cm to represent water content of the soil layer we calculated 10 day average soil moisture based on the daily soil moisture records from 2005 to 2019 and then calculated a 15 year average of the 10 day soil moisture at each site finally the change of soil moisture was derived as 5 δsm sm t2 sm t1 where sm t1 and sm t2 are the soil moisture measured at the beginning and end of the season respectively specifically we used the 10 day soil moistures from the last 10 days of april and the last 10 days of september to represent sm t1 and sm t2 respectively as a result the mean δsm value of the three scan stations is 8 that is soil moisture at the end of season is 8 less than that at the beginning of the season as an average of the three scan stations the soil layer including topsoil and subsoil is about 0 8 1 8 m thick in kansas usda national agricultural statistics service 2006 if we take crop rooting depth into consideration which is about 1 m for most crops including corn soybeans sorghum and wheat we can roughly estimate δsm in depth mm in this case 8 of soil moisture is equivalent to 80 mm of water stored in 1 m thick soil layer we estimated δsm 80 mm in eq 4 namely water storage reduces for 80 mm in soil layer from the beginning to the end of the growing season when the water balance eq 4 is calculated for the quantities in volume the volumetric δsm km3 is calculated by multiplying δsm depth 80 mm by the area of all croplands in a region in kansas the peak months for soil moisture are march april and may while the lowest moisture occurs in july august and september based on the monthly soil moisture averaged from 15 year 2005 2019 records mean value of soil moisture at depths of 20 cm and 50 cm at the three scan sites fig 3 comparing to that the monthly precipitation using the prism 30 year normal 1981 2010 indicates the peak months for precipitation are may and june fig 3 but the highest et process occurs in june to august based on the 30 year 1981 2010 reference et normal derived from gridmet fig 3 therefore soil water in kansas is recharged from snowmelt water and rainfall in spring and is utilized through et processes in early summer through early autumn due to high temperature strong solar radiation and intensive vegetation growth 3 3 statistical analysis of eta precipitation and irrigation water use to quantify and understand the responses of eta to precipitation and irrigation water use we performed regression analyses for the variables the linear and nonlinear regression models were developed for eta ppt and irr measured in depth as shown in table 2 in all regression models we set eta as the response variable and ppt irr or ppt irr as the predictor variable we used two sets of samples separately in the regression analyses ppt irr and eta depth at county level table 2a and at cd level table 2b each sample is the spatial mean values of eta ppt and irr depths of all croplands within a county or cd models 1 6 are the univariate regressions of eta vs ppt irr or ppt irr to achieve the best fitting model we applied both linear and nonlinear regressions to the data the nonlinear models include the quadratic model and the exponential growth model model 7 is the multiple linear regression of eta vs ppt and irr for the linear univariate linear bivariate and quadratic models the regression coefficients were estimated using the ordinary least square method the gauss newton method was applied to estimate the regression coefficients in the exponential model we used the f test coefficient of determination r 2 or pseudo r 2 for exponential model and root mean square error rmse to evaluate the goodness of fit of the regression models and to assess the sensitivity of crop water consumption to water availability the procedure for analyzing and assessing the water balance and the relationships between cropland water input and water consumption is summarized as a flowchart shown in fig 4 4 results 4 1 validation of ssebop eta estimation validation of the ssebop eta was performed using the covariance measurements obtained from two ameriflux sites the comparisons between the two datasets are shown in the timeseries plots and scatter plots fig 5 at the two sites the monthly ssebop eta and the eddy covariance eta agree well in magnitude and seasonal pattern in the timeseries plots fig 5 the results of the statistical comparisons are 1 us kfs r 2 0 930 bias 5 5 mm rmse 18 9 mm and 2 us kls r 2 0 870 bias 5 7 mm rmse 20 3 mm the ssebop eta overestimates the flux tower eta in the peak growing season at both towers after investigation we found that the overestimation at the us kfs site was a result of the choice of etr dataset that introduced a bias for that location for the us kls site the overestimation in july is due to cloud contamination in the ssebop et fraction because the failure of the landsat quality assurance band for masking cloud shadows created artificially low lst however despite these uncertainties the ssebop eta still performs reasonably well with the flux tower eta at the monthly scale when we compared the seasonal may september eta between ssebop and flux towers we found that the us kfs site has rmse of 23 5 mm and bias of 16 0 mm ssebop eta 133 1 mm flux tower 117 1 mm and us kls site has rmse of 30 5 mm and bias of 14 4 mm ssebop eta 129 1 mm flux tower 114 7 mm as a result the validation of the ssebop eta estimations at seasonal scale at the two flux tower sites indicates a satisfactory accuracy the landsat based ssebop eta products have been validated in various ecosystems using eddy covariance flux data from the ameriflux network e g singh et al 2014 bhattarai et al 2016 senay et al 2016 singh and senay 2016 senay et al 2019 velpuri et al 2020 in the colorado river basin validation of monthly ssebop eta estimates at two flux towers showed good accuracy with r 2 of 0 85 0 9 bias of 9 7 0 6 mm and rmse of 7 8 13 0 mm senay et al 2016 here bias is the difference between mean of estimations ssebop eta and mean of observations eddy covariance measurements senay et al 2019 compared monthly ssebop eta timeseries from 1986 to 2015 to eddy covariance measurements at six ameriflux stations located at forest shrubland and grassland sites in the upper rio grande basin and observed averaged r 2 of 0 85 bias of 0 55 mm and rmse of 11 7 mm evaluation of ssebop eta 2008 2009 at monthly scale for the upper klamath lake basin in southern oregon using eddy covariance data from two ameriflux flux towers indicated a high agreement r 2 0 92 0 93 bias 11 15 mm and rmse 21 22 mm velpuri et al 2020 although all those validations of ssebop model found a certain level of uncertainties in the eta estimates due to various reasons reasonable accuracies of the eta estimations have been achieved senay et al 2016 senay et al 2019 velpuri et al 2020 4 2 water balance depth in the croplands of kansas we calculated the water balance for all kansas counties in 2015 using seasonal may september precipitation seasonal eta irrigation water use and soil moisture data fig 6 shows the maps of ppt irr eta and wb measured by water depth in all croplands of 105 counties in 2015 ppt is 572 mm on average in the state but it ranges from 324 mm to 890 mm showing a gradient from the west to the east fig 6a higher ppt 600 mm occurs in eastern kansas and lower ppt 600 mm is in western kansas ppt in the southwest 440 570 mm is slightly higher than the northwest 340 440 mm irr ranges from 0 mm to 228 mm with a mean of 28 mm for the entire state higher irr 20 mm appears in the counties of the western and south central regions i e cds 1 4 7 and 8 while lower irr occurs in most counties in the eastern and north central regions fig 6b basically the counties with higher irr 47 132 mm occur mainly within the five gmds that enclose a large area of pods and pous fig 2 among the five districts gmds 3 4 and 5 have relatively high irr than the other two gmds irr is very low 5 mm on average in the regions outside of gmds ppt irr has a mean value of 600 mm ranging from 338 mm to 896 mm across the state fig 6c which displays the similar pattern as ppt fig 6a however when adding irr into ppt the total water input increases slightly in the western and south central regions cds 4 7 and 8 fig 6c the map of seasonal eta indicates higher values in the east and south i e cds 3 6 7 8 and 9 than other areas fig 6d the eta value of all counties is 568 mm on average varying from 426 mm to 715 mm but the general pattern of eta over the state is similar to ppt irr wb shows an overall positive balance in the state with a mean value of 112 mm ranging from 89 mm to 351 mm fig 6e in general wb is higher in the east and southeast several counties indicating negative water balance are mainly in the northwest cds 1 2 4 and 5 due to overestimation of eta or underestimation of ppt and or irr it is noticed that the counties with more irrigated lands outlined by gmds show slightly higher wb than their nearby counties our analysis of water balance eq 4 does not include the runoff component due to lack of county level or gridded streamflow data however if we neglect other unknown components in the water balance equation wb can roughly account for runoff for all croplands in the 2015 growing season our estimation of wb is 91 mm on average based on the runoff data from the us geological survey 2020 the annual average runoff streamflow per unit area in kansas for the 2015 water year from 1 october 2014 30 september 2015 is 81 4 mm the state level runoff is calculated as weighted average of hydrologic unit code level 2 huc2 and generated by combining flow data collected at streamgages the drainage basins of the streamgages and the boundaries of the hucs us geological survey 2020 this state level runoff record is close to our estimation of runoff using the water balance method although the timescales water year vs growing season are different the cropland water balance measured in depth is summarized by cds and gmds shown in the bar charts fig 7 over the nine cds ppt is higher 699 730 mm in the three eastern cds and lower in the three western cds 375 506 mm irr is the highest in cd 7 109 mm followed by cd 8 48 mm cd 1 41 mm and cd 4 19 mm three cds in the east have the lowest irr 3 mm because of few pods and pous in the area wb is higher 189 197 mm in the three cds of eastern kansas than other cds 5 109 mm which causes more runoff in the east comparison among five gmds demonstrates that all gmds have similar ppt 369 573 mm though gmd 4 in the northwest is slightly lower 369 mm although irr is high 47 132 mm in all gmds the highest irr amount occurs in gmd 3 132 mm and gmd 5 97 mm wb is higher 58 117 mm in the gmds 1 2 3 and 5 but lower 14 mm in gmd 4 located in the dry northwestern region fig 7 it should be noted that the water balance depth in the analysis was calculated for all croplands including irrigated and rainfed croplands within a county cd or gmd due to the lack of high resolution irrigation raster data for 2015 we were not able to distinguish between irrigated and rainfed croplands at the pixel scale if the water balance could be calculated based on only irrigated croplands irr would be much greater than the average value of irrigated and rainfed croplands likewise eta would be higher in the irrigated croplands than other lands at the state scale the total irrigated area in 2017 was 12 377 km2 as reported by kansas department of agriculture 2018 the total irr volume in kansas was calculated as 3 63 km3 described in section 4 3 that was equivalent to irr depth of 293 mm in irrigated croplands 3 62 km3 divided by 12 377 km2 thus the irr accounts for a substantial water depth 53 of the eta 555 mm on average in the irrigated croplands of the state 4 3 water balance volume in the croplands of kansas the maps of volumetric precipitation irrigation water amount eta and water balance in 2015 are shown in fig 8 the regional summaries of these variables by cd and gmd are shown in the bar charts fig 9 because the volumetric measurement of water amount is proportional to the area of the croplands in a county patterns of the volumetric ppt irr and eta are different from their corresponding water depth measurements figs 6 and 7 the total irr used in the croplands of the state is 3 62 km3 2 94 million acre feet but it is relatively high in cds 1 7 and 8 where irrigation agriculture is intense and common figs 7b and 8 the total volumetric ppt and eta are 50 9 km3 41 3 million acre feet and 53 4 km3 43 3 million acre feet respectively in the state but they are lower in east especially in cds 6 and 9 due to fewer croplands figs 7a c and 8 of the five gmds gmd 3 has the highest volumetric ppt irr and eta followed by gmds 4 and 5 because of larger cropland area in the districts fig 9c the total volumetric irr is 3 24 km3 2 6 million acre feet within five gmds while only 0 38 km3 0 31 million acre feet outside of gmds 4 4 statistical relationships between precipitation irrigation water and eta responses of eta to precipitation and irrigation water can be quantified using linear and nonlinear regression models table 2 we performed the regression analyses separately using two sets of samples 105 counties table 2a and 9 cds table 2b for the samples of counties the linear regression of eta vs ppt model 1 shows a significant positive relationship fig 10a table 2a the regression slope b is 0 318 implying that the rate of eta change is much lower than that of ppt that is one unit increase in eta corresponds to almost three times of increase in ppt the exponential growth model of eta against ppt model 2 indicates a slightly better goodness of it than the linear model fig 10a table 2a the exponential model shows that the rate of eta change increases gradually with the increasing ppt obviously response of eta to ppt is faster in the drier regions ppt 600 mm than the wetter regions ppt 600 mm for the relationship between eta and irr the linear regression model model 3 is marginally insignificant p value 0 0503 fig 10b table 2a however the relationship can be fit significantly p value 0 0001 by using a quadratic model model 4 the quadratic function shows a u shaped parabola curve with low eta values around irr of 50 65 mm the slope of quadratic function is negative at region of irr 50 mm flattened between 50 and 65 mm and positive over irr 65 mm in the counties where rainfall is abundant ppt is the dominant water source in the agriculture of the state in these regions irr decreases where ppt increases while ppt is positively correlated to eta therefore the negative correlation between eta and irr in the humid environment is mainly controlled by ppt for the counties with irr 65 mm where rainfall is insufficient irrigation provides a supplementary water supply for crop production in these regions eta is positively correlated to both ppt and irr the linear model of eta against ppt irr model 5 indicates higher goodness of fit r 2 0 684 than the linear model of eta against ppt only r 2 0 523 fig 10c the scatter plot of eta vs ppt irr shows that the sample points are located more closely along the regression line the slope 0 383 for the regression of eta against ppt irr is slightly higher than the slope 0 318 for the regression of eta against ppt which implies that eta is more sensitive to ppt irr than ppt only because of the curvature feature of the sample points in the scatter plot an exponential growth model model 6 fits the data slightly better than the linear model model 5 fig 10c the exponential model shows that the rate of eta change increases steadily with increasing ppt irr the multiple regression of eta against ppt and irr model 7 generates a better goodness of fit r 2 0 717 r adj 2 0 712 rmse 33 5 mm than all other linear and nonlinear univariate regressions table 2a the slope of ppt b1 0 382 is much smaller than the slope of irr b2 0 630 that explains that the response of eta to irr is 65 stronger than eta to ppt based on the regression analysis irrigation water is used more by crop production compared to rainfall water therefore irrigation water use is considered more efficient in crop growth than rainfall the regressions using nine cds as samples in the model show similar results as those using the county samples table 2b the scatter plots of eta vs ppt and irr demonstrate the relationships between the variables for nine cd samples fig 10d f however because each cd is grouped from several counties the analysis using the cd samples reduces the data variability or random errors in the models using the county samples apparently the regression models with the cd samples indicate better goodness of fit than those with county samples like the county samples the relationship of eta vs ppt and irr can be estimated using linear or nonlinear quadratic or exponential models table 2b fig 10d f because of the curvature feature nonlinear univariate models model 2 4 and 6 fit the data better than linear univariate models models 1 3 and 5 for the relationship of eta vs irr the linear model model 3 is not significant but a quadratic function model 4 represents for a better model to fit the u shaped pattern fig 10e the exponential model of eta vs ppt irr model 6 shows high goodness of fit pseudo r 2 0 877 rmse 16 5 mm which is even better than the linear bivariate model model 7 r adj 2 0 827 rmse 20 7 mm comparing the scatter plots of eta vs ppt and eta vs ppt irr by cd fig 10d and f we noticed the difference in the sample locations in the plots in the plot of eta vs ppt fig 10d three eastern cds cds 3 6 and 9 are located in the higher ppt region on the x axis and the northwest cd 1 and west central cd 4 are in the lower end with irr adding into the scatter plot fig 8f all cds shift toward the higher ppt region the greatest increase on the x axis is the southwest cd 7 and then the south central cd 8 and the northwest cd 1 the three eastern cds have only minor changes due to small amount of irrigation water 5 discussion 5 1 water balance and water use efficiency in kansas our analysis of water use and water balance indicates that precipitation is a major water source in the croplands of kansas while irrigation water provides a compensation to the water shortage in the western and south central portions of the state for all kansas percent of irrigation water use in total water input expressed as irr ppt irr is 6 6 however five gmds have much higher irr ppt irr than other regions using this ratio the gmds are ranked from high to low as gmd 3 18 3 gmd 5 15 8 gmd 4 10 8 gmd 1 7 6 and gmd 2 7 0 the average percentage of irr ppt irr in all areas outside of gmds is as low as 0 92 comparing among nine cds the four cds with more irrigation lands in the western and south central area have higher irr ppt irr ratios that are 17 7 9 8 7 8 and 4 1 for cds 7 1 8 and 4 respectively while the ratios are lower from 0 13 to 2 33 in other five cds the ratio of eta ppt irr δsm can be used to account for water use efficiency in the croplands in the equation the eta item indicates the total water consumption while the ppt irr δsm item indicates the total water input applied to croplands the concept of eta ppt irr δsm is similar to generalized efficiency defined as the ratio of total water consumption to total water inflow into an agricultural production system cao et al 2018 for the entire state the average eta ppt irr δsm is 0 86 the difference in the eta ppt irr δsm ratio is distinct among the nine cds three cds in the east have the lowest ratio of 0 76 and the cds in the western and central areas have the ratios greater than 0 84 while cd 1 has the highest ratio of 0 99 for the five gmds the eta ppt irr δsm ratio ranges from 0 83 cd 1 0 84 cd 3 0 85 cd 2 0 91 cd 5 to 0 97 cd 4 the spatial pattern in the eta ppt irr δsm ratio indicates that the crop water use is more efficient in the dry western and central kansas especially the northwestern than the wet eastern state an important factor is that surface runoff is higher in eastern kansas which decreases the efficiency of crop water use it is reported that the average runoff ranges from approximately 25 mm in the east to 0 25 mm in the west a 100 fold difference in the runoff across the state sophocleous 1998 it is noticeable from the maps of water balance figs 6e and 8e that wb is generally higher in the eastern kansas and lower in the western and central caused mainly by the distribution of the precipitation in the state groundwater discharge for irrigation adds a fair amount of water into croplands making wb to increase to some extent especially in the southeast e g cds 7 and 8 or gmds 3 and 5 however overall wb is still low in western and central kansas for example there are 25 counties where wb is less than 50 mm including 11 counties showing negative wb the negative wb specifies the regions where water supply comes primarily from the groundwater that is not recharged sufficiently by rainfall or water withdrawal for irrigation is more than recharge however possible overestimation of eta or underestimation of ppt and irr may cause false negative wb in these regions among the five gmds gmd 4 in the northeast has the lowest wb 14 mm figs 6e 7c 8e and 9c implying insufficiency of both rainfall and water withdrawal in the region although the other four gmds are also dry water supply from the groundwater considerably increases the water balance 5 2 uncertainty in soil moisture estimation for the water balance equation eq 4 the most uncertain item might be the change in soil moisture storage δsm because gridded soil moisture data at high resolution are not available we used the soil moisture data derived from the scan stations for estimating δsm as described in section 3 2 based on scan data and soil layer depth estimation we calculated that the water storage change in soil through the growing season is 80 mm in the croplands of kansas however this estimation is a simple approximation as we assumed a uniform soil property across the state to verify this estimation we used the surface soil moisture dataset developed at the copernicus climate change service c3s implemented by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf https climate copernicus eu the c3s thematic climate data record tcdr dataset provides estimates of soil moisture at 25 km resolution over the globe from a large set of satellite sensors for this study we chose the combined css surface soil moisture product created by blending scatterometer and radiometer soil moisture products scanlon et al 2018 we downloaded and processed the volumetric soil moisture product which is defined as the content of liquid water m3 m3 in a surface soil layer of 2 5 cm depth we used the monthly volumetric soil moisture to calculate the soil moisture storage δsm during the 2015 growing season for kansas eq 5 specifically δsm is the volumetric soil moisture difference between may and october subtracting october from may as a result δsm has a spatial mean value of 0 050 m3 m3 and a standard deviation of 0 025 m3 m3 for the state the volumetric soil moisture of 0 05 m3 m3 is equivalent to 50 mm of water depth stored in the soil if soil layer is assumed to be 1 m thick however this estimation of δsm is lower than that of 80 mm calculated based on the scan soil moisture data one reason for the difference is that the satellite sensors only detect the soil moisture of surface soil layer therefore estimation of soil water storage change using the c3s data partially verified the results derived from the scan data 5 3 implication of water balance analysis in and beyond kansas in this study the spatial variability of the relative contribution of rainfall to seasonal water use was shown to decrease from western to eastern kansas it indicates heavier reliance of agriculture on non renewable groundwater water resources in the west than the east where water demands are lower and surface water provides supplemental irrigation water supply due to heavy dependence on groundwater water withdrawals from the high plain aquifer have caused large water level declines that threaten the viability of the aquifer as a continuing resource for irrigated agriculture in western kansas butler et al 2013 2016 steward et al 2013 however investigation using a water balance approach by butler et al 2016 reveals that modest reductions in annual pumping would have stabilized water levels over much of the aquifer in kansas a study by steward et al 2013 substantiates that groundwater use reduction today would result in increased net production due to projected future increases in crop water use efficiencies therefore quantifying the contributions of rainfall and irrigation water is important for sustainable management of water resources for agriculture our study highlights the power of remote sensing based water use estimation to quantify and understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop water consumption for improving water management the evaluation of water balance with remote sensing techniques is especially useful for the agricultural areas where supplemental irrigation from groundwater resources is in practice due to scarcity in rainfall and surface water supply kansas is a good representative of semi arid and humid climate zones where supplemental irrigation from groundwater and surface water compensates for water deficit thus our water balance approach can be applied to similar irrigation districts in other states and regions around the world to quantify and assess the relative contribution of rainfall groundwater and surface water to irrigation agriculture furthermore globally available remote sensing datasets with high spatial and temporal resolutions can be used effectively to quantify blue water precipitation and green water irrigation water contributions to total water use for better understanding of crop water use and irrigation efficiency velpuri and senay 2017 thornton et al 2018 6 conclusions our study used climate data satellite based et data and irrigation agriculture reports to analyze and characterize water use and water balance in the croplands of kansas the study focuses on the spatial patterns of water resources irrigation water use water consumption and water balance for the irrigated or rainfed agricultural lands all the analyses based on the geospatial datasets at grid and point levels are summarized by counties cds and gmds the study indicates that the ssebop model provides a powerful tool for the eta estimation used for quantifying total water use and irrigation water consumption our analysis shows that the irrigation makes an important contribution to the state s agriculture although irrigation water constitutes a relatively small portion of total water supply specifically on average for the croplands of the state in 2015 the seasonal precipitation eta and soil water storage change are 528 mm 555 m and 80 mm respectively and the annual irrigation water is 38 mm irrigation water use is 92 mm in the irrigated croplands located primarily in the western and south central kansas while it is 5 mm in most rainfed croplands in the east the water use efficiency expressed by the ratio of eta to total water input in agriculture including precipitation irrigation water and soil moisture storage change is relatively high in the west due to dry climate and poor streamflow the statistical analysis shows a significant regression model for the relationships of eta vs precipitation and irrigation water use with r 2 values of 0 71 and 0 87 respectively at county and climate division levels the regression models indicate more efficient responses of eta to irrigation water use than eta to precipitation our study on spatial patterns of the water use and water balance provides important information that can be used for water allocation risk management and irrigation system planning in kansas further study can be expanded to historical data analysis on temporal trends and variations in irrigation water use and their impact factors in kansas declaration of

9948,intercropping is a common strategy to improve land use efficiency in many areas of the world however intercropping induces adaptive changes that remain poorly understood with regard to soil temperature and inter species moisture competition this is especially true for the interspecies relationship between intercropped jujube ziziphus jujuba mill and cotton gossypium hirsutum l to gain insight into this relationship and its influence field experiments were conducted in 2015 2017 to analyze how soil moisture and temperature were affected under jujube cotton intercropping compared with single cropping intercropping lowered the soil temperature under jujube by 0 04 0 87 and lowered soil temperature under cotton by 0 63 2 92 for all months except april and may the soil temperature stability of intercropping was significantly higher than that of monocropping these changes were generally conducive to crop growth although lowered soil temperature during the later growth period was not beneficial to jujube quality intercropping jujube growth was inhibited not only by interspecific competition but also by plastic film mulching of cotton throughout the total growth period both transpiration and soil evaporation in intercropped jujube decreased by 12 mm and 39 mm respectively and crop yields decreased by 20 30 however due to disproportionate absorption of irrigation water by cotton evapotranspiration during the entire growing season increased by 30 mm and crop yield increased by 30 in addition through carbon stable isotope method the transpiration ratio of single cropped jujube and cotton was 0 79 0 85 1 and that of intercropped jujube and cotton was 0 65 0 68 1 cotton dominated during the critical period of water demand therefore although intercropping can reduce water loss by evaporation and improve the efficiency of land use from the perspective of interspecific water relations the dominant position of cotton had pronounced inhibitory effects on jujube continuous implementation of intercropping over many years is not conducive to the development of fruit tree planting especially as trees become older keywords soil temperature evapotranspiration crop water distribution stable carbon isotope yield 1 introduction since the chinese government s initiation of the one belt one road policy safe 2018 the role of jujube production has rapidly expanded to become one of the pillar industries in xinjiang however the land available for cultivation is limited such that increasing the planting area of fruit trees would necessarily reduce that available for other important crops making the situation more difficult young 1 7 year old fruit trees produce low yields an ideal solution to these problems is to promote intercropping xinjiang is especially well suited to intercropping because its main cash crops cotton and jujube the latter of which had a planting area of 476 250 ha in 2019 sbx 2020 essentially share a growing season and are harvested once a year when two plants share a niche competition between the species is inevitable although it is well known that jujube cotton intercropping improves land economic benefits there is limited data regarding tree crop competition such data could be used to better understand interspecies competition and complementarity that would provide farmers with scientific guidance and agricultural economic benefits soil temperature is a critical factor for plant growth and agricultural development suitable soil temperature aids gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere enhances microbial activity from the soil and enhances root activity however soil temperature changes not only depend on atmospheric temperature fluctuations but also are impacted by cropping systems especially in intercropping systems complicated boundary conditions affect the change of soil temperature and have some influence on the physiological development of crops nyawade et al 2019 reported that a suitable planting model intercropping increases surface coverage and soil moisture content improves the ability of plants to intercept radiation energy and significantly reduces soil temperature in the 0 30 cm layer li et al 2012 reported that intercropping produces soil temperature changes by altering crop canopy width and growth potential therefore in some hot months such as june to july intercropping can effectively relieve the damage to crops caused by high temperature stress zhang et al 2016 other research has indicated that intercropping can inhibit decreases in soil temperature liu et al 2013 olasantan 1988 reported that in an intercropped system the low level crop hinders the dissipation of soil temperature to the high level crop at night wang et al 2017 reported that intercropping delayed the decrease in soil temperature occurring in november bolstering root growth of intercropped winter wheat and consequently increasing its yield intercropping exhibits a two way dynamic regulation function peng et al 2008 making soil temperature a crucial parameter for assessing intercropping functioning an important aspect of agroforestry research is assessing the effects of planting patterns on soil water change and water competition among species researchers generally consider intercropping to improve water use efficiency and to reduce soil evaporation ernst and bianculli 2013 fan et al 2020 for instance chen et al 2015 reported that maize pea intercropping increased grain yields by an average of 31 3 and improved wue by 21 9 compared with the corresponding sole maize and sole pea sharing resources in the rooting zones between the intercrops serves as a major mechanism responsible for the large yield and wue advantages for maize pea intercropping in arid areas furthermore it has been recognized that having two crops with a great difference in interspecific competitiveness leads to the restriction of less competitive crops thereby reducing evapotranspiration et peng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 notably the common approach of these studies examining water in intercropping systems is their tendency to utilize soil evaporation or to monitor soil moisture changes neglecting interspecies competition with respect to water and affording only indirect results regarding physiological et these commonly used methods have yet to be verified since in agroforestry intercropping the causal tree occupies a relatively small niche such that irrigation water administered to fruit trees inevitably migrates elsewhere in the soil therefore how the various components of the agroforestry model use and allocate water resources remains unclear stable carbon isotope technology has become a powerful tool for revealing the interaction between plants and the environment cui et al 2009 pascual et al 2013 when plants absorb co2 in the air for photosynthesis 12co2 is easier to cleave than 13co2 in other words 12co2 is more likely to participate in photosynthesis than 13co2 gessler et al 2008 in addition different catalytic reactions of photosynthetic carboxylase to co2 are easy to enrich 13c into mesophyll tissue badeck et al 2005 producing higher accumulation as photosynthesis progresses therefore the long term water use efficiency of plants can be effectively evaluated by the δ13c value yu et al 2021 remarkable differences among 13c 12c of different plant organizations and 13c 12c in each organ have been negatively correlated with water use efficiency wei et al 2013 this phenomenon cannot be completely explained by the difference of assimilates produced at different times it is called an indication of post photosynthetic discrimination badeck et al 2005 previous research has demonstrated that 13c 12c from leaves of maize zea mays l twohey et al 2019 alfalfa medicago sativa l zhu et al 2019 wheat triticum aestivum l he et al 2012 and cassia seed cassia obtusifolia l chen et al 2014 can characterize crop water use efficiency and transpiration however some research has shown that wue under specific ambient conditions 13c 12c of growth period and sampling tissue might be low correlation with water use efficiency and transpiration anyia et al 2007 wahbi and shaaban 2011 therefore verification of using 13c 12c to quantify water use efficiency and transpiration is required in arid areas for the present study we measured soil temperature soil moisture jujube stem flow and the stable carbon isotope composition of cotton leaves from intercropped jujube cotton systems all of which afforded examination of soil temperature and inter species moisture relationships under intercropping the main objectives of this study were to identify 1 how jujube cotton intercropping impacts soil temperature 2 how crop et changes due to intercropping 3 how intercropping influences the amount of water consumed by intercropped jujube and cotton and the relationship between the species with respect to water consumption and transmission 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the experimental base at xinjiang agricultural university in the aksu region of xinjiang from 2015 to 2017 80 14 e 41 16 this region has a temperate continental arid desert climate and features a substantial difference between day and night temperatures in 2008 2019 annual average parameters for this region include a total solar radiation of 533 620 kj cm 2 total sunshine hours of 2728 3014 h a frost free period of 203 224 d precipitation of 69 mm temperature of 11 4 the soil water holding capacity is 28 the depth to groundwater exceeds 10 m wang 2016 the soil at the test field is mainly comprised of sandy loam and the texture composition is detailed in table 1 2 2 study design the crops used in this study were cotton no 49 xinluzhong and 5 year old jujube planted 2015 cotton was sown in mid april and harvested at the end of october jujube entered the germination stage in late april and was harvested in mid november jujube plants were spaced 1 m apart in rows spaced 4 m apart fig 1 drip tape lines were located 30 cm away from either side of each tree row cotton was planted between jujube rows with two sets of four rows of cotton soil covered by colorless plastic mulch 1 5 m wide 0 05 mm thick cotton row spacing was 20 40 20 cm in each set and plant spacing within a row was 8 cm drip tape lines were centered in the 40 cm interrow space at the center of each four row set of cotton fig 1 drippers within the drip irrigation tapes were spaced 20 cm apart and the dripper discharge was 1 38 l h the experimental design was a single factor field experiment with three replications of three treatments comprised of 1 single cropped jujube 2 single cropped cotton 3 intercropped jujube cotton there were independent irrigation systems for intercropped jujube and intercropped cotton the experiment was carried out over the course of three years 2015 2017 the irrigation schedule for each treatment is shown in table 2 in 2015 and 2016 the experimental field was irrigated on a regular schedule according to the fixed irrigation quota method in 2017 the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 was utilized to guide irrigation in the experimental field irrigation was applied every seven days the irrigation amounts were applied to replace the cumulative et of the previous irrigation period the jujube and cotton crop coefficients were calculated as reported by hong et al 2014 and by zhang et al 2004 and ma et al 2015 respectively fertilizer applications and crop management were based on the local conditions 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture content previous studies have demonstrated root water uptake of young jujube to be mainly concentrated in the 0 100 cm soil layer shi et al 2015 therefore this study focused on changes in soil moisture at this layer corresponding to the jujube root zone jujube et was calculated by the water balance method 1 et c i p s r d where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the rainfall amount mm s is the change in soil moisture storage mm r is the surface runoff mm and d is the deep percolation mm soil moisture storage was determined using the trime iph trime pico iph channel tech china soil moisture measurement system as measured before and after each occurrence of irrigation and after each rainfall additionally soil moisture was measured if a crop underwent a change in growth stage the exact locations for the soil moisture measurements are shown in fig 2 for the single jujube it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the five trime sensors fig 2 a was the corresponding soil moisture content for the treatment for the single cotton it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the three trime sensors fig 2 c was the corresponding soil moisture content for the treatment it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the trime sensors at 30 cm and 50 cm between jujube plants in the jujube row and at 30 cm 50 cm and 70 cm from the jujube row was the soil moisture for intercropped jujube fig 2 b it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the trime sensors at 70 cm 100 cm and 125 cm from the jujube row was the soil moisture for intercropped cotton fig 2 b in addition we assumed surface runoff to be 0 mm due to the use of drip irrigation we also assumed deep percolation to be 0 mm due to soil moisture being relatively stable in the 90 100 cm layer soil moisture content was about 15 72 as measured by trime iph sensors during the entire growing season 2 3 2 soil evaporation soil evaporation was determined using micro lysimeters that were prepared in house from pvc tubes the micro lysimeters contained small isolated volumes of bare soil positioned flush with or slightly above the soil surface daamen et al 1993 and were weighed using electronic balances with 0 1 g precision daily at 10 00 a m to determine water loss each micro lysimeter was 11 cm in diameter and 15 cm in depth the outer barrel was 12 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth in order to minimize differences between soil moisture in the micro lysimeters and between the rows the soil in the micro lysimeters was replaced every 1 2 days and any time it rained we replaced and measured the micro lysimeters 24 h after irrigation events in order to get rid of the interstitial water that was leached by gravity and the remaining water was the held in micropores the jujube micro lysimeters were placed at 50 cm between jujube plants and 40 cm from the jujube row the mean value measured by the micro lysimeters was reported as the soil evaporation the cotton micro lysimeters were placed in the bare space between the two plastic mulch sheets and under the drip irrigation tape calculation of soil evaporation for the cotton field was determined according to the proportional areas of the plastic mulch and bare land 2 3 3 soil temperature soil temperature was measured every 30 min at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 40 cm using a microlite u disk temperature recorder microlite u fourtec israel temperature sensors were located at 50 cm between jujube plants and 30 cm from the jujube row in the jujube only fields in cotton only fields sensors were located at drip tape and 30 cm from the drip tape the drip irrigation tape intercropped fields had temperature sensors positioned at 50 cm 95 cm 125 cm 155 cm between jujube plants and 30 cm from the jujube row 2 3 4 leaf area index the leaf area index of the jujube was measured using a hemiview plant canopy analyzer hmv1 v9 harvesting tech china each data acquisition period occurred before 9 00 a m when there was no strong direct beam solar radiation beginning may 9 leaf area index was determined every 7 10 days until the end of the growing season based on measurements from three jujube plants from each treatment cotton leaf area was measured using a wanshen la s leaf area scanner la s wanshen china beginning may 25 measurements were collected every 10 15 days from nine cotton plants from each treatment until the end of the growing season 2 3 5 determination of stable carbon isotopes in cotton ten mature cotton leaves representing all positions of the plant canopy were harvested at five dates june 11 july 11 july 30 august 30 and october 20 composite leaf samples comprising all 10 mature leaves on a given collection date were oven dried to a constant weight at 65 c and homogenized to fine powder with a ball mill deco pbm v 2l deco equipment tech china if deemed necessary the samples were passed through 80 mesh sieves finally the carbon isotope ratio and carbon mass fraction of the cotton leaves were measured using a stable isotope mass spectrometer hs2022 sercon british 2 3 6 jujube stemflow transpiration rates from single cropped and intercropped treatments were collected every 10 min from three representative standard trees by heat diffusion probe stemflow sf g ecomatik germany in order to measure the cross sectional area of the water conducting parts of the sapwood and heartwood comprising the tree a growth cone was used to take measurements 20 cm above the soil surface at the end of the experiment 2 3

reducing sugar sucrose and vitamin c in each jujube treatments 2 3 8 meteorological parameters meteorological data were measured every 30 min using a watchdog model 2700 spectrum tech usa small automated weather station to automatically observe temperature solar radiation rainfall and other commonly measured meteorological data variation of et0 and rainfall in the whole growth period of jujube in the experimental field in 2015 2017 in fig 3 2 4 calculating water use efficiency and transpiration based on carbon stable isotopes carbon isotope ratios in plants and air were measured

responses were consistent with air temperature showing a sinusoidal s curve the amplitudes of the fluctuations of soil temperature were negatively correlated with soil depth in other words at greater depths fluctuations in soil temperature tended to be more muted changes in soil temperature generally exhibited some degree of lag compared with air temperature although there is no obvious rule which described how the lag time varied in different soil layers the fluctuation range of soil temperatures was lower in the intercropped system than in the single cropped system and more evident during the day than at night the standard deviation and daily amplitude of temperature fluctuations at different soil depths were smaller under intercropping than under the single cropped system table 3 as an example consider the 5 cm depth for intercropping the standard deviation of temperature under the intercropping treatment was about 38 of the standard deviation of single cropped jujube and about 42 of the standard deviation of single cropped cotton the difference between the temperature fluctuations of the single cropped and intercropped systems had a slight downward trend with increasing soil depth therefore soil temperature stability was higher in the intercropped system than in the single cropping system 3 1 2 monthly variation of surface soil temperature due to the effects of mulching the soil temperature in the cotton zone generally exceeded soil temperature in the jujube zone naturally a higher temperature difference promotes heat transfer in may the soil temperature at 5 cm under intercropped cotton was observed to be 0 77 1 50 c lower than the temperature under single cropped cotton fig 5 meanwhile the soil temperature of intercropped jujube slightly exceeded that of single cropped jujube by 0 51 0 82 c after june intercropped cotton began to affect the soil temperature of jujube the mechanism for this influence was that high density cotton blocked direct solar radiation to the jujube zone thereby reducing soil heating accordingly the soil temperature under the intercropped jujube was lower than under the single cropped jujube and the disparity between the two gradually widened with time the leaf area index of intercropped cotton was significantly higher than that of single cropped cotton fig 6 rendering the shading effect on the ground to be higher for the former than the latter and contributing to a similar trend for the soil temperatures under the respective crops except for april and may intercropping generally produced lower soil temperatures with soil temperatures under jujube reduced by 0 04 0 87 c and soil temperatures under cotton reduced by 0 63 2 92 c 3 2 effect of intercropping on soil moisture the continuous growth of single cropped jujube caused et to increase from 539 mm in 2015 to 569 mm in 2017 however et of intercropped jujube was inhibited by inter species competition such that from 2015 to 2017 the et of jujube only increased from 490 to 507 mm a notably smaller difference than seen for single cropped jujube fig 7 a therefore intercropping had an overall negative impact on jujube et however the presence of cotton mulching reduced soil evaporation under intercrop jujube by 34 42 mm demonstrating that intercropping reduces the loss of water occurring through evaporation water that would have normally been unavailable for transpiration throughout the three year study period e et in single cropped and intercropped jujube was similar in may but after june e of intercropped jujube was significantly smaller than e of single cropped jujube and this difference increased with tree age by 2017 e of single cropped jujube accounted for 45 83 of et while e of intercrop jujube accounted for 43 12 of et cotton et did not exhibit a significant difference between single and intercropping systems over the course of the experiment however et of intercropped cotton was higher by about 14 than et of single cropped cotton during the three years fig 7 b therefore intercropping had an overall positive impact on cotton given the et from each month of the experiment the differences in et between single cropped and intercropped cotton were mostly concentrated in the time spanning april to june during the water control stage during this time the et of intercropped cotton increased abnormally this in turn resulted in an increase in the e et for intercropped cotton from april to june from july to august the e et of single cropped cotton was higher than that of intercropped cotton nevertheless in september the e et of intercropped cotton had once again surpassed that of single cropped cotton in addition under jujube cotton intercropping the et of intercropped jujube and cotton was similar with only a difference of 3 17 9 61 between the two although soil evaporation was higher for jujube overall cotton occupying 57 5 of the land accounted for only about 38 of the total evaporation while jujube occupying only 42 5 of the land accounted for about 62 of the total evaporation 3 3 interspecific water distribution in jujube cotton intercropping system 3 3 1 verification of the stable carbon isotope method for measuring cotton transpiration in order to verify the feasibility of measuring transpiration of cotton by a stable carbon isotope method we validated its results against those obtained by the water balance method a comparison of the results is shown in table 4 wherein the simulated relative error 8 98 11 98 was the highest before june 11 the simulated relative error decreased over subsequent years across other periods by about 7 33 7 50 as of october 20 the relative error during the three year period was 4 37 5 61 although this generally represents except for individual periods an overestimation of cotton transpiration nevertheless the relative errors for each simulated period were within an acceptable range thus the stable carbon isotope method can be considered to be in good agreement with the water balance method 3 3 2 verification of the stemflow method for measuring jujube transpiration in order to verify whether transpiration of jujube might be feasibly measured based on stemflow the et of jujube was measured by stemflow micro lysimeter and the water balance method throughout 2015 2017 table 5 the relative errors of the stemflow micro lysimeter method were relatively larger in the period before jun 11 at 8 40 14 08 while the relative errors at other growth stages were 5 02 6 71 nevertheless when considered over the entire growing season the error was 2 19 3 85 thus the results obtained by the stem flow micro lysimeter method can be considered to be consistent with those from the water balance method 3 3 3 transpiration of intercropped jujube and intercropped cotton based on stable carbon isotope and stem flow based measurements transpiration measurements of intercropped jujube and cotton before october 20 were 288 300 mm and 433 445 mm respectively table 6 the measured transpiration of single cropped jujube and cotton was 292 321 mm and 369 376 mm respectively as such the transpiration of single cropped jujube was about 1 04 times that of intercropped jujube and that of single cropped cotton was 0 85 times that of intercropped cotton the transpiration ratio of single cropped jujube and cotton was 0 79 0 85 1 and that of intercropped jujube and cotton was 0 65 0 68 1 the et ratio of intercropped jujube cotton was divided into three stages 1 before june 11 2 from june 11 to august 30 3 after august 30 before june 11 the et ratio of jujube was significantly higher than that of cotton and the transpiration of jujube was 0 91 1 19 times that of cotton from june 11 to august 30 cotton transpiration increased significantly such that jujube transpiration was 0 46 0 73 times that of cotton transpiration this indicated that cotton occupies the dominant position during this period after august 30 the proportion of et attributed to jujube increased and the transpiration of jujube was 0 71 0 79 times that of cotton indicating that jujube et had become dominant 3 4 crop yield and fruit quality the quality change for jujube fruit grown under different planting patterns is shown in table 7 during the three years of the study the sugar content of the fruit followed the order of soluble sugar reducing sugar sucrose and the single jujube fruit contained greater amounts of sucrose than intercropped jujube therefore planting pattern had a significant effect on soluble sugar reducing sugar and sucrose in fruit but had less of an effect on fruit volume and vitamin c content single cropped jujube yield increased from 2564 kg ha to 3322 kg ha between 2015 and 2017 table 8 single cropped cotton yield remained stable at 2625 2774 kg ha across the three years under the intercropping system jujube yield was slightly greater than single cropped jujube in 2015 but 5 47 less in 2016 and 9 25 less in 2017 than single cropped jujube this indicates that jujube growth enhances the intensity of inter species competition exerting an increasingly significant impact on crop yield intercropped cotton is affected by inter specific complementarity and as such its yield was 26 47 greater than single cropped cotton in 2015 however with greater jujube age and correspondingly higher intensity of interspecies competition cotton yields declined as of 2017 intercropped cotton yield was still 20 33 greater than single cropped cotton yield it can be seen from the total income that the income of jujube cotton intercropping increased by 155 compared with single jujube compared with single cotton jujube cotton intercropping increased the total income by 49 therefore intercropping has a very significant improvement on increasing economic benefits in addition from the intensity of interspecific competition we can see that the competitive ability of intercropped jujube was negative during the three years and the overall competitiveness of intercropped jujube was less than that of cotton intercropping tree maturation had a strong influence on the competitive ability of jujube after seven years jujube trees appeared to reach a point where their competitive ability was significantly improved as demonstrated by increased crop yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of intercropping system on soil temperature fluctuations in soil temperature in the jujube cotton intercropping system are governed by many interrelated factors for example in the early planting stages film mulching caused the soil temperature for the cotton crop to rise abnormally emilio 2017 eliciting a large temperature difference compared with the soil temperature in the jujube zone this large disparity in temperature promoted heat transfer in the soil causing the soil temperature under intercrop jujube to exceed that under single cropped jujube in may fig 5 some studies have provided strong evidence that leaf area index is the main feature affecting changes in soil temperature ikeorgu and ezumah 1991 during the day increased leaf area index reduces the solar radiation received by the soil and reduces potential increases in soil temperature at night greater leaf area index hinders the dissipation of long wave radiation energy from the soil surface thereby reducing the rate of soil thermal energy dissipation in this study although the leaf area index varied slightly across single cropped and intercropped jujube fig 6 dense cotton leaves covered the jujube area and affected soil temperature ultimately the daily variation in temperature range and the standard deviation of soil temperature as measured at a depth of 5 cm were about 60 smaller for intercropped jujube than for single cropped jujube table 3 additionally after june the monthly average soil temperature was lower for intercropped jujube than for single cropped jujube fig 5 this kind of soil temperature drop has been found in several intercropped pairings including melon cassava olasantan and babalola 2007 potato maize batugal et al 1990 apple soybean dong et al 2014 and walnut wheat wang et al 2017 some studies have shown that reducing the daily range of soil temperature improves the fruit setting rate and renders trees more resilient to damage caused by extreme weather however a large temperature difference between day and night promotes accumulation of sugar in the fruit and therefore may affect the quality of jujube fruit from an intercropped jujube cotton system wang et al 2017 and cormier et al 2020 reported that intercrops exert a heat preservation effect on fruit trees during the low temperature season when fallen leaves form a dense cover on the ground however this study did not observe this phenomenon in october and in fact during this time the soil temperature of intercropped jujube was still lower than that of single cropped jujube an explanation for this observation may be attributed to the long distance separating the cotton and tree areas such that the fallen leaves did not cover the jujube root area but the cotton plants still provided some shade from the sunlight gong et al 2015 reported that appropriate row spacing could reduce the sheltering effect of low stand crops on high stand crops thus increasing the soil temperature of intercropped high stand crops indeed row spacing can change the boundary pattern of high stand crops decrease air flow huang et al 2013 alter farmland microclimate qiao et al 2012 delay soil temperature dissipation and importantly increase soil temperature however mao et al 2006 and hui et al 2004 found that intercropped grass caused the surface soil temperature of fruit trees to decrease demonstrating that leaves of low stand crops can intercept solar radiation reduce the absorption of solar radiation by soil under the high stand crop and ultimately reduce soil temperature this explanation is consistent with the changes in soil temperature of intercropped jujube observed in this study after july we must acknowledge that intercropping changes the boundary effects of the high stand crop resulting in both warming and cooling effects however the effect of distance on the intensity of this impact remains an open question and should be addressed by further observation and research 4 2 effects of intercropping on soil moisture and interspecific water relations intercropping can change the spatial gradient of et and soil moisture consumption due to interspecific competition and complementarity li et al 2013 the most commonly reported conclusion is that intercropping improves the specific surface coverage and reduces ineffective et chai et al 2014 through the spatial niche compensation effect horton and hart 1998 however some scholars have reported that intercropping may increase et qi et al 2019 in this study intercropping reduced soil evaporation under jujube by 36 46 mm however it also increased the soil evaporation under cotton by 10 20 mm the combined value of jujube and cotton et in the intercropped system was lower throughout the growing season than the et for single cropped jujube and cotton in addition chai et al 2011 found that the intercropped system exhibited a lower average daily soil evaporation than the single cropped system however the cumulative value of soil evaporation over the entire growing season was larger than that of the single cropping we do not find it controversial that intercropping can reduce ineffective et nevertheless some of the preserved water is absorbed by soil and this may increase soil evaporation morris and garrity 1993 this effect is particularly pronounced during the middle and later stages of reproduction fig 7 some areas such as southern xinjiang china experience a severe water deficit during later growth stages as withholding irrigation ensures the accumulation of sugar in fruit and improves the quality of cotton in the absence of irrigation the crop can make full use of the water saved by intercropping rather than losing water to the air via soil evaporation however this increased soil moisture can impact the cotton harvest time over the course of the three years of this experimental field study we observed the actual harvest time of intercropped cotton to occur 15 30 days later than that of single cropped cotton competition and complementarity mechanisms have long been recognized by scientific researchers crop interspecific competition and complementarity mechanisms can occur simultaneously martins et al 2013 he et al 2012 reported that wheat et accounted for 63 66 of the total et in intercropped walnut wheat the greatest contribution of wheat et occurred in the early growth period with smaller contributions during the vigorous growth period in contrast cotton in intercropped jujube cotton exhibited the largest et ratio during the vigorous growth period from june 11 to august 30 transpiration of intercropped cotton accounted for about 65 of total transpiration during this period cotton transpiration was twice that of jujube therefore we believe cotton occupies a dominant position in the intercropped jujube cotton system in agreement with the conclusion reported by li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 reported that interspecific competition ultimately inhibits the growth of both crops in intercropped jujube wheat in this study we likewise observed that jujube growth appeared to be inhibited on the other hand intercropped cotton exhibited noticeably enhanced transpiration and crop yield in addition during the three year period the et of intercropped jujube was reduced by 9 05 10 91 while the transpiration of intercropped cotton increased by 12 15 16 87 therefore entrance of irrigation water into the intercropping system cotton disproportionate interception of irrigation water leading to greater absorption of water by intercropped cotton the position occupied by cotton in the intercropping system is more niche in addition the results of tree research by zhang et al 2013 suggest that as fruit trees age their competitiveness increases thereby inhibiting crop growth the present study demonstrated that the proportion of cotton et gradually decreased over the course of three years therefore as trees age the intensity of interspecific competition will also change at present a large number of studies have utilized the carbon stable isotope method on branches fruit and leaves to evaluate plant wue and crop transpiration du et al 2021 however controversy remains as to whether correlations between wue transpiration and carbon stable isotopes from different plant parts are stable under different water environments this is because carbon stable isotopes and carbon content are easily impacted by a variety of environmental conditions especially under field conditions therefore there are still some limitations regarding the quantification of wue and crop transpiration by using only leaves under different planting patterns and these concerns have yet to be resolved 5 conclusions noticeable temporal and spatial variations in soil temperature were observed in the intercropped system as well as a phase lag phenomenon across different soil depths the daily amplitude and standard deviation of soil temperatures were lower under intercropping than under a single cropping system during the early growth stage intercropping can increase soil temperature in the jujube root zone and these higher temperatures are conducive to germination during the middle growth period intercropping effects can mitigate the influence of extreme weather on plant growth however during the later growth stage intercropping is not conducive to improving crop yield and quality jujube is affected by interspecific competition and cotton cover restricted growth can reduce crop yield and et meanwhile loss of water by evaporation also decreases intercropped cotton intercepts jujube irrigation water causing both et and crop yield of cotton to increase as such cotton dominates the critical period of water demand therefore although intercropping can reduce the loss of water by evaporation and improve the efficiency of land use from the perspective of interspecific water relations the dominant position occupied by cotton has pronounced inhibitory effects on jujube continuous implementation of intercropping over many years is not conducive to the development of fruit tree planting especially as trees become older declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

9948,intercropping is a common strategy to improve land use efficiency in many areas of the world however intercropping induces adaptive changes that remain poorly understood with regard to soil temperature and inter species moisture competition this is especially true for the interspecies relationship between intercropped jujube ziziphus jujuba mill and cotton gossypium hirsutum l to gain insight into this relationship and its influence field experiments were conducted in 2015 2017 to analyze how soil moisture and temperature were affected under jujube cotton intercropping compared with single cropping intercropping lowered the soil temperature under jujube by 0 04 0 87 and lowered soil temperature under cotton by 0 63 2 92 for all months except april and may the soil temperature stability of intercropping was significantly higher than that of monocropping these changes were generally conducive to crop growth although lowered soil temperature during the later growth period was not beneficial to jujube quality intercropping jujube growth was inhibited not only by interspecific competition but also by plastic film mulching of cotton throughout the total growth period both transpiration and soil evaporation in intercropped jujube decreased by 12 mm and 39 mm respectively and crop yields decreased by 20 30 however due to disproportionate absorption of irrigation water by cotton evapotranspiration during the entire growing season increased by 30 mm and crop yield increased by 30 in addition through carbon stable isotope method the transpiration ratio of single cropped jujube and cotton was 0 79 0 85 1 and that of intercropped jujube and cotton was 0 65 0 68 1 cotton dominated during the critical period of water demand therefore although intercropping can reduce water loss by evaporation and improve the efficiency of land use from the perspective of interspecific water relations the dominant position of cotton had pronounced inhibitory effects on jujube continuous implementation of intercropping over many years is not conducive to the development of fruit tree planting especially as trees become older keywords soil temperature evapotranspiration crop water distribution stable carbon isotope yield 1 introduction since the chinese government s initiation of the one belt one road policy safe 2018 the role of jujube production has rapidly expanded to become one of the pillar industries in xinjiang however the land available for cultivation is limited such that increasing the planting area of fruit trees would necessarily reduce that available for other important crops making the situation more difficult young 1 7 year old fruit trees produce low yields an ideal solution to these problems is to promote intercropping xinjiang is especially well suited to intercropping because its main cash crops cotton and jujube the latter of which had a planting area of 476 250 ha in 2019 sbx 2020 essentially share a growing season and are harvested once a year when two plants share a niche competition between the species is inevitable although it is well known that jujube cotton intercropping improves land economic benefits there is limited data regarding tree crop competition such data could be used to better understand interspecies competition and complementarity that would provide farmers with scientific guidance and agricultural economic benefits soil temperature is a critical factor for plant growth and agricultural development suitable soil temperature aids gas exchange between the soil and the atmosphere enhances microbial activity from the soil and enhances root activity however soil temperature changes not only depend on atmospheric temperature fluctuations but also are impacted by cropping systems especially in intercropping systems complicated boundary conditions affect the change of soil temperature and have some influence on the physiological development of crops nyawade et al 2019 reported that a suitable planting model intercropping increases surface coverage and soil moisture content improves the ability of plants to intercept radiation energy and significantly reduces soil temperature in the 0 30 cm layer li et al 2012 reported that intercropping produces soil temperature changes by altering crop canopy width and growth potential therefore in some hot months such as june to july intercropping can effectively relieve the damage to crops caused by high temperature stress zhang et al 2016 other research has indicated that intercropping can inhibit decreases in soil temperature liu et al 2013 olasantan 1988 reported that in an intercropped system the low level crop hinders the dissipation of soil temperature to the high level crop at night wang et al 2017 reported that intercropping delayed the decrease in soil temperature occurring in november bolstering root growth of intercropped winter wheat and consequently increasing its yield intercropping exhibits a two way dynamic regulation function peng et al 2008 making soil temperature a crucial parameter for assessing intercropping functioning an important aspect of agroforestry research is assessing the effects of planting patterns on soil water change and water competition among species researchers generally consider intercropping to improve water use efficiency and to reduce soil evaporation ernst and bianculli 2013 fan et al 2020 for instance chen et al 2015 reported that maize pea intercropping increased grain yields by an average of 31 3 and improved wue by 21 9 compared with the corresponding sole maize and sole pea sharing resources in the rooting zones between the intercrops serves as a major mechanism responsible for the large yield and wue advantages for maize pea intercropping in arid areas furthermore it has been recognized that having two crops with a great difference in interspecific competitiveness leads to the restriction of less competitive crops thereby reducing evapotranspiration et peng et al 2015 zhao et al 2017 notably the common approach of these studies examining water in intercropping systems is their tendency to utilize soil evaporation or to monitor soil moisture changes neglecting interspecies competition with respect to water and affording only indirect results regarding physiological et these commonly used methods have yet to be verified since in agroforestry intercropping the causal tree occupies a relatively small niche such that irrigation water administered to fruit trees inevitably migrates elsewhere in the soil therefore how the various components of the agroforestry model use and allocate water resources remains unclear stable carbon isotope technology has become a powerful tool for revealing the interaction between plants and the environment cui et al 2009 pascual et al 2013 when plants absorb co2 in the air for photosynthesis 12co2 is easier to cleave than 13co2 in other words 12co2 is more likely to participate in photosynthesis than 13co2 gessler et al 2008 in addition different catalytic reactions of photosynthetic carboxylase to co2 are easy to enrich 13c into mesophyll tissue badeck et al 2005 producing higher accumulation as photosynthesis progresses therefore the long term water use efficiency of plants can be effectively evaluated by the δ13c value yu et al 2021 remarkable differences among 13c 12c of different plant organizations and 13c 12c in each organ have been negatively correlated with water use efficiency wei et al 2013 this phenomenon cannot be completely explained by the difference of assimilates produced at different times it is called an indication of post photosynthetic discrimination badeck et al 2005 previous research has demonstrated that 13c 12c from leaves of maize zea mays l twohey et al 2019 alfalfa medicago sativa l zhu et al 2019 wheat triticum aestivum l he et al 2012 and cassia seed cassia obtusifolia l chen et al 2014 can characterize crop water use efficiency and transpiration however some research has shown that wue under specific ambient conditions 13c 12c of growth period and sampling tissue might be low correlation with water use efficiency and transpiration anyia et al 2007 wahbi and shaaban 2011 therefore verification of using 13c 12c to quantify water use efficiency and transpiration is required in arid areas for the present study we measured soil temperature soil moisture jujube stem flow and the stable carbon isotope composition of cotton leaves from intercropped jujube cotton systems all of which afforded examination of soil temperature and inter species moisture relationships under intercropping the main objectives of this study were to identify 1 how jujube cotton intercropping impacts soil temperature 2 how crop et changes due to intercropping 3 how intercropping influences the amount of water consumed by intercropped jujube and cotton and the relationship between the species with respect to water consumption and transmission 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at the experimental base at xinjiang agricultural university in the aksu region of xinjiang from 2015 to 2017 80 14 e 41 16 this region has a temperate continental arid desert climate and features a substantial difference between day and night temperatures in 2008 2019 annual average parameters for this region include a total solar radiation of 533 620 kj cm 2 total sunshine hours of 2728 3014 h a frost free period of 203 224 d precipitation of 69 mm temperature of 11 4 the soil water holding capacity is 28 the depth to groundwater exceeds 10 m wang 2016 the soil at the test field is mainly comprised of sandy loam and the texture composition is detailed in table 1 2 2 study design the crops used in this study were cotton no 49 xinluzhong and 5 year old jujube planted 2015 cotton was sown in mid april and harvested at the end of october jujube entered the germination stage in late april and was harvested in mid november jujube plants were spaced 1 m apart in rows spaced 4 m apart fig 1 drip tape lines were located 30 cm away from either side of each tree row cotton was planted between jujube rows with two sets of four rows of cotton soil covered by colorless plastic mulch 1 5 m wide 0 05 mm thick cotton row spacing was 20 40 20 cm in each set and plant spacing within a row was 8 cm drip tape lines were centered in the 40 cm interrow space at the center of each four row set of cotton fig 1 drippers within the drip irrigation tapes were spaced 20 cm apart and the dripper discharge was 1 38 l h the experimental design was a single factor field experiment with three replications of three treatments comprised of 1 single cropped jujube 2 single cropped cotton 3 intercropped jujube cotton there were independent irrigation systems for intercropped jujube and intercropped cotton the experiment was carried out over the course of three years 2015 2017 the irrigation schedule for each treatment is shown in table 2 in 2015 and 2016 the experimental field was irrigated on a regular schedule according to the fixed irrigation quota method in 2017 the penman monteith method allen et al 1998 was utilized to guide irrigation in the experimental field irrigation was applied every seven days the irrigation amounts were applied to replace the cumulative et of the previous irrigation period the jujube and cotton crop coefficients were calculated as reported by hong et al 2014 and by zhang et al 2004 and ma et al 2015 respectively fertilizer applications and crop management were based on the local conditions 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 soil moisture content previous studies have demonstrated root water uptake of young jujube to be mainly concentrated in the 0 100 cm soil layer shi et al 2015 therefore this study focused on changes in soil moisture at this layer corresponding to the jujube root zone jujube et was calculated by the water balance method 1 et c i p s r d where et c is crop evapotranspiration mm i is the irrigation amount mm p is the rainfall amount mm s is the change in soil moisture storage mm r is the surface runoff mm and d is the deep percolation mm soil moisture storage was determined using the trime iph trime pico iph channel tech china soil moisture measurement system as measured before and after each occurrence of irrigation and after each rainfall additionally soil moisture was measured if a crop underwent a change in growth stage the exact locations for the soil moisture measurements are shown in fig 2 for the single jujube it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the five trime sensors fig 2 a was the corresponding soil moisture content for the treatment for the single cotton it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the three trime sensors fig 2 c was the corresponding soil moisture content for the treatment it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the trime sensors at 30 cm and 50 cm between jujube plants in the jujube row and at 30 cm 50 cm and 70 cm from the jujube row was the soil moisture for intercropped jujube fig 2 b it was assumed that the mean value of soil moisture content measured by the trime sensors at 70 cm 100 cm and 125 cm from the jujube row was the soil moisture for intercropped cotton fig 2 b in addition we assumed surface runoff to be 0 mm due to the use of drip irrigation we also assumed deep percolation to be 0 mm due to soil moisture being relatively stable in the 90 100 cm layer soil moisture content was about 15 72 as measured by trime iph sensors during the entire growing season 2 3 2 soil evaporation soil evaporation was determined using micro lysimeters that were prepared in house from pvc tubes the micro lysimeters contained small isolated volumes of bare soil positioned flush with or slightly above the soil surface daamen et al 1993 and were weighed using electronic balances with 0 1 g precision daily at 10 00 a m to determine water loss each micro lysimeter was 11 cm in diameter and 15 cm in depth the outer barrel was 12 cm in diameter and 20 cm in depth in order to minimize differences between soil moisture in the micro lysimeters and between the rows the soil in the micro lysimeters was replaced every 1 2 days and any time it rained we replaced and measured the micro lysimeters 24 h after irrigation events in order to get rid of the interstitial water that was leached by gravity and the remaining water was the held in micropores the jujube micro lysimeters were placed at 50 cm between jujube plants and 40 cm from the jujube row the mean value measured by the micro lysimeters was reported as the soil evaporation the cotton micro lysimeters were placed in the bare space between the two plastic mulch sheets and under the drip irrigation tape calculation of soil evaporation for the cotton field was determined according to the proportional areas of the plastic mulch and bare land 2 3 3 soil temperature soil temperature was measured every 30 min at depths of 5 10 20 30 and 40 cm using a microlite u disk temperature recorder microlite u fourtec israel temperature sensors were located at 50 cm between jujube plants and 30 cm from the jujube row in the jujube only fields in cotton only fields sensors were located at drip tape and 30 cm from the drip tape the drip irrigation tape intercropped fields had temperature sensors positioned at 50 cm 95 cm 125 cm 155 cm between jujube plants and 30 cm from the jujube row 2 3 4 leaf area index the leaf area index of the jujube was measured using a hemiview plant canopy analyzer hmv1 v9 harvesting tech china each data acquisition period occurred before 9 00 a m when there was no strong direct beam solar radiation beginning may 9 leaf area index was determined every 7 10 days until the end of the growing season based on measurements from three jujube plants from each treatment cotton leaf area was measured using a wanshen la s leaf area scanner la s wanshen china beginning may 25 measurements were collected every 10 15 days from nine cotton plants from each treatment until the end of the growing season 2 3 5 determination of stable carbon isotopes in cotton ten mature cotton leaves representing all positions of the plant canopy were harvested at five dates june 11 july 11 july 30 august 30 and october 20 composite leaf samples comprising all 10 mature leaves on a given collection date were oven dried to a constant weight at 65 c and homogenized to fine powder with a ball mill deco pbm v 2l deco equipment tech china if deemed necessary the samples were passed through 80 mesh sieves finally the carbon isotope ratio and carbon mass fraction of the cotton leaves were measured using a stable isotope mass spectrometer hs2022 sercon british 2 3 6 jujube stemflow transpiration rates from single cropped and intercropped treatments were collected every 10 min from three representative standard trees by heat diffusion probe stemflow sf g ecomatik germany in order to measure the cross sectional area of the water conducting parts of the sapwood and heartwood comprising the tree a growth cone was used to take measurements 20 cm above the soil surface at the end of the experiment 2 3 7 crop yield and fruit quality yields were measured at the end of the growing season from each test plot 10 m2 harvest area in cotton and 10 jujube plants in addition sampled and analyzed solube sugar

responses were consistent with air temperature showing a sinusoidal s curve the amplitudes of the fluctuations of soil temperature were negatively correlated with soil depth in other words at greater depths fluctuations in soil temperature tended to be more muted changes in soil temperature generally exhibited some degree of lag compared with air temperature although there is no obvious rule which described how the lag time varied in different soil layers the fluctuation range of soil temperatures was lower in the intercropped system than in the single cropped system and more evident during the day than at night the standard deviation and daily amplitude of temperature fluctuations at different soil depths were smaller under intercropping than under the single cropped system table 3 as an example consider the 5 cm depth for intercropping the standard deviation of temperature under the intercropping treatment was about 38 of the standard deviation of single cropped jujube and about 42 of the standard deviation of single cropped cotton the difference between the temperature fluctuations of the single cropped and intercropped systems had a slight downward trend with increasing soil depth therefore soil temperature stability was higher in the intercropped system than in the single cropping system 3 1 2 monthly variation of surface soil temperature due to the effects of mulching the soil temperature in the cotton zone generally exceeded soil temperature in the jujube zone naturally a higher temperature difference promotes heat transfer in may the soil temperature at 5 cm under intercropped cotton was observed to be 0 77 1 50 c lower than the temperature under single cropped cotton fig 5 meanwhile the soil temperature of intercropped jujube slightly exceeded that of single cropped jujube by 0 51 0 82 c after june intercropped cotton began to affect the soil temperature of jujube the mechanism for this influence was that high density cotton blocked direct solar radiation to the jujube zone thereby reducing soil heating accordingly the soil temperature under the intercropped jujube was lower than under the single cropped jujube and the disparity between the two gradually widened with time the leaf area index of intercropped cotton was significantly higher than that of single cropped cotton fig 6 rendering the shading effect on the ground to be higher for the former than the latter and contributing to a similar trend for the soil temperatures under the respective crops except for april and may intercropping generally produced lower soil temperatures with soil temperatures under jujube reduced by 0 04 0 87 c and soil temperatures under cotton reduced by 0 63 2 92 c 3 2 effect of intercropping on soil moisture the continuous growth of single cropped jujube caused et to increase from 539 mm in 2015 to 569 mm in 2017 however et of intercropped jujube was inhibited by inter species competition such that from 2015 to 2017 the et of jujube only increased from 490 to 507 mm a notably smaller difference than seen for single cropped jujube fig 7 a therefore intercropping had an overall negative impact on jujube et however the presence of cotton mulching reduced soil evaporation under intercrop jujube by 34 42 mm demonstrating that intercropping reduces the loss of water occurring through evaporation water that would have normally been unavailable for transpiration throughout the three year study period e et in single cropped and intercropped jujube was similar in may but after june e of intercropped jujube was significantly smaller than e of single cropped jujube and this difference increased with tree age by 2017 e of single cropped jujube accounted for 45 83 of et while e of intercrop jujube accounted for 43 12 of et cotton et did not exhibit a significant difference between single and intercropping systems over the course of the experiment however et of intercropped cotton was higher by about 14 than et of single cropped cotton during the three years fig 7 b therefore intercropping had an overall positive impact on cotton given the et from each month of the experiment the differences in et between single cropped and intercropped cotton were mostly concentrated in the time spanning april to june during the water control stage during this time the et of intercropped cotton increased abnormally this in turn resulted in an increase in the e et for intercropped cotton from april to june from july to august the e et of single cropped cotton was higher than that of intercropped cotton nevertheless in september the e et of intercropped cotton had once again surpassed that of single cropped cotton in addition under jujube cotton intercropping the et of intercropped jujube and cotton was similar with only a difference of 3 17 9 61 between the two although soil evaporation was higher for jujube overall cotton occupying 57 5 of the land accounted for only about 38 of the total evaporation while jujube occupying only 42 5 of the land accounted for about 62 of the total evaporation 3 3 interspecific water distribution in jujube cotton intercropping system 3 3 1 verification of the stable carbon isotope method for measuring cotton transpiration in order to verify the feasibility of measuring transpiration of cotton by a stable carbon isotope method we validated its results against those obtained by the water balance method a comparison of the results is shown in table 4 wherein the simulated relative error 8 98 11 98 was the highest before june 11 the simulated relative error decreased over subsequent years across other periods by about 7 33 7 50 as of october 20 the relative error during the three year period was 4 37 5 61 although this generally represents except for individual periods an overestimation of cotton transpiration nevertheless the relative errors for each simulated period were within an acceptable range thus the stable carbon isotope method can be considered to be in good agreement with the water balance method 3 3 2 verification of the stemflow method for measuring jujube transpiration in order to verify whether transpiration of jujube might be feasibly measured based on stemflow the et of jujube was measured by stemflow micro lysimeter and the water balance method throughout 2015 2017 table 5 the relative errors of the stemflow micro lysimeter method were relatively larger in the period before jun 11 at 8 40 14 08 while the relative errors at other growth stages were 5 02 6 71 nevertheless when considered over the entire growing season the error was 2 19 3 85 thus the results obtained by the stem flow micro lysimeter method can be considered to be consistent with those from the water balance method 3 3 3 transpiration of intercropped jujube and intercropped cotton based on stable carbon isotope and stem flow based measurements transpiration measurements of intercropped jujube and cotton before october 20 were 288 300 mm and 433 445 mm respectively table 6 the measured transpiration of single cropped jujube and cotton was 292 321 mm and 369 376 mm respectively as such the transpiration of single cropped jujube was about 1 04 times that of intercropped jujube and that of single cropped cotton was 0 85 times that of intercropped cotton the transpiration ratio of single cropped jujube and cotton was 0 79 0 85 1 and that of intercropped jujube and cotton was 0 65 0 68 1 the et ratio of intercropped jujube cotton was divided into three stages 1 before june 11 2 from june 11 to august 30 3 after august 30 before june 11 the et ratio of jujube was significantly higher than that of cotton and the transpiration of jujube was 0 91 1 19 times that of cotton from june 11 to august 30 cotton transpiration increased significantly such that jujube transpiration was 0 46 0 73 times that of cotton transpiration this indicated that cotton occupies the dominant position during this period after august 30 the proportion of et attributed to jujube increased and the transpiration of jujube was 0 71 0 79 times that of cotton indicating that jujube et had become dominant 3 4 crop yield and fruit quality the quality change for jujube fruit grown under different planting patterns is shown in table 7 during the three years of the study the sugar content of the fruit followed the order of soluble sugar reducing sugar sucrose and the single jujube fruit contained greater amounts of sucrose than intercropped jujube therefore planting pattern had a significant effect on soluble sugar reducing sugar and sucrose in fruit but had less of an effect on fruit volume and vitamin c content single cropped jujube yield increased from 2564 kg ha to 3322 kg ha between 2015 and 2017 table 8 single cropped cotton yield remained stable at 2625 2774 kg ha across the three years under the intercropping system jujube yield was slightly greater than single cropped jujube in 2015 but 5 47 less in 2016 and 9 25 less in 2017 than single cropped jujube this indicates that jujube growth enhances the intensity of inter species competition exerting an increasingly significant impact on crop yield intercropped cotton is affected by inter specific complementarity and as such its yield was 26 47 greater than single cropped cotton in 2015 however with greater jujube age and correspondingly higher intensity of interspecies competition cotton yields declined as of 2017 intercropped cotton yield was still 20 33 greater than single cropped cotton yield it can be seen from the total income that the income of jujube cotton intercropping increased by 155 compared with single jujube compared with single cotton jujube cotton intercropping increased the total income by 49 therefore intercropping has a very significant improvement on increasing economic benefits in addition from the intensity of interspecific competition we can see that the competitive ability of intercropped jujube was negative during the three years and the overall competitiveness of intercropped jujube was less than that of cotton intercropping tree maturation had a strong influence on the competitive ability of jujube after seven years jujube trees appeared to reach a point where their competitive ability was significantly improved as demonstrated by increased crop yield 4 discussion 4 1 effects of intercropping system on soil temperature fluctuations in soil temperature in the jujube cotton intercropping system are governed by many interrelated factors for example in the early planting stages film mulching caused the soil temperature for the cotton crop to rise abnormally emilio 2017 eliciting a large temperature difference compared with the soil temperature in the jujube zone this large disparity in temperature promoted heat transfer in the soil causing the soil temperature under intercrop jujube to exceed that under single cropped jujube in may fig 5 some studies have provided strong evidence that leaf area index is the main feature affecting changes in soil temperature ikeorgu and ezumah 1991 during the day increased leaf area index reduces the solar radiation received by the soil and reduces potential increases in soil temperature at night greater leaf area index hinders the dissipation of long wave radiation energy from the soil surface thereby reducing the rate of soil thermal energy dissipation in this study although the leaf area index varied slightly across single cropped and intercropped jujube fig 6 dense cotton leaves covered the jujube area and affected soil temperature ultimately the daily variation in temperature range and the standard deviation of soil temperature as measured at a depth of 5 cm were about 60 smaller for intercropped jujube than for single cropped jujube table 3 additionally after june the monthly average soil temperature was lower for intercropped jujube than for single cropped jujube fig 5 this kind of soil temperature drop has been found in several intercropped pairings including melon cassava olasantan and babalola 2007 potato maize batugal et al 1990 apple soybean dong et al 2014 and walnut wheat wang et al 2017 some studies have shown that reducing the daily range of soil temperature improves the fruit setting rate and renders trees more resilient to damage caused by extreme weather however a large temperature difference between day and night promotes accumulation of sugar in the fruit and therefore may affect the quality of jujube fruit from an intercropped jujube cotton system wang et al 2017 and cormier et al 2020 reported that intercrops exert a heat preservation effect on fruit trees during the low temperature season when fallen leaves form a dense cover on the ground however this study did not observe this phenomenon in october and in fact during this time the soil temperature of intercropped jujube was still lower than that of single cropped jujube an explanation for this observation may be attributed to the long distance separating the cotton and tree areas such that the fallen leaves did not cover the jujube root area but the cotton plants still provided some shade from the sunlight gong et al 2015 reported that appropriate row spacing could reduce the sheltering effect of low stand crops on high stand crops thus increasing the soil temperature of intercropped high stand crops indeed row spacing can change the boundary pattern of high stand crops decrease air flow huang et al 2013 alter farmland microclimate qiao et al 2012 delay soil temperature dissipation and importantly increase soil temperature however mao et al 2006 and hui et al 2004 found that intercropped grass caused the surface soil temperature of fruit trees to decrease demonstrating that leaves of low stand crops can intercept solar radiation reduce the absorption of solar radiation by soil under the high stand crop and ultimately reduce soil temperature this explanation is consistent with the changes in soil temperature of intercropped jujube observed in this study after july we must acknowledge that intercropping changes the boundary effects of the high stand crop resulting in both warming and cooling effects however the effect of distance on the intensity of this impact remains an open question and should be addressed by further observation and research 4 2 effects of intercropping on soil moisture and interspecific water relations intercropping can change the spatial gradient of et and soil moisture consumption due to interspecific competition and complementarity li et al 2013 the most commonly reported conclusion is that intercropping improves the specific surface coverage and reduces ineffective et chai et al 2014 through the spatial niche compensation effect horton and hart 1998 however some scholars have reported that intercropping may increase et qi et al 2019 in this study intercropping reduced soil evaporation under jujube by 36 46 mm however it also increased the soil evaporation under cotton by 10 20 mm the combined value of jujube and cotton et in the intercropped system was lower throughout the growing season than the et for single cropped jujube and cotton in addition chai et al 2011 found that the intercropped system exhibited a lower average daily soil evaporation than the single cropped system however the cumulative value of soil evaporation over the entire growing season was larger than that of the single cropping we do not find it controversial that intercropping can reduce ineffective et nevertheless some of the preserved water is absorbed by soil and this may increase soil evaporation morris and garrity 1993 this effect is particularly pronounced during the middle and later stages of reproduction fig 7 some areas such as southern xinjiang china experience a severe water deficit during later growth stages as withholding irrigation ensures the accumulation of sugar in fruit and improves the quality of cotton in the absence of irrigation the crop can make full use of the water saved by intercropping rather than losing water to the air via soil evaporation however this increased soil moisture can impact the cotton harvest time over the course of the three years of this experimental field study we observed the actual harvest time of intercropped cotton to occur 15 30 days later than that of single cropped cotton competition and complementarity mechanisms have long been recognized by scientific researchers crop interspecific competition and complementarity mechanisms can occur simultaneously martins et al 2013 he et al 2012 reported that wheat et accounted for 63 66 of the total et in intercropped walnut wheat the greatest contribution of wheat et occurred in the early growth period with smaller contributions during the vigorous growth period in contrast cotton in intercropped jujube cotton exhibited the largest et ratio during the vigorous growth period from june 11 to august 30 transpiration of intercropped cotton accounted for about 65 of total transpiration during this period cotton transpiration was twice that of jujube therefore we believe cotton occupies a dominant position in the intercropped jujube cotton system in agreement with the conclusion reported by li et al 2014 wang et al 2014 reported that interspecific competition ultimately inhibits the growth of both crops in intercropped jujube wheat in this study we likewise observed that jujube growth appeared to be inhibited on the other hand intercropped cotton exhibited noticeably enhanced transpiration and crop yield in addition during the three year period the et of intercropped jujube was reduced by 9 05 10 91 while the transpiration of intercropped cotton increased by 12 15 16 87 therefore entrance of irrigation water into the intercropping system cotton disproportionate interception of irrigation water leading to greater absorption of water by intercropped cotton the position occupied by cotton in the intercropping system is more niche in addition the results of tree research by zhang et al 2013 suggest that as fruit trees age their competitiveness increases thereby inhibiting crop growth the present study demonstrated that the proportion of cotton et gradually decreased over the course of three years therefore as trees age the intensity of interspecific competition will also change at present a large number of studies have utilized the carbon stable isotope method on branches fruit and leaves to evaluate plant wue and crop transpiration du et al 2021 however controversy remains as to whether correlations between wue transpiration and carbon stable isotopes from different plant parts are stable under different water environments this is because carbon stable isotopes and carbon content are easily impacted by a variety of environmental conditions especially under field conditions therefore there are still some limitations regarding the quantification of wue and crop transpiration by using only leaves under different planting patterns and these concerns have yet to be resolved 5 conclusions noticeable temporal and spatial variations in soil temperature were observed in the intercropped system as well as a phase lag phenomenon across different soil depths the daily amplitude and standard deviation of soil temperatures were lower under intercropping than under a single cropping system during the early growth stage intercropping can increase soil temperature in the jujube root zone and these higher temperatures are conducive to germination during the middle growth period intercropping effects can mitigate the influence of extreme weather on plant growth however during the later growth stage intercropping is not conducive to improving crop yield and quality jujube is affected by interspecific competition and cotton cover restricted growth can reduce crop yield and et meanwhile loss of water by evaporation also decreases intercropped cotton intercepts jujube irrigation water causing both et and crop yield of cotton to increase as such cotton dominates the critical period of water demand therefore although intercropping can reduce the loss of water by evaporation and improve the efficiency of land use from the perspective of interspecific water relations the dominant position occupied by cotton has pronounced inhibitory effects on jujube continuous implementation of intercropping over many years is not conducive to the development of fruit tree planting especially as trees become older declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

soil phosphorus p however the effect of different management practices on the mechanism of runoff p fractions and possible tradeoffs associated with consecutive rainstorms is not well understood this study aggregated management practices biochar grassing and planting modes to evaluate the surface pathways of p loss from loessial bare and grassed slopes with different slope angles 10 15 and 20 and consecutive rainstorms 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 results indicated that i the highest sediment yield rate and total phosphorus loss concentrations were registered during the first rainstorm event 10 slope and 60 mm h 1 soil erosion and p loss under different rainfall intensities could be effectively reduced by 0 3 biochar grassed slope with horizontal ridge but were aggravated under bare slope with 3 6 biochar or grassed slope with 6 biochar ii planting grass on bare slope could effectively mitigate erosion and runoff p at different rainfall intensities and the reduction rate increased with increased rainfall intensity the sediment reduction effect of bare slope with horizontal ridge decreased with increased rainfall intensity and was liable to fail in the 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities iii the particulate phosphorus pp was the primary loss fraction of soil p from loessial sloping land 80 and pp increased with increased biochar content and rainfall intensity but reduced by grass and horizontal ridge interventions integrating grass with horizontal ridge was considered to be the most effective way to control erosion and protect soil fertility these outcomes provide underlying insights for employing appropriate best management practices bmps to decrease runoff p on sloping soils which can be highlighted through a reasonable allocation of biochar ridge growing plants and other bmps keywords rainfall intensity horizontal ridge vegetation coverage biochar sloping land runoff phosphorus 1 introduction soil erosion on sloping land not only aggravates the degree of desertification but also causes degradation of soil fertility and deterioration of soil physical and chemical properties zhao and li 2016 studies have shown that controlling soil and water losses is indispensable for alleviating p losses from sloping farmland he et al 2020 because runoff p was mainly lost through overland flow dominantly in the form of particulate phosphorus pp deng et al 2019 particularly p in runoff from bare loessial soil consists almost entirely of the reactive pp form 96 6 regardless of rainfall intensity 45 60 75 90 105 and 120 mm h 1 and slope 5 10 15 20 and 25 wu et al 2021 identifying ways to quantify the processes controlling the transfer of soil p to runoff based on the dominant form of p in runoff dp or pp and understanding of possible tradeoffs between the two forms are two important challenges in future soil conservation schemes at different spatial scales dodd and sharpley 2016 this is also the key knowledge gap between the surface pathways of p loss under consecutive rainstorms and the environmental significance of the various forms of mobilized p and their subsequent transformations in fact the long term soil erosion due to loose soil structure sparse vegetation and concentrated rainstorm in the loess plateau china has shaped many ravines and a large number of loessial slopes wu and ma 2015 which increases the structural connectivity of surface susceptibility to runoff generation and sediment detachment and transport williams et al 2014 therefore a series of close to nature engineering agricultural and biological practices had been carried out on the sloping land of the loess plateau since the 1990s li et al 2019 the most commonly used best management practices bmps in this region can be grouped according to their functions firstly buffer zones or filter strips are bmps that reduce the transport of pollutants and are considered structural practices wojciechowska et al 2019 the most prominent pollutant removal processes in filter strips tend to be infiltration of dissolved pollutants and deposition of sediment bound pollutants wang et al 2017 secondly horizontal ridges increase surface roughness by changing slope microtopography and intercepts runoff by ridges and hills zheng et al 2016 which can effectively achieve soil consolidation and water storage luo et al 2015 however ridges and hills can easily be destroyed by runoff scouring under heavy rainstorm thus intensifying soil erosion and sediment bound nutrient loss from the slope surface wang et al 2018 thirdly as a new type of slow release carrier of n and p fertilizer biochar has characteristics of being porous large specific surface area and is rich in functional groups lv et al 2015 it can be used to ameliorate physical chemical and biological properties of soil if reasonable considering the cost effectiveness and irreversibility of biochar application chu et al 2014 these above bmps reinforce each other and the implementation of a single bmp is rarely practiced sharpley 2006 panagopoulos et al 2012 this is because the soil erosion resistance and pollution control of a single practice are often limited under extreme rainstorms sommerlot et al 2013 more importantly different bmps are required to target different forms of p loss and the guidance for policymakers to implement strategies targeting particulate p pp reductions in erosion and dissolved p dp losses in runoff bundy et al 2001 further comparative analysis of the reduction efficiency of a single practice or reasonable combination of different agricultural management practices is the key step in the study of soil and nutrient loss control of sloping land sharpley 2013 carstensen et al 2020 rainfall is the precondition of soil erosion on slope surface and the material basis of runoff generation zhou et al 2019a it has high energy that packs the bare soil surface and disperses soil aggregates common observations show that the two important rainfall variables that determine storm erosivity are rainfall amount and intensity wu et al 2018a frequent alternation of drying rewetting in soil caused by consecutive rainstorms is one of the most extensive abiotic stresses that soil experiences ren et al 2015 it plays an important role in controlling the release of nutrients zhang et al 2010 and thus increases the risk of surface water eutrophication gu et al 2018 moreover another important factor relevant to soil erosion is slope steepness wu et al 2020 the steepness of a land influences erosion in a variety of ways for example an increase in the velocity of the runoff due to the high slope causes a large amount of soil to be collected and transported fang 2021 and the detention of water in a surface is reduced as the slope increases due to the reduced capacity of depressions and furrows li et al 2021 many experimental attempts to integrate environmental factors including slope and consecutive rainstorms into laboratory or field scales have been extensively made in order to explore the effect of drying rewetting process on soil aggregates soil microorganisms soil erosion and nutrient release turner and haygarth 2001 dinh et al 2017 blackwell et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however the effects of sloping management practices especially biochar grassing and planting modes on the surface pathways of p loss associated with the drying rewetting process by variable consecutive rainstorms under different slopes have not been completely considered in previous studies therefore laboratory studies with simulated consecutive rainstorms with controlled conditions of initial soil moisture rainfall intensity slope angle biochar grassing and planting modes were designed to quantify the processes controlling the transfer of soil p to runoff based on the dominant form of p in runoff dp or pp and possible tradeoffs this is critical to test hypotheses regarding the need to design management recommendations to minimize losses of different p forms with the most significant pollution potential the objectives of this study were to i examine the efficiency of agricultural interventions such as biochar horizontal ridge and grassing on slope erosion and runoff p processes under drying rewetting alternation caused by simulated consecutive rainstorms 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 ii identify the surface pathways of p loss under different bare and grassed sloping soils 10 15 and 20 and iii assess the mechanisms of agricultural interventions in minimizing slope erosion and regulating runoff p fractions this study will contribute to deepening the understanding of slope erosion and runoff p processes in the effects of different agricultural management practices of biochar ridge and grassing by employing consecutive rainstorm experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff flume and simulated rainfall the experiment was conducted in the side flow liquid jet rainfall system zone of the artificial simulated rainfall hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china the rainfall height of the side flow liquid jet rainfall system is 16 m which meets all the conditions of rainfall raindrops required to reach the terminal speed the range of rainfall intensity is 40 260 mm h 1 the rainfall uniformity is 80 and the maximum duration of rainfall is 12 h zheng and zhao 2004 twelve steel runoff flumes with the characteristics of variable slopes 10 15 and 20 were designed in this study fig 1 the sizes of each runoff flume were 2 m length 1 m width 0 45 m height each group of flumes was separated from the middle by two small flumes with a total of six small flumes in each rainfall event with conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting respectively the standard of horizontal ridge was defined as ridge height of 5 cm ridge top spacing of 10 cm and ridge width of 5 cm and was applied on one side of the runoff flume a v shaped device is installed at the outlet of flume to collect runoff the rainstorm intensity of this experiment was designed as 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the rainfall duration was maintained as 90 min 60 min and 45 min respectively because the total rainfall volume was 90 mm in each rainstorm event three rainfall intensities were applied to the same flume consecutively and the test order of slope under the same rainfall intensity was 10 15 and 20 before each rainfall test the rainfall intensity was calibrated at least three times and the corresponding sampling time was 2 min until the final error of rainfall intensity was maintained within the range of 3 mm h 1 of the designed rainfall intensity and the final rainfall uniformity reached 80 following this the tarpaulin was opened immediately to start the rainfall test and the starting rainfall time was recorded 2 2 biochar loessial soil and perennial ryegrass sawdust biochar with particles of mesh size 80 400 provided by shaanxi yixin bioenergy technology development co ltd produced by apple branches under partial hypoxia fired by the brick kiln method at 600 was evenly added to the tested soil according to the requirements of the experiment 0 3 and 6 the tested loessial soil was classified as calcic cambisols according to the soil classification system used by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations iuss working group wrb 2015 or ustochnept according to usda soil taxonomy and was taken from the louping project site in ansai county shaanxi province china the physicochemical properties of the tested loessial soil were determined as follows alkaline and silty loam soil antecedent soil moisture was 6 8 ph value was 7 6 soil particle compositions were 12 36 clay 0 002 mm 66 15 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 21 49 sand 0 05 mm tn and tp contents were 0 43 g kg 1 and 0 49 g kg 1 respectively before filling the loessial soil into the flume the soil needed to be firstly dried in the sun and sieved through a 10 mm sieve to remove stones roots and debris subsequently the details regarding the soil pretreatment were as follows i the sprayer was used to sprinkle superphosphate dosage ssp dissolved in distilled water into the soil this was done to ensure that the original soil p content of 0 495 g kg 1 and soil moisture content of 6 8 were modified to 0 605 g kg 1 and 10 time domain reflectory tdr fieldscout 6445 tdr 150 spectrum technologies inc united states of america respectively according to the values of the soil from ansai county wang et al 2014 wu et al 2018b ii biochar with 3 and 6 mass percentage was weighed using an electronic balance to determine the amount of biochar to be applied biochar fertilizer and soil were thoroughly blended with a mixer and then sealed and left for 24 h to form the tested fertile soil for standby iii the layered filling method was adopted to fill the runoff flume in order to ensure uniformity of the tested soil and the soil bulk density was controlled to be 1 2 0 2 g cm 3 initially gauze and 5 cm fine sand were laid at the bottom of the flume following this four layers with 10 cm thickness of soil were successively filled to ensure uniform soil bulk density and 5 cm superelevation was maintained to prevent runoff and sediment from splashing out during rainfall the lower layer was abraded to make the upper and lower soil bond firmly and prevent soil stratification moreover perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l a common perennial herb with 5 20 cm length 3 6 mm width linear soft and hairy leaves developed fibrous roots thin hollow and upright stalks was selected as the tested grass 10 cm row spacing between plants sown on march 24 2019 2 3 experimental design and statistical analyses the rainfall test was undertaken from the first ten days of may to the middle of october in 2019 the average interval between the two rains was about eight days in order to ensure 10 soil water content before each rainfall event there were six treatments for each rainstorm event thus two repetitions with 36 rainfall events and a total of 216 treatments were applied in the bare and grassed slopes specifically five primary factors and 12 experimental treatments including different rainfall intensities and slope angles were considered and designed in this study table 1 ck bare slope 0 biochar conventional flat planting c1 bare slope 0 biochar horizontal ridge

the v shaped outlet of runoff flume was recorded as the initial runoff generation time and water samples were then taken according to the designed time point the runoff samples were collected with plastic buckets at intervals of one minute in the first 20 min after the stable generation of runoff following this the one minute runoff samples were collected at intervals of ten minutes until the runoff stopped after sampling the volume of runoff samples was measured and recorded with the measuring cylinder the well shaken runoff samples 100 200 ml were taken back to the laboratory in a plastic bottle for water quality analysis and the remaining portions were transferred to an aluminum box dried in an oven weighed by platform scale and finally the sediment yield rate was calculated the monitored indicators included runoff sediment total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and particulate phosphorus pp among them the muddy runoff samples and the clean runoff samples filtered by 0 45 µm microporous filter membrane were used to measure tp and dp respectively by 5 potassium persulfate digestion and molybdenum antimony spectrophotometry gb11893 89 and the difference between tp and dp was defined as pp excel 2016 was used for data statistics and chart making and t tests student s t test based on spss 23 0 statistical product and service solutions software were conducted to assess the homogeneity of variances of two groups of data sets by examining the ratios of their variances 3 results 3 1 sediment yield processes under different rainfall intensities fig 2 depicts the sediment yield process at 10 slope under the rainfall intensities of 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the changing trend of sediment yield rate in each treatment was different under different rainfall intensities under 60 mm h 1 the sediment yield rate of ck c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 decreased first and then stabilized with the extension of rainfall duration under 90 and 120 mm h 1 the overall trend of sediment yield rate increased with the extension of rainfall duration and then stabilized but the sediment yield rates of c2 c3 c4 and c5 were higher than those of ck and c1 indicating that the biochar could aggravate the sediment loss of sloping land specifically the sediment yield rate of c5 was higher than that of c4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 indicating that the horizontal ridge measures on the slope with high biochar content had adverse effects on the control of sediment loss further the sediment yield rate of c1 was similar to that of ck under 120 mm h 1 and even slightly higher than that of ck in the later stage of runoff generation indicating that the sediment interception effect of single horizontal ridge was weakened under a severe rainstorm compared with the bare sloping land the sediment yield rate of c10 and c11 increased significantly at 90 and 120 mm h 1 the sediment yield rate of c10 was even higher than that of c4 and c5 in bare slope under the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 however the sediment yield rates and their variation amplitudes of the remaining treatments c6 c9 c11 were generally less than those of ck c5 and the sediment yield rate fluctuated slightly with the increase of rainfall intensity indicating that grass mulching on sloping land could effectively reduce soil erosion and the interception ability of vegetation at lower biochar level was considerable under various rainstorm intensities 3 2 phosphorus loss processes under different rainfall intensities fig 3 depicts tp loss process at 10 slope under the rainfall intensities of 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the results suggested that the tp loss process of different measures was similar to the sediment yield trend under different rainfall intensities the trend of tp concentration under the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h 1 decreased first and then tended to stabilize i e the initial scouring effect of p loss on sloping land was evident however tp concentration always increased with the increase of rainfall duration at 90 and 120 mm h 1 and with an increase in the amount of biochar application the concentration and fluctuation range of tp loss increased compared with the bare sloping land tp concentrations in grassed slopes c6 c9 were relatively low and the range of tp concentration was 1 1 5 mg l 1 the variation in tp concentration with an increase in rainfall intensity was minute this indicates that grass cover can reduce the risk of increase in tp concentration due to an increase in rainfall intensity however the loss of tp concentration of c10 and c11 increased with an increase in rainfall duration at 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the loss of tp concentration of c10 grassed slope was even higher than that of c4 bare slope at 120 mm h 1 indicating that the reduction effect of vegetation measures on p loss of 6 biochar slope was liable to be weakened or to fail 3 3 surface pathways of phosphorus loss fig 4 depicts dp and pp fractions in different management practices under three rainfall intensities pp is the main fraction of runoff p in the loessial slope and accounts for more than 80 of tp loss under most scenarios indicating that p loss in bare loessial slope occurs mainly in particulate fraction in runoff which is consistent with the results of most existing research chen et al 2013 in terms of different rainfall intensities the average pp tp ratios were 81 65 95 03 and 96 76 at 10 bare slope 94 92 80 23 and 95 79 at 15 bare slope 97 54 85 42 and 97 26 at 20 bare slope under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively the average pp tp ratios were 84 61 62 95 and 80 48 at 10 grassed slope 60 73 97 22 and 93 28 at 15 grassed slope and 91 95 97 37 and 94 37 at 20 grassed slope respectively the results indicated that the pp tp ratios of grassed slope were lower than those of bare slope due to the dual role of grass in controlling erosion and reducing transport capacity of grass taking ck as an example the pp tp ratio increased from 80 16 to 88 10 and finally to 96 36 when the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 90 mm h 1 and then to 120 mm h 1 respectively in terms of different biochar contents the pp tp ratios of 3 and 6 biochar on 10 bare and grassed slopes c3 c5 c8 c11 were higher than that of 0 biochar ck c1 c6 c7 under the same conditions and the ratios increased with the increase of rainfall intensity in terms of different planting modes the horizontal ridge could significantly reduce the pp tp ratio of 10 slope under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity but the effect of horizontal ridge on pp tp ratio decreased or failed with the increase of rainfall intensity taking c1 at 10 slope as an example the pp tp ratio in c1 slope 30 89 was much lower than that in ck slope 80 16 under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and the ratio was slightly less in c1 90 55 than that in ck 96 36 under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the pp tp ratio in c1 93 10 was higher than that in ck 88 10 at 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity in terms of different underlying surfaces the average pp tp ratios of 10 grassed slope were 91 43 93 27 and 96 75 under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities respectively which were less than those of bare slope under the same rainfall intensity this indicates that grass coverage can effectively increase the dp tp ratio under different rainfall intensities in terms of different biochar applications biochar could increase the pp tp ratio under the same rainfall intensity the effect of horizontal ridge on reducing the pp tp ratio of 10 slope was evident with a value as low as 30 89 c1 under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity while the pp tp ratio could also be reduced by grass cover under different rainfall intensities 4 discussion 4 1 management of sediment production and prevention controlling erosion is an essential aspect of preventing non point source pollution of surface waters as eroding soil particles carry excess nutrients particularly p with them into water bodies cestti et al 2003 the sediment yield rate of ck c5 at 10 slope decreased first and then tended to stabilize with an increase of rainfall duration under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity this pattern was likely because the slope was dominated by splash erosion and excess infiltration overland flow in the early stage of rainfall under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity a high infiltration rate maximizes the amount of rainfall that enters the soil and resists erosion since runoff is low liang et al 2012 following this the surface crust gradually forms on the slope surface under the action of raindrops splash and compaction resulting in the decrease and stability of sediment yield rate huo et al 2015 the sediment yield rate of ck c5 at 10 slope under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity increased first with the extension of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize this pattern was likely because increasing slope erosion is primarily affected by two aspects the sediment carrying capacity of runoff and the surface material supply capacity he et al 2016 specifically the temporary crust is vulnerable to be destroyed and the rills are gradually formed due to the increasing raindrops splash and the strengthened runoff scouring with the increase of rainfall intensity fohrer et al 1999 the addition of biochar to soils can thus lead to unique interactions that influence soil physical properties such as porosity particle size distribution density and packing lehmann and joseph 2015 which can also easily cause the crust soil to loosen on the slope surface therefore the maturity of rill development and the compaction of soil structure support the results that the sediment yield rate increased in the early stage of rainstorm under the rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 and successively tended to stabilize with the steady runoff in the subsequent stage of rainstorm event the t test results showed that there were most significant differences between the fifteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of ck and c4 n 15 p 0 05 and between the thirteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of c6 and c10 and c6 and c11 n 13 p 0 05 however there were no significant differences between the thirteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of c6 and c7 and c8 and c9 n 13 p 0 05 these results indicated that excessive biochar could aggravate sediment loss regardless of bare or grassed slopes while the horizontal ridge also did not show evident interception effect on eroded soil particles under grassed slopes and 0 3 biochar level 4 2 agricultural interventions for runoff phosphorus tp loss was associated with heavy rainfall events and can be significantly reduced if slopes are well covered with vegetation zhang et al 2020 meanwhile p loss could be further reduced by adding horizontal ridge on the basis of grass cover and the reduction effect of horizontal ridge on grassed slopes was significantly stronger than that on bare slopes although the p reduction effect of horizontal ridge under grassed slopes was weakened with the increase of rainfall intensity more significantly when sediment delivery is controlled by reducing transport capacity the potential reduction of the pollutants associated with sediment is less than the reduction in the sediment delivered niziolomski et al 2020 however biochar application increased the risk of p loss in bare slopes with the increase in rainfall intensity remarkably the p loss of the bare slope with 3 biochar reached the maximum at 90 mm h 1 c2 and c3 slopes this is because these slopes were in the development stage of rill erosion at 90 mm h 1 which caused more severe slope erosion fig 5 and more p would be carried by eroded soil particles therefore p loss of 3 biochar was higher than that of 6 biochar moreover the comparison between the erosion status of c2 c3 c4 and c5 under 90 mm h 1 and 10 bare slope fig 5 4th rainfall event and those under 60 mm h 1 and 20 bare slope fig 6 3rd rainfall event indicated that the surface crusts of c2 and c3 had been destroyed while the soil structure in c4 and c5 has been compacted fig 6 this might be attributed to the formed rill erosion in the downslope of c2 and the ridge collapse that occurred in c3 due to the runoff scouring of steep slope in the last rainstorm event 60 mm h 1 20 slope this is because fine material has a surface seal forming on the soils during storms that protects them from detaching which is eroded when the slope is steep thereby exposing the easily detachable material and allowing it to be eroded easily imdad and rafique 2019 however the excessive application of biochar increased the potential of p loss in sloping land especially at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 c4 c5 c10 and c11 therefore it is necessary to precisely moderate the applied amount of biochar in actual agricultural production and cautiously apply biochar generally the accumulated amount of sediment yield can be accurately used to reflect the degree of soil erosion under different scenarios niu et al 2020 however runoff soil and associated nutrient losses vary under different underlying surfaces and rainfall intensities ramos et al 2019 detachment of sediments and nutrients from the parent soil is selective for soluble nutrients and for the fine soil fractions to which nutrients are associated blackwell et al 2009 the sediment and associated nutrient loss are substantially affected by land use patterns wang et al 2019 this is because grass cover without biochar application could protect against soil particle detachment slow down sediment transport and enhance sediment deposition more effectively and finally cause the release of considerable amounts of p into soil solutions bünemann et al 2013 the t test results showed that there were significant differences between the fifteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of ck and c4 n 15 p 0 05 and between the thirteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of c6 and c10 and c6 and c11 n 13 p 0 05 however there were no significant differences between the thirteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of c6 and c7 and c8 and c9 n 13 p 0 05 and no significant differences between the thirteen or fifteen paired tp samples for the treatments of c4 and c10 n 13 or 15 p 0 05 the above statistical analysis reconfirmed that excessive biochar could aggravate p loss regardless of the slopes being bare or grassed and the p loss of conventional flat planting was close to that of horizontal ridge under the same biochar level 4 3 phosphorus and sediment reduction effectiveness overall the sediment yield from bare and vegetated slopes increased with the increase in rainfall intensity this is because with a higher rainfall intensity the splash capacity of raindrops as well as the kinetic energy and the rainfall volume per unit time are higher toy et al 2002 at the same time the increase in rainfall intensity leads to the increase of runoff velocity and runoff volume which enhance the runoff scouring capacity yang et al 2020 more importantly most of the sediment delivered from inter rill areas to rill areas however is transported by the thin flow in the inter rill areas rather than rain splash mutchler and young 1975 for example the results showed the following i the sediment yield rate of c1 was similar to that of ck and even slightly higher than that of ck in the subsequent stage of runoff generation which indicated that the sediment interception effect of single horizontal ridge c1 was weakened under the condition of a heavy rainstorm rainfall intensity 120 mm h 1 ii the sediment yield rate of c2 c3 c4 and c5 increased continuously with the rainfall duration which was mainly due to the impact of heavy rainstorm that made the rills merge and interweave and the sediment from inter rills was continuously washed away and entered the runoff and the erosion stage developed from rill erosion to the next form zheng et al 2016 iii the sediment yield rate of c10 in the 7th rainfall event increased significantly under the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 indicating that the combination of conventional flat planting and 6 biochar was liable to fail at extreme rainstorm iv the erosion status of bare slope under three rainfall intensities was compared at the end of 120 mm h 1 rainstorm event fig 7 it was found that the distance between rills was widened the length and number of rills were increased notably and drop sill appeared at the lower end of the slope which proved that types of soil erosion under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity developed from rill erosion to gully erosion gradually this is mainly because the water film forming on the soil surface during high and intense rains that helps dissipate the energy of raindrops is not formed on sloping soils adam sigler et al 2020 therefore runoff power especially during the heavy rainfall intensity could be considered as the best hydrodynamic parameter to characterize rill erosion bryan 2000 more importantly the runoff p is mainly present in particulate fraction and the pp is generally adsorbed and consolidated on the surface of soil particles yuan et al 2016 therefore like sediment the amount of p loss is also positively correlated with rainfall intensity which is consistent with most existing research results zhou et al 2019b ryegrass could effectively reduce the fluctuation range of sediment yield c6 c7 c8 and c9 and significantly reduce p loss under three rainfall intensities indicating that vegetation cover is one of the effective measures to prevent and control the loss of sediment and nutrients in sloping land moreau et al 2020 the results can be attributed to the following aspects first the stem and leaf of ryegrass can effectively intercept rainwater and weaken the splash ability of raindrops on the surface soil gan et al 2010 second the vertical height of the ryegrass leaves is relatively close to the slope surface and the kinetic energy of raindrops reaching the slope through the leaves is minute therefore the damage to the slope surface is minute zhang and zhou 2015 third the root system of ryegrass is well developed and widely distributed which can consolidate soil particles and increase soil anti scourability li 2014 moreover the combination of horizontal ridge and vegetation c11 also had a significant interception effect on soil erosion and p loss compared with c5 although 6 biochar did not reduce soil erosion and p loss under conventional flat planting and vegetation cover c10 this is because the combination of the horizontal ridge and vegetation had stronger reduction effect on the slope erosion and p loss than single vegetation cover sun et al 2018 horizontal ridge could significantly reduce the risk of sediment loss and runoff p at 10 slope from ck to c11 but the interception capacity of horizontal ridge was liable to fail with the increase of rainfall intensity this is because horizontal ridge can easily be destroyed and even collapse by excess infiltration overland flow under the raindrops splash and runoff scouring of heavy rainstorm thus aggravating soil erosion and p loss from the sloping land wang 2008 however compared with the single horizontal ridge measure the combination of horizontal ridge and vegetation cover can effectively mitigate the erosion and p loss under three rainfall intensities and the reduction efficiencies were all 60 this is because the sediment delivery can be controlled by reducing the sediment transport capacity of the erosive dynamics domingues et al 2020 in which case horizontal ridge and vegetation cover are both the primary practices that have good intrinsic interception capability remarkably control of sediment delivery by reducing transport capacity always causes deposition lee and yang 2010 which enriches the fine sediment load that most seriously increases the potential risk of p loss in the subsequent heavy rainstorm event klik et al 2020 this is because the fine sediment often contains adsorbed chemicals that can be major pollutants juvigny khenafou et al 2020 therefore it is recommended to integrate the horizontal ridge with other suitable vegetation cover practices for soil erosion and p loss control in the regions with frequent extreme rainfall events biochar application 3 and 6 on the bare slopes could aggravate slope erosion and p loss regardless of conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting in c2 c3 c4 and c5 slopes this is because excessive biochar application can increase slope runoff and enhance runoff scouring capacity on the slope wu et al 2016 further the heterogeneity and erodibility of biochar change the physical and chemical properties of soil resulting in the soil being more easily eroded in slopes under rainstorms wei et al 2017 wu et al 2018c as a type of soil amendment enriched in c p ca mg and even n a large amount of application of biochar will increase the background content of soil p providing more material source for p loss zhang et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to apply the reasonable amount of biochar in actual agricultural production and not apply excessive biochar wu 2016 our results are similar to the findings of gholami et al 2019 that the application of 1 6 t ha 1 biochar plus 10 soil moisture was an affordable useful and safe method in reducing runoff soil erosion and sediment loss as well as in decreasing the associated environmental pollutants nevertheless 3 biochar application on vegetated slopes would reduce slope erosion and p loss significantly regardless of conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting as was shown in c8 and c9 slopes this indicates that the combination of reasonable wood based biochars and vegetation cover could reduce p loss in surface runoff by increasing water infiltration or by improving soil stability sachdeva et al 2019 further the reduction in particulate p concentration in runoff may be the result of biochar integration within the microaggregate structure which indirectly promotes p retention in macro aggregates interestingly the slope erosion and p loss under grassed slopes increased sharply when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 c10 and c11 under three rainfall intensities i e the sediment and p loss of c10 was even higher than that of bare slope of c4 under the rainstorm intensity of 120 mm h 1 this is also indirectly confirmed by the surface flow passing through the grassed filter strip which should not be fast moving concentrated or flow as a channel robinson et al 1996 if concentrated flow occurs the buffer will be short circuited and rendered ineffective chaubey et al 1994 this is because a severe rainstorm causes more rapid runoff which leaves grass roots unprotected and prone to erosion han et al 2021 excessive biochar can also inhibit the growth and development of grass seedlings except that heavy rainfall intensity can also heighten sediment and p loss wu et al 2017 resulting in limiting growth of roots and even rotten roots which weakens the interception ability of grass to sediment and runoff p therefore it is necessary to reasonably select the application amount of biochar for vegetation slope although horizontal ridge played an important role in reducing p loss on grassed slope c11 5 conclusions a set of laboratory studies with simulated rainstorm were suitably selected to study the comprehensive effects of rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 slopes 10 15 and 20 biochar 0 3 and 6 and planting modes conventional flat planting horizontal ridge planting on the physical processes of runoff phosphorus p fractions total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and particulate phosphorus pp and possible tradeoffs in bare and grassed slopes the above results are part of an integrated catchment study that links detailed plot studies with scenario measurements of runoff and erosion chemistry in order to elucidate the experimental evidence on the efficacy of agricultural interventions on the surface pathways of p loss the study findings were able to highlight the importance of limited surface pathways especially sediment bounded p delivery from soil with biochar application to water because the application of biochar particularly the excessive application of biochar increased the losses of sediment and p under different slopes and rainfall intensities however erosion may be limited as long as there are reasonable management practices such as the combination of grassing and horizontal ridge which reduce erosion and p loss both by 60 and show significant potential in soil conservation it is important to recognize that p is still lost from surface runoff but the pathway of p loss can be mainly associated with erosion especially through bare slope different runoff p fractions vary both between different designed scenarios and for different periods of consecutive rainstorm this variation can be further used to identify potential key source areas and to calculate the time delay between the onset of rainfall the generation of runoff and the receipt of storm derived nutrients in the catchment scales moreover future new theoretical advances in the prioritization of adequate management practices of land resources at large scales require developing testable hypotheses and performing suitable modeling or undertaking experiments for testing these hypotheses credit authorship

soil phosphorus p however the effect of different management practices on the mechanism of runoff p fractions and possible tradeoffs associated with consecutive rainstorms is not well understood this study aggregated management practices biochar grassing and planting modes to evaluate the surface pathways of p loss from loessial bare and grassed slopes with different slope angles 10 15 and 20 and consecutive rainstorms 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 results indicated that i the highest sediment yield rate and total phosphorus loss concentrations were registered during the first rainstorm event 10 slope and 60 mm h 1 soil erosion and p loss under different rainfall intensities could be effectively reduced by 0 3 biochar grassed slope with horizontal ridge but were aggravated under bare slope with 3 6 biochar or grassed slope with 6 biochar ii planting grass on bare slope could effectively mitigate erosion and runoff p at different rainfall intensities and the reduction rate increased with increased rainfall intensity the sediment reduction effect of bare slope with horizontal ridge decreased with increased rainfall intensity and was liable to fail in the 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities iii the particulate phosphorus pp was the primary loss fraction of soil p from loessial sloping land 80 and pp increased with increased biochar content and rainfall intensity but reduced by grass and horizontal ridge interventions integrating grass with horizontal ridge was considered to be the most effective way to control erosion and protect soil fertility these outcomes provide underlying insights for employing appropriate best management practices bmps to decrease runoff p on sloping soils which can be highlighted through a reasonable allocation of biochar ridge growing plants and other bmps keywords rainfall intensity horizontal ridge vegetation coverage biochar sloping land runoff phosphorus 1 introduction soil erosion on sloping land not only aggravates the degree of desertification but also causes degradation of soil fertility and deterioration of soil physical and chemical properties zhao and li 2016 studies have shown that controlling soil and water losses is indispensable for alleviating p losses from sloping farmland he et al 2020 because runoff p was mainly lost through overland flow dominantly in the form of particulate phosphorus pp deng et al 2019 particularly p in runoff from bare loessial soil consists almost entirely of the reactive pp form 96 6 regardless of rainfall intensity 45 60 75 90 105 and 120 mm h 1 and slope 5 10 15 20 and 25 wu et al 2021 identifying ways to quantify the processes controlling the transfer of soil p to runoff based on the dominant form of p in runoff dp or pp and understanding of possible tradeoffs between the two forms are two important challenges in future soil conservation schemes at different spatial scales dodd and sharpley 2016 this is also the key knowledge gap between the surface pathways of p loss under consecutive rainstorms and the environmental significance of the various forms of mobilized p and their subsequent transformations in fact the long term soil erosion due to loose soil structure sparse vegetation and concentrated rainstorm in the loess plateau china has shaped many ravines and a large number of loessial slopes wu and ma 2015 which increases the structural connectivity of surface susceptibility to runoff generation and sediment detachment and transport williams et al 2014 therefore a series of close to nature engineering agricultural and biological practices had been carried out on the sloping land of the loess plateau since the 1990s li et al 2019 the most commonly used best management practices bmps in this region can be grouped according to their functions firstly buffer zones or filter strips are bmps that reduce the transport of pollutants and are considered structural practices wojciechowska et al 2019 the most prominent pollutant removal processes in filter strips tend to be infiltration of dissolved pollutants and deposition of sediment bound pollutants wang et al 2017 secondly horizontal ridges increase surface roughness by changing slope microtopography and intercepts runoff by ridges and hills zheng et al 2016 which can effectively achieve soil consolidation and water storage luo et al 2015 however ridges and hills can easily be destroyed by runoff scouring under heavy rainstorm thus intensifying soil erosion and sediment bound nutrient loss from the slope surface wang et al 2018 thirdly as a new type of slow release carrier of n and p fertilizer biochar has characteristics of being porous large specific surface area and is rich in functional groups lv et al 2015 it can be used to ameliorate physical chemical and biological properties of soil if reasonable considering the cost effectiveness and irreversibility of biochar application chu et al 2014 these above bmps reinforce each other and the implementation of a single bmp is rarely practiced sharpley 2006 panagopoulos et al 2012 this is because the soil erosion resistance and pollution control of a single practice are often limited under extreme rainstorms sommerlot et al 2013 more importantly different bmps are required to target different forms of p loss and the guidance for policymakers to implement strategies targeting particulate p pp reductions in erosion and dissolved p dp losses in runoff bundy et al 2001 further comparative analysis of the reduction efficiency of a single practice or reasonable combination of different agricultural management practices is the key step in the study of soil and nutrient loss control of sloping land sharpley 2013 carstensen et al 2020 rainfall is the precondition of soil erosion on slope surface and the material basis of runoff generation zhou et al 2019a it has high energy that packs the bare soil surface and disperses soil aggregates common observations show that the two important rainfall variables that determine storm erosivity are rainfall amount and intensity wu et al 2018a frequent alternation of drying rewetting in soil caused by consecutive rainstorms is one of the most extensive abiotic stresses that soil experiences ren et al 2015 it plays an important role in controlling the release of nutrients zhang et al 2010 and thus increases the risk of surface water eutrophication gu et al 2018 moreover another important factor relevant to soil erosion is slope steepness wu et al 2020 the steepness of a land influences erosion in a variety of ways for example an increase in the velocity of the runoff due to the high slope causes a large amount of soil to be collected and transported fang 2021 and the detention of water in a surface is reduced as the slope increases due to the reduced capacity of depressions and furrows li et al 2021 many experimental attempts to integrate environmental factors including slope and consecutive rainstorms into laboratory or field scales have been extensively made in order to explore the effect of drying rewetting process on soil aggregates soil microorganisms soil erosion and nutrient release turner and haygarth 2001 dinh et al 2017 blackwell et al 2010 zhang et al 2017 however the effects of sloping management practices especially biochar grassing and planting modes on the surface pathways of p loss associated with the drying rewetting process by variable consecutive rainstorms under different slopes have not been completely considered in previous studies therefore laboratory studies with simulated consecutive rainstorms with controlled conditions of initial soil moisture rainfall intensity slope angle biochar grassing and planting modes were designed to quantify the processes controlling the transfer of soil p to runoff based on the dominant form of p in runoff dp or pp and possible tradeoffs this is critical to test hypotheses regarding the need to design management recommendations to minimize losses of different p forms with the most significant pollution potential the objectives of this study were to i examine the efficiency of agricultural interventions such as biochar horizontal ridge and grassing on slope erosion and runoff p processes under drying rewetting alternation caused by simulated consecutive rainstorms 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 ii identify the surface pathways of p loss under different bare and grassed sloping soils 10 15 and 20 and iii assess the mechanisms of agricultural interventions in minimizing slope erosion and regulating runoff p fractions this study will contribute to deepening the understanding of slope erosion and runoff p processes in the effects of different agricultural management practices of biochar ridge and grassing by employing consecutive rainstorm experiments 2 materials and methods 2 1 runoff flume and simulated rainfall the experiment was conducted in the side flow liquid jet rainfall system zone of the artificial simulated rainfall hall of the state key laboratory of soil erosion and dryland farming on the loess plateau yangling china the rainfall height of the side flow liquid jet rainfall system is 16 m which meets all the conditions of rainfall raindrops required to reach the terminal speed the range of rainfall intensity is 40 260 mm h 1 the rainfall uniformity is 80 and the maximum duration of rainfall is 12 h zheng and zhao 2004 twelve steel runoff flumes with the characteristics of variable slopes 10 15 and 20 were designed in this study fig 1 the sizes of each runoff flume were 2 m length 1 m width 0 45 m height each group of flumes was separated from the middle by two small flumes with a total of six small flumes in each rainfall event with conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting respectively the standard of horizontal ridge was defined as ridge height of 5 cm ridge top spacing of 10 cm and ridge width of 5 cm and was applied on one side of the runoff flume a v shaped device is installed at the outlet of flume to collect runoff the rainstorm intensity of this experiment was designed as 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the rainfall duration was maintained as 90 min 60 min and 45 min respectively because the total rainfall volume was 90 mm in each rainstorm event three rainfall intensities were applied to the same flume consecutively and the test order of slope under the same rainfall intensity was 10 15 and 20 before each rainfall test the rainfall intensity was calibrated at least three times and the corresponding sampling time was 2 min until the final error of rainfall intensity was maintained within the range of 3 mm h 1 of the designed rainfall intensity and the final rainfall uniformity reached 80 following this the tarpaulin was opened immediately to start the rainfall test and the starting rainfall time was recorded 2 2 biochar loessial soil and perennial ryegrass sawdust biochar with particles of mesh size 80 400 provided by shaanxi yixin bioenergy technology development co ltd produced by apple branches under partial hypoxia fired by the brick kiln method at 600 was evenly added to the tested soil according to the requirements of the experiment 0 3 and 6 the tested loessial soil was classified as calcic cambisols according to the soil classification system used by the food and agriculture organization of the united nations iuss working group wrb 2015 or ustochnept according to usda soil taxonomy and was taken from the louping project site in ansai county shaanxi province china the physicochemical properties of the tested loessial soil were determined as follows alkaline and silty loam soil antecedent soil moisture was 6 8 ph value was 7 6 soil particle compositions were 12 36 clay 0 002 mm 66 15 silt 0 002 0 05 mm and 21 49 sand 0 05 mm tn and tp contents were 0 43 g kg 1 and 0 49 g kg 1 respectively before filling the loessial soil into the flume the soil needed to be firstly dried in the sun and sieved through a 10 mm sieve to remove stones roots and debris subsequently the details regarding the soil pretreatment were as follows i the sprayer was used to sprinkle superphosphate dosage ssp dissolved in distilled water into the soil this was done to ensure that the original soil p content of 0 495 g kg 1 and soil moisture content of 6 8 were modified to 0 605 g kg 1 and 10 time domain reflectory tdr fieldscout 6445 tdr 150 spectrum technologies inc united states of america respectively according to the values of the soil from ansai county wang et al 2014 wu et al 2018b ii biochar with 3 and 6 mass percentage was weighed using an electronic balance to determine the amount of biochar to be applied biochar fertilizer and soil were thoroughly blended with a mixer and then sealed and left for 24 h to form the tested fertile soil for standby iii the layered filling method was adopted to fill the runoff flume in order to ensure uniformity of the tested soil and the soil bulk density was controlled to be 1 2 0 2 g cm 3 initially gauze and 5 cm fine sand were laid at the bottom of the flume following this four layers with 10 cm thickness of soil were successively filled to ensure uniform soil bulk density and 5 cm superelevation was maintained to prevent runoff and sediment from splashing out during rainfall the lower layer was abraded to make the upper and lower soil bond firmly and prevent soil stratification moreover perennial ryegrass lolium perenne l a common perennial herb with 5 20 cm length 3 6 mm width linear soft and hairy leaves developed fibrous roots thin hollow and upright stalks was selected as the tested grass 10 cm row spacing between plants sown on march 24 2019 2 3 experimental design and statistical analyses the rainfall test was undertaken from the first ten days of may to the middle of october in 2019 the average interval between the two rains was about eight days in order to ensure 10 soil water content before each rainfall event there were six treatments for each rainstorm event thus two repetitions with 36 rainfall events and a total of 216 treatments were applied in the bare and grassed slopes specifically five primary factors and 12 experimental treatments including different rainfall intensities and slope angles were considered and designed in this study table 1 ck bare slope 0 biochar conventional flat planting c1 bare slope 0 biochar horizontal ridge

the v shaped outlet of runoff flume was recorded as the initial runoff generation time and water samples were then taken according to the designed time point the runoff samples were collected with plastic buckets at intervals of one minute in the first 20 min after the stable generation of runoff following this the one minute runoff samples were collected at intervals of ten minutes until the runoff stopped after sampling the volume of runoff samples was measured and recorded with the measuring cylinder the well shaken runoff samples 100 200 ml were taken back to the laboratory in a plastic bottle for water quality analysis and the remaining portions were transferred to an aluminum box dried in an oven weighed by platform scale and finally the sediment yield rate was calculated the monitored indicators included runoff sediment total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and particulate phosphorus pp among them the muddy runoff samples and the clean runoff samples filtered by 0 45 µm microporous filter membrane were used to measure tp and dp respectively by 5 potassium persulfate digestion and molybdenum antimony spectrophotometry gb11893 89 and the difference between tp and dp was defined as pp excel 2016 was used for data statistics and chart making and t tests student s t test based on spss 23 0 statistical product and service solutions software were conducted to assess the homogeneity of variances of two groups of data sets by examining the ratios of their variances 3 results 3 1 sediment yield processes under different rainfall intensities fig 2 depicts the sediment yield process at 10 slope under the rainfall intensities of 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the changing trend of sediment yield rate in each treatment was different under different rainfall intensities under 60 mm h 1 the sediment yield rate of ck c1 c2 c3 c4 and c5 decreased first and then stabilized with the extension of rainfall duration under 90 and 120 mm h 1 the overall trend of sediment yield rate increased with the extension of rainfall duration and then stabilized but the sediment yield rates of c2 c3 c4 and c5 were higher than those of ck and c1 indicating that the biochar could aggravate the sediment loss of sloping land specifically the sediment yield rate of c5 was higher than that of c4 under 90 and 120 mm h 1 indicating that the horizontal ridge measures on the slope with high biochar content had adverse effects on the control of sediment loss further the sediment yield rate of c1 was similar to that of ck under 120 mm h 1 and even slightly higher than that of ck in the later stage of runoff generation indicating that the sediment interception effect of single horizontal ridge was weakened under a severe rainstorm compared with the bare sloping land the sediment yield rate of c10 and c11 increased significantly at 90 and 120 mm h 1 the sediment yield rate of c10 was even higher than that of c4 and c5 in bare slope under the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 however the sediment yield rates and their variation amplitudes of the remaining treatments c6 c9 c11 were generally less than those of ck c5 and the sediment yield rate fluctuated slightly with the increase of rainfall intensity indicating that grass mulching on sloping land could effectively reduce soil erosion and the interception ability of vegetation at lower biochar level was considerable under various rainstorm intensities 3 2 phosphorus loss processes under different rainfall intensities fig 3 depicts tp loss process at 10 slope under the rainfall intensities of 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 the results suggested that the tp loss process of different measures was similar to the sediment yield trend under different rainfall intensities the trend of tp concentration under the rainfall intensity of 60 mm h 1 decreased first and then tended to stabilize i e the initial scouring effect of p loss on sloping land was evident however tp concentration always increased with the increase of rainfall duration at 90 and 120 mm h 1 and with an increase in the amount of biochar application the concentration and fluctuation range of tp loss increased compared with the bare sloping land tp concentrations in grassed slopes c6 c9 were relatively low and the range of tp concentration was 1 1 5 mg l 1 the variation in tp concentration with an increase in rainfall intensity was minute this indicates that grass cover can reduce the risk of increase in tp concentration due to an increase in rainfall intensity however the loss of tp concentration of c10 and c11 increased with an increase in rainfall duration at 90 and 120 mm h 1 and the loss of tp concentration of c10 grassed slope was even higher than that of c4 bare slope at 120 mm h 1 indicating that the reduction effect of vegetation measures on p loss of 6 biochar slope was liable to be weakened or to fail 3 3 surface pathways of phosphorus loss fig 4 depicts dp and pp fractions in different management practices under three rainfall intensities pp is the main fraction of runoff p in the loessial slope and accounts for more than 80 of tp loss under most scenarios indicating that p loss in bare loessial slope occurs mainly in particulate fraction in runoff which is consistent with the results of most existing research chen et al 2013 in terms of different rainfall intensities the average pp tp ratios were 81 65 95 03 and 96 76 at 10 bare slope 94 92 80 23 and 95 79 at 15 bare slope 97 54 85 42 and 97 26 at 20 bare slope under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity respectively the average pp tp ratios were 84 61 62 95 and 80 48 at 10 grassed slope 60 73 97 22 and 93 28 at 15 grassed slope and 91 95 97 37 and 94 37 at 20 grassed slope respectively the results indicated that the pp tp ratios of grassed slope were lower than those of bare slope due to the dual role of grass in controlling erosion and reducing transport capacity of grass taking ck as an example the pp tp ratio increased from 80 16 to 88 10 and finally to 96 36 when the rainfall intensity increased from 60 mm h 1 to 90 mm h 1 and then to 120 mm h 1 respectively in terms of different biochar contents the pp tp ratios of 3 and 6 biochar on 10 bare and grassed slopes c3 c5 c8 c11 were higher than that of 0 biochar ck c1 c6 c7 under the same conditions and the ratios increased with the increase of rainfall intensity in terms of different planting modes the horizontal ridge could significantly reduce the pp tp ratio of 10 slope under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity but the effect of horizontal ridge on pp tp ratio decreased or failed with the increase of rainfall intensity taking c1 at 10 slope as an example the pp tp ratio in c1 slope 30 89 was much lower than that in ck slope 80 16 under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity and the ratio was slightly less in c1 90 55 than that in ck 96 36 under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity however the pp tp ratio in c1 93 10 was higher than that in ck 88 10 at 90 mm h 1 rainfall intensity in terms of different underlying surfaces the average pp tp ratios of 10 grassed slope were 91 43 93 27 and 96 75 under 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensities respectively which were less than those of bare slope under the same rainfall intensity this indicates that grass coverage can effectively increase the dp tp ratio under different rainfall intensities in terms of different biochar applications biochar could increase the pp tp ratio under the same rainfall intensity the effect of horizontal ridge on reducing the pp tp ratio of 10 slope was evident with a value as low as 30 89 c1 under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity while the pp tp ratio could also be reduced by grass cover under different rainfall intensities 4 discussion 4 1 management of sediment production and prevention controlling erosion is an essential aspect of preventing non point source pollution of surface waters as eroding soil particles carry excess nutrients particularly p with them into water bodies cestti et al 2003 the sediment yield rate of ck c5 at 10 slope decreased first and then tended to stabilize with an increase of rainfall duration under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity this pattern was likely because the slope was dominated by splash erosion and excess infiltration overland flow in the early stage of rainfall under 60 mm h 1 rainfall intensity a high infiltration rate maximizes the amount of rainfall that enters the soil and resists erosion since runoff is low liang et al 2012 following this the surface crust gradually forms on the slope surface under the action of raindrops splash and compaction resulting in the decrease and stability of sediment yield rate huo et al 2015 the sediment yield rate of ck c5 at 10 slope under 90 and 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity increased first with the extension of rainfall duration and then tended to stabilize this pattern was likely because increasing slope erosion is primarily affected by two aspects the sediment carrying capacity of runoff and the surface material supply capacity he et al 2016 specifically the temporary crust is vulnerable to be destroyed and the rills are gradually formed due to the increasing raindrops splash and the strengthened runoff scouring with the increase of rainfall intensity fohrer et al 1999 the addition of biochar to soils can thus lead to unique interactions that influence soil physical properties such as porosity particle size distribution density and packing lehmann and joseph 2015 which can also easily cause the crust soil to loosen on the slope surface therefore the maturity of rill development and the compaction of soil structure support the results that the sediment yield rate increased in the early stage of rainstorm under the rainfall intensities of 90 mm h 1 and 120 mm h 1 and successively tended to stabilize with the steady runoff in the subsequent stage of rainstorm event the t test results showed that there were most significant differences between the fifteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of ck and c4 n 15 p 0 05 and between the thirteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of c6 and c10 and c6 and c11 n 13 p 0 05 however there were no significant differences between the thirteen paired sediment yield samples for the treatments of c6 and c7 and c8 and c9 n 13 p 0 05 these results indicated that excessive biochar could aggravate sediment loss regardless of bare or grassed slopes while the horizontal ridge also did not show evident interception effect on eroded soil particles under grassed slopes and 0 3 biochar level 4 2 agricultural interventions for runoff phosphorus tp loss was associated with heavy rainfall events and can be significantly reduced if slopes are well covered with vegetation zhang et al 2020 meanwhile p loss could be further reduced by adding horizontal ridge on the basis of grass cover and the reduction effect of horizontal ridge on grassed slopes was significantly stronger than that on bare slopes although the p reduction effect of horizontal ridge under grassed slopes was weakened with the increase of rainfall intensity more significantly when sediment delivery is controlled by reducing transport capacity the potential reduction of the pollutants associated with sediment is less than the reduction in the sediment delivered niziolomski et al 2020 however biochar application increased the risk of p loss in bare slopes with the increase in rainfall intensity remarkably the p loss of the bare slope with 3 biochar reached the maximum at 90 mm h 1 c2 and c3 slopes this is because these slopes were in the development stage of rill erosion at 90 mm h 1 which caused more severe slope erosion fig 5 and more p would be carried by eroded soil particles therefore p loss of 3 biochar was higher than that of 6 biochar moreover the comparison between the erosion status of c2 c3 c4 and c5 under 90 mm h 1 and 10 bare slope fig 5 4th rainfall event and those under 60 mm h 1 and 20 bare slope fig 6 3rd rainfall event indicated that the surface crusts of c2 and c3 had been destroyed while the soil structure in c4 and c5 has been compacted fig 6 this might be attributed to the formed rill erosion in the downslope of c2 and the ridge collapse that occurred in c3 due to the runoff scouring of steep slope in the last rainstorm event 60 mm h 1 20 slope this is because fine material has a surface seal forming on the soils during storms that protects them from detaching which is eroded when the slope is steep thereby exposing the easily detachable material and allowing it to be eroded easily imdad and rafique 2019 however the excessive application of biochar increased the potential of p loss in sloping land especially at the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 c4 c5 c10 and c11 therefore it is necessary to precisely moderate the applied amount of biochar in actual agricultural production and cautiously apply biochar generally the accumulated amount of sediment yield can be accurately used to reflect the degree of soil erosion under different scenarios niu et al 2020 however runoff soil and associated nutrient losses vary under different underlying surfaces and rainfall intensities ramos et al 2019 detachment of sediments and nutrients from the parent soil is selective for soluble nutrients and for the fine soil fractions to which nutrients are associated blackwell et al 2009 the sediment and associated nutrient loss are substantially affected by land use patterns wang et al 2019 this is because grass cover without biochar application could protect against soil particle detachment slow down sediment transport and enhance sediment deposition more effectively and finally cause the release of considerable amounts of p into soil solutions bünemann et al 2013 the t test results showed that there were significant differences between the fifteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of ck and c4 n 15 p 0 05 and between the thirteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of c6 and c10 and c6 and c11 n 13 p 0 05 however there were no significant differences between the thirteen paired tp loss samples for the treatments of c6 and c7 and c8 and c9 n 13 p 0 05 and no significant differences between the thirteen or fifteen paired tp samples for the treatments of c4 and c10 n 13 or 15 p 0 05 the above statistical analysis reconfirmed that excessive biochar could aggravate p loss regardless of the slopes being bare or grassed and the p loss of conventional flat planting was close to that of horizontal ridge under the same biochar level 4 3 phosphorus and sediment reduction effectiveness overall the sediment yield from bare and vegetated slopes increased with the increase in rainfall intensity this is because with a higher rainfall intensity the splash capacity of raindrops as well as the kinetic energy and the rainfall volume per unit time are higher toy et al 2002 at the same time the increase in rainfall intensity leads to the increase of runoff velocity and runoff volume which enhance the runoff scouring capacity yang et al 2020 more importantly most of the sediment delivered from inter rill areas to rill areas however is transported by the thin flow in the inter rill areas rather than rain splash mutchler and young 1975 for example the results showed the following i the sediment yield rate of c1 was similar to that of ck and even slightly higher than that of ck in the subsequent stage of runoff generation which indicated that the sediment interception effect of single horizontal ridge c1 was weakened under the condition of a heavy rainstorm rainfall intensity 120 mm h 1 ii the sediment yield rate of c2 c3 c4 and c5 increased continuously with the rainfall duration which was mainly due to the impact of heavy rainstorm that made the rills merge and interweave and the sediment from inter rills was continuously washed away and entered the runoff and the erosion stage developed from rill erosion to the next form zheng et al 2016 iii the sediment yield rate of c10 in the 7th rainfall event increased significantly under the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 indicating that the combination of conventional flat planting and 6 biochar was liable to fail at extreme rainstorm iv the erosion status of bare slope under three rainfall intensities was compared at the end of 120 mm h 1 rainstorm event fig 7 it was found that the distance between rills was widened the length and number of rills were increased notably and drop sill appeared at the lower end of the slope which proved that types of soil erosion under 120 mm h 1 rainfall intensity developed from rill erosion to gully erosion gradually this is mainly because the water film forming on the soil surface during high and intense rains that helps dissipate the energy of raindrops is not formed on sloping soils adam sigler et al 2020 therefore runoff power especially during the heavy rainfall intensity could be considered as the best hydrodynamic parameter to characterize rill erosion bryan 2000 more importantly the runoff p is mainly present in particulate fraction and the pp is generally adsorbed and consolidated on the surface of soil particles yuan et al 2016 therefore like sediment the amount of p loss is also positively correlated with rainfall intensity which is consistent with most existing research results zhou et al 2019b ryegrass could effectively reduce the fluctuation range of sediment yield c6 c7 c8 and c9 and significantly reduce p loss under three rainfall intensities indicating that vegetation cover is one of the effective measures to prevent and control the loss of sediment and nutrients in sloping land moreau et al 2020 the results can be attributed to the following aspects first the stem and leaf of ryegrass can effectively intercept rainwater and weaken the splash ability of raindrops on the surface soil gan et al 2010 second the vertical height of the ryegrass leaves is relatively close to the slope surface and the kinetic energy of raindrops reaching the slope through the leaves is minute therefore the damage to the slope surface is minute zhang and zhou 2015 third the root system of ryegrass is well developed and widely distributed which can consolidate soil particles and increase soil anti scourability li 2014 moreover the combination of horizontal ridge and vegetation c11 also had a significant interception effect on soil erosion and p loss compared with c5 although 6 biochar did not reduce soil erosion and p loss under conventional flat planting and vegetation cover c10 this is because the combination of the horizontal ridge and vegetation had stronger reduction effect on the slope erosion and p loss than single vegetation cover sun et al 2018 horizontal ridge could significantly reduce the risk of sediment loss and runoff p at 10 slope from ck to c11 but the interception capacity of horizontal ridge was liable to fail with the increase of rainfall intensity this is because horizontal ridge can easily be destroyed and even collapse by excess infiltration overland flow under the raindrops splash and runoff scouring of heavy rainstorm thus aggravating soil erosion and p loss from the sloping land wang 2008 however compared with the single horizontal ridge measure the combination of horizontal ridge and vegetation cover can effectively mitigate the erosion and p loss under three rainfall intensities and the reduction efficiencies were all 60 this is because the sediment delivery can be controlled by reducing the sediment transport capacity of the erosive dynamics domingues et al 2020 in which case horizontal ridge and vegetation cover are both the primary practices that have good intrinsic interception capability remarkably control of sediment delivery by reducing transport capacity always causes deposition lee and yang 2010 which enriches the fine sediment load that most seriously increases the potential risk of p loss in the subsequent heavy rainstorm event klik et al 2020 this is because the fine sediment often contains adsorbed chemicals that can be major pollutants juvigny khenafou et al 2020 therefore it is recommended to integrate the horizontal ridge with other suitable vegetation cover practices for soil erosion and p loss control in the regions with frequent extreme rainfall events biochar application 3 and 6 on the bare slopes could aggravate slope erosion and p loss regardless of conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting in c2 c3 c4 and c5 slopes this is because excessive biochar application can increase slope runoff and enhance runoff scouring capacity on the slope wu et al 2016 further the heterogeneity and erodibility of biochar change the physical and chemical properties of soil resulting in the soil being more easily eroded in slopes under rainstorms wei et al 2017 wu et al 2018c as a type of soil amendment enriched in c p ca mg and even n a large amount of application of biochar will increase the background content of soil p providing more material source for p loss zhang et al 2015 therefore it is necessary to apply the reasonable amount of biochar in actual agricultural production and not apply excessive biochar wu 2016 our results are similar to the findings of gholami et al 2019 that the application of 1 6 t ha 1 biochar plus 10 soil moisture was an affordable useful and safe method in reducing runoff soil erosion and sediment loss as well as in decreasing the associated environmental pollutants nevertheless 3 biochar application on vegetated slopes would reduce slope erosion and p loss significantly regardless of conventional flat planting and horizontal ridge planting as was shown in c8 and c9 slopes this indicates that the combination of reasonable wood based biochars and vegetation cover could reduce p loss in surface runoff by increasing water infiltration or by improving soil stability sachdeva et al 2019 further the reduction in particulate p concentration in runoff may be the result of biochar integration within the microaggregate structure which indirectly promotes p retention in macro aggregates interestingly the slope erosion and p loss under grassed slopes increased sharply when the biochar content increased from 3 to 6 c10 and c11 under three rainfall intensities i e the sediment and p loss of c10 was even higher than that of bare slope of c4 under the rainstorm intensity of 120 mm h 1 this is also indirectly confirmed by the surface flow passing through the grassed filter strip which should not be fast moving concentrated or flow as a channel robinson et al 1996 if concentrated flow occurs the buffer will be short circuited and rendered ineffective chaubey et al 1994 this is because a severe rainstorm causes more rapid runoff which leaves grass roots unprotected and prone to erosion han et al 2021 excessive biochar can also inhibit the growth and development of grass seedlings except that heavy rainfall intensity can also heighten sediment and p loss wu et al 2017 resulting in limiting growth of roots and even rotten roots which weakens the interception ability of grass to sediment and runoff p therefore it is necessary to reasonably select the application amount of biochar for vegetation slope although horizontal ridge played an important role in reducing p loss on grassed slope c11 5 conclusions a set of laboratory studies with simulated rainstorm were suitably selected to study the comprehensive effects of rainfall intensities 60 90 and 120 mm h 1 slopes 10 15 and 20 biochar 0 3 and 6 and planting modes conventional flat planting horizontal ridge planting on the physical processes of runoff phosphorus p fractions total phosphorus tp dissolved phosphorus dp and particulate phosphorus pp and possible tradeoffs in bare and grassed slopes the above results are part of an integrated catchment study that links detailed plot studies with scenario measurements of runoff and erosion chemistry in order to elucidate the experimental evidence on the efficacy of agricultural interventions on the surface pathways of p loss the study findings were able to highlight the importance of limited surface pathways especially sediment bounded p delivery from soil with biochar application to water because the application of biochar particularly the excessive application of biochar increased the losses of sediment and p under different slopes and rainfall intensities however erosion may be limited as long as there are reasonable management practices such as the combination of grassing and horizontal ridge which reduce erosion and p loss both by 60 and show significant potential in soil conservation it is important to recognize that p is still lost from surface runoff but the pathway of p loss can be mainly associated with erosion especially through bare slope different runoff p fractions vary both between different designed scenarios and for different periods of consecutive rainstorm this variation can be further used to identify potential key source areas and to calculate the time delay between the onset of rainfall the generation of runoff and the receipt of storm derived nutrients in the catchment scales moreover future new theoretical advances in the prioritization of adequate management practices of land resources at large scales require developing testable hypotheses and performing suitable modeling or undertaking experiments for testing these hypotheses credit authorship
