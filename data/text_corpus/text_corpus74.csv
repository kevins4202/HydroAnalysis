time followed by a constant equilibrium height ze the average time taken for the menisci to reach ze was 0 39 s with no differences between rock types the menisci achieved a greater vertical extent on the fracture faces of the sedimentary rocks as compared to those of the granites apparent θ e values were calculated from the best fit estimates of ze using the wilhelmy plate equation for a smooth

about the wettability of rock fracture surfaces is needed for modeling multiphase flow of fluids within fractured geologic formations determining fracture surface wettability is an essential step in applications such as waterflooding for enhanced oil recovery in fractured reservoirs ogunberu and muhammad 2005 kasiri and bashiri 2011 and evaluation of caprock integrity for geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide kaldi et al 2013 wan et al 2014 wettability represents the relative adhesion of one fluid to a solid surface in the presence of another fluid donaldson and alam 2008 it can be quantitatively defined in terms of young s equation drelich et al 2020 for the equilibrium contact angle θ e rad between the solid phase s and the two fluids f 1 and f 2 i e 1 c o s θ e γ s f 1 γ s f 2 γ f 1 f 2 where γ kgs 2 is the interfacial tension of the specified phase pair eq 1 requires among other things a perfectly flat impermeable surface experimental techniques used to determine the equilibrium contact angle of a wetting non wetting fluid pair on such a surface have been reviewed by several authors e g neumann and good 1979 good 1993 shang et al 2008 chau 2009 yuan and lee 2013 drelich et al 2020 the most frequently used methods for determining θ e on rocks are the sessile drop and captive bubble techniques montes ruiz cabello et al 2011 these approaches can be applied directly to some rock types such as shales which can be split apart along distinct bedding planes exposing relatively smooth planar surfaces borysenko et al 2009 direct measurements of θ e using both the sessile drop and captive bubble techniques have also been reported for freshly exposed cleavage surfaces of muscovite mica e g wan et al 2014 mugele et al 2015 however this approach is limited to a relatively small group of rock types with bedding planes and or sheet like structures a common practice with rough rock surfaces has been remove asperities through polishing prior to measuring θ e ethington 1990 koc 2013 use of increasingly finer grits leaves fewer and fewer asperities on the surface for example gates et al 2018 were able to measure equilibrium contact angles on a wide variety of rock types using sessile drop measurements implemented on polished surfaces while this may be acceptable for some geologic applications estimating θ e on polished rock surfaces does not make sense in the case of fracture faces which often exhibit irregularities over multiple length scales boffa et al 1998 babadagli and develi 2003 1 2 non ideal surfaces several models have been proposed for predicting the apparent equilibrium contact angle of a rough surface based on the intrinsic θ e value measured on an ideal flat surface of the same material e g wenzel 1936 cassie and baxter 1944 cassie 1948 hazlett 1990 brabazon et al 2019 predictions based on these models indicate decreasing apparent θ e values with increasing surface roughness experimental observations generally support this trend although the results of kittu et al 2014 and rayudu and bulut 2014 indicate the opposite can occur i e increasing apparent θ e with increasing rock surface roughness it should also be noted that some researchers wolansky and marmur 1999 gao and mccarthy 2007 have questioned the theoretical veracity of this predictive approach currently only a few techniques are available for experimentally determining apparent θ e values on non ideal rough surfaces like rock fracture faces meiron et al 2004 describe a method for measuring the apparent equilibrium contact angle for a liquid droplet on a rough surface their approach is based on vibrating the surface while taking top down view images of the droplet the circularity of the drop is monitored and θ e is estimated from the droplet diameter and known liquid volume this method was successfully tested on a series of wax surfaces with varying grades of surface roughness the wilhelmy plate method in which a solid vertical plate is lowered into a liquid reservoir is a well established technique for measuring θ e the method can be implemented in two ways by evaluating the force balance between the surface and the wetting fluid al shareef et al 2013 wang et al 2017 karim and kavehpour 2018 volpe and siboni 2018 or by measuring the height of capillary rise of the wetting fluid on the vertical plate neuman and good 1979 we focus on the later approach here which relates the equilibrium contact angle to the maximum height attained by the meniscus at equilibrium ze m neuman and good 1979 2 s i n θ e 1 ρ g z e 2 2 γ f 1 f 2 where ρ is the density of the wetting fluid kg m 3 and g is gravitational acceleration ms 2 eq 2 assumes the plate is infinitely wide but surfaces 2 cm wide have been shown to produce acceptable experimental results neumann and good 1979 although the wilhelmy plate method is based on a solid flat plate and has been used on polished rock surfaces muhammad and rao 2003 it has also been applied to measure apparent θ e values for rough surfaces studies by cain et al 1983 and kwok et al 1995 successfully implemented the method to quantify differences in θ e between smooth and rough surfaces for a variety of engineered materials vijapurapu et al 2002 applied it to glass quartz sandstone dolomite and calcite surfaces treated to give varying degrees of surface roughness however their resulting apparent θ e values were insensitive to variations in surface type and roughness 1 3 menisci onset dynamics several studies have investigated menisci dynamics on a vertical solid plate from initial contact to the maximum height of capillary rise bracke et al 1989 derived an empirical expression for the rate of wetting and used it in conjunction with eq 2 to define a dynamic contact angle θ d this approach yields θ d 90 at t 0 with θ d asymptotically approaching θ e as t other authors have presented theoretical models which assume that the shape of the meniscus and thus the contact angle is constant during capillary rise on a vertical surface following this approach eq 2 only holds at equilibrium keller and miksis 1983 clanet and quéré 2002 the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model for the onset dynamics of a meniscus of constant shape on a solid flat vertical surface can be written as 3a z 3 α 1 β 2 1 3 γ f 1 f 2 t 2 ρ 1 3 κ t 2 3 t t e 3b z z e 2 γ f 1 f 2 ρ g 1 s i n θ e t t e where t is time elapsed since liquid first contacts the surface s z is height of the meniscus m at time t s te is the time to reach equilibrium s α is a meniscus shape factor mm 1 β is a liquid entrainment factor mm 1 and κ 3 γ f 1 f 2 α ρ 1 β 2 1 3 eq 3b is equivalent to a rearrangement of eq 2 1 4 imaging menisci recent advances in 3d imaging technology and image analysis software have allowed researchers to directly measure contact angles on natural surfaces within porous reservoir rocks andrew et al 2014 for example employed x ray microtomography to visualize and quantify contact angles in situ within a super critical co2 brine carbonate system the measurements resulted in a distribution of contact angles ranging from 35 to 55 this distribution was attributed to contact angle hysteresis and surface heterogeneity al ratrout et al 2017 and scanziani et al 2017 have published improved algorithms to automatically compute contact angles from segmented x ray tomograms budziak and neumann 1990 have demonstrated that the wilhelmy plate method can be easily adapted for digital image acquisition and analysis we propose the use of a similar imaging based approach in which neutron radiography perfect et al 2014 is combined with the wilhelmy plate method to measure the onset dynamics and apparent θ e of water menisci on vertical rock fracture surfaces 1 5 objectives the objectives of this paper are to visualize and quantify the dynamic behavior of air water menisci on exposed fracture surfaces for a variety of rock types the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model describing the dynamics of menisci movement will be evaluated by fitting it to the acquired neutron imaging data apparent equilibrium contact angles will be estimated using eq 2 and compared to intrinsic equilibrium contact angles determined on polished surfaces of the same rock types using the sessile drop approach the main hypotheses to be tested are 1 due to differences in mineralogical composition and fracture surface roughness the apparent equilibrium contact angles will differ among the different rock types and 2 due to surface roughness and porosity the apparent equilibrium contact angles of the fracture surfaces will be less than the intrinsic equilibrium contact angles determined on their polished surface counterparts 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock types onset dynamics of air water menisci and equilibrium contact angles were investigated on fracture surfaces from a variety of low porosity rock types the rocks were obtained as cylindrical core samples from unknown surface outcrops through a commercial vendor kocurek industries inc caldwell tx the cores were 5 08 cm long and 2 54 cm in diameter and included both sedimentary and igneous rock types the sedimentary rock types were crossville sandstone also known as crab orchard sandstone cs and mancos shale ms cs is a fine grained light gray fine to medium grained sandstone deposited during the pennsylvanian period in the kentucky tennessee region of the united states cs commonly displays red yellow brown and gray bands due to iron oxidation wanless 1946 the permeability of cs ranges between 3 10 17 and 3 10 18 m2 gehne and benson 2017 ms is an interbedded shale and siltstone located throughout colorado new mexico wyoming and utah in the united states deposited during the late cretaceous the ms is a well known unconventional reservoir and has according to mclennan et al 1983 an estimated volumetric gas reserve of 595 billion m3 the permeability of ms ranges between 3 10 17 and 9 10 19 m2 mokhtari and tutuncu 2015 samples of the ms were obtained with bedding planes oriented both perpendicular ms and parallel ms to coring the igneous rock types were vermilion bay granite known commercially as morning rose granite vg sierra white granite sg and westerly granite wg vg is a pink to light red alkali granite ranging from northern minnesota in the united states to western ontario in canada sg is a granodiorite that was emplaced between the permian and tertiary periods jennings et al 1977 the permeability of sg is 8 10 19 m2 ye and ghassemi 2018 wg is a brownish gray to light gray granite established in rhode island in the united states during the pennsylvanian period quinn et al 1971 the permeability of wg is 6 10 20 m2 brace et al 1968 all of the rock cores were oven dried at 105 c for approximately twenty four hours to bring the matrix moisture content to zero the length and diameter of each core were measured with digital calipers and used to calculate its volume this information combined with gas pycnometry donnelly et al 2016 was used to determine the bulk density ρb solid phase density ρs and porosity ϕ of the different rock types table 1 horizontal flat mirror like surfaces prepared from replicate cores by sequential polishing as described by gates et al 2018 equilibrium air water contact angles θ e were measured on these surfaces using the sessile drop method gates et al 2018 and are summarized in table 1 2 2 fracture surfaces replicate fracture surfaces were obtained for each rock type under laboratory conditions such surfaces can be considered proxies for natural fracture surfaces formed in situ vogler et al 2017 faoro et al 2012 replicate cores were wrapped in kapton tape and fractured using the well known brazilian method li and wong 2013 this method induces a mode i tensile fracture within the core by applying stress between two parallel loading plates until the tensile strength of the core is exceeded resulting in brittle failure hathaway et al 2009 cheng et al 2015 the fracturing of the rock cores was done manually using a model m carver laboratory press with a 25 ton hydraulic unit model no 3925 failure was always accompanied by an audible cracking sound at which point loading was stopped once fractured the kapton tape was removed from each core and the two halves were split apart along the fracture plane this provided two fracture surfaces for testing per rock core any loose fault gouge on the exposed fracture surfaces was removed with air using a high pressure blower the fractured core halves were kept in sealed containers to minimize any changes in moisture content over time the microtopography of subsample flakes of the fracture surfaces was imaged at different scales using a phenom pro x sem phenom world b v eindhoven netherlands perfect et al 2020 the resulting images were detrended to remove any macroscopic slope attributable to the positioning of the flakes surface fractal dimensions ds table 1 were estimated from the detrended images using multi image variography williams and beebe 1993 2 3 dynamic neutron radiography the heights of rise of air water menisci on the fracture faces were obtained as functions of time for each rock type using dynamic neutron radiography this 2 d imaging method is ideally suited to investigate menisci dynamics because neutrons are strongly attenuated by hydrogen in water while air and most minerals in rocks are virtually transparent in a neutron beam furthermore radiographs can be acquired with appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions i e 10 s of μm s and 10 s of frames per second fps respectively perfect et al 2014 dynamic neutron radiography has been used previously to visualize the spontaneous imbibition of water within various porous and fractured materials e g hanžič and ilić 2003 kanematsu et al 2009 hall et al 2013 kang et al 2013 perfect et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge however it has not been previously applied to observe the onset of menisci on exposed fracture surfaces the dynamic neutron radiography was conducted using the cg 1d beamline of oak ridge national laboratory s neutron imaging facility at the high flux isotope reactor oak ridge tn usa detailed information about this cold neutron beam line is given in santodonato et al 2015 a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor scmos detector with a field of view fov of 66 56 mm2 was employed for the menisci measurements the pixel size within the resulting neutron radiographs was experimentally determined to be 20 µm the detector was set at a constant frame rate of 33 fps during data collection all of the image stacks were acquired during july 2018 the design of our imaging experiments was inspired by the wilhelmy plate method for measuring equilibrium contact angles neuman and good 1979 fig 1 a oven dried core halves were placed individually in front of the neutron detector with their exposed fracture surfaces aligned parallel to the neutron beam fig 1b this alignment produced water menisci 25 4 mm thick that could be readily discerned by the neutron detector each rock fracture surface was imaged through time while its base was brought into contact with a water table created by an aluminum reservoir filled with deionized water the resulting vertical movement of the water meniscus on the fracture surface was captured as a series of time stamped digital grayscale images 2 4 image analysis image stacks for each rock fracture face were analyzed to delineate the height of rise of the water meniscus with respect to time images were first normalized in imagej schneider et al 2012 to more clearly visualize the water meniscus on the fracture surface fig 2 a the normalization was done by dividing the individual pixel values of each time stamped radiograph in the stack by the corresponding pixel values from a radiograph acquired immediately before contact was made between the base of the fracture surface and the water table this resulted in normalized gray scale images with pixel values ranging between 0 and 1 a transect a few 10 s of pixels wide was superimposed over the meniscus fracture surface interface in each normalized image fig 2a the normalized pixel values were then averaged on a row by row basis within this transect next change point analysis was employed to determine the height of rise of the water meniscus on the fracture surface fig 2b this analysis were performed in the r software environment r core team 2016 change point analysis is a method of identifying where there are significant shifts in the statistical properties of a sequence of observations eckley et al 2011 brabazon et al 2019 applied this technique to normalized neutron radiographic images of spontaneous imbibition within an enclosed fracture in order to extract the height of water uptake over time a similar likelihood ratio based approach was employed here this consisted of a single change point model used to detect the location where the row averaged normalized pixel values of the transect experienced a significant shift in mean and variance the resulting change point determined for each time stamped image represents the height of the meniscus on the exposed fracture surface at any given time the extracted meniscus heights were converted from pixels to length units using the experimentally determined pixel size of 20 μm 2 5 statistical analyses unless otherwise noted the statistical analyses were conducted using the sas stat software suite sas institute inc 2012 with statistical significance assessed at the p 0 05 level eq 1 was fitted to the meniscus height versus time data sets using segmented non linear regression analysis all of the fits converged according to the software default convergence criterion goodness of fit was quantified using both the sum of squared estimate of errors sse and the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted values r2 the non linear regression analyses resulted in best fit estimates of the following parameters ze κ and t e z e κ 3 2 apparent θ e values for the rock fracture faces were calculated from the best fit ze values using eq 2 analyses of variance anova were performed on the parameter estimates obtained by fitting eq 3 to the data box and whisker plots were used to compare mean values between the different rock types the statistical relationship between θ e for the fracture surfaces estimated using eq 2 wilhelmy plate method and θ e measured on horizontal polished rock surfaces using the sessile drop method was evaluated using linear regression analysis it should be noted that θ e could not be measured by the sessile drop method for the ms cores due to the inability to obtain a mirror like finish during polishing as a result only the ms θ e data were included in the linear regression analysis 3 results and discussion table 1 summarizes various physical properties that were measured on the different rock types mean porosities ranged from 0 69 to 5 85 with the sedimentary rocks cs ms having the highest pore volumes and the granites sg vg wg the lowest mean equilibrium air water contact angles for the cut and polished surfaces ranged from 38 4 to 58 5 with values for the sedimentary rocks slightly lower than those for the granites the exposed fracture surfaces of the cs and ms rock cores both had mean surface fractal dimensions ds of 2 16 these values were significantly greater than two indicating the occurrence of roughness elements over multiple length scales in contrast the mean ds values for the granites were not statistically different from two indicating their fracture surfaces were relatively smooth and planar a total of 27 wilhelmy plate type experiments were conducted at the cg 1d neutron beamline between 4 and 6 replicate imaging data sets of meniscus onset were acquired for each rock type table 2 examples of the extracted meniscus height versus time measurements are given in fig 3 capillary rise was typified by an extremely rapid quasi linear ascent followed by an approximately constant equilibrium height the clanet and quéré 2002 model eq 3 fitted the neutron radiographic data very well with sse values ranging from 0 03 to 2 48 mm2 table 2 the minimum median and maximum r2 values for the best fit predictions regressed against the observed values were 0 828 0 958 0 980 respectively table 2 with just one exception ms rep 4 eq 3 explained at least 90 of the total variation in each observed data set and for half of the fits it explained over 95 of the total variation based on the parameter estimates the time taken for the menisci to reach equilibrium on the exposed rock fracture faces te ranged from 0 13 to 1 03 s table 2 the overall mean te value was 0 39 s and an anova indicated no significant effect of rock type on te the compound κ parameter which incorporates meniscus shape and entrainment effects ranged from 1 22 to 7 68 mm s 2 3 while the ze parameter which determines θ e ranged from 0 64 to 2 49 mm table 2 observed and predicted wetting heights for those fits that yielded the minimum and maximum estimates of κ and ze are shown in fig 3 it is clear from this figure that κ determines the rate of capillary rise of the meniscus with the rate increasing as κ gets larger anova s indicated that rock type had a significant effect on the total variation for both the κ and ze parameters as hypothesized there was also a significant effect of rock type on θ e box and whisker plots for these parameters are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the sedimentary rocks cs ms and ms generally had faster rates of meniscus onset i e higher mean κ values than the igneous rocks sg vg wg the same separation of rock types was also apparent for the ze and θ e parameters with higher elevation s attained and as a result lower equilibrium contact angles for the sandstone and shale versus the three granites fig 4 means and standard errors of the equilibrium contact angles obtained from analysis of the neutron radiographs i e the wilhelmy plate method applied to vertical rock fracture surfaces are compared in fig 5 with the corresponding values determined on polished horizontal surfaces for the same rock types using the sessile drop method the average standard errors associated with the two different measurement approaches were 3 3 for the wilhelmy plate approach and 3 6 for the sessile drop method a paired t test performed on the standard errors indicated no significant difference in measurement variability between the two techniques use of eq 2 to calculate apparent θ e values for rock fracture faces assumes that the surfaces are smooth planar and impermeable the assumption of impermeability was effectively met through the use of low permeability rock types in terms of surface topography the mean ds values for the three granites generally support the smooth and planar assumption however it was likely violated for the sedimentary rocks cs and ms since their mean ds values indicate significant surface roughness over multiple length scales as a result we hypothesized that because of the presence of asperities the apparent θ e values for the rock fracture faces would be less than the measured values for polished surfaces however the opposite was true fig 5 linear regression analysis yielded a statistically significant model which explained 80 of the total variation between the two sets of equilibrium contact angle data fig 5 while the slope of this model was approximately unity the significant positive intercept of 9 75 indicates the apparent θ e values from the neutron imaging approach overestimated the θ e values from the sessile drop method the later are intrinsic equilibrium contact angles since they were determined on polished rock surfaces and corrected for porosity gates et al 2018 both surface roughness and porosity are generally thought to reduce apparent θ e values relative to intrinsic θ e values wenzel 1936 drelich and chibowski 2010 in the present study however the apparent θ e values were actually greater than the intrinsic θ e values the exact reason or reasons for the larger apparent θ e values are not known kirk et al 2019 showed that the wilhelmy plate method generally yields higher intrinsic θ e values as compared to the sessile drop method when both methods are deployed on ideal flat surfaces it is also possible that the greater apparent θ e values are an experimental artifact based on eq 3b the estimated intercept value of 9 75 translates into an underestimation of the height of wetting of 9 when compared to the equilibrium height associated with a contact angle of zero this underestimation of ze could be attributable to the averaging of normalized pixel values for each row within the superimposed transect the averaging was necessary in order to smooth the data for the change point analysis however as a result of this averaging the maximum height of the meniscus on the fracture surface may have been slightly underestimated a slight underestimation of ze will result in a slight overestimation of θ e possibly giving rise to the intercept in the regression model there is a significant body of recent evidence that a thin liquid film precedes the bulk liquid of a meniscus during the wetting of a rough surface e g kim et al 2016 chandra and yang 2011 chen et al 2019 this phenomenon is known as hemiwicking and it may occur on rock fracture faces while precursor liquid films have been visualized using high spatial resolution synchrotron x ray radiography yu et al 2015 our neutron radiographic technique sacrificed spatial resolution in favor of temporal resolution as a result only the bulk water of the meniscus was discernable thus the extracted ze values do not include any component attributable to precursor water films that may or may not have been present this is consistent with our use of the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model to fit these data since that model does not account for hemiwicking 4 concluding remarks the capillary rise of air water menisci on exposed vertical rock fracture faces was quantified using dynamic neutron radiography combined with change point analysis replicate fracture surfaces for a sandstone a shale and three different granites were investigated meniscus movement was typified by an extremely rapid quasi linear ascent until an approximately constant equilibrium height was attained the average time taken for the menisci to reach equilibrium was 0 39 s with no statistically significant differences due to rock type the clanet and quéré 2002 model for meniscus onset dynamics eq 3 fitted the experimental data very well with a median r2 between the observed and predicted values of 0 958 the resulting model parameter estimates κ and ze describe the meniscus onset rate and maximum height attained respectively anova s and box and whisker plots indicated that menisci moved more rapidly and achieved a greater vertical extent on the fracture surfaces of the sedimentary rocks cs ms and ms as compared to those of the granites sg vg wg the wilhelmy plate method eq 2 was used to calculate apparent θ e values for the vertical rock fracture faces based on the estimates of ze this method assumes the surface is smooth and planar despite some of the surfaces exhibiting roughness over multiple length scales there was a statistically significant linear relationship between the resulting apparent θ e values and intrinsic θ e values measured on polished surfaces from the same rock types using the sessile drop method regression analysis indicated that neutron radiography slightly overestimated the equilibrium contact angle as compared to the sessile drop results while the wilhelmy plate approach generally gives higher values of θ e than the sessile drop method when compared for the same surfaces kirk et al 2019 we expected the opposite trend the estimates of θ e for the fracture faces are apparent values which theoretical models predict to be less than intrinsic values due to the presence of asperities and pores wenzel 1936 drelich and chibowski 2010 a possible experimental explanation of this trend is that averaging within the transect window during image analysis resulted in a slight underestimation of ze although the present results are preliminary in nature they are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further exploration of the range of

and good 1979 we focus on the later approach here which relates the equilibrium contact angle to the maximum height attained by the meniscus at equilibrium ze m neuman and good 1979 2 s i n θ e 1 ρ g z e 2 2 γ f 1 f 2 where ρ is the density of the wetting fluid kg m 3 and g is gravitational acceleration ms 2 eq 2 assumes the plate is infinitely wide but surfaces 2 cm wide have been shown to produce acceptable experimental results neumann and good 1979 although the wilhelmy plate method is based on a solid flat plate and has been used on polished rock surfaces muhammad and rao 2003 it has also been applied to measure apparent θ e values for rough surfaces studies by cain et al 1983 and kwok et al 1995 successfully implemented the method to quantify differences in θ e between smooth and rough surfaces for a variety of engineered materials vijapurapu et al 2002 applied it to glass quartz sandstone dolomite and calcite surfaces treated to give varying degrees of surface roughness however their resulting apparent θ e values were insensitive to variations in surface type and roughness 1 3 menisci onset dynamics several studies have investigated menisci dynamics on a vertical solid plate from initial contact to the maximum height of capillary rise bracke et al 1989 derived an empirical expression for the rate of wetting and used it in conjunction with eq 2 to define a dynamic contact angle θ d this approach yields θ d 90 at t 0 with θ d asymptotically approaching θ e as t other authors have presented theoretical models which assume that the shape of the meniscus and thus the contact angle is constant during capillary rise on a vertical surface following this approach eq 2 only holds at equilibrium keller and miksis 1983 clanet and quéré 2002 the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model for the onset dynamics of a meniscus of constant shape on a solid flat vertical surface can be written as 3a z 3 α 1 β 2 1 3 γ f 1 f 2 t 2 ρ 1 3 κ t 2 3 t t e 3b z z e 2 γ f 1 f 2 ρ g 1 s i n θ e t t e where t is time elapsed since liquid first contacts the surface s z is height of the meniscus m at time t s te is the time to reach equilibrium s α is a meniscus shape factor mm 1 β is a liquid entrainment factor mm 1 and κ 3 γ f 1 f 2 α ρ 1 β 2 1 3 eq 3b is equivalent to a rearrangement of eq 2 1 4 imaging menisci recent advances in 3d imaging technology and image analysis software have allowed researchers to directly measure contact angles on natural surfaces within porous reservoir rocks andrew et al 2014 for example employed x ray microtomography to visualize and quantify contact angles in situ within a super critical co2 brine carbonate system the measurements resulted in a distribution of contact angles ranging from 35 to 55 this distribution was attributed to contact angle hysteresis and surface heterogeneity al ratrout et al 2017 and scanziani et al 2017 have published improved algorithms to automatically compute contact angles from segmented x ray tomograms budziak and neumann 1990 have demonstrated that the wilhelmy plate method can be easily adapted for digital image acquisition and analysis we propose the use of a similar imaging based approach in which neutron radiography perfect et al 2014 is combined with the wilhelmy plate method to measure the onset dynamics and apparent θ e of water menisci on vertical rock fracture surfaces 1 5 objectives the objectives of this paper are to visualize and quantify the dynamic behavior of air water menisci on exposed fracture surfaces for a variety of rock types the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model describing the dynamics of menisci movement will be evaluated by fitting it to the acquired neutron imaging data apparent equilibrium contact angles will be estimated using eq 2 and compared to intrinsic equilibrium contact angles determined on polished surfaces of the same rock types using the sessile drop approach the main hypotheses to be tested are 1 due to differences in mineralogical composition and fracture surface roughness the apparent equilibrium contact angles will differ among the different rock types and 2 due to surface roughness and porosity the apparent equilibrium contact angles of the fracture surfaces will be less than the intrinsic equilibrium contact angles determined on their polished surface counterparts 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock types onset dynamics of air water menisci and equilibrium contact angles were investigated on fracture surfaces from a variety of low porosity rock types the rocks were obtained as cylindrical core samples from unknown surface outcrops through a commercial vendor kocurek industries inc caldwell tx the cores were 5 08 cm long and 2 54 cm in diameter and included both sedimentary and igneous rock types the sedimentary rock types were crossville sandstone also known as crab orchard sandstone cs and mancos shale ms cs is a fine grained light gray fine to medium grained sandstone deposited during the pennsylvanian period in the kentucky tennessee region of the united states cs commonly displays red yellow brown and gray bands due to iron oxidation wanless 1946 the permeability of cs ranges between 3 10 17 and 3 10 18 m2 gehne and benson 2017 ms is an interbedded shale and siltstone located throughout colorado new mexico wyoming and utah in the united states deposited during the late cretaceous the ms is a well known unconventional reservoir and has according to mclennan et al 1983 an estimated volumetric gas reserve of 595 billion m3 the permeability of ms ranges between 3 10 17 and 9 10 19 m2 mokhtari and tutuncu 2015 samples of the ms were obtained with bedding planes oriented both perpendicular ms and parallel ms to coring the igneous rock types were vermilion bay granite known commercially as morning rose granite vg sierra white granite sg and westerly granite wg vg is a pink to light red alkali granite ranging from northern minnesota in the united states to western ontario in canada sg is a granodiorite that was emplaced between the permian and tertiary periods jennings et al 1977 the permeability of sg is 8 10 19 m2 ye and ghassemi 2018 wg is a brownish gray to light gray granite established in rhode island in the united states during the pennsylvanian period quinn et al 1971 the permeability of wg is 6 10 20 m2 brace et al 1968 all of the rock cores were oven dried at 105 c for approximately twenty four hours to bring the matrix moisture content to zero the length and diameter of each core were measured with digital calipers and used to calculate its volume this information combined with gas pycnometry donnelly et al 2016 was used to determine the bulk density ρb solid phase density ρs and porosity ϕ of the different rock types table 1 horizontal flat mirror like surfaces prepared from replicate cores by sequential polishing as described by gates et al 2018 equilibrium air water contact angles θ e were measured on these surfaces using the sessile drop method gates et al 2018 and are summarized in table 1 2 2 fracture surfaces replicate fracture surfaces were obtained for each rock type under laboratory conditions such surfaces can be considered proxies for natural fracture surfaces formed in situ vogler et al 2017 faoro et al 2012 replicate cores were wrapped in kapton tape and fractured using the well known brazilian method li and wong 2013 this method induces a mode i tensile fracture within the core by applying stress between two parallel loading plates until the tensile strength of the core is exceeded resulting in brittle failure hathaway et al 2009 cheng et al 2015 the fracturing of the rock cores was done manually using a model m carver laboratory press with a 25 ton hydraulic unit model no 3925 failure was always accompanied by an audible cracking sound at which point loading was stopped once fractured the kapton tape was removed from each core and the two halves were split apart along the fracture plane this provided two fracture surfaces for testing per rock core any loose fault gouge on the exposed fracture surfaces was removed with air using a high pressure blower the fractured core halves were kept in sealed containers to minimize any changes in moisture content over time the microtopography of subsample flakes of the fracture surfaces was imaged at different scales using a phenom pro x sem phenom world b v eindhoven netherlands perfect et al 2020 the resulting images were detrended to remove any macroscopic slope attributable to the positioning of the flakes surface fractal dimensions ds table 1 were estimated from the detrended images using multi image variography williams and beebe 1993 2 3 dynamic neutron radiography the heights of rise of air water menisci on the fracture faces were obtained as functions of time for each rock type using dynamic neutron radiography this 2 d imaging method is ideally suited to investigate menisci dynamics because neutrons are strongly attenuated by hydrogen in water while air and most minerals in rocks are virtually transparent in a neutron beam furthermore radiographs can be acquired with appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions i e 10 s of μm s and 10 s of frames per second fps respectively perfect et al 2014 dynamic neutron radiography has been used previously to visualize the spontaneous imbibition of water within various porous and fractured materials e g hanžič and ilić 2003 kanematsu et al 2009 hall et al 2013 kang et al 2013 perfect et al 2014 to the best of our knowledge however it has not been previously applied to observe the onset of menisci on exposed fracture surfaces the dynamic neutron radiography was conducted using the cg 1d beamline of oak ridge national laboratory s neutron imaging facility at the high flux isotope reactor oak ridge tn usa detailed information about this cold neutron beam line is given in santodonato et al 2015 a scientific complementary metal oxide semiconductor scmos detector with a field of view fov of 66 56 mm2 was employed for the menisci measurements the pixel size within the resulting neutron radiographs was experimentally determined to be 20 µm the detector was set at a constant frame rate of 33 fps during data collection all of the image stacks were acquired during july 2018 the design of our imaging experiments was inspired by the wilhelmy plate method for measuring equilibrium contact angles neuman and good 1979 fig 1 a oven dried core halves were placed individually in front of the neutron detector with their exposed fracture surfaces aligned parallel to the neutron beam fig 1b this alignment produced water menisci 25 4 mm thick that could be readily discerned by the neutron detector each rock fracture surface was imaged through time while its base was brought into contact with a water table created by an aluminum reservoir filled with deionized water the resulting vertical movement of the water meniscus on the fracture surface was captured as a series of time stamped digital grayscale images 2 4 image analysis image stacks for each rock fracture face were analyzed to delineate the height of rise of the water meniscus with respect to time images were first normalized in imagej schneider et al 2012 to more clearly visualize the water meniscus on the fracture surface fig 2 a the normalization was done by dividing the individual pixel values of each time stamped radiograph in the stack by the corresponding pixel values from a radiograph acquired immediately before contact was made between the base of the fracture surface and the water table this resulted in normalized gray scale images with pixel values ranging between 0 and 1 a transect a few 10 s of pixels wide was superimposed over the meniscus fracture surface interface in each normalized image fig 2a the normalized pixel values were then averaged on a row by row basis within this transect next change point analysis was employed to determine the height of rise of the water meniscus on the fracture surface fig 2b this analysis were performed in the r software environment r core team 2016 change point analysis is a method of identifying where there are significant shifts in the statistical properties of a sequence of observations eckley et al 2011 brabazon et al 2019 applied this technique to normalized neutron radiographic images of spontaneous imbibition within an enclosed fracture in order to extract the height of water uptake over time a similar likelihood ratio based approach was employed here this consisted of a single change point model used to detect the location where the row averaged normalized pixel values of the transect experienced a significant shift in mean and variance the resulting change point determined for each time stamped image represents the height of the meniscus on the exposed fracture surface at any given time the extracted meniscus heights were converted from pixels to length units using the experimentally determined pixel size of 20 μm 2 5 statistical analyses unless otherwise noted the statistical analyses were conducted using the sas stat software suite sas institute inc 2012 with statistical significance assessed at the p 0 05 level eq 1 was fitted to the meniscus height versus time data sets using segmented non linear regression analysis all of the fits converged according to the software default convergence criterion goodness of fit was quantified using both the sum of squared estimate of errors sse and the coefficient of determination between the observed and predicted values r2 the non linear regression analyses resulted in best fit estimates of the following parameters ze κ and t e z e κ 3 2 apparent θ e values for the rock fracture faces were calculated from the best fit ze values using eq 2 analyses of variance anova were performed on the parameter estimates obtained by fitting eq 3 to the data box and whisker plots were used to compare mean values between the different rock types the statistical relationship between θ e for the fracture surfaces estimated using eq 2 wilhelmy plate method and θ e measured on horizontal polished rock surfaces using the sessile drop method was evaluated using linear regression analysis it should be noted that θ e could not be measured by the sessile drop method for the ms cores due to the inability to obtain a mirror like finish during polishing as a result only the ms θ e data were included in the linear regression analysis 3 results and discussion table 1 summarizes various physical properties that were measured on the different rock types mean porosities ranged from 0 69 to 5 85 with the sedimentary rocks cs ms having the highest pore volumes and the granites sg vg wg the lowest mean equilibrium air water contact angles for the cut and polished surfaces ranged from 38 4 to 58 5 with values for the sedimentary rocks slightly lower than those for the granites the exposed fracture surfaces of the cs and ms rock cores both had mean surface fractal dimensions ds of 2 16 these values were significantly greater than two indicating the occurrence of roughness elements over multiple length scales in contrast the mean ds values for the granites were not statistically different from two indicating their fracture surfaces were relatively smooth and planar a total of 27 wilhelmy plate type experiments were conducted at the cg 1d neutron beamline between 4 and 6 replicate imaging data sets of meniscus onset were acquired for each rock type table 2 examples of the extracted meniscus height versus time measurements are given in fig 3 capillary rise was typified by an extremely rapid quasi linear ascent followed by an approximately constant equilibrium height the clanet and quéré 2002 model eq 3 fitted the neutron radiographic data very well with sse values ranging from 0 03 to 2 48 mm2 table 2 the minimum median and maximum r2 values for the best fit predictions regressed against the observed values were 0 828 0 958 0 980 respectively table 2 with just one exception ms rep 4 eq 3 explained at least 90 of the total variation in each observed data set and for half of the fits it explained over 95 of the total variation based on the parameter estimates the time taken for the menisci to reach equilibrium on the exposed rock fracture faces te ranged from 0 13 to 1 03 s table 2 the overall mean te value was 0 39 s and an anova indicated no significant effect of rock type on te the compound κ parameter which incorporates meniscus shape and entrainment effects ranged from 1 22 to 7 68 mm s 2 3 while the ze parameter which determines θ e ranged from 0 64 to 2 49 mm table 2 observed and predicted wetting heights for those fits that yielded the minimum and maximum estimates of κ and ze are shown in fig 3 it is clear from this figure that κ determines the rate of capillary rise of the meniscus with the rate increasing as κ gets larger anova s indicated that rock type had a significant effect on the total variation for both the κ and ze parameters as hypothesized there was also a significant effect of rock type on θ e box and whisker plots for these parameters are presented in fig 4 it can be seen that the sedimentary rocks cs ms and ms generally had faster rates of meniscus onset i e higher mean κ values than the igneous rocks sg vg wg the same separation of rock types was also apparent for the ze and θ e parameters with higher elevation s attained and as a result lower equilibrium contact angles for the sandstone and shale versus the three granites fig 4 means and standard errors of the equilibrium contact angles obtained from analysis of the neutron radiographs i e the wilhelmy plate method applied to vertical rock fracture surfaces are compared in fig 5 with the corresponding values determined on polished horizontal surfaces for the same rock types using the sessile drop method the average standard errors associated with the two different measurement approaches were 3 3 for the wilhelmy plate approach and 3 6 for the sessile drop method a paired t test performed on the standard errors indicated no significant difference in measurement variability between the two techniques use of eq 2 to calculate apparent θ e values for rock fracture faces assumes that the surfaces are smooth planar and impermeable the assumption of impermeability was effectively met through the use of low permeability rock types in terms of surface topography the mean ds values for the three granites generally support the smooth and planar assumption however it was likely violated for the sedimentary rocks cs and ms since their mean ds values indicate significant surface roughness over multiple length scales as a result we hypothesized that because of the presence of asperities the apparent θ e values for the rock fracture faces would be less than the measured values for polished surfaces however the opposite was true fig 5 linear regression analysis yielded a statistically significant model which explained 80 of the total variation between the two sets of equilibrium contact angle data fig 5 while the slope of this model was approximately unity the significant positive intercept of 9 75 indicates the apparent θ e values from the neutron imaging approach overestimated the θ e values from the sessile drop method the later are intrinsic equilibrium contact angles since they were determined on polished rock surfaces and corrected for porosity gates et al 2018 both surface roughness and porosity are generally thought to reduce apparent θ e values relative to intrinsic θ e values wenzel 1936 drelich and chibowski 2010 in the present study however the apparent θ e values were actually greater than the intrinsic θ e values the exact reason or reasons for the larger apparent θ e values are not known kirk et al 2019 showed that the wilhelmy plate method generally yields higher intrinsic θ e values as compared to the sessile drop method when both methods are deployed on ideal flat surfaces it is also possible that the greater apparent θ e values are an experimental artifact based on eq 3b the estimated intercept value of 9 75 translates into an underestimation of the height of wetting of 9 when compared to the equilibrium height associated with a contact angle of zero this underestimation of ze could be attributable to the averaging of normalized pixel values for each row within the superimposed transect the averaging was necessary in order to smooth the data for the change point analysis however as a result of this averaging the maximum height of the meniscus on the fracture surface may have been slightly underestimated a slight underestimation of ze will result in a slight overestimation of θ e possibly giving rise to the intercept in the regression model there is a significant body of recent evidence that a thin liquid film precedes the bulk liquid of a meniscus during the wetting of a rough surface e g kim et al 2016 chandra and yang 2011 chen et al 2019 this phenomenon is known as hemiwicking and it may occur on rock fracture faces while precursor liquid films have been visualized using high spatial resolution synchrotron x ray radiography yu et al 2015 our neutron radiographic technique sacrificed spatial resolution in favor of temporal resolution as a result only the bulk water of the meniscus was discernable thus the extracted ze values do not include any component attributable to precursor water films that may or may not have been present this is consistent with our use of the clanet and quéré 2002 theoretical model to fit these data since that model does not account for hemiwicking 4 concluding remarks the capillary rise of air water menisci on exposed vertical rock fracture faces was quantified using dynamic neutron radiography combined with change point analysis replicate fracture surfaces for a sandstone a shale and three different granites were investigated meniscus movement was typified by an extremely rapid quasi linear ascent until an approximately constant equilibrium height was attained the average time taken for the menisci to reach equilibrium was 0 39 s with no statistically significant differences due to rock type the clanet and quéré 2002 model for meniscus onset dynamics eq 3 fitted the experimental data very well with a median r2 between the observed and predicted values of 0 958 the resulting model parameter estimates κ and ze describe the meniscus onset rate and maximum height attained respectively anova s and box and whisker plots indicated that menisci moved more rapidly and achieved a greater vertical extent on the fracture surfaces of the sedimentary rocks cs ms and ms as compared to those of the granites sg vg wg the wilhelmy plate method eq 2 was used to calculate apparent θ e values for the vertical rock fracture faces based on the estimates of ze this method assumes the surface is smooth and planar despite some of the surfaces exhibiting roughness over multiple length scales there was a statistically significant linear relationship between the resulting apparent θ e values and intrinsic θ e values measured on polished surfaces from the same rock types using the sessile drop method regression analysis indicated that neutron radiography slightly overestimated the equilibrium contact angle as compared to the sessile drop results while the wilhelmy plate approach generally gives higher values of θ e than the sessile drop method when compared for the same surfaces kirk et al 2019 we expected the opposite trend the estimates of θ e for the fracture faces are apparent values which theoretical models predict to be less than intrinsic values due to the presence of asperities and pores wenzel 1936 drelich and chibowski 2010 a possible experimental explanation of this trend is that averaging within the transect window during image analysis resulted in a slight underestimation of ze although the present results are preliminary in nature they are sufficiently encouraging to warrant further exploration of the range of applicability and measurement accuracy of this proposed new technique data availability the raw data used to support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon request

371,mangrove forests can significantly attenuate tsunami waves and thus play an important role in coastal protection as a first approximation the problem is modeled utilizing solitary waves impinging on emergent submerged rigid cylinders a three dimensional 3 d numerical model using cyclic boundary conditions was developed based on the ihfoam solver to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on the solitary wave attenuation the numerical model was established based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations combined with the standard k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model and the volume of fluid vof surface capturing schemes the results indicate that different patterns are found in terms of flow field characteristics velocity and turbulent kinetic energy and forces exerted on the cylinders for various wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration which helps to better understand wave dissipation mechanism induced by vegetation different from the bulk drag coefficient derived by the conventional wave dissipation models the direct force method was applied to quantify the time varying and period averaged drag coefficients c d of individual cylinders the time varying c d associated with maximum force and local velocity is defined as the representative c d for comparison with the period averaged c d in detail besides by considering the submergence ratio new generic c d formulas are proposed as functions of the modified reynolds number re and keulegan carpenter number kc for illustrating the c d dynamics under solitary wave conditions finally a preliminary comparison between the proposed c d formulas and existing formulas are given to reveal the intrinsic c d law which may lead to improved understanding and modeling concerning wave vegetation interaction keywords rigid vegetation solitary wave wave nonlinearity direct force method drag coefficients 1 introduction coastal vegetation such as seagrasses salt marshes kelp forests and mangroves etc can significantly attenuate incident wave energy and protect coastal habitats and structures which has long been a topic of interest anderson and smith 2014 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2011 and its wave damping efficiency is remarkable even in extreme sea events möller et al 2014 vuik et al 2018 for example mangrove forests effectively attenuated wave energy from the indian ocean tsunami to save several villages in 2004 huang et al 2011 therefore numerous studies in field scale e g bradley and houser 2009 gaylord et al 2003 jadhav et al 2013 and in laboratory scale e g augustin et al 2009 hu et al 2014 huang et al 2011 koftis et al 2013 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 as well as numerical modeling e g ma et al 2013 mattis et al 2015 2019 maza et al 2013 2015 tang et al 2017 have been conducted to better understand the protection role of coastal vegetation however in addition to wave damping induced by vegetation merely few studies have focused on the turbulence characteristics in vegetated oscillatory flows chen et al 2020 and the vegetation stem scale turbulence was found to play a significant role in in the water environment and ecological processes such as dissolved nutrients supply cornelisen and thomas 2004 sediment suspension and transport chen et al 2007 due to the complicated process and multivariate factors the mechanisms of vegetation hydrodynamics interactions have not been fully understood in recent years wave dissipation induced by vegetation hereafter referred to as wdv has attracted wide interest and its relationship was examined with the vegetation characteristics i e the stem diameter density stiffness and distribution pattern etc and incident wave conditions regular or irregular incident wave height and wave period etc e g bradley and houser 2009 jadhav et al 2013 koftis et al 2013 möller 2006 yang et al 2012 previous studies have mostly focused on vegetation induced attenuation under either regular or irregular wave conditions the mechanism of wave attenuation by vegetation during extreme sea events e g tsunami is still not fully understood moreover few studies consider the effect of wave nonlinearity on wdv wu and cox 2015 which is of great importance to the understanding of the hydrodynamic sedimentation and exchange processes in mangrove forests wdv is primarily induced by the drag force f d provided by the vegetation acting on the wave motion which can be quantified by the morison equation dalrymple et al 1984 morison et al 1950 f d is a function of the vegetation drag coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity used in force equation to define the drag or the resistance of vegetation in a fluid flow which is generally denoted as c d yuce and kareem 2016 thus to adequately describe wdv accurate parameterization of c d is essential mendez and losada 2004 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 however c d parameterization is still challenging when describing vegetation flow interactions in coastal and freshwater environments since it is affected by many factors of wave and vegetation parameters hu et al 2014 henry et al 2015 to our knowledge numerous studies focused on the bulk drag coefficient c d which is an empirical parameter to quantify the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 currently c d is typically calculated based on the measured wave height reduction by the theoretical wdv models which were derived from energy conservation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 or momentum conservation kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 as a conventional method the wdv models have been widely applied in a large number of flume experiments with not only rigid vegetation e g hu et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 chen et al 2018 but also artificial real flexible vegetation e g anderson and smith 2014 cavallaro et al 2018 koftis et al 2013 möller et al 2014 to obtain additional empirical formulas for predicting c d as summarized in table 1 it can be found that for regular or irregular wave flows the c d empirical formulas usually have been proposed as functions of the reynolds number re u c b v ν or the keulegan carpenter number kc u c t b v in which u c is the characteristic velocity b v is the characteristic length usually vegetation diameter ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and t is the wave period that can be replaced by the spectral peak wave period t p in the case of irregular waves note that these formulas can take different forms this can be explained that significant variations exist in the characteristic velocity and length scales as well as the wdv models adopted in the literature besides the cauchy number c a was used to explore the relationship with c d for wave flows interacting with flexible aquatic vegetation cavallaro et al 2018 luhar and nepf 2011 2016 although the aforementioned wdv model method has been widely used in predicting c d the limitations of this method should be pointed out this method derives c d from the perspective of wave energy dissipation the measured wave height attenuation is often assumed to be solely induced by vegetation drag other dissipative processes such as bed friction and wave breaking are not explicitly considered but lumped into the vegetation drag which may lead to an overestimated c d chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 compared to the wdv model method the direct force method hu et al 2014 infantes et al 2011 is a newer approach to determine c d for individual vegetation which is expected to be different from c d mattis et al 2015 the direct force method is based on the original morison equation rather than wdv models and requires synchronized force and local velocity data to determine c d chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 the main difference between the wdv model and direct force methods is that the former can only provide c d for the entire vegetation field while the latter provides a way to obtain both time varying c d and period averaged c d for individual vegetation which makes it easier to better understand wdv processes by providing more accurate c d values however only few studies have been carried out with the goal of considering time varying and period averaged c d hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 using the direct force method for studying wdv in combined wave current flows hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 derived the space averaged period averaged c d termed c d by averaging the data from the 4 locations within the vegetation field to represent the bulk drag characteristics of the entire vegetation zone and respectively proposed two empirical formulas as functions of re and kc please refer to table 1 however the characteristics associated with drag coefficients of the individual vegetation have not yet been clarified to the best of our knowledge the current study is the first study to provide a detailed comparison between the time varying c d and period averaged c d for individual vegetation along the canopy under solitary wave conditions it needs to mention that during the laboratory measurements it is challenging to obtain the desirable aligned force velocity data since it may be limited by synchronized force velocity measuring systems and the data processing technique yao et al 2018 a small time lag between the original force data and velocity data may lead to large errors in deriving c d also the intrinsic time shifts in instrument recordings may further contribute to these errors moreover laboratory wave attenuation studies are extremely expensive to perform and require many testing facilities mattis et al 2019 for this reason it is arduous to obtain all c d values for individual vegetation along the entire path during the laboratory tests hence only a few typical measurements are usually selected to represent the bulk characteristic of the entire vegetation field hu et al 2014 showing a certain degree of limitation alternatively a robust numerical model in which the synchronized force velocity data are determined by post processing utilities which can effectively overcome this limitation as a result both the time varying and period averaged c d for individual vegetation can be accurately provided which is the main objective of this paper regarding the numerical modeling of the interaction between coastal vegetation and waves a common approach is to adopt depth integrated wave equations such as boussinesq type equations huang et al 2011 karambas et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and nonlinear shallow water equations tang et al 2017 wu and marsooli 2012 the effects of vegetation on waves are considered by introducing a drag force term in the depth integrated momentum equations in recent years the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models have also been applied in several works to solve the 3 d wave vegetation issues directly for example maza et al 2015 proposed a 3 d numerical scheme coupled with the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model for simulating the wave flow field by considering the actual geometry of rigid emergent cylinders tsai et al 2017 presented a 3 d rans model to simulate the effects of flexible vegetation on tsunami damping although the rans numerical model has been proven to capture flow information in the vicinity of vegetation however it requires very fine meshes and extremely high computational cost maza et al 2015 2016 however this limitation may be alleviated by applying the cyclic boundary conditions in the numerical flume as used in this study the cyclic boundary conditions are mostly applied to represent a large infinite system by using a small computational domain to effectively eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries and the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency wang et al 2017 and the cyclic boundary conditions have been successfully used to investigate the dynamics of wave driven oscillatory flow through emergent canopies etminan et al 2019 the objective of this study was to use a 3 d numerical approach to investigate solitary wave interactions with the rigid emergent submerged vegetation based on ihfoam solver built in openfoam open field operation and manipulation the numerical model solves the rans equations for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization the standard k ω sst model was considered as the turbulence closure and the volume of fluid vof method was employed to capture the free surface the work is organized as follows first the mathematical description of the 3 d numerical model is presented mesh sensitivity analysis and model validation are carried out using laboratory data in huang et al 2011 in section 4 the numerical model setup and the direct force method are introduced in detail section 5 shows a detailed and intuitive flow field with streamline and vortex information is provided to understand the small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv inside the canopy besides the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on solitary wave attenuation velocity and turbulence fields as well as the wave induced forces exerted on cylinders are also explored on the other hand the time varying c d and period averaged c d related to individual cylinders are compared based on the direct force method furthermore some new generic c d re and c d kc relations are proposed to describe the c d dynamics finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 numerical model to simulate tsunami wave interactions with mangrove forests the direct simulation approach used by maza et al 2015 2016 was followed in this study in this approach individual vegetation elements were included in the numerical domain by considering the actual cylinders geometry note that this approach is free of the complex flow parameterizations such as the drag coefficient used in the macroscopic approach maza et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the numerical model was developed using ihfoam higuera et al 2013a b a 3 d navier stokes ns solver built in the openfoam platform ihfoam adopts a modified version of standard interfoam solver and caters for the simulation of gravity waves higuera et al 2013a b and porous media flows higuera et al 2014 it also incorporates a set of algorithms to generate and absorb waves at the boundaries instead of using the relaxation zones thus accelerating the simulations and ensuring proper representation of the wave induced hydrodynamics in the numerical domain 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 continuity and momentum equations with the assumption of incompressible fluids the aforementioned rans equations which include continuity equation eq 1 and momentum conservation equation eq 2 are used to develop the numerical model for air water two phase flow linking fluid velocity and pressure 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t

water 1 α μ air in this study a standard k ω sst model was included as the turbulence closure due to its ability to deal with reverse pressure gradients that are developed around rigid cylinders menter 1992 maza et al 2015 2016 2 1 2 volume of fluid method it is well known that the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 has been successfully adopted to capture the wave surface between air and water phases α is defined to denote the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell therefore if α 1 a cell is full of water phase if α 0 the cell is full of air phase 0 α 1 represents that the wave surface exists at the cell to obtain physical results α must be conserved and bound between 0 and 1 to maintain a sharp air water interface an artificial compression term u c i weller 2002 is adopted in openfoam to modify the classic vof advection equation as follows 3 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 where u c i min c α u i at xi max u i xi at the free surface and the specified factor c α is equal to 1 by default higuera et al 2013a b maza et al 2015 note that the boundedness of eq 3 is implemented utilizing a specially designed solver called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in openfoam it makes use of the limiting factor of the discrete divergence term flux to ensure that the final value is within 0 and 1 rusche 2002 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 wave generation and absorption boundary conditions following wang et al 2019 the dirichlet boundary condition was utilized at the inflow left boundary to generate the desired solitary wave based on the boussinesq theory lee et al 1982 the corresponding free wave surface elevation is expressed as follows 4 η h i sech 2 3 h i 4 h 3 x where x xl ct xl is the horizontal distance from the wave generation boundary and c g h h i is the wave speed with still water depth h and incident wave height h i accordingly the velocity components that involve derivatives in η are presented as follows 5 u x g h η h 1 1 4 η h h 3 h η 1 3 2 z 2 h 2 d 2 η d x 2 6 u z g h z h 1 1 2 η h d η d x 1 3 h 2 1 1 2 z 2 h 2 d 3 η d x 3 to minimize the effects of reflected waves the active absorption method schäffer and klopman 2000 was employed at the outflow right boundary to generate an opposite velocity with a value equal to the incident wave the free surface corresponds to the reflected wave elevation η r leading to the following expression 7 u cor g h η r where u cor is the correction velocity that is applied to a vector perpendicular to the active absorption boundary and pointing into the domain and η r is calculated by subtracting the measured wave elevation η m at the wave generation boundary from the target one η t according to the equation for the expected reflection free wave generation η r η m η t 2 2 2 other boundary conditions to improve computing efficiency cyclic boundary conditions were considered at the two side walls of the numerical flume chakrabarti et al 2016 the other boundary conditions were established according to higuera et al 2013a b and maza et al 2016 at the upper boundary of the wave flume the pressure was specified as the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary was applied both on the flume bottom and the cylinders geometry surfaces where the flow velocity is zero at the wall surfaces and increases to the free stream velocity away from the boundaries note that the no slip wall boundary has also been successfully applied in unidirectional and wave flows through rigid vertical cylinders using the large eddy simulation les method e g chakrabarti et al 2016 chang et al 2020 stoesser et al 2010 besides the initial values for the standard k ω sst turbulence model were determined according to menter 1992 3 numerical model validation laboratory test results by huang et al 2011 were used to validate the numerical model as they provided solitary wave evolution along an idealized mangrove forest using emergent cylinders it needs to mention that laboratory information about flow characteristics or wave induced forces on the cylinders is unfortunately lacking and only free surface evolution is available to validate the numerical model performance the characteristics of the laboratory tests by huang et al 2011 are as follows the physical flume was 32 m long and 0 55 m wide the cylinders made of perspex tubes with outer diameters of 0 01 m were placed on a flatbed in the middle zone of the wave flume they were arranged following three different arrangements see fig 1 a a b and c with various densities n v 2228 1108 and 560 cylinders m2 respectively the lengths l of the arrangements were equal to 0 545 1 090 and 1 635 m for arrangements a b and c respectively the wave gauge locations g1 g7 are also shown in fig 1 b during the laboratory experiments the incident solitary wave height h i varied from 0 02 to 0 06 m with constant water depth h of 0 15 m in the numerical simulations to reproduce the exact setup in the physical experiments huang et al 2011 the individual rigid cylinders were introduced in a small computational domain with cyclic boundary conditions it needs to mention that the arrangement b with three different flume widths 0 06 m 0 12 m and 0 18 m has been selected to perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the flume width effect on the numerical results and it was found that the effect of numerical flume width on the results can be reasonably ignored after considering the computational cost and the accuracy of the numerical predictions according to this the width of the numerical domain was determined as small as 0 06 m so that the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency and effectively eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries in addition since the wave flow has to be solved among the cylinders a finer mesh was needed for high accuracy yielding a higher computational cost thus to reach a balance between the computational effort and accuracy of the simulated results a comprehensive mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out for arrangement a in this study the meshes were created by using the special mesh generation tool snappyhexmesh in openfoam which can generate smooth meshes by adapting and refining the cells intersected by given surfaces cylinders fig 2 displays a close up of the three meshes considered in the mesh sensitivity analysis a horizontal slice was selected to present the local cells around the cylinders mesh 1 corresponds to the coarser mesh and mesh 3 is the one with the smaller cells the difference between the meshes lies in the refinement introduced around the cylinders to obtain a better flow representation of the small scale flow features the numerical domain was 5 60 m long 0 06 m wide and 0 30 m high the three meshes share the same initial discretization a uniform 0 0025 m in the horizontal and vertical cell size the refinements in mesh 2 and mesh 3 yielded a cell size of 0 00125 m and 0 000625 m around the cylinders respectively and the numbers of total cells for mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 were 1781166 4287565 and 9573693 respectively to run 12 s of actual time with a time step of 0 01 s by using a 4 processor pc machine the execution time associated with mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 were 17 h 112 h and 256 h respectively fig 3 shows the comparison between numerical and laboratory free surface evolutions η for arrangement a using the three meshes showing an overall satisfactory agreement between the data for all three meshes except for an underestimation of the wave height at location g5 for the coarsest mesh mesh 1 due to the poor spatial mesh resolution around the cylinders overall the relative deviations defined as the difference between numerical results and experimental data divided by the latter were smaller than 4 7 for mesh 2 and mesh 3 in addition the reflected wave due to the cylinders was simulated with high accuracy particularly at location g1 near t 9 3 s and the reflected wave height was almost 28 that of the incident wave height therefore fig 3 indicates that the numerical model was able to reproduce the solitary wave propagate over the rigid cylinders with a high degree of accuracy in addition a further mesh sensitivity analysis using the three meshes was performed the cross sectional average velocity u and the wave force f exerted on the cylinders were considered here u was determined by averaging the horizontal velocity ux over the same flume cross section as f which has been found to be an appropriate local velocity to normalize the vegetation related drag force etminan et al 2019 following maza et al 2015 2016 in the numerical post processing the wave force f exerted on the emergent cylinders can be calculated by integrating both pressure and viscous forces on each cylinder as follow 8 f 0 h η p μ e f f u i x i d a where p is the total pressure μ eff is the effective kinematic viscosity which includes the laminar and the turbulent contribution to shear stresses and da is the differential area along the cylinder fig 4 shows the comparison of the maximum wave force f max exerted on the cylinders located at the central line hereinafter referred to as row ⅰ and the maximum cross sectional average velocity u max at the same cross sections for the three meshes the horizontal distance x was normalized by the vegetation length l it was found that although wave height evolutions were similar for the three meshes shown in fig 3 significant differences were observed with respect to f max and u max between mesh 1 and the other two mesh cases revealing an accuracy dependency on the mesh resolution generally when x l was larger than around 0 2 mesh 1 exhibited an underestimation of f max and u max due to the poor spatial mesh resolution around the cylinders however an overall good agreement was observed for f max and u max using mesh 2 and mesh 3 and the maximum deviations were smaller than 11 7 for f max and 5 4 for u max respectively based on previous results mesh 2 was used to further validate the numerical model using other scenarios reported by huang et al 2011 arrangements b and c with different n v and h i as shown in fig 5 an overall favorable agreement was found between the numerical results and experimental data finally mesh 2 was chosen as the mesh resolution in the following simulations after balancing between computational cost and accuracy 4 numerical simulations since the numerical model was demonstrated to reproduce wave height evolution along the canopy with a high degree of accuracy when the cylinders geometry was resolved in the domain it was used in the following sections to explore the detailed hydrodynamic characteristics of the solitary wave interaction with the emergent submerged vegetation 4 1 numerical model setup fig 6 shows a sketch of the numerical model for solitary wave interaction with the rigid vegetation the numerical simulations were performed considering the vegetation arrangements a and b from huang et al 2011 and the vegetation length l was constant as 0 57 m for all simulations the vegetation densities n v were 2228 cylinders m2 and 1108 cylinders m2 the height h v of the cylinder was 0 28 m and its diameter b v was 0 01 m two still water depths h were used to form emergent submerged canopy 0 15 m and 0 30 m and the corresponding submergence ratios h h v were 0 54 and 1 07 respectively four incident solitary wave heights of h i 0 025 0 050 0 075 and 0 15 m for h 0 15 m and h i 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 m for h 0 30 m were studied with the following associated relative wave heights h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 respectively to characterize various wave nonlinearities since the theoretical wavelength of a solitary wave is infinite the effective solitary wavelength l s is approximated ranging from 0 78 m to 3 12 m following the formula l s 4 24 h h i h reported by dean and dalrymple 1991 and maza et al 2015 2016 the parameters of the numerical simulations are summarized in table 2 the numerical domain was 3 60 m long 0 06 m wide and 0 60 m high schematized in fig 6 a solitary wave was generated at the left side of the numerical domain and the active wave absorption was considered at its right side allowing the outgoing waves to leave the domain mesh 2 was used as the mesh resolution due to the sensitivity analysis presented in the previous section accordingly the total cell numbers of the meshes were 4214365 and 2953786 for arrangements a and b respectively to run 5 s of actual time to simulate the solitary wave propagation over the vegetation using a 4 processor pc the time step was chosen as small as 0 01 s it took nearly 102 h and 45 h for arrangements a and b respectively the free surface elevations were obtained by 11 numerical wave gauges along the numerical flume in order to calculate wave damping induced by the vegetation and the representative locations of the numerical wave gauges are indicated in fig 6 a to obtain the in phase data the forces f exerted on the individual cylinders along the canopy and the local cross sectional average horizontal velocities u at the same flume cross sections as f were necessary to be obtained for the following investigation owing to the symmetry of arrangements a and b the cylinders on the central line called row ⅰ and the adjacent row called row ⅱ were selected as force measure locations for the sake of clarity these force probe locations are indicated in the top views in fig 6 b where the cylinders were plotted in blue row ⅰ or gray row ⅱ for arrangement b only the force data on the cylinders along row ⅱ were measured as a comparison furthermore to explore the effects of the cylinder configuration on the flow pattern inside the canopy a group consisting of 3 velocity measuring probes was set at the leading middle and trailing sections corresponding to the x l 0 0 5 1 0 locations of the canopy respectively to obtain the instantaneous horizontal velocity ux and turbulent kinetic energy tke profiles a detailed top view shows the exact probe locations of the circle in red denoted as v i 1 v i 2 and v i 1 respectively as shown in fig 6 b 4 2 direct force method by integrating the pressure and viscous force on the cylinder the total wave force f acting on an individual cylinder has been obtained using eq 8 according to chakrabarti et al 2016 the numerical wave force f also can be expressed by the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 9 f f d f m 1 2 ρ c d h vw b v u u π 4 ρ c m h vw b v 2 u t where f d is the drag force f m is the inertia force c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively h vw is the height of the cylinder submerged in the water body and b v is the diameter of the cylinder usually f m is assumed to be small compared to the f d for waves interacting with small bodies and is typically neglected e g chakrabarti et al 2016 dalrymple et al 1984 huang et al 2011 ma et al 2013 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 therefore for simplicity the numerical f calculated in this study was assumed to be the same as f d without considering the contribution of f m accordingly if the in phase drag force and velocity data are given the time varying c d can be derived from the following equation 10 c d 2 f d ρ h vw b v u u note that the time varying c d has great variability over one wave period chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 specifically the time varying c d is infinite when u is close to zero however those c d values contribute little to the wdv as dissipation is strongest at the u peaks yao et al 2018 in other words c d values at larger velocity matter the most in fact thus the time varying c d corresponding to the maximum drag force and maximum horizontal flow velocity is valuable for describing the wdv mechanism as it will be discussed later in detail for regular wave interactions with the vegetation the period averaged c d is derived by computing the work done by f over one period chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 for such long waves of a solitary wave a pseudo period t s can be calculated by the formula t s l s c huang and yuan 2010 therefore the period averaged c d for solitary wave interactions with the vegetation can be estimated using the direct force method 11 c d 2 0 t s f d u d t 0 t s ρ h vw b v u 2 u d t as shown in table 1 c d is closely related to either re or kc when velocity measurements are unavailable the characteristic velocity u c for calculations of re and kc is usually estimated based on the linear wave theory defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the top of the vegetation located at the seaward edge e g anderson and smith 2014 kobayashi et al 1993 koftis et al 2013 mattis et al 2019 maza et al 2013 mendez et al 1999 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 for physical experiments with small submergence ratios hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 regarded the measured maximum horizontal velocity at the half water depth as the depth average velocity to obtain a suitable characteristic velocity u c instead with respect to the calculations of re u c b v ν and kc u c t b v in this study the local maximum cross sectional average velocity u max was obtained to replace u c the similar usage concerning the maximum horizontal velocity has also been satisfactorily adopted in henry et al 2015 for wave flows b v is represented by the diameter of the cylinder which is the typical characteristic length for re and kc calculation for vegetated flows nepf 2011 for real vegetation cases the measured mean diameter of vegetation stems can be used as the characteristic length jadhav et al 2013 t is the wave period and was replaced by the pseudo period t s for solitary wave in this study 5 results and discussions 5 1 effect of solitary wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on wdv fig 7 shows the normalized free surface elevation η h i at wgs 1 to 11 for emergent submerged vegetation with different relative wave heights h i h 0 17 and 0 67 the results show that arrangements a and b generally share a similar free surface behavior free surface measurements at wg1 reveal stronger reflections for arrangement a while this effect is slightly weaker for arrangement b in addition it was found that the free surface evolutions with larger h i h exhibit a certain degree of asymmetry with sharp peaks followed by significant undulating tails however the amplitudes of the undulating tail for submerged scenarios are weaker to some extent for emergent scenarios the wave height shows a significant decay for larger h i h indicating wave nonlinearity plays a crucial role in wave attenuation to evaluate the effects of the relative wave height h i h on wave damping the solitary wave height evolutions along the flume are presented in fig 8 the wave height h is normalized by h i and the horizontal distance x is normalized by the vegetation length l the beginning of the vegetation zone is set as the origin see fig 6 fig 8 a shows that arrangement a presents a common feature about the wave height evolutions along the canopy the wave height increases rapidly to a value larger than the incident one at the seaward edge of the canopy a local effect due to an increase of flow resistance induced by the cylinders may account for this then h h i decreases with increasing x l from 0 to 1 within the canopy and it increases with increasing x l from 1 behind the canopy note that the emergent canopy contributes a greater deal to h h i variation than the submerged canopy does for equal h i h scenarios as h i h increases from 0 17 to 0 67 the h h i values at x l 1 1 location decreases from 0 71 to 0 44 for the emergent canopy while it keeps around 0 8 for the submerged canopy indicating that the emergent scenarios perform better in wave damping than the submerged scenarios this is because that wave energy is basically concentrated near the wave surface and the majority of the wave energy passes over the submerged canopy without suffering too much disturbance as a result the emergent canopy contributes more to the wave height variation along the flume than the submerged canopy does in addition the h h i reduction increases with the increase of h i h indicating that the emergent canopy can better attenuate waves with stronger wave nonlinearities fig 8 b shows that although arrangement b displays a similar pattern to arrangement a a weaker wave height enhancement occurs at x l 0 location for the former in detail with respect to the emergent scenarios the wave height enhancement factors of arrangement a are 1 34 1 29 1 28 and 1 20 for h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 respectively while they all decrease to 1 18 1 13 1 12 and 1 13 of arrangement b respectively due to lower flow resistance this effect is greatly relevant to the flow behavior characteristics at the seaward edge of the canopy on the other hand compared to arrangement a the wave height reduction is not remarkable for arrangement b for example for the emergent canopy the h h i values at x l 1 1 for arrangement a are within the range of 0 71 to 0 44 for various h i h while they are from 0 90 to 0 72 for arrangement b moreover the h h i values at x l 1 1 for submerged canopy keep around 0 90 the above results indicate that vegetation configuration plays a significant role in wave damping applying the morison equation and linear wave theory wave attenuation within the canopy can be evaluated by a wave decay formulation as follows dalrymple et al 1984 12 k v h h 0 1 1 β x where k v is the damping coefficient h 0 is the initial wave height at the seaward edge of the canopy β is the damping factor that can be obtained by fitting eq 12 when spatial wave height data are available eq 12 shows that the damping factor β is of significance to describe the wave height attenuation characteristics inside the canopy indicating that a larger β illustrates a better wdv performance this wave decay formulation was also successfully adopted in numerous studies e g chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 mattis et al 2019 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 fig 9 shows the variation of h h 0 along the canopy for all scenarios together with the curves fitted to the wave heights based on eq 12 using a nonlinear least squares method it is found that all fitted curves present extremely high correlation coefficients indicating that the wave decay formulation for regular waves proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 also fits well with the solitary wave attenuation along the canopy in addition the fitting curves for arrangement a shows a stronger correlation than those for arrangement b the weaker the wave nonlinearity the stronger the correlation of the fitted curves confirming the significant influences of the vegetation configuration and wave nonlinearity on wave height evolutions in detail the wave attenuation variations lead to different β values and they have a close relationship with various h i h with regard to arrangement a for emergent scenarios β is fitted to be 1 31 1 92 2 40 and 2 41 for h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 scenarios respectively in contrast the submerged canopy shows much smaller β values i e approximately from 0 67 to 0 51 indicating β values significantly depend on the submergence ratio h h v specifically chen et al 2018 reported a β value of 0 059 in regular wave interactions with the rigid submerged vegetation where the wave height was 0 08 m and the wave period was 1 5 s the large difference in β values may be attributed to the differences in vegetation density in the tested vegetation by chen et al 2018 which was 139 cylinders m2 while the vegetation densities of arrangements a and b are 2228 and 1108 cylinders m2 in this study indicating that vegetation with a larger density has a larger damping factor β with a better wave attenuation performance 5 2 flow pattern characteristics inside the canopy to better understand the wdv from the small scale perspective this section provides a detailed and intuitive wave field containing streamline and vortex information besides the influence mechanisms of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on velocity and turbulence fields tke are also explored 5 2 1 velocity field inside the canopy fig 10 presents four various time snapshots of wave flow pattern inside the canopy for arrangements a and b and the emergent scenarios with the largest relative wave height h i h 0 67 are considered as an example the wave free surface is included for each instance which is colored by the horizontal velocity magnitude ux m s 1 in order to better understand the internal flow field inside the canopy when a solitary wave passes by in the left panels for each instance a typical slice is selected at half the still water depth to exhibit the detailed velocity field the right panels show the streamlines within the canopy which are colored by the vorticity magnitude s 1 as can be observed from the left panels of fig 10 a for arrangement a when the solitary wave crest reaches the seaward edge of the canopy at t 1 45 s the wave surface ascends obviously because of the cylinders obstacle yielding a significant enhancement in wave height consistent with the results shown in fig 8 the typical slice shows that as the solitary wave is passing along the canopy the wave induced flow is channeled along the gap between row i and row ii and is oriented in the wave propagation direction except for the first cylinders at the seaward edge the other cylinders are not directly exposed to the flow they shelter each other this is the sheltering effect described by raupach 1992 and etminan et al 2019 as a consequence the downstream cylinders experience a lower incident velocity due to the sheltering effect by upstream cylinders meanwhile the right panels of fig 10 a illustrates that the streamlines become significantly disturbed within the canopy by the obstacle of cylinders in particular a few spiral vortexes occur at the cylinder spacing i e the cylinder s wake region moreover a higher vorticity magnitude appears within the region below the wave crest as the wave continues to propagate through the canopy at t 1 55 s a slight wave breaking occurs at the wave surface and the magnitude of ux decrease rapidly due to energy dissipation as the wave continues to propagate at t 1 65 s to 1 75 s the wave height gradually decreases significantly accompanied by a decreasing velocity field the vorticity field also moves forward following the wave crest location and the range of vortex influence gradually expands as expected from the overall view of fig 10 b the behavior of the flow pattern for arrangement b is similar to that for arrangement a however the velocity and vorticity fields differ between the staggered and aligned configurations due to the absence of the cylinders along row ⅰ for arrangement b a preference flow channel develops with a low dissipation rate along the channel it is interesting to note that the ux values behind the upstream cylinders are pretty small due to the sheltering effect which is different from the behavior presented by arrangement a the effect of the staggered cylinder on the velocity field will be explained in detail in fig 11 as can be observed from the typical slices for t 1 55 s to 1 75 s ux remains a larger magnitude as the wave propagates indicating that the velocity field weakens little due to the aligned configuration in addition the scales of spiral vortexes are larger than that of arrangement a this is because that the vortex structure of arrangement b can be more fully developed due to its wider cylinder spacing on the other hand it is interesting to note the change of solitary wave celerity for arrangements a and b it can be observed from the free surface elevation snapshots at t 1 75 s that the wave crest is located at different positions for both the arrangements the higher the cylinder density the higher the wave celerity reduction to reveal the effects of the vegetation configuration on the velocity field the velocity data are obtained at the three probe locations v i 1 v i 2 and v ii 1 in the leading middle and trailing sections x l 0 0 5 and 1 0 refer to fig 6 b specifically for arrangement b probes v i 1 and v ii 2 are located at the constricted cross section and probe v ⅱ 1 is located directly in the area sheltered by the upstream cylinder fig 11 shows the vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity ux as wave crests pass over the three typical sections the emergent submerged scenarios for arrangements a and b with the largest relative wave height h i h 0 67 are tested here the black and green dotted lines indicate the still water level and the canopy height respectively for each subfigure the upper panels show the results for arrangement a and the bottom panels correspond to arrangement b it can be observed from fig 11 a that the ux values increase gradually from the bed to wave crest due to the effects of cylinders and the increasing rates of arrangement b are slightly larger than those of arrangement a in general due to the influence of the central row ⅰ cylinders the vertical structure of ux shows different patterns at three typical locations in detail the ux values of probe v ⅰ 1 are larger than those of probes v ⅰ 2 and v ⅱ 1 at x l 0 section for emergent scenarios of arrangement a this is because probe v ⅰ 1 is directly exposed to wave action and probes v ⅰ 2 or v ⅱ 1 are located at the shadow of the cylinders as the wave propagates through the canopy x l 0 5 1 0 the velocity field redistributed and the ux values of probes v ⅰ 1 v ⅰ 2 and v ⅱ 1 are basically similar to each other however the ux values of probe v ⅰ 2 are slightly higher than the other two probes at x l 1 0 section this may be attributed to the absence of the downstream cylinder at the leeward edge of the canopy in contrast for emergent scenarios of arrangement b bottom panels in fig 11 a the ux profiles at probe v ⅱ 1 show different behaviors in which the ux values are basically equal to zero along the water depth and the ux values of probes v ⅰ 1 and v ⅰ 2 are larger than those for arrangement a consistent with the flow pattern observed in fig 10 this feature attributes to the existence of preference flow channels in arrangement b and its lower cylinder density which makes the flow through the canopy easier with a low wave energy dissipation compared to the emergent scenarios fig 11 b shows that the submergence ratio plays a significant role in ux profiles for submerged scenarios in general the variation of the ux values within the canopy 0 z 0 28 m is relatively small and the behaviors of ux profiles are similar to fig 11 a however for the submerged scenarios of arrangement a a rapidly ux amplification occurs above the canopy 0 28 z 0 30 m and ux continues to increase until it reaches the wave crest surface this will result in a wave induced current in the same direction as the wave above the canopy it has been associated with boundary layer streaming which follows from the shear stresses at the top of the canopy van veelen et al 2020 by contrast van veelen et al 2020 observed a wave induced anti clockwise circulation above the rigid submerged canopy under regular wave conditions due to the elliptical motion of the water particles it needs to be emphasized that the ux profile of v ⅰ 1 at x l 0 section keeps a similar trend as fig 11 a and no velocity amplification layer develops above the canopy this is due to the lack of sheltering effects of the upstream cylinder the similar ux profiles trend also appears in the ux profiles of probes v ⅰ 1 and v ⅰ 2 i e along row ⅰ for the submerged scenarios of arrangement b 5 2 2 turbulent kinetic energy tke evolution inside the canopy the tke will be generated and will dissipate during the wave when interacting with the cylinders as shown in fig 12 the tke evolutions at the half still water depth along row ⅰ were obtained to compare the time evolutions of surface elevation η h i at the same cross section the emergent and submerged scenarios of arrangement a for h i h 0 67 were considered as examples fig 12 a shows that when the wave crest reaches x l 0 section the tke at x l 0 section has not yet developed instead the maximum tke occurs at x l 0 16 section this result is similar to maza et al 2015 who found that the maximum turbulent intensity does not develop when the wave crest reaches the emergent cylinders fig 12 a also shows that there is a variable time lag between the occurrence of maximum tke and the maximum η h i for example the time lag increases from 0 s for x l 0 16 section to 0 1 s for x l 0 95 section that is the maximum tke is produced after the wave crest passes each section for emergent scenarios by contrast fig 12 b shows that the submerged scenario shows a different pattern the maximum tke at x l 0 16 to 0 47 section develops before the wave crest while the maximum tke at x l 0 95 section occurs after the wave crest furthermore it can be observed in fig 12 a and b that the maximum tke shows a decreasing trend from x l 0 16 to 0 47 and then keeps a stable value within the region of x l 0 47 to 0 95 indicating that turbulence has entered a fully developed region according to the above the tke values at a certain position are time varying as shown in fig 12 in contrast fig 13 shows the vertical profiles of the time averaged tke tke at the three typical sections x l 0 0 5 and 1 0 to reveal the effects of the cylinders along row ⅰ on tke field similar to fig 11 the emergent submerged scenarios for arrangements a and b with h i h 0 67 are tested here the black and green dotted lines indicate the still water level and the canopy height respectively fig 13 a shows that the emergent scenarios of arrangements a and b present a similar vertical profile of tke tke keeps stable within 0 z 0 1 m for each probe v ⅰ 1 v ⅱ 1 and v ⅰ 2 at each section while significant tke amplifications occur near the still water surface at x l 0 and 1 0 sections a higher tke appears at v ⅰ 1 location than that at v ⅰ 2 location of x l 0 section however a contrary behavior occurs at x l 1 0 section the reason for this is that the wave breaking at the seaward canopy edge x l 0 results in the tke amplification at v ⅰ 1 location the absence of the downstream cylinders accounts for the tke amplification of probes of v ⅰ 2 at the leeward canopy edge x l 1 0 it is expected that the tke values of probes of v ⅱ 1 at the seaward and leeward canopy edges have not obviously been changed due to the sheltering effect of the upstream cylinders in addition fig 13 b shows that the submerged scenarios of arrangements a and b exhibit a similar vertical structure of tke to the emergent ones in fig 13 a the major difference is that the amplification layer of tke for submerged scenarios appears in the vicinity of the canopy top z 0 28 m and its amplification magnitudes are smaller at both seaward and leeward edges of the canopy x l 0 and 1 0 and larger within the canopy x l 0 5 than those of the emergent scenarios as a summary the tke increases obviously near the shear layers i e the still water surface for emergent canopy or the canopy top for submerged canopy on the other hand the tke at both ends of the canopy exhibit different degrees of increase and their magnitudes are much larger than those within the canopy it can be seen from figs 10 to 13 that the presence of vegetation significantly changes the flow structure velocity and turbulence characteristics which will help us better understand the hydrodynamic processes such as wdv sediment suspension and transport within the vegetation canopy however the tke is obtained based on the fluctuation velocity which is not relevant to the subsequent researches with respect to drag coefficients will not be discussed in further detail 5 3 fmax and umax along the canopy the maximum forces exerted on the individual cylinders along the canopy were obtained and shown in fig 14 for arrangements a and b the maximum forces f max are normalized by ρg h h i a w and ρ g h v a w for emergent and submerged scenarios respectively where a w and a w are the cylinder wet y sectional areas calculated by b v h h i and b v h v respectively the force data along both row ⅰ and row ⅱ are presented for arrangement a and only the forces along row ⅱ are shown for arrangement b for comparison generally normalized f max at the cylinders increases with increasing h i for given h scenarios and the values of f max ρ g h h i a w for emergent canopies are smaller than that for submerged ones in detail with respect to arrangement a the values of f max ρ g h h i a w decreases basically along the canopy and the reduction rate increases with increasing h i h which is in accordance with the trend of the wave height damping in particular the smallest relative wave height h i h 0 17 shows an almost constant value of f max ρ g h h i a w along the canopy for h i h 0 17 scenario which is consistent with the conclusions reported by maza et al 2015 moreover there is no significant difference in f max ρ g h h i a w between row ⅰ and row ⅱ by contrast fig 14 b shows a similar variation of f max ρ g h h i a w along the canopy for submerged scenarios however the values of f max ρ g h h i a w decreases from x l 0 to 0 5 and then remains stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy in addition for the stronger nonlinearity scenarios h i h 0 50 0 67 significant differences and fluctuations occur between row ⅰ and row ⅱ at the seaward region of the canopy this can be related to the velocity amplification above the canopy shown in fig 11 b fig 14 c and d shows that with increasing x l from 0 to 1 for arrangement b f max ρ g h v a w decreases sharply from the first cylinders of the seaward edge of the canopy and then slightly decreases to an almost constant value similar to what was observed for the testing prototype rhizophora mangrove forests reported by ismail et al 2012 this effect plays a significant role in the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to waves located at the seaward region of the canopy the alignment configuration generates clearly preference flow channels because of the relatively large and uniform spacing between the cylinders and the cylinders except for the first ones are not directly exposed to wave induced flow the downstream cylinders are sheltered by the upstream ones as a result the values of f max ρ g h v a w vary little along the canopy however this effect is not observed for arrangement a with a higher density and staggered configuration in addition the results of arrangement b show that a self similarity characteristic with almost the same values of f max ρ g h v a w appears between emergent and submerged scenarios except for the first seaward cylinders indicating that f max ρ g h v a w is not sensitive to the submergence ratio for arrangement b similarly fig 15 shows that the maximum cross sectional average velocity u max at the same cross sections as f max along the canopy in which u max is normalized by solitary wave celerity c it is expected that u max c increases with increasing h i for the given h scenarios and all the u max c tend to be the minimum values at x l 1 0 overall the values of u max c for emergent scenarios are obviously much smaller than those for submerged scenarios as expected showing that the submergence ratio plays a greater role in flow velocity than the force exerted on cylinders shown in fig 14 regarding arrangement a fig 15 a shows that the u max c values initially increase at the seaward region of the canopy and the larger h i h further increases the amplification then u max c decreases along the canopy basically and the reduction rate increases with increasing h i h in particular u max c tends to be an almost constant value along the canopy for h i h 0 17 scenarios similar to the overall evolutions of f max as shown in fig 14 b fig 15 b shows that the values of u max c increase firstly and then decreases from x l 0 05 to 0 5 and then remains stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy besides fig 15 c and d show that with increasing x l from 0 to 1 u max c decreases firstly from the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the canopy and then remains an almost constant on the other hand for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a the u max c values at row ⅱ are slightly larger than those at row ⅰ especially for h i h 0 67 scenarios this can be explained by the blockage effect etminan et al 2019 of the presence of the cylinder body at row ⅱ reducing the cross sectional area locally which results in a local velocity increase around the cylinders zdravkovich 2003 similar to that for unidirectional flow reported by etminan et al 2017 in addition this blockage effect gradually weakens as the wave nonlinearity increases in contrast the submerged scenarios of arrangement a show a different pattern this is because the majority of wave energy passes over the submerged canopy without suffering too much disturbance 5 4 drag coefficient quantification for individual cylinder using direct force method 5 4 1 deriving time varying c d fig 16 shows the time varying wave induced force f the cross sectional average horizontal velocity u and the time varying c d at x l 0 026 0 342 0 658 and 0 974 sections corresponding to the locations of the 1st 7th 13th and 19th cylinders along row ⅰ the emergent scenarios with h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 for arrangement a were considered it is found that they share a similar behavior that both f and u show consistent variation with the solitary wave height the f and u peak values decrease with increasing x l indicating the vegetation induced wave damping along the canopy note that the dashed lines in the plots show that there is almost no time lag between f and u this is the main advantage of numerical simulations compared to physical measurements because a robust realignment algorithm needs to be developed to get the synchronized f and u data in physical tests as suggested by yao et al 2018 the time varying c d can be derived from in phase data of time varying f and u based on eq 10 without considering the contribution of the inertia force f m the results in fig 16 indicate that the time varying c d values vary with f and u accordingly generally leading to a declining trend as expected the time varying c d values are unrealistically high with small u in particular they reach infinity when u approaches zero which is not plotted in the figures further the time varying c d can drop to near zero when f is weak it needs to mention that the unrealistically large c d values are not beneficial in modeling wdv since they are associated with small u when the energy dissipation is greatly limited hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 by contrast the time varying c d values tend to be relatively small and stable near the f and u peaks which contribute fundamentally to the wdv consequently the time varying c d associated with the velocity peak u max and the maximum force f max namely representative c d is obtained to better understand the wdv mechanism in this study 5 4 2 deriving representative c d and period averaged c d fig 17 shows the representative c d for individual cylinders along the canopy it is calculated by using in phase f max and u max data to replace f d and u in eq 10 the representative c d for individual cylinders along both row ⅰ and row ⅱ are presented for arrangement a and for arrangement b only the representative c d along row ⅱ is shown it is expected that the evolution of the representative c d has a general trend opposite to both f max and u max in general fig 17 shows the representative c d values of arrangement a are larger than that of arrangement b for a given h i h due possibly to the blockage and sheltering effect of the cylinders etminan et al 2019 also the representative c d values of the emergent canopy are much larger than that of the submerged canopy as expected moreover the representative c d values decrease as h i h increases in detail compared fig 17 a and c the representative c d values present a general increasing trend along the emergent canopy for a given h i h except for the cylinders at the seaward and leeward regions along row ⅱ for arrangement a the effect of the staggered cylinders can account for this a similar pattern is observed between fig 17 b and fig 17 d in which the representative c d shows an almost constant value along the canopy except for the fluctuation at the seaward and leeward regions therefore the representative c d values can be approximated as a constant value within a submerged canopy which is similar to the use of bulk drag coefficient c d which is expected to be useful to future numerical modeling studies in addition for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a although there is no significant difference in f max and u max along row ⅰ and row ⅱ in figs 14 and 15 respectively the representative c d values along row ⅰ are significantly larger than those along row ⅱ shown in fig 17 a in contrast the differences in representative c d along row ⅰ and row ⅱ become smaller for the submerged canopy as a comparison the period averaged c d values are estimated based on eq 11 and fig 18 shows the comparison of period averaged c d and representative c d for individual cylinders to quantitatively compare both of them the ratio of the period averaged c d to representative c d is defined as r cd the y x lines are plotted for reference in the figures different patterns are observed for various scenarios in detail for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a fig 18 a most of the period averaged c d values are slightly smaller than representative c d except for the strongest wave nonlinearity scenario h i h 0 67 the r cd values are between 0 9 and 1 0 for h i h 0 17 to 0 50 scenarios showing an overall good agreement between representative c d and period averaged c d in contrast although the emergent scenarios of arrangement b show a similar tendency and smaller r cd values are observed compared with those for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a a large proportion of r cd values range from 0 70 to 0 85 the main reason for this is that within a wave cycle more wave induced forces for the cylinders except for the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the canopy shifts towards the negative direction leading to a smaller 0 t s f d u d t in eq 11 note that the four data in the red circle are almost located in the vicinity of the y x line they correspond to the first seaward cylinders for various h i h showing a slight difference between the period averaged c d and representative c d in terms of the submersed scenarios of arrangement a fig 18 b for h i h 0 17 scenarios the period averaged c d is equal to the representative c d in general for the higher h i h scenarios of 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 the period averaged c d values are larger than the representative c d to some extent the r cd values of h i h 0 67 increase to 1 3 however a large number of r cd values lie between 1 0 and 1 1 indicating a good agreement between period averaged c d and representative c d by contrast a more scattered pattern is observed in fig 18 d in which the typical four data in the red circle are also clearly captured similar to fig 18 c showing the significant effects of the first cylinders on the wave field for arrangement b this is also consistent with the characteristics of the normalized maximum wave induced forces in figs 14 c d in addition as h i h increases from 0 17 to 0 67 r cd increases from around 0 70 to 1 20 indicating wave nonlinearity has more sensitive effects on the period averaged c d in this situation 5 5 relations of cd re and cd kc as shown in table 1 the bulk drag coefficient c d has generally been expressed as functions of re and kc the most common expressions are mostly written as c d δ κ re γ and c d δ κ kc γ based on the empirical formulas all the representative c d data for individual cylinders are plotted against re and kc for various h i h in fig 19 it needs to mention that similar figures for the period averaged c d re and c d kc relations are not reported here since the period averaged c d shows a comparable agreement with the representative c d shown in fig 18 following the structure of the empirical c d re relationships in kobayashi et al 1993 and mendez et al 1999 the lower bound of the non dimensional parameter δ is given as 0 08 for all scenarios thus quite a few representative c d re relations are obtained as the best fit using the nonlinear least squares method the non dimensional parameters κ and γ and the correlation coefficient r2 are also included in these plots note that the submerged scenarios show a larger re since these scenarios have larger u max values than the emergent ones leading to two separate clusters of data within a wide range of re nevertheless there is a close relationship between the two separate clusters based on previous empirical formulas the fitted results show that the r2 values of the fitted c d re relations are extremely high between 0 968 and 0 992 for arrangement b whereas they lie between 0 933 and 0 977 for arrangement a indicating a stronger correlation for arrangement b moreover as the relative wave height h i h gradually increases for arrangement a the values of κ increase from 2345 to 5669 and the γ values decrease from 1 452 to 1 382 in contrast to arrangement b the values of κ and γ increase from 1882 to 4698 and 1 756 to 2 049 respectively indicating that the vegetation configuration plays an important role in determining κ and γ fig 19 b presents the fitted curves of representative c d kc relations using the nonlinear least squares method and the parameter δ is determined to be 0 for all scenarios consistent with the values reported by bradley and houser 2009 sánchez gonzález et al 2011 and jadhav et al 2013 for waves interacting with flexible real vegetation thalassia testudinum posidonia oceanica spartina alterniflora in addition the values of κ and γ were determined with the same order of magnitude as previous studies in table 1 note that the r2 values of the fitted c d kc relations are between 0 964 and 0 988 for arrangement a and within the range of 0 985 and 0 997 for arrangement b showing a stronger correlation for arrangement b in addition the r2 values of representative c d kc relations are higher than those of c d re relations this is consistent with the conclusions in the literature augustin et al 2009 chen et al 2018 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 in which the c d kc relations were suggested more suitable for oscillatory flows since kc contains additional information of wave period while re depends solely on characteristic velocity it is found in fig 19 that a similar pattern regarding the c d re and c d kc relations occur for various h i h scenarios in general the representative c d decreases with increasing re and kc values as expected consequently to provide general results for all h i h scenarios the generic representative c d re and c d kc relations are obtained for arrangement a arrangement b and a combined arrangement arrangements a b using the same formulas used in fig 19 as a result fig 20 a shows that the representative c d generally decreases with increasing re from 507 to 8048 whereas the data show a substantial degree of scattering for various h i h scenarios as a result relatively lower r2 values are obtained approximately 0 71 for the representative c d re relations for all scenarios in contrast the degree of scattering is much reduced in the relation between the representative c d and kc in fig 20 b for example the r2 value of the fitted representative c d re relation for arrangements a b is 0 72 whereas it is as high as 0 97 for the fitted representative c d kc relation showing a stronger correlation of representative c d with kc than with re as expected consistent well with the tendency in fig 19 in addition when kc is smaller than 10 all fitted curves coincide indicating a high degree of internal similarity for various h i h as recommend by mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 and mattis et al 2019 to obtain better c d re and kc relations for emergent submerged vegetation re and kc numbers can be modified by introducing the submergence ratio h h v which accounts for the vertical variation of the vegetation properties here the modified reynolds number is defined as re re h h v and the modified keulegan carpenter number is defined as kc kc h h v fig 21 presents the modified relations between the representative c d and re as well as kc it is found that the distribution of data points is much denser than that in fig 20 particularly for arrangements a b r2 values increase from 0 72 to 0 85 for the representative c d re relation and it increases slightly from 0 97 to 0 98 for the representative c d kc relation indicating that the modified re and kc describe the behaviors of the c d dynamics for emergent submerged vegetation with relatively satisfactory performance especially for the modified re number re table 3 summarizes the generic relations between the representative c d and re or kc for arrangements a b and the relations with respect to the period averaged c d are also included in general it is found that the period averaged c d re and c d kc relations show lower r2 values than those for the representative c d further all the relations are plotted in fig 22 to compare with the existing formulas list in table 1 concerning the bulk c d re and kc relations using the wdv model or direct force method it should be emphasized that fig 22 only shows a preliminary comparison and analysis with respect to the c d relations this is because that many significant differences exist in these formulas due possibly to too many complex factors such as the vegetation species rigid or flexible and configurations staggered aligned or random wave conditions regular irregular or solitary the definitions of re and kc using various characteristic velocity and length scales and the c d derivation methods wdv model or direct force etc therefore the c d formulas proposed in this study cannot be directly compared with existing formulas in the literature although an overall similar trend can still be found i e with an increase of re re or kc kc the drag coefficients gradually decrease and approach a stable value revealing the intrinsic law between drag coefficient and re or kc number in addition it is clear that most c d values in this study are larger than that of the literature in general the reason for this may be that the wdv model assumes that the flow velocity inside a canopy follows the linear wave theory and is not attenuated by the canopy however the flow velocity is reduced due to the presence of vegetation canopy hu et al 2014 leading to a larger c d for the direct force method in this study by drawing analogies between pipe flows and vegetated channel flows cheng and nguyen 2011 proposed a new friction function with re that is redefined by using a vegetation related hydraulic radius to evaluate the resistance force induced by emergent vegetation in open channel flow similar to the manning equation which is useful for consolidating various experimental data across a wide range of vegetation density it sheds some light on conducting a generic formulation for predicting the drag force coefficient with various parameters for wave and vegetation in future work 6 conclusions the numerical modeling of the interaction of tsunami waves with mangrove forests is studied employing solitary waves impinging on rigid cylinders based on the ihfoam solver a 3 d rans numerical model with cyclic boundary conditions is developed considering the actual geometry of the cylinders in the domain the cyclic boundary condition is adopted to improve computing efficiency the numerical model is well validated using the experimental data reported by huang et al 2011 a series of numerical experiments in terms of emergent submerged vegetation with staggered aligned configurations using this validated model have been carried out and several findings were obtained in general the vegetation configuration and wave nonlinearity play significant roles in vegetation induced wave damping the wave height increases with enhancement factors greater than about 1 2 and 1 1 at the seaward edge of staggered and aligned configurations for emergent canopy respectively by contrast the submerged canopy shows a gentle wave height transition due to lower flow resistance a better vegetation induced wave attenuation performance occurs for emergent canopy with the staggered configuration the stronger the wave nonlinearity the better the wave attenuation induced by vegetation besides the wave decay formulation for regular waves proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 fits well with the solitary wave attenuation along the canopy with very high correlation coefficients especially for staggered canopy under relatively weakly nonlinear solitary waves in addition different patterns are found in flow characteristics water velocity vorticity and tke and wave induced forces on cylinders for emergent submerged canopy with staggered aligned configuration as well as various wave nonlinearities which make it easier to better understand energy dissipation mechanisms from a small scale perspective within the staggered canopy the local velocities in the vicinity of individual cylinders are nonzero and similar to each other owing to the velocity redistribution by contrast due to the absence of central cylinders for aligned canopy a preference flow channel developed consequently the velocities behind the upstream cylinders are close to zero because of the upstream cylinders sheltering effect moreover the presence of the sheltering effect contributed to the generation of the velocity amplification layer wave induced current above the submerged canopy furthermore the time averaged tke tke profiles exhibit a similar amplification near the shear layers i e the still water surface for emergent canopy or the canopy top for submerged canopy the tke amplifications at both ends of the canopy behave differently and they are stronger than those within the canopy on the other hand the appearance of the maximum tke is not synchronized with the wave crest in particular the maximum tke is produced after the wave crest passes for the emergent canopy the evolutions of dimensionless maximum forces f max and local maximum cross sectional average velocity u max along the canopy were provided in detail the stronger the wave nonlinearity the larger f max and u max the influence of the submergence ratio on u max is more sensitive than that on f max apart from the seaward and leeward edges of the staggered canopy both f max and u max decrease along the canopy basically for the emergent canopy and they decrease to the middle of the vegetation field and then keep stable for the submerged canopy and the decrease rates of f max and u max shows a declining trend as wave nonlinearity decreases in addition both f max and u max decrease from the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the aligned canopy and then remain stable along the canopy different from the bulk drag coefficients c d derived by the wdv models a direct force method was applied to quantify the drag coefficients c d for individual cylinders including the time varying c d and the period averaged c d based on the synchronized f and u data note that the time varying c d varies with the variations of f and u accordingly generally following a declining trend and it tends to be stable near the f and u peaks which makes a fundamental contribution to wave energy dissipation consequently the time varying c d associated with f max and u max is defined as the representative c d which is comparable to the period averaged c d to some extent the emergent canopy with staggered configuration has larger representative c d values and the representative c d values decrease as h i h increases and it can be approximated as a constant value within a submerged canopy to some extent the classic reynolds number re and keulegan carpenter number kc are determined using the local u max as the characteristic velocity the drag coefficients collapse onto single curves of re and kc with correlation coefficients greater than 0 69 and 0 97 respectively suggesting that c d kc relation is more suitable for wave flows since kc number not only includes characteristic velocity but also considers the effect of wave period but re number does not moreover the fitted results show that the drag coefficients gradually decrease and approach a stable value with increasing re or kc once the modified re re and kc kc numbers were defined by considering the submergence ratio h h v some new generic c d re and c d kc formulas were proposed with satisfactory correlation coefficients greater than 0 85 and 0 98 respectively which can better describe the c d dynamics for solitary wave interaction with rigid emergent submerged canopy finally a preliminary comparison between the proposed c d formulas and the existing formulas is given to reveal the intrinsic law in terms of drag coefficient between re and kc which can be used in the future as a basis for developing new general predictive formulations for assigning vegetation drag coefficients in various situations credit authorship

371,mangrove forests can significantly attenuate tsunami waves and thus play an important role in coastal protection as a first approximation the problem is modeled utilizing solitary waves impinging on emergent submerged rigid cylinders a three dimensional 3 d numerical model using cyclic boundary conditions was developed based on the ihfoam solver to investigate the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on the solitary wave attenuation the numerical model was established based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations combined with the standard k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model and the volume of fluid vof surface capturing schemes the results indicate that different patterns are found in terms of flow field characteristics velocity and turbulent kinetic energy and forces exerted on the cylinders for various wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration which helps to better understand wave dissipation mechanism induced by vegetation different from the bulk drag coefficient derived by the conventional wave dissipation models the direct force method was applied to quantify the time varying and period averaged drag coefficients c d of individual cylinders the time varying c d associated with maximum force and local velocity is defined as the representative c d for comparison with the period averaged c d in detail besides by considering the submergence ratio new generic c d formulas are proposed as functions of the modified reynolds number re and keulegan carpenter number kc for illustrating the c d dynamics under solitary wave conditions finally a preliminary comparison between the proposed c d formulas and existing formulas are given to reveal the intrinsic c d law which may lead to improved understanding and modeling concerning wave vegetation interaction keywords rigid vegetation solitary wave wave nonlinearity direct force method drag coefficients 1 introduction coastal vegetation such as seagrasses salt marshes kelp forests and mangroves etc can significantly attenuate incident wave energy and protect coastal habitats and structures which has long been a topic of interest anderson and smith 2014 chen et al 2018 huang et al 2011 and its wave damping efficiency is remarkable even in extreme sea events möller et al 2014 vuik et al 2018 for example mangrove forests effectively attenuated wave energy from the indian ocean tsunami to save several villages in 2004 huang et al 2011 therefore numerous studies in field scale e g bradley and houser 2009 gaylord et al 2003 jadhav et al 2013 and in laboratory scale e g augustin et al 2009 hu et al 2014 huang et al 2011 koftis et al 2013 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 as well as numerical modeling e g ma et al 2013 mattis et al 2015 2019 maza et al 2013 2015 tang et al 2017 have been conducted to better understand the protection role of coastal vegetation however in addition to wave damping induced by vegetation merely few studies have focused on the turbulence characteristics in vegetated oscillatory flows chen et al 2020 and the vegetation stem scale turbulence was found to play a significant role in in the water environment and ecological processes such as dissolved nutrients supply cornelisen and thomas 2004 sediment suspension and transport chen et al 2007 due to the complicated process and multivariate factors the mechanisms of vegetation hydrodynamics interactions have not been fully understood in recent years wave dissipation induced by vegetation hereafter referred to as wdv has attracted wide interest and its relationship was examined with the vegetation characteristics i e the stem diameter density stiffness and distribution pattern etc and incident wave conditions regular or irregular incident wave height and wave period etc e g bradley and houser 2009 jadhav et al 2013 koftis et al 2013 möller 2006 yang et al 2012 previous studies have mostly focused on vegetation induced attenuation under either regular or irregular wave conditions the mechanism of wave attenuation by vegetation during extreme sea events e g tsunami is still not fully understood moreover few studies consider the effect of wave nonlinearity on wdv wu and cox 2015 which is of great importance to the understanding of the hydrodynamic sedimentation and exchange processes in mangrove forests wdv is primarily induced by the drag force f d provided by the vegetation acting on the wave motion which can be quantified by the morison equation dalrymple et al 1984 morison et al 1950 f d is a function of the vegetation drag coefficient which is a dimensionless quantity used in force equation to define the drag or the resistance of vegetation in a fluid flow which is generally denoted as c d yuce and kareem 2016 thus to adequately describe wdv accurate parameterization of c d is essential mendez and losada 2004 möller et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 however c d parameterization is still challenging when describing vegetation flow interactions in coastal and freshwater environments since it is affected by many factors of wave and vegetation parameters hu et al 2014 henry et al 2015 to our knowledge numerous studies focused on the bulk drag coefficient c d which is an empirical parameter to quantify the mean resistance force exerted against the waves by the entire vegetation field ozeren et al 2014 currently c d is typically calculated based on the measured wave height reduction by the theoretical wdv models which were derived from energy conservation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 or momentum conservation kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 as a conventional method the wdv models have been widely applied in a large number of flume experiments with not

2014 to obtain additional empirical formulas for predicting c d as summarized in table 1 it can be found that for regular or irregular wave flows the c d empirical formulas usually have been proposed as functions of the reynolds number re u c b v ν or the keulegan carpenter number kc u c t b v in which u c is the characteristic velocity b v is the characteristic length usually vegetation diameter ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid and t is the wave period that can be replaced by the spectral peak wave period t p in the case of irregular waves note that these formulas can take different forms this can be explained that significant variations exist in the characteristic velocity and length scales as well as the wdv models adopted in the literature besides the cauchy number c a was used to explore the relationship with c d for wave flows interacting with flexible aquatic vegetation cavallaro et al 2018 luhar and nepf 2011 2016 although the aforementioned wdv model method has been widely used in predicting c d the limitations of this method should be pointed out this method derives c d from the perspective of wave energy dissipation the measured wave height attenuation is often assumed to be solely induced by vegetation drag other dissipative processes such as bed friction and wave breaking are not explicitly considered but lumped into the vegetation drag which may lead to an overestimated c d chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 compared to the wdv model method the direct force method hu et al 2014 infantes et al 2011 is a newer approach to determine c d for individual vegetation which is expected to be different from c d mattis et al 2015 the direct force method is based on the original morison equation rather than wdv models and requires synchronized force and local velocity data to determine c d chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 the main difference between the wdv model and direct force methods is that the former can only provide c d for the entire vegetation field while the latter provides a way to obtain both time varying c d and period averaged c d for individual vegetation which makes it easier to better understand wdv processes by providing more accurate c d values however only few studies have been carried out with the goal of considering time varying and period averaged c d hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 using the direct force method for studying wdv in combined wave current flows hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 derived the space averaged period averaged c d termed c d by averaging the data from the 4 locations within the vegetation field to represent the bulk drag characteristics of the entire vegetation zone and respectively proposed two empirical formulas as functions of re and kc please refer to table 1 however the characteristics associated with drag coefficients of the individual vegetation have not yet been clarified to the best of our knowledge the current study is the first study to provide a detailed comparison between the time varying c d and period averaged c d for individual vegetation along the canopy under solitary wave conditions it needs to mention that during the laboratory measurements it is challenging to obtain the desirable aligned force velocity data since it may be limited by synchronized force velocity measuring systems and the data processing technique yao et al 2018 a small time lag between the original force data and velocity data may lead to large errors in deriving c d also the intrinsic time shifts in instrument recordings may further contribute to these errors moreover laboratory wave attenuation studies are extremely expensive to perform and require many testing facilities mattis et al 2019 for this reason it is arduous to obtain all c d values for individual vegetation along the entire path during the laboratory tests hence only a few typical measurements are usually selected to represent the bulk characteristic of the entire vegetation field hu et al 2014 showing a certain degree of limitation alternatively a robust numerical model in which the synchronized force velocity data are determined by post processing utilities which can effectively overcome this limitation as a result both the time varying and period averaged c d for individual vegetation can be accurately provided which is the main objective of this paper regarding the numerical modeling of the interaction between coastal vegetation and waves a common approach is to adopt depth integrated wave equations such as boussinesq type equations huang et al 2011 karambas et al 2015 yang et al 2018 and nonlinear shallow water equations tang et al 2017 wu and marsooli 2012 the effects of vegetation on waves are considered by introducing a drag force term in the depth integrated momentum equations in recent years the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans models have also been applied in several works to solve the 3 d wave vegetation issues directly for example maza et al 2015 proposed a 3 d numerical scheme coupled with the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model for simulating the wave flow field by considering the actual geometry of rigid emergent cylinders tsai et al 2017 presented a 3 d rans model to simulate the effects of flexible vegetation on tsunami damping although the rans numerical model has been proven to capture flow information in the vicinity of vegetation however it requires very fine meshes and extremely high computational cost maza et al 2015 2016 however this limitation may be alleviated by applying the cyclic boundary conditions in the numerical flume as used in this study the cyclic boundary conditions are mostly applied to represent a large infinite system by using a small computational domain to effectively eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries and the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency wang et al 2017 and the cyclic boundary conditions have been successfully used to investigate the dynamics of wave driven oscillatory flow through emergent canopies etminan et al 2019 the objective of this study was to use a 3 d numerical approach to investigate solitary wave interactions with the rigid emergent submerged vegetation based on ihfoam solver built in openfoam open field operation and manipulation the numerical model solves the rans equations for two incompressible phases using a finite volume discretization the standard k ω sst model was considered as the turbulence closure and the volume of fluid vof method was employed to capture the free surface the work is organized as follows first the mathematical description of the 3 d numerical model is presented mesh sensitivity analysis and model validation are carried out using laboratory data in huang et al 2011 in section 4 the numerical model setup and the direct force method are introduced in detail section 5 shows a detailed and intuitive flow field with streamline and vortex information is provided to understand the small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv inside the canopy besides the effects of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on solitary wave attenuation velocity and turbulence fields as well as the wave induced forces exerted on cylinders are also explored on the other hand the time varying c d and period averaged c d related to individual cylinders are compared based on the direct force method furthermore some new generic c d re and c d kc relations are proposed to describe the c d dynamics finally conclusions are summarized in section 6 2 numerical model to simulate tsunami wave interactions with mangrove forests the direct simulation approach used by maza et al 2015 2016 was followed in this study in this approach individual vegetation elements were included in the numerical domain by considering the actual cylinders geometry note that this approach is free of the complex flow parameterizations such as the drag coefficient used in the macroscopic approach maza et al 2015 wang et al 2019 the numerical model was developed using ihfoam higuera et al 2013a b a 3 d navier stokes ns solver built in the openfoam platform ihfoam adopts a modified version of standard interfoam solver and caters for the simulation of gravity waves higuera et al 2013a b and porous media flows higuera et al 2014 it also incorporates a set of algorithms to generate and absorb waves at the boundaries instead of using the relaxation zones thus accelerating the simulations and ensuring proper representation of the wave induced hydrodynamics in the numerical domain 2 1 governing equations 2 1 1 continuity and momentum equations with the assumption of incompressible fluids the aforementioned rans equations which include continuity equation eq 1 and momentum conservation equation eq 2 are used to develop the numerical model for air water two phase flow linking fluid velocity and pressure 1 u i x i 0 2 ρ u i t u j ρ u i x j x j μ e f f u i x j p x i g i x j ρ x j where ρ is the density calculated as ρ αρ water 1 α ρ air α is the vof indicator to mark the location of the air water interface based on the

takes into account the molecular dynamic viscosity plus the turbulent effects μ eff μ ρν t with the turbulent kinetic viscosity ν t obtained from turbulence modeling and the dynamic viscosity μ αμ water 1 α μ air in this study a standard k ω sst model was included as the turbulence closure due to its ability to deal with reverse pressure gradients that are developed around rigid cylinders menter 1992 maza et al 2015 2016 2 1 2 volume of fluid method it is well known that the vof method hirt and nichols 1981 has been successfully adopted to capture the wave surface between air and water phases α is defined to denote the quantity of water per unit of volume at each cell therefore if α 1 a cell is full of water phase if α 0 the cell is full of air phase 0 α 1 represents that the wave surface exists at the cell to obtain physical results α must be conserved and bound between 0 and 1 to maintain a sharp air water interface an artificial compression term u c i weller 2002 is adopted in openfoam to modify the classic vof advection equation as follows 3 α t u i α x i u c i α 1 α x i 0 where u c i min c α u i at xi max u i xi at the free surface and the specified factor c α is equal to 1 by default higuera et al 2013a b maza et al 2015 note that the boundedness of eq 3 is implemented utilizing a specially designed solver called mules multidimensional universal limiter for explicit solution in openfoam it makes use of the limiting factor of the discrete divergence term flux to ensure that the final value is within 0 and 1 rusche 2002 2 2 boundary conditions 2 2 1 wave generation and absorption boundary conditions following wang et al 2019 the dirichlet boundary condition was utilized at the inflow left boundary to generate the desired solitary wave based on the boussinesq theory lee et al 1982 the corresponding free wave surface elevation is expressed as follows 4 η h i sech 2 3 h i 4 h 3 x where x xl ct xl is the horizontal distance from the wave generation boundary and c g h h i is the wave speed with still water depth h and incident wave height h i accordingly the velocity components that involve derivatives in η are presented as follows 5 u x g h η h 1 1 4 η h h 3 h η 1 3 2 z 2 h 2 d 2 η d x 2 6 u z g h z h 1 1 2 η h d η d x 1 3 h 2 1 1 2 z 2 h 2 d 3 η d x 3 to minimize the effects of reflected waves the active absorption method schäffer and klopman 2000 was employed at the outflow right boundary to generate an opposite velocity with a value equal to the incident wave the free surface corresponds to the reflected wave elevation η r leading to the following expression 7 u cor g h η r where u cor is the correction velocity that is applied to a vector perpendicular to the active absorption boundary and pointing into the domain and η r is calculated by subtracting the measured wave elevation η m at the wave generation boundary from the target one η t according to the equation for the expected reflection free wave generation η r η m η t 2 2 2 other boundary conditions to improve computing efficiency cyclic boundary conditions were considered at the two side walls of the numerical flume chakrabarti et al 2016 the other boundary conditions were established according to higuera et al 2013a b and maza et al 2016 at the upper boundary of the wave flume the pressure was specified as the atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundary was applied both on the flume bottom and the cylinders geometry surfaces where the flow velocity is zero at the wall surfaces and increases to the free stream velocity away from the boundaries note that the no slip wall boundary has also been successfully applied in unidirectional and wave flows through rigid vertical cylinders using the large eddy simulation les method e g chakrabarti et al 2016 chang et al 2020 stoesser et al 2010 besides the initial values for the standard k ω sst turbulence model were determined according to menter 1992 3 numerical model validation laboratory test results by huang et al 2011 were used to validate the numerical model as they provided solitary wave evolution along an idealized mangrove forest using emergent cylinders it needs to mention that laboratory information about flow characteristics or wave induced forces on the cylinders is unfortunately lacking and only free surface evolution is available to validate the numerical model performance the characteristics of the laboratory tests by huang et al 2011 are as follows the physical flume was 32 m long and 0 55 m wide the cylinders made of perspex tubes with outer diameters of 0 01 m were placed on a flatbed in the middle zone of the wave flume they were arranged following three different arrangements see fig 1 a a b and c with various densities n v 2228 1108 and 560 cylinders m2 respectively the lengths l of the arrangements were equal to 0 545 1 090 and 1 635 m for arrangements a b and c respectively the wave gauge locations g1 g7 are also shown in fig 1 b during the laboratory experiments the incident solitary wave height h i varied from 0 02 to 0 06 m with constant water depth h of 0 15 m in the numerical simulations to reproduce the exact setup in the physical experiments huang et al 2011 the individual rigid cylinders were introduced in a small computational domain with cyclic boundary conditions it needs to mention that the arrangement b with three different flume widths 0 06 m 0 12 m and 0 18 m has been selected to perform a sensitivity analysis to investigate the flume width effect on the numerical results and it was found that the effect of numerical flume width on the results can be reasonably ignored after considering the computational cost and the accuracy of the numerical predictions according to this the width of the numerical domain was determined as small as 0 06 m so that the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency and effectively eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries in addition since the wave flow has to be solved among the cylinders a finer mesh was needed for high accuracy yielding a higher computational cost thus to reach a balance between the computational effort and accuracy of the simulated results a comprehensive mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out for arrangement a in this study the meshes were created by using the special mesh generation tool snappyhexmesh in openfoam which can generate smooth meshes by adapting and refining the cells intersected by given surfaces cylinders fig 2 displays a close up of the three meshes considered in the mesh sensitivity analysis a horizontal slice was selected to present the local cells around the cylinders mesh 1 corresponds to the coarser mesh and mesh 3 is the one with the smaller cells the difference between the meshes lies in the refinement introduced around the cylinders to obtain a better flow representation of the small scale flow features the numerical domain was 5 60 m long 0 06 m wide and 0 30 m high the three meshes share the same initial discretization a uniform 0 0025 m in the horizontal and vertical cell size the refinements in mesh 2 and mesh 3 yielded a cell size of 0 00125 m and 0 000625 m around the cylinders respectively and the numbers of total cells for mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 were 1781166 4287565 and 9573693 respectively to run 12 s of actual time with a time step of 0 01 s by using a 4 processor pc machine the execution time associated with mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 were 17 h 112 h and 256 h respectively fig 3 shows the comparison between numerical and laboratory free surface evolutions η for arrangement a using the three meshes showing an overall satisfactory agreement between the data for all three meshes except for an underestimation of the wave height at location g5 for the coarsest mesh mesh 1 due to the poor spatial mesh resolution around the cylinders overall the relative deviations defined as the difference between numerical results and experimental data divided by the latter were smaller than 4 7 for mesh 2 and mesh 3 in addition the reflected wave due to the cylinders was simulated with high accuracy particularly at location g1 near t 9 3 s and the reflected wave height was almost 28 that of the incident wave height therefore fig 3 indicates that the numerical model was able to reproduce the solitary wave propagate over the rigid cylinders with a high degree of accuracy in addition a further mesh sensitivity analysis using the three meshes was performed the cross sectional average velocity u and the wave force f exerted on the cylinders were considered here u was determined by averaging the horizontal velocity ux over the same flume cross section as f which has been found to be an appropriate local velocity to normalize the vegetation related drag force etminan et al 2019 following maza et al 2015 2016 in the numerical post processing the wave force f exerted on the emergent cylinders can be calculated by integrating both pressure and viscous forces on each cylinder as follow 8 f 0 h η p μ e f f u i x i d a where p is the total pressure μ eff is the effective kinematic viscosity which includes the laminar and the turbulent contribution to shear stresses and da is the differential area along the cylinder fig 4 shows the comparison of the maximum wave force f max exerted on the cylinders located at the central line hereinafter referred to as row ⅰ and the maximum cross sectional average velocity u max at the same cross sections for the three meshes the horizontal distance x was normalized by the vegetation length l it was found that although wave height evolutions were similar for the three meshes shown in fig 3 significant differences were observed with respect to f max and u max between mesh 1 and the other two mesh cases revealing an accuracy dependency on the mesh resolution generally when x l was larger than around 0 2 mesh 1 exhibited an underestimation of f max and u max due to the poor spatial mesh resolution around the cylinders however an overall good agreement was observed for f max and u max using mesh 2 and mesh 3 and the maximum deviations were smaller than 11 7 for f max and 5 4 for u max respectively based on previous results mesh 2 was used to further validate the numerical model using other scenarios reported by huang et al 2011 arrangements b and c with different n v and h i as shown in fig 5 an overall favorable agreement was found between the numerical results and experimental data finally mesh 2 was chosen as the mesh resolution in the following simulations after balancing between computational cost and accuracy 4 numerical simulations since the numerical model was demonstrated to reproduce wave height evolution along the canopy with a high degree of accuracy when the cylinders geometry was resolved in the domain it was used in the following sections to explore the detailed hydrodynamic characteristics of the solitary wave interaction with the emergent submerged vegetation 4 1 numerical model setup fig 6 shows a sketch of the numerical model for solitary wave interaction with the rigid vegetation the numerical simulations were performed considering the vegetation arrangements a and b from huang et al 2011 and the vegetation length l was constant as 0 57 m for all simulations the vegetation densities n v were 2228 cylinders m2 and 1108 cylinders m2 the height h v of the cylinder was 0 28 m and its diameter b v was 0 01 m two still water depths h were used to form emergent submerged canopy 0 15 m and 0 30 m and the corresponding submergence ratios h h v were 0 54 and 1 07 respectively four incident solitary wave heights of h i 0 025 0 050 0 075 and 0 15 m for h 0 15 m and h i 0 05 0 10 0 15 and 0 20 m for h 0 30 m were studied with the following associated relative wave heights h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 respectively to characterize various wave nonlinearities since the theoretical wavelength of a solitary wave is infinite the effective solitary wavelength l s is approximated ranging from 0 78 m to 3 12 m following the formula l s 4 24 h h i h reported by dean and dalrymple 1991 and maza et al 2015 2016 the parameters of the numerical simulations are summarized in table 2 the numerical domain was 3 60 m long 0 06 m wide and 0 60 m high schematized in fig 6 a solitary wave was generated at the left side of the numerical domain and the active wave absorption was considered at its right side allowing the outgoing waves to leave the domain mesh 2 was used as the mesh resolution due to the sensitivity analysis presented in the previous section accordingly the total cell numbers of the meshes were 4214365 and 2953786 for arrangements a and b respectively to run 5 s of actual time to simulate the solitary wave propagation over the vegetation using a 4 processor pc the time step was chosen as small as 0 01 s it took nearly 102 h and 45 h for arrangements a and b respectively the free surface elevations were obtained by 11 numerical wave gauges along the numerical flume in order to calculate wave damping induced by the vegetation and the representative locations of the numerical wave gauges are indicated in fig 6 a to obtain the in phase data the forces f exerted on the individual cylinders along the canopy and the local cross sectional average horizontal velocities u at the same flume cross sections as f were necessary to be obtained for the following investigation owing to the symmetry of arrangements a and b the cylinders on the central line called row ⅰ and the adjacent row called row ⅱ were selected as force measure locations for the sake of clarity these force probe locations are indicated in the top views in fig 6 b where the cylinders were plotted in blue row ⅰ or gray row ⅱ for arrangement b only the force data on the cylinders along row ⅱ were measured as a comparison furthermore to explore the effects of the cylinder configuration on the flow pattern inside the canopy a group consisting of 3 velocity measuring probes was set at the leading middle and trailing sections corresponding to the x l 0 0 5 1 0 locations of the canopy respectively to obtain the instantaneous horizontal velocity ux and turbulent kinetic energy tke profiles a detailed top view shows the exact probe locations of the circle in red denoted as v i 1 v i 2 and v i 1 respectively as shown in fig 6 b 4 2 direct force method by integrating the pressure and viscous force on the cylinder the total wave force f acting on an individual cylinder has been obtained using eq 8 according to chakrabarti et al 2016 the numerical wave force f also can be expressed by the well known morison equation morison et al 1950 9 f f d f m 1 2 ρ c d h vw b v u u π 4 ρ c m h vw b v 2 u t where f d is the drag force f m is the inertia force c d and c m are the drag and inertia coefficients respectively h vw is the height of the cylinder submerged in the water body and b v is the diameter of the cylinder usually f m is assumed to be small compared to the f d for waves interacting with small bodies and is typically neglected e g chakrabarti et al 2016 dalrymple et al 1984 huang et al 2011 ma et al 2013 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 therefore for simplicity the numerical f calculated in this study was assumed to be the same as f d without considering the contribution of f m accordingly if the in phase drag force and velocity data are given the time varying c d can be derived from the following equation 10 c d 2 f d ρ h vw b v u u note that the time varying c d has great variability over one wave period chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 specifically the time varying c d is infinite when u is close to zero however those c d values contribute little to the wdv as dissipation is strongest at the u peaks yao et al 2018 in other words c d values at larger velocity matter the most in fact thus the time varying c d corresponding to the maximum drag force and maximum horizontal flow velocity is valuable for describing the wdv mechanism as it will be discussed later in detail for regular wave interactions with the vegetation the period averaged c d is derived by computing the work done by f over one period chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 for such long waves of a solitary wave a pseudo period t s can be calculated by the formula t s l s c huang and yuan 2010 therefore the period averaged c d for solitary wave interactions with the vegetation can be estimated using the direct force method 11 c d 2 0 t s f d u d t 0 t s ρ h vw b v u 2 u d t as shown in table 1 c d is closely related to either re or kc when velocity measurements are unavailable the characteristic velocity u c for calculations of re and kc is usually estimated based on the linear wave theory defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the top of the vegetation located at the seaward edge e g anderson and smith 2014 kobayashi et al 1993 koftis et al 2013 mattis et al 2019 maza et al 2013 mendez et al 1999 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 for physical experiments with small submergence ratios hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 regarded the measured maximum horizontal velocity at the half water depth as the depth average velocity to obtain a suitable characteristic velocity u c instead with respect to the calculations of re u c b v ν and kc u c t b v in this study the local maximum cross sectional average velocity u max was obtained to replace u c the similar usage concerning the maximum horizontal velocity has also been satisfactorily adopted in henry et al 2015 for wave flows b v is represented by the diameter of the cylinder which is the typical characteristic length for re and kc calculation for vegetated flows nepf 2011 for real vegetation cases the measured mean diameter of vegetation stems can be used as the characteristic length jadhav et al 2013 t is the wave period and was replaced by the pseudo period t s for solitary wave in this study 5 results and discussions 5 1 effect of solitary wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on wdv fig 7 shows the normalized free surface elevation η h i at wgs 1 to 11 for emergent submerged vegetation with different relative wave heights h i h 0 17 and 0 67 the results show that arrangements a and b generally share a similar free surface behavior free surface measurements at wg1 reveal stronger reflections for arrangement a while this effect is slightly weaker for arrangement b in addition it was found that the free surface evolutions with larger h i h exhibit a certain degree of asymmetry with sharp peaks followed by significant undulating tails however the amplitudes of the undulating tail for submerged scenarios are weaker to some extent for emergent scenarios the wave height shows a significant decay for larger h i h indicating wave nonlinearity plays a crucial role in wave attenuation to evaluate the effects of the relative wave height h i h on wave damping the solitary wave height evolutions along the flume are presented in fig 8 the wave height h is normalized by h i and the horizontal distance x is normalized by the vegetation length l the beginning of the vegetation zone is set as the origin see fig 6 fig 8 a shows that arrangement a presents a common feature about the wave height evolutions along the canopy the wave height increases rapidly to a value larger than the incident one at the seaward edge of the canopy a local effect due to an increase of flow resistance induced by the cylinders may account for this then h h i decreases with increasing x l from 0 to 1 within the canopy and it increases with increasing x l from 1 behind the canopy note that the emergent canopy contributes a greater deal to h h i variation than the submerged canopy does for equal h i h scenarios as h i h increases from 0 17 to 0 67 the h h i values at x l 1 1 location decreases from 0 71 to 0 44 for the emergent canopy while it keeps around 0 8 for the submerged canopy indicating that the emergent scenarios perform better in wave damping than the submerged scenarios this is because that wave energy is basically concentrated near the wave surface and the majority of the wave energy passes over the submerged canopy without suffering too much disturbance as a result the emergent canopy contributes more to the wave height variation along the flume than the submerged canopy does in addition the h h i reduction increases with the increase of h i h indicating that the emergent canopy can better attenuate waves with stronger wave nonlinearities fig 8 b shows that although arrangement b displays a similar pattern to arrangement a a weaker wave height enhancement occurs at x l 0 location for the former in detail with respect to the emergent scenarios the wave height enhancement factors of arrangement a are 1 34 1 29 1 28 and 1 20 for h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 respectively while they all decrease to 1 18 1 13 1 12 and 1 13 of arrangement b respectively due to lower flow resistance this effect is greatly relevant to the flow behavior characteristics at the seaward edge of the canopy on the other hand compared to arrangement a the wave height reduction is not remarkable for arrangement b for example for the emergent canopy the h h i values at x l 1 1 for arrangement a are within the range of 0 71 to 0 44 for various h i h while they are from 0 90 to 0 72 for arrangement b moreover the h h i values at x l 1 1 for submerged canopy keep around 0 90 the above results indicate that vegetation configuration plays a significant role in wave damping applying the morison equation and linear wave theory wave attenuation within the canopy can be evaluated by a wave decay formulation as follows dalrymple et al 1984 12 k v h h 0 1 1 β x where k v is the damping coefficient h 0 is the initial wave height at the seaward edge of the canopy β is the damping factor that can be obtained by fitting eq 12 when spatial wave height data are available eq 12 shows that the damping factor β is of significance to describe the wave height attenuation characteristics inside the canopy indicating that a larger β illustrates a better wdv performance this wave decay formulation was also successfully adopted in numerous studies e g chen et al 2018 hu et al 2014 mattis et al 2019 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 fig 9 shows the variation of h h 0 along the canopy for all scenarios together with the curves fitted to the wave heights based on eq 12 using a nonlinear least squares method it is found that all fitted curves present extremely high correlation coefficients indicating that the wave decay formulation for regular waves proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 also fits well with the solitary wave attenuation along the canopy in addition the fitting curves for arrangement a shows a stronger correlation than those for arrangement b the weaker the wave nonlinearity the stronger the correlation of the fitted curves confirming the significant influences of the vegetation configuration and wave nonlinearity on wave height evolutions in detail the wave attenuation variations lead to different β values and they have a close relationship with various h i h with regard to arrangement a for emergent scenarios β is fitted to be 1 31 1 92 2 40 and 2 41 for h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 scenarios respectively in contrast the submerged canopy shows much smaller β values i e approximately from 0 67 to 0 51 indicating β values significantly depend on the submergence ratio h h v specifically chen et al 2018 reported a β value of 0 059 in regular wave interactions with the rigid submerged vegetation where the wave height was 0 08 m and the wave period was 1 5 s the large difference in β values may be attributed to the differences in vegetation density in the tested vegetation by chen et al 2018 which was 139 cylinders m2 while the vegetation densities of arrangements a and b are 2228 and 1108 cylinders m2 in this study indicating that vegetation with a larger density has a larger damping factor β with a better wave attenuation performance 5 2 flow pattern characteristics inside the canopy to better understand the wdv from the small scale perspective this section provides a detailed and intuitive wave field containing streamline and vortex information besides the influence mechanisms of wave nonlinearity and vegetation configuration on velocity and turbulence fields tke are also explored 5 2 1 velocity field inside the canopy fig 10 presents four various time snapshots of wave flow pattern inside the canopy for arrangements a and b and the emergent scenarios with the largest relative wave height h i h 0 67 are considered as an example the wave free surface is included for each instance which is colored by the horizontal velocity magnitude ux m s 1 in order to better understand the internal flow field inside the canopy when a solitary wave passes by in the left panels for each instance a typical slice is selected at half the still water depth to exhibit the detailed velocity field the right panels show the streamlines within the canopy which are colored by the vorticity magnitude s 1 as can be observed from the left panels of fig 10 a for arrangement a when the solitary wave crest reaches the seaward edge of the canopy at t 1 45 s the wave surface ascends obviously because of the cylinders obstacle yielding a significant enhancement in wave height consistent with the results shown in fig 8 the typical slice shows that as the solitary wave is passing along the canopy the wave induced flow is channeled along the gap between row i and row ii and is oriented in the wave propagation direction except for the first cylinders at the seaward edge the other cylinders are not directly exposed to the flow they shelter each other this is the sheltering effect described by raupach 1992 and etminan et al 2019 as a consequence the downstream cylinders experience a lower incident velocity due to the sheltering effect by upstream cylinders meanwhile the right panels of fig 10 a illustrates that the streamlines become significantly disturbed within the canopy by the obstacle of cylinders in particular a few spiral vortexes occur at the cylinder spacing i e the cylinder s wake region moreover a higher vorticity magnitude appears within the region below the wave crest as the wave continues to propagate through the canopy at t 1 55 s a slight wave breaking occurs at the wave surface and the magnitude of ux decrease rapidly due to energy dissipation as the wave continues to propagate at t 1 65 s to 1 75 s the wave height gradually decreases significantly accompanied by a decreasing velocity field the vorticity field also moves forward following the wave crest location and the range of vortex influence gradually expands as expected from the overall view of fig 10 b the behavior of the flow pattern for arrangement b is similar to that for arrangement a however the velocity and vorticity fields differ between the staggered and aligned configurations due to the absence of the cylinders along row ⅰ for arrangement b a preference flow channel develops with a low dissipation rate along the channel it is interesting to note that the ux values behind the upstream cylinders are pretty small due to the sheltering effect which is different from the behavior presented by arrangement a the effect of the staggered cylinder on the velocity field will be explained in detail in fig 11 as can be observed from the typical slices for t 1 55 s to 1 75 s ux remains a larger magnitude as the wave propagates indicating that the velocity field weakens little due to the aligned configuration in addition the scales of spiral vortexes are larger than that of arrangement a this is because that the vortex structure of arrangement b can be more fully developed due to its wider cylinder spacing on the other hand it is interesting to note the change of solitary wave celerity for arrangements a and b it can be observed from the free surface elevation snapshots at t 1 75 s that the wave crest is located at different positions for both the arrangements the higher the cylinder density the higher the wave celerity reduction to reveal the effects of the vegetation configuration on the velocity field the velocity data are obtained at the three probe locations v i 1 v i 2 and v ii 1 in the leading middle and trailing sections x l 0 0 5 and 1 0 refer to fig 6 b specifically for arrangement b probes v i 1 and v ii 2 are located at the constricted cross section and probe v ⅱ 1 is located directly in the area sheltered by the upstream cylinder fig 11 shows the vertical profiles of the horizontal velocity ux as wave crests pass over the three typical sections the emergent submerged scenarios for arrangements a and b with the largest relative wave height h i h 0 67 are tested here the black and green dotted lines indicate the still water level and the canopy height respectively for each subfigure the upper panels show the results for arrangement a and the bottom panels correspond to arrangement b it can be observed from fig 11 a that the ux values increase gradually from the bed to wave crest due to the effects of cylinders and the increasing rates of arrangement b are slightly larger than those of arrangement a in general due to the influence of the central row ⅰ cylinders the vertical structure of ux shows different patterns at three typical locations in detail the ux values of probe v ⅰ 1 are larger than those of probes v ⅰ 2 and v ⅱ 1 at x l 0 section for emergent scenarios of arrangement a this is because probe v ⅰ 1 is directly exposed to wave action and probes v ⅰ 2 or v ⅱ 1 are located at the shadow of the cylinders as the wave propagates through the canopy x l 0 5 1 0 the velocity field redistributed and the ux values of probes v ⅰ 1 v ⅰ 2 and v ⅱ 1 are basically similar to each other however the ux values of probe v ⅰ 2 are slightly higher than the other two probes at x l 1 0 section this may be attributed to the absence of the downstream cylinder at the leeward edge of the canopy in contrast for emergent scenarios of arrangement b bottom panels in fig 11 a the ux profiles at probe v ⅱ 1 show different behaviors in which the ux values are basically equal to zero along the water depth and the ux values of probes v ⅰ 1 and v ⅰ 2 are larger than those for arrangement a consistent with the flow pattern observed in fig 10 this feature attributes to the existence of preference flow channels in arrangement b and its lower cylinder density which makes the flow through the canopy easier with a low wave energy dissipation compared to the emergent scenarios fig 11 b shows that the submergence ratio plays a significant role in ux profiles for submerged scenarios in general the variation of the ux values within the canopy 0 z 0 28 m is relatively small and the behaviors of ux profiles are similar to fig 11 a however for the submerged scenarios of arrangement a a rapidly ux amplification occurs above the canopy 0 28 z 0 30 m and ux continues to increase until it reaches the wave crest surface this will result in a wave induced current in the same direction as the wave above the canopy it has been associated with boundary layer streaming which follows from the shear stresses at the top of the canopy van veelen et al 2020 by contrast van veelen et al 2020 observed a wave induced anti clockwise circulation above the rigid submerged canopy under regular wave conditions due to the elliptical motion of the water particles it needs to be emphasized that the ux profile of v ⅰ 1 at x l 0 section keeps a similar trend as fig 11 a and no velocity amplification layer develops above the canopy this is due to the lack of sheltering effects of the upstream cylinder the similar ux profiles trend also appears in the ux profiles of probes v ⅰ 1 and v ⅰ 2 i e along row ⅰ for the submerged scenarios of arrangement b 5 2 2 turbulent kinetic energy tke evolution inside the canopy the tke will be generated and will dissipate during the wave when interacting with the cylinders as shown in fig 12 the tke evolutions at the half still water depth along row ⅰ were obtained to compare the time evolutions of surface elevation η h i at the same cross section the emergent and submerged scenarios of arrangement a for h i h 0 67 were considered as examples fig 12 a shows that when the wave crest reaches x l 0 section the tke at x l 0 section has not yet developed instead the maximum tke occurs at x l 0 16 section this result is similar to maza et al 2015 who found that the maximum turbulent intensity does not develop when the wave crest reaches the emergent cylinders fig 12 a also shows that there is a variable time lag between the occurrence of maximum tke and the maximum η h i for example the time lag increases from 0 s for x l 0 16 section to 0 1 s for x l 0 95 section that is the maximum tke is produced after the wave crest passes each section for emergent scenarios by contrast fig 12 b shows that the submerged scenario shows a different pattern the maximum tke at x l 0 16 to 0 47 section develops before the wave crest while the maximum tke at x l 0 95 section occurs after the wave crest furthermore it can be observed in fig 12 a and b that the maximum tke shows a decreasing trend from x l 0 16 to 0 47 and then keeps a stable value within the region of x l 0 47 to 0 95 indicating that turbulence has entered a fully developed region according to the above the tke values at a certain position are time varying as shown in fig 12 in contrast fig 13 shows the vertical profiles of the time averaged tke tke at the three typical sections x l 0 0 5 and 1 0 to reveal the effects of the cylinders along row ⅰ on tke field similar to fig 11 the emergent submerged scenarios for arrangements a and b with h i h 0 67 are tested here the black and green dotted lines indicate the still water level and the canopy height respectively fig 13 a shows that the emergent scenarios of arrangements a and b present a similar vertical profile of tke tke keeps stable within 0 z 0 1 m for each probe v ⅰ 1 v ⅱ 1 and v ⅰ 2 at each section while significant tke amplifications occur near the still water surface at x l 0 and 1 0 sections a higher tke appears at v ⅰ 1 location than that at v ⅰ 2 location of x l 0 section however a contrary behavior occurs at x l 1 0 section the reason for this is that the wave breaking at the seaward canopy edge x l 0 results in the tke amplification at v ⅰ 1 location the absence of the downstream cylinders accounts for the tke amplification of probes of v ⅰ 2 at the leeward canopy edge x l 1 0 it is expected that the tke values of probes of v ⅱ 1 at the seaward and leeward canopy edges have not obviously been changed due to the sheltering effect of the upstream cylinders in addition fig 13 b shows that the submerged scenarios of arrangements a and b exhibit a similar vertical structure of tke to the emergent ones in fig 13 a the major difference is that the amplification layer of tke for submerged scenarios appears in the vicinity of the canopy top z 0 28 m and its amplification magnitudes are smaller at both seaward and leeward edges of the canopy x l 0 and 1 0 and larger within the canopy x l 0 5 than those of the emergent scenarios as a summary the tke increases obviously near the shear layers i e the still water surface for emergent canopy or the canopy top for submerged canopy on the other hand the tke at both ends of the canopy exhibit different degrees of increase and their magnitudes are much larger than those within the canopy it can be seen from figs 10 to 13 that the presence of vegetation significantly changes the flow structure velocity and turbulence characteristics which will help us better understand the hydrodynamic processes such as wdv sediment suspension and transport within the vegetation canopy however the tke is obtained based on the fluctuation velocity which is not relevant to the subsequent researches with respect to drag coefficients will not be discussed in further detail 5 3 fmax and umax along the canopy the maximum forces exerted on the individual cylinders along the canopy were obtained and shown in fig 14 for arrangements a and b the maximum forces f max are normalized by ρg h h i a w and ρ g h v a w for emergent and submerged scenarios respectively where a w and a w are the cylinder wet y sectional areas calculated by b v h h i and b v h v respectively the force data along both row ⅰ and row ⅱ are presented for arrangement a and only the forces along row ⅱ are shown for arrangement b for comparison generally normalized f max at the cylinders increases with increasing h i for given h scenarios and the values of f max ρ g h h i a w for emergent canopies are smaller than that for submerged ones in detail with respect to arrangement a the values of f max ρ g h h i a w decreases basically along the canopy and the reduction rate increases with increasing h i h which is in accordance with the trend of the wave height damping in particular the smallest relative wave height h i h 0 17 shows an almost constant value of f max ρ g h h i a w along the canopy for h i h 0 17 scenario which is consistent with the conclusions reported by maza et al 2015 moreover there is no significant difference in f max ρ g h h i a w between row ⅰ and row ⅱ by contrast fig 14 b shows a similar variation of f max ρ g h h i a w along the canopy for submerged scenarios however the values of f max ρ g h h i a w decreases from x l 0 to 0 5 and then remains stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy in addition for the stronger nonlinearity scenarios h i h 0 50 0 67 significant differences and fluctuations occur between row ⅰ and row ⅱ at the seaward region of the canopy this can be related to the velocity amplification above the canopy shown in fig 11 b fig 14 c and d shows that with increasing x l from 0 to 1 for arrangement b f max ρ g h v a w decreases sharply from the first cylinders of the seaward edge of the canopy and then slightly decreases to an almost constant value similar to what was observed for the testing prototype rhizophora mangrove forests reported by ismail et al 2012 this effect plays a significant role in the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to waves located at the seaward region of the canopy the alignment configuration generates clearly preference flow channels because of the relatively large and uniform spacing between the cylinders and the cylinders except for the first ones are not directly exposed to wave induced flow the downstream cylinders are sheltered by the upstream ones as a result the values of f max ρ g h v a w vary little along the canopy however this effect is not observed for arrangement a with a higher density and staggered configuration in addition the results of arrangement b show that a self similarity characteristic with almost the same values of f max ρ g h v a w appears between emergent and submerged scenarios except for the first seaward cylinders indicating that f max ρ g h v a w is not sensitive to the submergence ratio for arrangement b similarly fig 15 shows that the maximum cross sectional average velocity u max at the same cross sections as f max along the canopy in which u max is normalized by solitary wave celerity c it is expected that u max c increases with increasing h i for the given h scenarios and all the u max c tend to be the minimum values at x l 1 0 overall the values of u max c for emergent scenarios are obviously much smaller than those for submerged scenarios as expected showing that the submergence ratio plays a greater role in flow velocity than the force exerted on cylinders shown in fig 14 regarding arrangement a fig 15 a shows that the u max c values initially increase at the seaward region of the canopy and the larger h i h further increases the amplification then u max c decreases along the canopy basically and the reduction rate increases with increasing h i h in particular u max c tends to be an almost constant value along the canopy for h i h 0 17 scenarios similar to the overall evolutions of f max as shown in fig 14 b fig 15 b shows that the values of u max c increase firstly and then decreases from x l 0 05 to 0 5 and then remains stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy besides fig 15 c and d show that with increasing x l from 0 to 1 u max c decreases firstly from the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the canopy and then remains an almost constant on the other hand for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a the u max c values at row ⅱ are slightly larger than those at row ⅰ especially for h i h 0 67 scenarios this can be explained by the blockage effect etminan et al 2019 of the presence of the cylinder body at row ⅱ reducing the cross sectional area locally which results in a local velocity increase around the cylinders zdravkovich 2003 similar to that for unidirectional flow reported by etminan et al 2017 in addition this blockage effect gradually weakens as the wave nonlinearity increases in contrast the submerged scenarios of arrangement a show a different pattern this is because the majority of wave energy passes over the submerged canopy without suffering too much disturbance 5 4 drag coefficient quantification for individual cylinder using direct force method 5 4 1 deriving time varying c d fig 16 shows the time varying wave induced force f the cross sectional average horizontal velocity u and the time varying c d at x l 0 026 0 342 0 658 and 0 974 sections corresponding to the locations of the 1st 7th 13th and 19th cylinders along row ⅰ the emergent scenarios with h i h 0 17 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 for arrangement a were considered it is found that they share a similar behavior that both f and u show consistent variation with the solitary wave height the f and u peak values decrease with increasing x l indicating the vegetation induced wave damping along the canopy note that the dashed lines in the plots show that there is almost no time lag between f and u this is the main advantage of numerical simulations compared to physical measurements because a robust realignment algorithm needs to be developed to get the synchronized f and u data in physical tests as suggested by yao et al 2018 the time varying c d can be derived from in phase data of time varying f and u based on eq 10 without considering the contribution of the inertia force f m the results in fig 16 indicate that the time varying c d values vary with f and u accordingly generally leading to a declining trend as expected the time varying c d values are unrealistically high with small u in particular they reach infinity when u approaches zero which is not plotted in the figures further the time varying c d can drop to near zero when f is weak it needs to mention that the unrealistically large c d values are not beneficial in modeling wdv since they are associated with small u when the energy dissipation is greatly limited hu et al 2014 yao et al 2018 by contrast the time varying c d values tend to be relatively small and stable near the f and u peaks which contribute fundamentally to the wdv consequently the time varying c d associated with the velocity peak u max and the maximum force f max namely representative c d is obtained to better understand the wdv mechanism in this study 5 4 2 deriving representative c d and period averaged c d fig 17 shows the representative c d for individual cylinders along the canopy it is calculated by using in phase f max and u max data to replace f d and u in eq 10 the representative c d for individual cylinders along both row ⅰ and row ⅱ are presented for arrangement a and for arrangement b only the representative c d along row ⅱ is shown it is expected that the evolution of the representative c d has a general trend opposite to both f max and u max in general fig 17 shows the representative c d values of arrangement a are larger than that of arrangement b for a given h i h due possibly to the blockage and sheltering effect of the cylinders etminan et al 2019 also the representative c d values of the emergent canopy are much larger than that of the submerged canopy as expected moreover the representative c d values decrease as h i h increases in detail compared fig 17 a and c the representative c d values present a general increasing trend along the emergent canopy for a given h i h except for the cylinders at the seaward and leeward regions along row ⅱ for arrangement a the effect of the staggered cylinders can account for this a similar pattern is observed between fig 17 b and fig 17 d in which the representative c d shows an almost constant value along the canopy except for the fluctuation at the seaward and leeward regions therefore the representative c d values can be approximated as a constant value within a submerged canopy which is similar to the use of bulk drag coefficient c d which is expected to be useful to future numerical modeling studies in addition for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a although there is no significant difference in f max and u max along row ⅰ and row ⅱ in figs 14 and 15 respectively the representative c d values along row ⅰ are significantly larger than those along row ⅱ shown in fig 17 a in contrast the differences in representative c d along row ⅰ and row ⅱ become smaller for the submerged canopy as a comparison the period averaged c d values are estimated based on eq 11 and fig 18 shows the comparison of period averaged c d and representative c d for individual cylinders to quantitatively compare both of them the ratio of the period averaged c d to representative c d is defined as r cd the y x lines are plotted for reference in the figures different patterns are observed for various scenarios in detail for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a fig 18 a most of the period averaged c d values are slightly smaller than representative c d except for the strongest wave nonlinearity scenario h i h 0 67 the r cd values are between 0 9 and 1 0 for h i h 0 17 to 0 50 scenarios showing an overall good agreement between representative c d and period averaged c d in contrast although the emergent scenarios of arrangement b show a similar tendency and smaller r cd values are observed compared with those for the emergent scenarios of arrangement a a large proportion of r cd values range from 0 70 to 0 85 the main reason for this is that within a wave cycle more wave induced forces for the cylinders except for the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the canopy shifts towards the negative direction leading to a smaller 0 t s f d u d t in eq 11 note that the four data in the red circle are almost located in the vicinity of the y x line they correspond to the first seaward cylinders for various h i h showing a slight difference between the period averaged c d and representative c d in terms of the submersed scenarios of arrangement a fig 18 b for h i h 0 17 scenarios the period averaged c d is equal to the representative c d in general for the higher h i h scenarios of 0 33 0 50 and 0 67 the period averaged c d values are larger than the representative c d to some extent the r cd values of h i h 0 67 increase to 1 3 however a large number of r cd values lie between 1 0 and 1 1 indicating a good agreement between period averaged c d and representative c d by contrast a more scattered pattern is observed in fig 18 d in which the typical four data in the red circle are also clearly captured similar to fig 18 c showing the significant effects of the first cylinders on the wave field for arrangement b this is also consistent with the characteristics of the normalized maximum wave induced forces in figs 14 c d in addition as h i h increases from 0 17 to 0 67 r cd increases from around 0 70 to 1 20 indicating wave nonlinearity has more sensitive effects on the period averaged c d in this situation 5 5 relations of cd re and cd kc as shown in table 1 the bulk drag coefficient c d has generally been expressed as functions of re and kc the most common expressions are mostly written as c d δ κ re γ and c d δ κ kc γ based on the empirical formulas all the representative c d data for individual cylinders are plotted against re and kc for various h i h in fig 19 it needs to mention that similar figures for the period averaged c d re and c d kc relations are not reported here since the period averaged c d shows a comparable agreement with the representative c d shown in fig 18 following the structure of the empirical c d re relationships in kobayashi et al 1993 and mendez et al 1999 the lower bound of the non dimensional parameter δ is given as 0 08 for all scenarios thus quite a few representative c d re relations are obtained as the best fit using the nonlinear least squares method the non dimensional parameters κ and γ and the correlation coefficient r2 are also included in these plots note that the submerged scenarios show a larger re since these scenarios have larger u max values than the emergent ones leading to two separate clusters of data within a wide range of re nevertheless there is a close relationship between the two separate clusters based on previous empirical formulas the fitted results show that the r2 values of the fitted c d re relations are extremely high between 0 968 and 0 992 for arrangement b whereas they lie between 0 933 and 0 977 for arrangement a indicating a stronger correlation for arrangement b moreover as the relative wave height h i h gradually increases for arrangement a the values of κ increase from 2345 to 5669 and the γ values decrease from 1 452 to 1 382 in contrast to arrangement b the values of κ and γ increase from 1882 to 4698 and 1 756 to 2 049 respectively indicating that the vegetation configuration plays an important role in determining κ and γ fig 19 b presents the fitted curves of representative c d kc relations using the nonlinear least squares method and the parameter δ is determined to be 0 for all scenarios consistent with the values reported by bradley and houser 2009 sánchez gonzález et al 2011 and jadhav et al 2013 for waves interacting with flexible real vegetation thalassia testudinum posidonia oceanica spartina alterniflora in addition the values of κ and γ were determined with the same order of magnitude as previous studies in table 1 note that the r2 values of the fitted c d kc relations are between 0 964 and 0 988 for arrangement a and within the range of 0 985 and 0 997 for arrangement b showing a stronger correlation for arrangement b in addition the r2 values of representative c d kc relations are higher than those of c d re relations this is consistent with the conclusions in the literature augustin et al 2009 chen et al 2018 mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 in which the c d kc relations were suggested more suitable for oscillatory flows since kc contains additional information of wave period while re depends solely on characteristic velocity it is found in fig 19 that a similar pattern regarding the c d re and c d kc relations occur for various h i h scenarios in general the representative c d decreases with increasing re and kc values as expected consequently to provide general results for all h i h scenarios the generic representative c d re and c d kc relations are obtained for arrangement a arrangement b and a combined arrangement arrangements a b using the same formulas used in fig 19 as a result fig 20 a shows that the representative c d generally decreases with increasing re from 507 to 8048 whereas the data show a substantial degree of scattering for various h i h scenarios as a result relatively lower r2 values are obtained approximately 0 71 for the representative c d re relations for all scenarios in contrast the degree of scattering is much reduced in the relation between the representative c d and kc in fig 20 b for example the r2 value of the fitted representative c d re relation for arrangements a b is 0 72 whereas it is as high as 0 97 for the fitted representative c d kc relation showing a stronger correlation of representative c d with kc than with re as expected consistent well with the tendency in fig 19 in addition when kc is smaller than 10 all fitted curves coincide indicating a high degree of internal similarity for various h i h as recommend by mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 and mattis et al 2019 to obtain better c d re and kc relations for emergent submerged vegetation re and kc numbers can be modified by introducing the submergence ratio h h v which accounts for the vertical variation of the vegetation properties here the modified reynolds number is defined as re re h h v and the modified keulegan carpenter number is defined as kc kc h h v fig 21 presents the modified relations between the representative c d and re as well as kc it is found that the distribution of data points is much denser than that in fig 20 particularly for arrangements a b r2 values increase from 0 72 to 0 85 for the representative c d re relation and it increases slightly from 0 97 to 0 98 for the representative c d kc relation indicating that the modified re and kc describe the behaviors of the c d dynamics for emergent submerged vegetation with relatively satisfactory performance especially for the modified re number re table 3 summarizes the generic relations between the representative c d and re or kc for arrangements a b and the relations with respect to the period averaged c d are also included in general it is found that the period averaged c d re and c d kc relations show lower r2 values than those for the representative c d further all the relations are plotted in fig 22 to compare with the existing formulas list in table 1 concerning the bulk c d re and kc relations using the wdv model or direct force method it should be emphasized that fig 22 only shows a preliminary comparison and analysis with respect to the c d relations this is because that many significant differences exist in these formulas due possibly to too many complex factors such as the vegetation species rigid or flexible and configurations staggered aligned or random wave conditions regular irregular or solitary the definitions of re and kc using various characteristic velocity and length scales and the c d derivation methods wdv model or direct force etc therefore the c d formulas proposed in this study cannot be directly compared with existing formulas in the literature although an overall similar trend can still be found i e with an increase of re re or kc kc the drag coefficients gradually decrease and approach a stable value revealing the intrinsic law between drag coefficient and re or kc number in addition it is clear that most c d values in this study are larger than that of the literature in general the reason for this may be that the wdv model assumes that the flow velocity inside a canopy follows the linear wave theory and is not attenuated by the canopy however the flow velocity is reduced due to the presence of vegetation canopy hu et al 2014 leading to a larger c d for the direct force method in this study by drawing analogies between pipe flows and vegetated channel flows cheng and nguyen 2011 proposed a new friction function with re that is redefined by using a vegetation related hydraulic radius to evaluate the resistance force induced by emergent vegetation in open channel flow similar to the manning equation which is useful for consolidating various experimental data across a wide range of vegetation density it sheds some light on conducting a generic formulation for predicting the drag force coefficient with various parameters for wave and vegetation in future work 6 conclusions the numerical modeling of the interaction of tsunami waves with mangrove forests is studied employing solitary waves impinging on rigid cylinders based on the ihfoam solver a 3 d rans numerical model with cyclic boundary conditions is developed considering the actual geometry of the cylinders in the domain the cyclic boundary condition is adopted to improve computing efficiency the numerical model is well validated using the experimental data reported by huang et al 2011 a series of numerical experiments in terms of emergent submerged vegetation with staggered aligned configurations using this validated model have been carried out and several findings were obtained in general the vegetation configuration and wave nonlinearity play significant roles in vegetation induced wave damping the wave height increases with enhancement factors greater than about 1 2 and 1 1 at the seaward edge of staggered and aligned configurations for emergent canopy respectively by contrast the submerged canopy shows a gentle wave height transition due to lower flow resistance a better vegetation induced wave attenuation performance occurs for emergent canopy with the staggered configuration the stronger the wave nonlinearity the better the wave attenuation induced by vegetation besides the wave decay formulation for regular waves proposed by dalrymple et al 1984 fits well with the solitary wave attenuation along the canopy with very high correlation coefficients especially for staggered canopy under relatively weakly nonlinear solitary waves in addition different patterns are found in flow characteristics water velocity vorticity and tke and wave induced forces on cylinders for emergent submerged canopy with staggered aligned configuration as well as various wave nonlinearities which make it easier to better understand energy dissipation mechanisms from a small scale perspective within the staggered canopy the local velocities in the vicinity of individual cylinders are nonzero and similar to each other owing to the velocity redistribution by contrast due to the absence of central cylinders for aligned canopy a preference flow channel developed consequently the velocities behind the upstream cylinders are close to zero because of the upstream cylinders sheltering effect moreover the presence of the sheltering effect contributed to the generation of the velocity amplification layer wave induced current above the submerged canopy furthermore the time averaged tke tke profiles exhibit a similar amplification near the shear layers i e the still water surface for emergent canopy or the canopy top for submerged canopy the tke amplifications at both ends of the canopy behave differently and they are stronger than those within the canopy on the other hand the appearance of the maximum tke is not synchronized with the wave crest in particular the maximum tke is produced after the wave crest passes for the emergent canopy the evolutions of dimensionless maximum forces f max and local maximum cross sectional average velocity u max along the canopy were provided in detail the stronger the wave nonlinearity the larger f max and u max the influence of the submergence ratio on u max is more sensitive than that on f max apart from the seaward and leeward edges of the staggered canopy both f max and u max decrease along the canopy basically for the emergent canopy and they decrease to the middle of the vegetation field and then keep stable for the submerged canopy and the decrease rates of f max and u max shows a declining trend as wave nonlinearity decreases in addition both f max and u max decrease from the first cylinders at the seaward edge of the aligned canopy and then remain stable along the canopy different from the bulk drag coefficients c d derived by the wdv models a direct force method was applied to quantify the drag coefficients c d for individual cylinders including the time varying c d and the period averaged c d based on the synchronized f and u data note that the time varying c d varies with the variations of f and u accordingly generally following a declining trend and it tends to be stable near the f and u peaks which makes a fundamental contribution to wave energy dissipation consequently the time varying c d associated with f max and u max is defined as the representative c d which is comparable to the period averaged c d to some extent the emergent canopy with staggered configuration has larger representative c d values and the representative c d values decrease as h i h increases and it can be approximated as a constant value within a submerged canopy to some extent the classic reynolds number re and keulegan carpenter number kc are determined using the local u max as the characteristic velocity the drag coefficients collapse onto single curves of re and kc with correlation coefficients greater than 0 69 and 0 97 respectively suggesting that c d kc relation is more suitable for wave flows since kc number not only includes characteristic velocity but also considers the effect of wave period but re number does not moreover the fitted results show that the drag coefficients gradually decrease and approach a stable value with increasing re or kc once the modified re re and kc kc numbers were defined by considering the submergence ratio h h v some new generic c d re and c d kc formulas were proposed with satisfactory correlation coefficients greater than 0 85 and 0 98 respectively which can better describe the c d dynamics for solitary wave interaction with rigid emergent submerged canopy finally a preliminary comparison between the proposed c d formulas and the existing formulas is given to reveal the intrinsic law in terms of drag coefficient between re and kc which can be used in the future as a basis for developing new general predictive formulations for assigning vegetation drag coefficients in various situations credit authorship

kinetics describe a broad range of physical chemical and biological processes since they are non linear spatial averaging of reaction kinetics is non trivial and it is not known how concentration gradients affect the global effective kinetics here we use numerical simulations and theoretical developments to investigate the effective kinetics of diffusing solute pulses locally subject to michaelis menten reaction kinetics we find that coupled diffusion and reaction lead to non monotonic effective kinetics that differ significantly from the local kinetics the resulting effective reaction rates can be significantly enhanced compared to those of homogeneous batch reactors we uncover the different regimes of effective kinetics as a function of the damköhler number and michaelis menten parameters and derive a theory that explains and quantifies these upscaled kinetics using a weakly coupled description of reaction and diffusion we illustrate the consequences of these findings on the accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria these results are relevant to a large spectrum of reactive systems characterized by heterogeneous concentration landscapes keywords michaelis menten effective kinetics solute pulses concentration gradients upscaling bacteria uptake 1 introduction michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 occur in many natural and engineered reactive systems they were originally developed as a model of catalytic reactions where the reaction of interest is mediated by binding to a catalyst leading to saturation effects michaelis and menten 1913 segel and slemrod 1989 this type of kinetics has found applicability in a variety of contexts such as microbial growth holmberg 1982 thullner and regnier 2019 chemotaxis novick cohen and segel 1984 solute transport in biological tissues ward and king 2003 hiltmann and lory 1983 mcelwain 1978 nicholson 1995 enzyme reactions horvath and engasser 1974 predator prey models hsu et al 2001 and reaction diffusion in electrodes michael et al 1996 in the context of bacterial growth it is also known as monod kinetics monod 1949 they have been used extensively to model biodegradation of contaminants in hydrological and groundwater systems tompson et al 1994 porta et al 2018 barry et al 2002 kindred and celia 1989 blum et al 2009 ginn et al 1995 these kinetics display a simple non linearity the reaction rate is proportional to concentration at low concentrations and saturates to a constant above a threshold concentration analytical solutions exist for the michaelis menten kinetics in batch conditions schnell and mendoza 1997 maggi and la cecilia 2016 for non homogeneous systems the reaction diffusion equation with michaelis menten kinetics has been analyzed mathematically for different applications leading to approximate solutions in some regimes ward and king 2003 hiltmann and lory 1983 mcelwain 1978 shanthi et al 2013 hsu and waltman 1993 anderson and arthurs 1985 1980 park and agmon 2008 here we analyze the effect of chemical gradients on the average kinetic laws for local michaelis menten kinetics we investigate whether non homogeneities in concentrations may lead to enhanced or reduced average reaction rates compared with batch kinetics characterized by homogeneous concentrations under non linear kinetics unresolved concentration gradients lead to effective macroscopic reactive transport laws that are different from microscopic laws battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 meile and tuncay 2006 guo et al 2015 in the context of michaelis menten reactions the effect of mass transfer limitations on effective macroscopic kinetics has been studied with an emphasis on bioavailability limitations when micro organisms are located on solid surfaces heße et al 2009 wood et al 2007 hesse et al 2010 or more generally distributed in space schmidt et al 2018 mixing limitation with michaelis menten kinetics have also been investigated in the context of reactive fronts where reactants are spatially segregated and mixing is the limiting step to bring reactants into contact sole mari et al 2017 ding and benson 2015 here we study situations where nutrients or reactants are released as discrete pulses in time and space which encompasses a large spectrum of natural and engineered systems examples include pulse of nutrients in soil könig et al 2018 waring and powers 2016 plants orcutt and nilsen 2000 aquifers bochet et al 2020 or catchments weigelhofer et al 2018 which are often consumed by biological agents through michaelis menten kinetics haefner 2005 while other types of non homogeneous initial conditions could be considered we argue that the general impact of concentration gradients on the average kinetics will be similar as for pulses we study the effective kinetics of diffusing pulses of a single chemical species undergoing degradation with michaelis menten kinetics we assume that the local kinetics are uniform in space and hence focus on the effect of spatial and temporal changes in reactant concentration on the effective kinetics we approximate these nonlinear kinetics by a sharp crossover from a linear dependency of the degradation rate on c for concentrations lower than the crossover concentration to a saturated constant rate above it we investigate the dependency of the effective kinetics on the damköhler number da and the ratio α between the kinetics crossover concentration and the initial concentration we develop a semi analytical framework relying on a weak coupling approximation regarding diffusion and reaction the results compare favorably to numerical simulations of the coupled equations fully analytical descriptions are also derived for asymptotic regimes corresponding respectively to reaction and diffusion dominated dynamics in the following we first present in section 2 a mathematical description of the dynamics including the solution under well mixed conditions which will serve as the reference scenario next section 3 is concerned with analysing the dynamics of the effective reaction rate as a function of the damköhler number and α based on numerical simulations section 4 is devoted to the derivation of the semi analytical theory relying on the approximation of weakly coupled diffusion and reaction section 5 explores the consequences of our results in the context of the consumption of nutrients by bacteria conclusions are drawn and the results discussed in terms of their relevance to natural systems in section 6 additional technical derivations regarding the analytical theory and details on the performance of the weakly coupled approximation may be found in appendix 2 dynamics the dependence of local reaction rate on local concentration associated with michaelis menten kinetics is given by 1 r c μ c k c where c is the concentration μ is the maximum reaction rate in units of concentration per time and k is the characteristic concentration for the transition between first order and zero order kinetics the key qualitative features of these kinetics are i saturation of the reaction rate at high concentrations c k and ii linear growth of the reaction rate at low concentrations c k we define the normalized concentration and characteristic concentrations respectively as 2 c c c 0 and 3 α k c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration we associate a characteristic reaction time with the low concentration regime 4 τ ℓ k μ and we nondimensionalize time as 5 t t τ ℓ this leads to a dimensionless reaction rate r τ ℓ r c 0 given as a function of dimensionless concentration by 6 r c α c α c in nondimensional terms the saturation condition reads c α and the saturated rate value is likewise given by r c α in the following we present and discuss our results in terms of nondimensional quantities unless noted otherwise for simplicity in order to elucidate the main mechanisms driving the effective kinetics describing the evolution of total mass under this type of scenario we consider a piecewise linear model of kinetics accounting for saturation 7 r c c h α c α h c α where h is the heaviside step function this corresponds to a linear increase r c c of the reaction rate up to the critical concentration α so that r α α above the critical concentration the reaction rate saturates and remains equal to its maximum value α see fig 1 this model simplifies the analytical treatment and allows us to focus on the key features of the interplay between transport induced mixing and saturation in appendix f we investigate numerically the effect of this simplification and show that it tends to slightly over estimate the maximum effective reaction rates fig f 16 however results are very similar since the piecewise linear approximation is very close to the two regimes over orders of magnitudes in concentrations fig 1 and f 17 2 1 well mixed kinetics we first consider the well mixed case corresponding to the conditions found in a batch reactor the concentration c is then spatially homogeneous and depends only on time t the dynamic equation describing concentration decay is the well mixed rate law 8 c r c which describes the decay resulting from the sharp crossover approximation of the michaelis menten kinetics when the rate r c is defined according to eq 7 throughout the dot denotes nondimensional time differentiation if the initial concentration is sufficiently large α 1 reaction starts in the saturated regime the reaction then proceeds at a constant rate for a dimensionless duration σb defined such that c σ b α for α 1 the batch starts in the linear regime and σ b 0 thus 9 σ b max 0 1 α α for t σb standard linear dynamics apply and the concentration decreases exponentially the total mass corresponding to a homogeneous batch of width s 0 is given in one dimension by m b t s 0 c t which we nondimensionalize as m b t m b t m b t 0 hence expressed in nondimensional terms the temporal evolution of the total mass of reactant is given by 10 m b t 1 α t t σ b min α 1 e t σ b t σ b 2 2 diffusing pulses of reactive solutes we now consider a pulse of a reactant diffusing in a solution and locally subject to the piecewise linear reaction rate r c defined in eq 7 our goal is to compare the effective reaction kinetics under these conditions to the well mixed batch reaction kinetics for the same initial mass of reactant and the same initial concentration for simplicity we consider transport in one spatial dimension but the approach can be extended to three dimensions the initial condition is taken to be homogeneous within a region of width s 0 centered at x 0 for a total initial mass of m 0 the initial concentration corresponding to this injection is c 0 m 0 s 0 in dimensional terms the corresponding dynamical equation is 11 t c d x 2 c r c where d is the diffusion coefficient here and throughout the notation y denotes the partial derivative with respect to a variable y note that eq 11 is also relevant for one dimensional dispersion when substituting the diffusion coefficient by a dispersion coefficient hence results derived here for one dimensional diffusion also apply to one dimensional dispersion which would be relevant for instance for reactive pulses released in porous media columns under flow dentz et al 2011 in appendix g we also discuss the effect of dimensionality by solving the reactive transport equation in spherical coordinate for three dimensional diffusion since the surface available for diffusion is larger in three dimensions the effect of average kinetics enhancement is found to be even more pronounced for three dimensional pulses than for one dimensional pulses fig g 18 and g 19 as above we nondimensionalize concentration as c c c 0 and time as t t τ ℓ furthermore we normalize position as x x s 0 we introduce also the diffusion time τ d s 0 2 2 d corresponding to the characteristic time needed to homogenize the width of the initial condition i e to homogenize a unit length in dimensionless units we then define the damköhler number as 12 da τ d τ ℓ s 0 2 μ 2 d k which quantifies the relative importance of reaction versus diffusion and is also simply the diffusion time in dimensionless units the dynamical equation then becomes 13 t c x 2 c 2 da r c where r c is given by eq 7 and the initial condition is 14 c x 0 h x 1 2 h 1 2 x since under diffusion and degradation the maximum concentration cannot increase once the latter reaches the value α the kinetics become linear everywhere and are identical to the well mixed scenario similarly to above we denote by σ the time at which the maximum concentration reaches α for t σ we have 15 m t m σ e t σ and 16 m t m σ e t σ as for the batch problem α 1 means all mass starts in the linear regime corresponding to the linear reaction problem for all times furthermore for any value of α the limit da reduces to the batch problem this happens because in this limit all mass reaches the linear regime through reaction before diffusion has time to deform the initial uniform concentration distribution note that we consider a pulse in a formally infinite domain this means that our results for the total mass are valid so long as deformation of the pulse by diffusion does not extend to the spatial domain boundaries at least while the saturated regime lasts in a finite domain the limit da 0 reduces to a batch of the size of the domain as opposed to the initial pulse size corresponding to the initial pulse becoming homogeneous over the entire domain before reaction becomes important 2 3 effective kinetics of diffusing pulses in order to quantify the effective kinetics of diffusing pulses we study the evolution of the total mass of reactant in dimensionless terms the effective reaction rate as a function of time is given by 17 r t t m t we analyze the evolution of the effective reaction rate rt as a function of time and as a function rm of the mass itself 18 r m m m t m where t m is the time at which the total mass m t t m is equal to m under well mixed conditions the effective kinetics governing the total mass always coincide with the local kinetics irrespective of the latter in the pulse scenario and for nonlinear kinetics however the mixing state as encoded in the concentration profile changes the nature of the effective reaction rate as we will see this is reflected in a qualitatively different behavior of rm m when compared to the local kinetics r c seen as a function of concentration note that formally t is the inverse of m that is m t m m and t m t t this inverse exists for our problem because the mass as a function of time is monotonic for degradation kinetics meaning that a value of mass corresponds to exactly one value of time and vice versa if this were not the case multiple rates would be associated with a given value of mass and the effective kinetics would exhibit hysteresis we do not address this type of scenario in the present work 3 numerical simulations before proceeding with the theoretical discussion we illustrate some key aspects of the dynamics using numerical simulations to this end we numerically integrated eq 13 with a square pulse initial condition as described in section 2 2 using matlab s pdepe method fig 2 illustrates the evolution of the concentration profile for all combinations of values of da 10 3 1 10 3 and α 0 01 0 05 0 26 these parameter combinations are representative of the different qualitative dynamics which may be observed for high da and high α top right panel reaction dominates over diffusion and the shape of the initial profile remains relatively unchanged until the onset of the linear regime in fact this is expected for sufficiently high da whatever the value of α indeed in the limit of high da diffusion becomes slow compared to reaction so that each region of the pulse becomes essentially independent and the pulse behaves as a set of independent batches hence for sufficiently high da and a square pulse initial condition the pulse remains homogeneous for the duration of the saturated regime and the effective kinetics tend towards the batch kinetics for low da and high α bottom right diffusion dominates and the profile approaches a gaussian before relevant reaction occurs for decreasing α and increasing da left and center panels corresponding to an initial condition higher above the saturation threshold and faster reaction there is an enhanced interplay between diffusion and reaction and the evolution of the concentration profile becomes more complex fig 3 a compares the evolution of the total mass over time for diffusing pulses and well mixed batch conditions the interplay between diffusion and nonlinear reaction in pulses leads to an enhancement of the effective reaction rate when compared to the batch reaction the well mixed conditions are the least efficient in the sense that the remaining mass is always higher at a given time this is consistent with the above discussion regarding the convergence to batch behavior at high da for low da when the effect of diffusion is most pronounced the effective reaction rate initially increases with time to reach a maximum before decaying at larger times fig 3b these non monotonic effective kinetics contrast with the well mixed scenario which mimics the local kinetics constant rate followed by exponential decay see eq 16 fig 3 c compares the evolution of the effective reaction rate as a function of total mass with the local kinetics the initial value of the reaction rate corresponding to m 1 is always the same as the initial batch reaction rate because the initial conditions are identical then the reaction rate increases up to a maximum value before decreasing and reaching the linear regime when the peak concentration drops below α the maximum reaction rates increase markedly with decreasing da and the local kinetics are recovered at high da note that the reaction rate is maximum when the mass of the pulse is distributed such that all concentrations lie below α local concentrations then obey c c which upon spatial integration leads to m m this linear dependence corresponds to the upper envelope of rm m as seen in fig 3c in appendix a we present a series of additional numerical simulations and discuss the sensitivity of the non monotonic effective kinetics on da and α fig a 11 the maximum reaction rate r max increases with decreasing da and increasing α fig 4 a therefore the region of maximum reaction rate corresponds to a regime where diffusion dominates over reaction and where the linear regime dominates over the saturated regime for most of the dynamics see fig 1 the time t max at which this maximum reaction rate occurs is largest for high da and low α which corresponds to relatively low values of r max see fig 4b note that α corresponds to the maximum reaction rate for well mixed batch dynamics thus increasing α leads to an increase in r max but also in the maximum batch reaction rate to evaluate the reaction enhancement relative to the batch kinetics we define the instantaneous reaction rate enhancement as 19 r t m t m b t because of the nature of michaelis menten kinetics the batch reaction rate m b t is maximum at initial time and equal to α until the time t σ b when the concentration reaches the transition concentration k in contrast the maximum reaction rate of the pulse kinetics m t is always maximum at an intermediate time t max σb fig 3 hence the maximum reaction rate enhancement is r max m t max α fig 5 the maximum enhancement of the effective reaction is found in the limit of low da and α this corresponds to the case of diffusion processes dominating over reaction processes with a saturation concentration far below the initial concentration conversely the minimum enhancement of effective reaction by mixing is found in the opposite limit of high da where reaction dominates the dynamics and high α in appendix a we present an analysis of the late time surviving masses to quantify the global reaction enhancement as a function of da and α the behavior of the global reaction enhancement follows the same tendencies as the instantaneous reaction enhancement fig 5 described above it is maximum for low da and low α fig a 12 4 theory we will now develop a theoretical description in order to better understand and quantify the numerical results discussed in the previous section since the dynamics for the mass are trivially identical to the batch problem whenever there is no saturated regime we assume in what follows that the initial concentration maximum is larger than α to develop the theory we first introduce two key quantities governing the dynamics of the diffusion reaction system relating to the dynamics of the spatial boundary between the linear and saturated kinetic regimes we then develop a weak coupling approximation to predict the evolution of total mass under reaction and diffusion 4 1 transition between saturated and linear regimes for times t σ at which the peak concentration is above the saturation threshold α the spatial domain may be divided into regions in which either the linear or the saturated reaction dynamics are taking place in this framework the first key quantity is the position of the interface between these domains if the concentration profile is symmetric at the initial time it will remain so at all times if further over the half space of positive x the initial concentration profile c x t 0 decreases monotonically i e x c 0 for x 0 the profile will remain monotonically decreasing at all times hence the saturated region occurs around x 0 and is separated from the linear region by an interface at positions ξ t where ξ t is the positive solution to c ξ t t α we may thus separate the concentration field into two terms corresponding respectively to these two regions c x t c ℓ x t c s x t with 20 c s x t c x t h ξ t x c ℓ x t c x t h x ξ t where s stands for saturated and ℓ for linear kinetics the total mass is given by 21 m t d x c x t m s t m ℓ t where the masses in each regime are given by the integrals of the corresponding concentrations the second key quantity is the total diffusive flux across the interface between the regions i e between reaction regimes the net diffusive flux into the linear regime considering the contributions at both ξ t is given by 22 f t x c x t x ξ t da for t σ when the full profile is in the linear reaction regime we set ξ t f t 0 then c x t c ℓ x t and therefore m t m ℓ t mass transfer between regimes is governed by the direct effect of the diffusive flux across the interface as well as by the displacement over time of the interface position due to both reaction and diffusion by the leibniz integral rule for differentiation under the integral sign we have 23 m s t x ξ t d x t c x t 2 α ξ t m ℓ t x ξ t d x t c x t 2 α ξ t the first term for each mass is due to the dynamical change of concentration whereas the second is directly due to the time dependence of the interface position as shown in appendix b this leads to 24a m s t m s 0 r t f t b t 24b m ℓ t m ℓ 0 e t g t h t where 25a r t 2 α 0 t d u ξ u 25b f t 0 t d u f u are the saturated regime mass losses due respectively to reaction and diffusive flux at the boundaries 25c b t 2 α 0 t d u ξ u 2 α ξ 0 ξ t is the saturated mass loss due directly to the changing position of the interface and 25d g t 0 t d u e t u f u 25e h t 2 α 0 t d u e t u ξ u correspond to the amount of mass which was transferred to the linear regime at some time u t by diffusion and directly by change of the interface position respectively and then survived exponential decay until time t in order to simplify the analytical treatment it is convenient to consider a gaussian initial condition the role of the initial condition on the effective reaction kinetics will be discussed shortly in dimensionless units we consider an initial profile with unit mass and variance 26 c x 0 exp x 2 2 2 π note that the corresponding initial masses are 27 m s 0 erf ξ 0 2 m ℓ 0 erfc ξ 0 2 where erf and erfc are the error function and the complementary error function respectively the initial position of the interface is given by 28 ξ 0 ln 2 π α 2 the numerically computed time evolution of the total mass and effective reaction rate for the gaussian initial condition are shown in fig 6 for small da when diffusion dominates the behavior is the same as for the square pulse initial condition because diffusion quickly deforms the initial profile into a gaussian shape before appreciable reaction takes place in the limit of small da reaction approaches the linear regime for masses arbitrarily close to the initial mass for high da however the initial condition controls the kinetics because diffusion cannot deform it substantially before the linear regime is reached in this case reaction is much more efficient than for the batch scenario since a relevant portion of the mass starts in the linear regime whereas the well mixed batch is fully saturated this effect is more pronounced for low α since as discussed above it corresponds to a longer duration of the saturated regime in what follows we will develop approximations to quantitatively analyze the dynamical behavior of the diffusion reaction system under the unit gaussian initial condition it should be kept in mind that the high da limit exhibits a behavior which differs from the square pulse initial condition which as discussed above is identical with a well mixed batch in this limit 4 2 weak coupling approximation as formalized in eqs 24 and 25 determining the dynamics of the total mass of reactant m t reduces to computing the temporal evolution of the position of the regime interface ξ t between the linear and saturated regimes along with the diffusive flux f t thereat to solve this problem it is sufficient to develop an approximation for the concentration distribution in the saturated regime cs x t because the reaction dynamics in the linear regime are independent of the concentration profile in the saturated regime the local reaction rate r c is constant and equal to α and the corresponding reactive transport equation is 29 t c s x 2 c s 2 da α defining for x ξ t c d c s α t cd solves the conservative equation 30 t c d x 2 c d 2 da solving this equation is not trivial in general since it depends on the boundary condition at the interface x ξ t with the linear regime neglecting the effect of the boundary condition on the shape of the saturated part of the profile we obtain for x ξ t the solution 31 c d x t da 2 π da t e da x 2 2 da t and 32 c s x t c d x t α t h ξ t x thus assuming that the linear regime does not significantly influence the shape of the profile in the saturated regime leads to a weak coupling approximation for the dynamics of diffusion and reaction the concentration in the saturated regime is the result of superimposing a linear concentration decay α t corresponding to the constant rate r c α on the conservative diffusion problem this leads for the interface behavior to 33a ξ t da t da ln da 2 π α 2 1 t 2 da t 33b f t α ξ t 1 t da t valid for t σ the duration of the saturated regime for t σ we set ξ t f t 0 as discussed before as mentioned above we consider configurations for which the saturated regime is present initially which means that the maximum initial concentration is above α for the gaussian initial condition this means α 2 π time σ then corresponds to the time when the peak of the concentration profile at x 0 reaches α it follows that σ solves ξ σ 0 which gives 34 1 σ 2 da σ da 2 π α 2 this is a cubic equation for σ with a single positive root an analytical solution exists but it is not particularly useful or insightful and the root can easily be found numerically under the weak coupling approximation the saturated regime mass has the analytical solution 35 m s t erf da da t ξ t 2 2 α t ξ t while we are not aware of a general closed form solution for the mass in the linear regime the latter can easily be obtained by numerically computing the integrals in eq 24b the total mass is then the sum of the two regime masses and the effective kinetics rm can be computed from eq 18 in the diffusion and reaction dominated limits analytical solutions can be obtained these regimes are discussed in detail in appendix c 4 3 effective kinetics we compare the results for the total mass and the temporal effective kinetics rt t under the weak coupling approximation against numerical simulations in fig 7 overall the approximation provides very good predictions unsurprisingly da 1 together with low values of α leads to the most discrepancy between simulations and semi analytical solutions since it corresponds to a long saturated regime with reaction and diffusion acting on similar timescales nonetheless the weakly coupled formulation provides a reasonable approximation even in this regime capturing the main features of the dynamics of the total mass a more detailed analysis of the performance of this approximation in terms of the interface dynamics is provided in appendix d we now use the weak coupling approximation to gain insight into the enhancement and non monotonic behavior of the effective kinetics the latter can be understood by examining the derivative drm dm in particular the condition for non monotonic effective kinetics is d r m m 1 d m 0 because the linear regime is always reached for small masses m so that d r m m d m 1 0 using the chain rule in eq 18 for the effective mass kinetics we obtain for the change in reaction rate with total mass 36 d r m m d m m t m r m m as shown in appendix e the first and second times derivatives of the total mass are given by 37a m t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t 37b m t m ℓ t f t the interpretation of the first result is straightforward the total rate of loss of mass is the sum of the reactive mass loss rates in each regime with the linear regime being characterized by a rate proportional to mass and the saturated regime consuming concentration at a constant rate α within a region of length 2ξ the remaining terms involved in the change of the mass in each regime correspond to transfer between regimes and therefore do not affect the total mass the result for the temporal change m in the rate m of mass consumption is more subtle because it is affected by transfer processes the rate in the linear regime changes according to the negative of the change of mass therein due to the linear character of the reaction in the saturated regime the reaction rate changes as 2 α ξ due to change in size of the saturated region thus the rate of change of mass which is the negative of the reaction rate changes as 2 α ξ in turn the mass in the linear regime changes as 2 α ξ due to movement of the boundary compensating the change in saturated regime rate finally the mass in the linear regime also increases according to the diffusive flux f t the net rate change resulting from these processes is given by m ℓ t f t the result for m t leads according eq 18 to 38 r m m m ℓ t m 2 α ξ t m and using the result for m t we find 39 d r m m d m m ℓ t m f t m m ℓ t m 2 α ξ t m the initial condition corresponding to unit mass m 1 and time t m 1 0 is characterized by 40 d r m m d m m 1 m ℓ 0 f 0 m ℓ 0 2 α ξ 0 thus if m ℓ 0 f 0 the initial change is the reaction rate is nonnegative and the maximum reaction rate occurs for m 1 t 0 for m ℓ 0 f 0 the effective kinetics are non monotonic and the maximum reaction rate occurs at some intermediate value m c m ℓ t c f t c corresponding to some time 0 tc σ we will now identify three qualitative damköhler number regimes of reaction enhancement these are characterized by two transition damköhler numbers da 1 and da 2 such that the three regimes correspond to da da 1 da 1 da da 2 and da da 2 we consider first the upper transition number da 2 using eqs 27 28 and 33b for the initial masses interface position and boundary flux under the weak coupling approximation the condition m ℓ 0 f 0 for drm dm to switch signs at some intermediate mass mc becomes da da 2 where 41 da 2 α ln 2 π α 2 erfc ln 2 π α 2 2 we note that this criterion is well approximated by the small and large α expansions 42 da 2 ln 2 π α 2 α 1 1 2 π α 2 π 1 2 π α 2 1 with the crossover between these two α dependencies occurring for α 0 2 for a given α and da da 2 the effective kinetics are monotonic and the maximum rate occurs at m 1 it is given by r m 1 m l 0 2 α ξ 0 from eq 38 using eqs 27 and 28 we obtain for the maximum enhancement r max r max α 43 r max α 1 erfc ln 2 π α 2 2 2 ln 2 π α 2 note the independence on da this expression is well approximated by the low and high α expansions 44 r max 2 1 ln 2 π α 2 ln 2 π α 2 α 1 2 π 1 1 2 π α 2 1 2 π α 2 1 with the crossover occurring for α 0 1 next we consider the limit of small da for a given α for sufficiently small da we have da da 2 so that the effective kinetics are non monotonic diffusion dominated dynamics occur for da π α 2 see eq c 23 in c 2 in this regime we have m ℓ t 1 for t σ using eqs c 20 and c 22 for the boundary position and flux under diffusion dominated dynamics we obtain tc σd see also eq c 21 we conclude that r max m ℓ σ 1 this means that in agreement with the trend observed in fig 6c in the limit of small da at fixed α the maximum reaction rate is approximately unity and occurs after diffusion has placed roughly all the mass in the linear regime with little loss due to reaction thus in this limit the maximum reaction enhancement is 45 r max 1 α independent of da to leading order since this regime occurs for da π α 2 we set 46 da 1 π α 2 10 so that the regime is characterized by da da 1 for a given α the dependence of the maximum effective reaction rate on da thus follows three regimes i a plateau of maximum enhancement for low da below a first transition damköhler da 1 ii a decrease of the maximum reaction rate up to a second transition damköhler da 2 and iii a second plateau at large damköhler the weak coupling approximation accurately captures the non monotonic behavior of the effective kinetics fig 8 a and their enhancement relative to the batch kinetics fig 8b the weak coupling approximation allows for deriving analytical expressions for the two plateaus and the associated transition damköhler numbers and for accurate and efficient numerical computation of the complex intermediate da behavior we summarize these findings in fig 9 5 accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria to illustrate the phenomena described above we compute effective reaction rates for nutrient pulses consumed by bacteria under michaelis menten kinetics and investigate the influence of pulse size on the maximum reaction rate we consider michaelis menten parameters representative of nutrient consumption by e coli natarajan and srienc 2000 see eq 1 and table 1 we consider a pulse of nutrient in a solution of homogeneous bacterial concentration b we assume here that the bacterial concentration does not evolve in time which requires the division rate to be much slower than the nutrient consumption rate the nutrient is introduced as a pulse of width s 0 in the direction x and uniform in the y and z directions in the x direction the spatial domain is assumed much wider than the pulse at all times and in the y z plane the latter is assumed to occupy the full available area s while we focus here on the one dimensional problem the derivations above could easily be extended to localized pulses in three dimensional systems by expressing eq 13 in radial coordinates the nutrient pulse thus diffuses in the x direction and follows the reactive transport eq 13 where the maximum consumption rate μ is a function of the concentration b of bacteria 47 μ μ c b with μc the rate of consumption of the nutrient by a single bacterium for a given initial dimensional mass m 0 of nutrient the initial nutrient concentration is c 0 m 0 s 0 s therefore α is given by 48 α s 0 k s m 0 covering a broad range of values depending on pulse size fig 10 a shows the damköhler number associated with a given pulse width s 0 and bacterial concentration b expressed as a fraction of the maximum bacterial concentration b max koch 1961 since the damköhler number is proportional to s 0 2 μ see eq 12 it varies broadly with pulse size and bacterial concentration expressing s 0 in terms of α the system s trajectory in the da α plane when varying s 0 is therefore characterized by the relation 49 da m 0 2 μ 2 d k 3 s 2 α 2 we show these trajectories for different bacterial concentrations in fig 10b when varying the initial pulse size of a pulse of given mass all the different regimes discussed in the previous sections are explored from low da and α for small pulses which corresponds to the maximum enhancement relative to the batch to large da and α which corresponds to the reaction dominated regime where the global and local kinetics are identical for large s 0 and therefore low c 0 most of the mass is initially in the linear regime in this situation the effective reaction rate is therefore maximum similar reaction rates are however reached in the opposite situation of sharp and highly concentrated pulses due to the effects discussed above the system thus exhibits two optima at low and high s 0 the lowest effective reaction rate is reached for intermediate pulse sizes blue area in fig 10b where a large portion of the mass remains in the saturated regime for a long time for this simple yet very common scenario of a nutrient pulse consumed by bacteria these results illustrate some of the non trivial consequences of our findings for different pulse sizes a broad range of the da α space is explored where the different regimes uncovered in our analysis occur our results could therefore provide a guide for understanding natural systems or designing bacterial cultures under non uniform nutrient conditions in practice these phenomena should be expected to be coupled to other important processes such as bacterial growth chemotaxis or biofilm development which further increase the system s complexity 6 conclusions we have investigated the kinetics of solute pulses locally subject to a michaelis menten reaction which occur in many natural and industrial systems we have analyzed the effective i e global kinetics of such pulse reactors by representing the rate of mass change as a function of mass while for linear local kinetics the global effective kinetics are also linear under nonlinear kinetics the global behavior differs from the local kinetics in the present problem the nonlinearity arises from the transition from linear to constant local reaction rate due to saturation spatial heterogeneity in the concentration profile causes the transition to occur at different times for different spatial locations this fact underlies the difference between local and global kinetics the coupling of diffusion and nonlinear kinetics can lead to non monotonic effective kinetics characterized by an initial enhancement of the effective reaction rate up to a maximum followed by a linear decay of the reaction rate this enhancement is mediated by diffusion which transfers mass from regions where the kinetics are saturated to others where it is linear i e where the reaction rate is locally proportional to concentration this mechanism can significantly accelerate the effective kinetics of pulse reactors relative to a batch reactor of the same size as the initial pulse in which reactants are spatially homogeneous the precise kinetics depend on the initial condition as illustrated by comparing the square initial pulse fig 3 to the gaussian initial pulse fig 6 but the enhancement of effective kinetics through the coupling of diffusion and reaction is expected to be a general result for any non uniform initial condition diffusion always accelerates the transfer of mass from the saturated regime to the linear kinetics regime leading to faster average kinetics than in batch conditions we have numerically explored the different regimes that emerge from this nonlinear reactive transport problem and shown that they can be adequately understood and quantified using a weak coupling approximation this approximation leads to analytical expressions that predict the transitions between different regimes and quantify the enhancement of reaction rates in the end member scenarios we have considered here a piecewise linear approximation of the michaelis menten kinetics to facilitate analytical derivations our methodology could be extended to more complex analytical solutions of full michaelis menten kinetics maggi and la cecilia 2016 schnell and mendoza 1997 for a more precise analysis of reaction enhancement close to the transition between first order and zero order kinetics the mechanisms of reaction enhancement discussed here for one dimensional diffusion are qualitatively similar as those occurring in three dimensions as discussed in appendix g and analytical solutions in spherical coordinates can be derived following the same approach since the diffusion reaction equation is the same of the diffusion reaction equation studied here the mechanisms described here are also relevant for conventional dispersion processes the effect of more complex mixing patterns induced by shear and stretching rolle and le borgne 2019 could be investigated using a similar approach by considering stretching enhanced diffusion captured by lamella mixing models le borgne et al 2015 we have illustrated the consequences of these findings by investigating the dynamics of consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria varying the bacterial concentration and pulse size allows for exploring the different regimes of nonlinear effective kinetics for a given mass of nutrient the consumption kinetics are characterized by two maxima respectively for localized highly concentrated pulses and for wide dilute pulses a minimum consumption rate is obtained for intermediate pulse sizes and concentrations these findings provide new clues to understand natural bio reactive systems and potentially optimize engineered bacterial cultures either to maximize or minimize consumption rates under non uniform nutrient landscapes furthermore these results provide a new framework to understand and model the effective kinetics of michaelis menten reactions in non homogeneous concentration fields while these kinetics are well known in batch reactors we have uncovered a rich array of behaviors that arise from the coupling of concentration gradients and nonlinear kinetics these results are relevant to a broad range of reactive systems characterized by saturating

project chemicalwalks 792041 appendix a sensitivity of the effective kinetics on da and α in this appendix we provide additional numerical results illustrating how the effective kinetics depend on da and α the non monotonic nature of the effective kinetics is enhanced for decreasing da and increasing α fig a 11 for low da fig a 11a the maximum reaction rate initially increases markedly with decreasing mass before converging to linear decay for high da fig a 11c the effective kinetics approach the local kinetics for increasing α at fixed da the maximum reaction rate increases and occurs for higher masses fig a 11d f at late times once the peak concentration drops below α both the pulse and batch kinetics are linear the transition to linear kinetics happens at time σ for the diffusive problem and σb for the batch problem when all the mass is in the linear regime mass and reaction rates decay exponentially at unit rate regardless of the mixing state see eqs 15 and 16 thus r t is constant at times larger than both σb and σ and given by the ratio of surviving masses a 1 λ r t m t m b t t max σ b σ asσ is always smaller than σb the value of λ can be obtained by evaluating the mass ratio for any time t σb taking t σ b and using eqs 10 and 15 we find a 2 λ m σ α e σ b σ and η 1 λ is thus a measure of the overall enhancement of the effective reaction rate the larger η the more efficient the diffusing pulse reactor is when compared to the batch reactor with η 1 λ 0 being the largest possible value a value of η 0 λ 1 means that mixing has no effect on the overall reaction efficiency negative values of η would mean that the incompletely mixed system is less efficient than the batch but these do not occur for michaelis menten reactions we show the dependence of the overall reaction enhancement η on da and α in fig a 12 when α is low both the diffusion and batch problems start from highly saturated conditions these conditions correspond to less efficient overall reaction when compared to linear kinetics since the effective kinetics are constant rather than linearly increasing with total mass in the batch problem exiting the saturated regime requires mass to be consumed until the uniform concentration drops below α which means reaction proceeds under saturated conditions for a long time on the other hand when da is low diffusion can quickly deform the concentration profile so that a significant portion of mass reacts under linear conditions leading to substantially increased overall reaction efficiency increasing α corresponds to less saturated initial conditions the duration of the saturated regime is reduced and the difference between the two scenarios decreases as da increases diffusion becomes less important until the linear regime is reached so that pulse and batch reactors behave similarly appendix b analytical solution for concentration in terms of boundary dynamics in this appendix we provide details on the derivation of the concentration dynamics under diffusive transport in terms of the boundary position ξ t and the mass flux f t the nondimensional dynamical equations for the saturated and linear regimes may be written

eq 33a to full numerical simulations is shown in fig d 13 we show also the analytical solutions corresponding to the diffusive and reactive limits obtained in the previous appendix eqs c 20 and c 2 respectively in the limit of high da for all α the numerical and semi analytical solutions show good quantitative agreement and are also well approximated by the reaction dominated solution for high α for all da eq 33a also provides accurate predictions it interpolates between the diffusion and reaction dominated at low and high da respectively but differs substantially from both at intermediate da as expected low α leads to a worse quantitative approximation except at high da for which the reaction dominated approximation provides a good description note how low α and low da lead to more complex dynamics with a non monotonic evolution of the interface position this occurs because the interface evolution results from the competition of diffusion and reaction with diffusion leading to both a widening and a reduction in the maximum of the concentration profile despite the worse quantitative agreement at low α qualitative features such as non monotonicity are well captured under the weak coupling approximation fig d 14 shows a similar comparison for the diffusive flux f t at the interface computed according to eq 33b the diffusion and reaction dominated limits eqs c 22 and c 4 respectively are also shown in this case low da or high α both lead to good quantitative agreement when da 1 and α is low the weak coupling solution predicts non monotonic behavior whereas numerical simulations show that the diffusive flux is more closely described by the monotonically decreasing diffusion dominated prediction at early times nonetheless the weak coupling approximation captures the transition time to fully linear kinetics well whereas the diffusion dominated approximation does not note that as shown in fig d 15 the mass predictions at high da are accurate despite the quantitative deviations observed for f t at low α this is due to the fact that the magnitude of the diffusive flux is small in this limit and therefore has a negligible effect compared to reaction appendix e temporal derivatives of total mass in this appendix we present details on the calculation of the first and second derivatives of the total mass eq 37 taking the temporal derivative of eq 24 using the definitions in eq 25 we obtain e 1a m s t 2 α ξ t f t 2 α ξ t e 1b m ℓ t m ℓ 0 e t g t h t f t 2 α ξ t using eq 24b for the linear regime mass the latter equation reads e 2 m ℓ t m ℓ t f t 2 α ξ t which has a simple interpretation the first term characterizes the linear regime reaction the second refers to change in mass due to diffusive flux and the third quantifies the direct effect of boundary movement using eq e 1a this equation leads to e 3 m ℓ t m s t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t which since m m ℓ m s yields eq 37a for the first time derivative of the total mass next we differentiate eq 37a yielding e 4 m t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t substituting eq e 2 for m ℓ t leads to eq 37b appendix f simulations of reactive pulses with full michaelis menten kinetics in order to evaluate the effect of the piecewise linear approximation for the local reaction kinetics eq 7 we performed additional numerical simulations using the full michaelis menten reaction kinetics eq 6 the temporal evolution of the mass with full michaelis menten kinetics is found to be very close to the one simulated with the piecewise linear approximation fig f 16 a for low da the maximum reaction rate is slightly smaller than for the approximated kinetics and it occurs a bit earlier fig f 16 b and f 16 c the maximum reaction enhancement r max is however very similar for the full and approximated kinetics for a large range of da and α fig f 17 appendix g simulations of three dimensional reactive pulses in this appendix we investigate the sensitivity of our findings to dimensionality we thus consider a reactive pulse diffusing in three dimensions and solve numerically the reactive transport equation in spherical coordinates g 1 c t 1 2 d a ρ 2 ρ ρ 2 c ρ r c with ρ the radial distance from the initial pulse of mass m 0 v 0 c 0 1 the evolution of the mass and effective reaction rates is found to be similar for one dimensional and three dimensional pulses fig g 18 in three dimensions the maximum reaction rate tends to be larger and to occur earlier fig g 18 b and g 18 c this is due to the fact that diffusion is more efficient at diluting a pulse in three dimensions than in one dimension this enhanced diffusive flux accelerates the transfer of mass from the saturated to the linear regime and thus tends to increase the effective reaction enhancement compared to one dimensional pulses with similar trends as a function of da and α fig g 19 supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j advwatres 2020 103739 appendix

kinetics describe a broad range of physical chemical and biological processes since they are non linear spatial averaging of reaction kinetics is non trivial and it is not known how concentration gradients affect the global effective kinetics here we use numerical simulations and theoretical developments to investigate the effective kinetics of diffusing solute pulses locally subject to michaelis menten reaction kinetics we find that coupled diffusion and reaction lead to non monotonic effective kinetics that differ significantly from the local kinetics the resulting effective reaction rates can be significantly enhanced compared to those of homogeneous batch reactors we uncover the different regimes of effective kinetics as a function of the damköhler number and michaelis menten parameters and derive a theory that explains and quantifies these upscaled kinetics using a weakly coupled description of reaction and diffusion we illustrate the consequences of these findings on the accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria these results are relevant to a large spectrum of reactive systems characterized by heterogeneous concentration landscapes keywords michaelis menten effective kinetics solute pulses concentration gradients upscaling bacteria uptake 1 introduction michaelis menten kinetics michaelis and menten 1913 occur in many natural and engineered reactive systems they were originally developed as a model of catalytic reactions where the reaction of interest is mediated by binding to a catalyst leading to saturation effects michaelis and menten 1913 segel and slemrod 1989 this type of kinetics has found applicability in a variety of contexts such as microbial growth holmberg 1982 thullner and regnier 2019 chemotaxis novick cohen and segel 1984 solute transport in biological tissues ward and king 2003 hiltmann and lory 1983 mcelwain 1978 nicholson 1995 enzyme reactions horvath and engasser 1974 predator prey models hsu et al 2001 and reaction diffusion in electrodes michael et al 1996 in the context of bacterial growth it is also known as monod kinetics monod 1949 they have been used extensively to model biodegradation of contaminants in hydrological and groundwater systems tompson et al 1994 porta et al 2018 barry et al 2002 kindred and celia 1989 blum et al 2009 ginn et al 1995 these kinetics display a simple non linearity the reaction rate is proportional to concentration at low concentrations and saturates to a constant above a threshold concentration analytical solutions exist for the michaelis menten kinetics in batch conditions schnell and mendoza 1997 maggi and la cecilia 2016 for non homogeneous systems the reaction diffusion equation with michaelis menten kinetics has been analyzed mathematically for different applications leading to approximate solutions in some regimes ward and king 2003 hiltmann and lory 1983 mcelwain 1978 shanthi et al 2013 hsu and waltman 1993 anderson and arthurs 1985 1980 park and agmon 2008 here we analyze the effect of chemical gradients on the average kinetic laws for local michaelis menten kinetics we investigate whether non homogeneities in concentrations may lead to enhanced or reduced average reaction rates compared with batch kinetics characterized by homogeneous concentrations under non linear kinetics unresolved concentration gradients lead to effective macroscopic reactive transport laws that are different from microscopic laws battiato and tartakovsky 2011 battiato et al 2009 meile and tuncay 2006 guo et al 2015 in the context of michaelis menten reactions the effect of mass transfer limitations on effective macroscopic kinetics has been studied with an emphasis on bioavailability limitations when micro organisms are located on solid surfaces heße et al 2009 wood et al 2007 hesse et al 2010 or more generally distributed in space schmidt et al 2018 mixing limitation with michaelis menten kinetics have also been investigated in the context of reactive fronts where reactants are spatially segregated and mixing is the limiting step to bring reactants into contact sole mari et al 2017 ding and benson 2015 here we study situations where nutrients or reactants are released as discrete pulses in time and space which encompasses a large spectrum of natural and engineered systems examples include pulse of nutrients in soil könig et al 2018 waring and powers 2016 plants orcutt and nilsen 2000 aquifers bochet et al 2020 or catchments weigelhofer et al 2018 which are often consumed by biological agents through michaelis menten kinetics haefner 2005 while other types of non homogeneous initial conditions could be considered we argue that the general impact of concentration gradients on the average kinetics will be similar as for pulses we study the effective kinetics of diffusing pulses of a single chemical species undergoing degradation with michaelis menten kinetics we assume that the local kinetics are uniform in space and hence focus on the effect of spatial and temporal changes in reactant concentration on the effective kinetics we approximate these nonlinear kinetics by a sharp crossover from a linear dependency of the degradation rate on c for concentrations lower than the crossover concentration to a saturated constant rate above it we investigate the dependency of the effective kinetics on the damköhler number da and the ratio α between the kinetics crossover concentration and the initial concentration we develop a semi analytical framework relying on a weak coupling approximation regarding diffusion and reaction the results compare favorably to numerical simulations of the coupled equations fully analytical descriptions are also derived for asymptotic regimes corresponding respectively to reaction and diffusion dominated dynamics in the following we first present in section 2 a mathematical description of the dynamics including the solution under well mixed conditions which will serve as the reference scenario next section 3 is concerned with analysing the dynamics of the effective reaction rate as a function of the damköhler number and α based on numerical simulations section 4 is devoted to the derivation of the semi analytical theory relying on the approximation of weakly coupled diffusion and reaction section 5 explores the consequences of our results in the context of the consumption of nutrients by bacteria conclusions are drawn and the results discussed in terms of their relevance to natural systems in section 6 additional technical derivations regarding the analytical theory and details on the performance of the weakly coupled approximation may be found in appendix 2 dynamics the dependence of local reaction rate on local concentration associated with michaelis menten kinetics is given by 1 r c μ c k c where c is the concentration μ is the maximum reaction rate in units of concentration per time and k is the characteristic concentration for the transition between first order and zero order kinetics the key qualitative features of these kinetics are i saturation of the reaction rate at high concentrations c k and ii linear growth of the reaction rate at low concentrations c k we define the normalized concentration and characteristic concentrations respectively as 2 c c c 0 and 3 α k c 0 where c 0 is the initial concentration we associate a characteristic reaction time with the low concentration regime 4 τ ℓ k μ and we nondimensionalize time as 5 t t τ ℓ this leads to a dimensionless reaction rate r τ ℓ r c 0 given as a function of dimensionless concentration by 6 r c α c α c in nondimensional terms the saturation condition reads c α and the saturated rate value is likewise given by r c α in the following we present and discuss our results in terms of nondimensional quantities unless noted otherwise for simplicity in order to elucidate the main mechanisms driving the effective kinetics describing the evolution of total mass under this type of scenario we consider a piecewise linear model of kinetics accounting for saturation 7 r c c h α c α h c α where h is the heaviside step function this corresponds to a linear increase r c c of the reaction rate up to the critical concentration α so that r α α above the critical concentration the reaction rate saturates and remains equal to its maximum value α see fig 1 this model simplifies the analytical treatment and allows us to focus on the key features of the interplay between transport induced mixing and saturation in appendix f we investigate numerically the effect of this simplification and show that it tends to slightly over estimate the maximum effective reaction rates fig f 16 however results are very similar since the piecewise linear approximation is very close to the two regimes over orders of magnitudes in concentrations fig 1 and f 17 2 1 well mixed kinetics we first consider the well mixed case corresponding to the conditions found in a batch reactor the concentration c is then spatially homogeneous and depends only on time t the dynamic equation describing concentration decay is the well mixed rate law 8 c r c which describes the decay resulting from the sharp crossover approximation of the michaelis menten kinetics when the rate r c is defined according to eq 7 throughout the dot denotes nondimensional time differentiation if the initial concentration is sufficiently large α 1 reaction starts in the saturated regime the reaction then proceeds at a constant rate for a dimensionless duration σb defined such that c σ b α for α 1 the batch starts in the linear regime and σ b 0 thus 9 σ b max 0 1 α α for t σb standard linear dynamics apply and the concentration decreases exponentially the total mass corresponding to a homogeneous batch of width s 0 is given in one dimension by m b t s 0 c t which we nondimensionalize as m b t m b t m b t 0 hence expressed in nondimensional terms the temporal evolution of the total mass of reactant is given by 10 m b t 1 α t t σ b min α 1 e t σ b t σ b 2 2 diffusing pulses of reactive solutes we now consider a pulse of a reactant diffusing in a solution and locally subject to the piecewise linear reaction rate r c defined in eq 7 our goal is to compare the effective reaction kinetics under these conditions to the well mixed batch reaction kinetics for the same initial mass of reactant and the same initial concentration for simplicity we consider transport in one spatial dimension but the approach can be extended to three dimensions the initial condition is taken to be homogeneous within a region of width s 0 centered at x 0 for a total initial mass of m 0 the initial concentration corresponding to this injection is c 0 m 0 s 0 in dimensional terms the corresponding dynamical equation is 11 t c d x 2 c r c where d is the diffusion coefficient here and throughout the notation y denotes the partial derivative with respect to a variable y note that eq 11 is also relevant for one dimensional dispersion when substituting the diffusion coefficient by a dispersion coefficient hence results derived here for one dimensional diffusion also apply to one dimensional dispersion which would be relevant for instance for reactive pulses released in porous media columns under flow dentz et al 2011 in appendix g we also discuss the effect of dimensionality by solving the reactive transport equation in spherical coordinate for three dimensional diffusion since the surface available for diffusion is larger in three dimensions the effect of average kinetics enhancement is found to be even more pronounced for three dimensional pulses than for one dimensional pulses fig g 18 and g 19 as above we nondimensionalize concentration as c c c 0 and time as t t τ ℓ furthermore we normalize position as x x s 0 we introduce also the diffusion time τ d s 0 2 2 d corresponding to the characteristic time needed to homogenize the width of the initial condition i e to homogenize a unit length in dimensionless units we then define the damköhler number as 12 da τ d τ ℓ s 0 2 μ 2 d k which quantifies the relative importance of reaction versus diffusion and is also simply the diffusion time in dimensionless units the dynamical equation then becomes 13 t c x 2 c 2 da r c where r c is given by eq 7 and the initial condition is 14 c x 0 h x 1 2 h 1 2 x since under diffusion and degradation the maximum concentration cannot increase once the latter reaches the value α the kinetics become linear everywhere and are identical to the well mixed scenario similarly to above we denote by σ the time at which the maximum concentration reaches α for t σ we have 15 m t m σ e t σ and 16 m t m σ e t σ as for the batch problem α 1 means all mass starts in the linear regime corresponding to the linear reaction problem for all times furthermore for any value of α the limit da reduces to the batch problem this happens because in this limit all mass reaches the linear regime through reaction before diffusion has time to deform the initial uniform concentration distribution note that we consider a pulse in a formally infinite domain this means that our results for the total mass are valid so long as deformation of the pulse by diffusion does not extend to the spatial domain boundaries at least while the saturated regime lasts in a finite domain the limit da 0 reduces to a batch of the size of the domain as opposed to the initial pulse size corresponding to the initial pulse becoming homogeneous over the entire domain before reaction becomes important 2 3 effective kinetics of diffusing pulses in order to quantify the effective kinetics of diffusing pulses we study the evolution of the total mass of reactant in dimensionless terms the effective reaction rate as a function of time is given by 17 r t t m t we analyze the evolution of the effective reaction rate rt as a function of time and as a function rm of the mass itself 18 r m m m t m where t m is the time at which the total mass m t t m is equal to m under well mixed conditions the effective kinetics governing the total mass always coincide with the local kinetics irrespective of the latter in the pulse scenario and for nonlinear kinetics however the mixing state as encoded in the concentration profile changes the nature of the effective reaction rate as we will see this is reflected in a qualitatively different behavior of rm m when compared to the local kinetics r c seen as a function of concentration note that formally t is the inverse of m that is m t m m and t m t t this inverse exists for our problem because the mass as a function of time is monotonic for degradation kinetics meaning that a value of mass corresponds to exactly one value of time and vice versa if this were not the case multiple rates would be associated with a given value of mass and the effective kinetics would exhibit hysteresis we do not address this type of scenario in the present work 3 numerical simulations before proceeding with the theoretical discussion we illustrate some key aspects of the dynamics using numerical simulations to this end we numerically integrated eq 13 with a square pulse initial condition as described in section 2 2 using matlab s pdepe method fig 2 illustrates the evolution of the concentration profile for all combinations of values of da 10 3 1 10 3 and α 0 01 0 05 0 26 these parameter combinations are representative of the different qualitative dynamics which may be observed for high da and high α top right panel reaction dominates over diffusion and the shape of the initial profile remains relatively unchanged until the onset of the linear regime in fact this is expected for sufficiently high da whatever the value of α indeed in the limit of high da diffusion becomes slow compared to reaction so that each region of the pulse becomes essentially independent and the pulse behaves as a set of independent batches hence for sufficiently high da and a square pulse initial condition the pulse remains homogeneous for the duration of the saturated regime and the effective kinetics tend towards the batch kinetics for low da and high α bottom right diffusion dominates and the profile approaches a gaussian before relevant reaction occurs for decreasing α and increasing da left and center panels corresponding to an initial condition higher above the saturation threshold and faster reaction there is an enhanced interplay between diffusion and reaction and the evolution of the concentration profile becomes more complex fig 3 a compares the evolution of the total mass over time for diffusing pulses and well mixed batch conditions the interplay between diffusion and nonlinear reaction in pulses leads to an enhancement of the effective reaction rate when compared to the batch reaction the well mixed conditions are the least efficient in the sense that the remaining mass is always higher at a given time this is consistent with the above discussion regarding the convergence to batch behavior at high da for low da when the effect of diffusion is most pronounced the effective reaction rate initially increases with time to reach a maximum before decaying at larger times fig 3b these non monotonic effective kinetics contrast with the well mixed scenario which mimics the local kinetics constant rate followed by exponential decay see eq 16 fig 3 c compares the evolution of the effective reaction rate as a function of total mass with the local kinetics the initial value of the reaction rate corresponding to m 1 is always the same as the initial batch reaction rate because the initial conditions are identical then the reaction rate increases up to a maximum value before decreasing and reaching the linear regime when the peak concentration drops below α the maximum reaction rates increase markedly with decreasing da and the local kinetics are recovered at high da note that the reaction rate is maximum when the mass of the pulse is distributed such that all concentrations lie below α local concentrations then obey c c which upon spatial integration leads to m m this linear dependence corresponds to the upper envelope of rm m as seen in fig 3c in appendix a we present a series of additional numerical simulations and discuss the sensitivity of the non monotonic effective kinetics on da and α fig a 11 the maximum reaction rate r max increases with decreasing da and increasing α fig 4 a therefore the region of maximum reaction rate corresponds to a regime where diffusion dominates over reaction and where the linear regime dominates over the saturated regime for most of the dynamics see fig 1 the time t max at which this maximum reaction rate occurs is largest for high da and low α which corresponds to relatively low values of r max see fig 4b note that α corresponds to the maximum reaction rate for well mixed batch dynamics thus increasing α leads to an increase in r max but also in the maximum batch reaction rate to evaluate the reaction enhancement relative to the batch kinetics we define the instantaneous reaction rate enhancement as 19 r t m t m b t because of the nature of michaelis menten kinetics the batch reaction rate m b t is maximum at initial time and equal to α until the time t σ b when the concentration reaches the transition concentration k in contrast the maximum reaction rate of the pulse kinetics m t is always maximum at an intermediate time t max σb fig 3 hence the maximum reaction rate enhancement is r max m t max α fig 5 the maximum enhancement of the effective reaction is found in the limit of low da and α this corresponds to the case of diffusion processes dominating over reaction processes with a saturation concentration far below the initial concentration conversely the minimum enhancement of effective reaction by mixing is found in the opposite limit of high da where reaction dominates the dynamics and high α in appendix a we present an analysis of the late time surviving masses to quantify the global reaction enhancement as a function of da and α the behavior of the global reaction enhancement follows the same tendencies as the instantaneous reaction enhancement fig 5 described above it is maximum for low da and low α fig a 12 4 theory we will now develop a theoretical description in order to better understand and quantify the numerical results discussed in the previous section since the dynamics for the mass are trivially identical to the batch problem whenever there is no saturated regime we assume in what follows that the initial concentration maximum is larger than α to develop the theory we first introduce two key quantities governing the dynamics of the diffusion reaction system relating to the dynamics of the spatial boundary between the linear and saturated kinetic regimes we then develop a weak coupling approximation to predict the evolution of total mass under reaction and diffusion 4 1 transition between saturated and linear regimes for times t σ at which the peak concentration is above the saturation threshold α the spatial domain may be divided into regions in which either the linear or the saturated reaction dynamics are taking place in this framework the first key quantity is the position of the interface between these domains if the concentration profile is symmetric at the initial time it will remain so at all times if further over the half space of positive x the initial concentration profile c x t 0 decreases monotonically i e x c 0 for x 0 the profile will remain monotonically decreasing at all times hence the saturated region occurs around x 0 and is separated from the linear region by an interface at positions ξ t where ξ t is the positive solution to c ξ t t α we may thus separate the concentration field into two terms corresponding respectively to these two regions c x t c ℓ x t c s x t with 20 c s x t c x t h ξ t x c ℓ x t c x t h x ξ t where s stands for saturated and ℓ for linear kinetics the total mass is given by 21 m t d x c x t m s t m ℓ t where the masses in each regime are given by the integrals of the corresponding concentrations the second key quantity is the total diffusive flux across the interface between the regions i e between reaction regimes the net diffusive flux into the linear regime considering the contributions at both ξ t is given by 22 f t x c x t x ξ t da for t σ when the full profile is in the linear reaction regime we set ξ t f t 0 then c x t c ℓ x t and therefore m t m ℓ t mass transfer between regimes is governed by the direct effect of the diffusive flux across the interface as well as by the displacement over time of the interface position due to both reaction and diffusion by the leibniz integral rule for differentiation under the integral sign we have 23 m s t x ξ t d x t c x t 2 α ξ t m ℓ t x ξ t d x t c x t 2 α ξ t the first term for each mass is due to the dynamical change of concentration whereas the second is directly due to the time dependence of the interface position as shown in appendix b this leads to 24a m s t m s 0 r t f t b t 24b m ℓ t m ℓ 0 e t g t h t where 25a r t 2 α 0 t d u ξ u 25b f t 0 t d u f u are the saturated regime mass losses due respectively to reaction and diffusive flux at the boundaries 25c b t 2 α 0 t d u ξ u 2 α ξ 0 ξ t is the saturated mass loss due directly to the changing position of the interface and 25d g t 0 t d u e t u f u 25e h t 2 α 0 t d u e t u ξ u correspond to the amount of mass which was transferred to the linear regime at some time u t by diffusion and directly by change of the interface position respectively and then survived exponential decay until time t in order to simplify the analytical treatment it is convenient to consider a gaussian initial condition the role of the initial condition on the effective reaction kinetics will be discussed shortly in dimensionless units we consider an initial profile with unit mass and variance 26 c x 0 exp x 2 2 2 π note that the corresponding initial masses are 27 m s 0 erf ξ 0 2 m ℓ 0 erfc ξ 0 2 where erf and erfc are the error function and the complementary error function respectively the initial position of the interface is given by 28 ξ 0 ln 2 π α 2 the numerically computed time evolution of the total mass and effective reaction rate for the gaussian initial condition are shown in fig 6 for small da when diffusion dominates the behavior is the same as for the square pulse initial condition because diffusion quickly deforms the initial profile into a gaussian shape before appreciable reaction takes place in the limit of small da reaction approaches the linear regime for masses arbitrarily close to the initial mass for high da however the initial condition controls the kinetics because diffusion cannot deform it substantially before the linear regime is reached in this case reaction is much more efficient than for the batch scenario since a relevant portion of the mass starts in the linear regime whereas the well mixed batch is fully saturated this effect is more pronounced for low α since as discussed above it corresponds to a longer duration of the saturated regime in what follows we will develop approximations to quantitatively analyze the dynamical behavior of the diffusion reaction system under the unit gaussian initial condition it should be kept in mind that the high da limit exhibits a behavior which differs from the square pulse initial condition which as discussed above is identical with a well mixed batch in this limit 4 2 weak coupling approximation as formalized in eqs 24 and 25 determining the dynamics of the total mass of reactant m t reduces to computing the temporal evolution of the position of the regime interface ξ t between the linear and saturated regimes along with the diffusive flux f t thereat to solve this problem it is sufficient to develop an approximation for the concentration distribution in the saturated regime cs x t because the reaction dynamics in the linear regime are independent of the concentration profile in the saturated regime the local reaction rate r c is constant and equal to α and the corresponding reactive transport equation is 29 t c s x 2 c s 2 da α defining for x ξ t c d c s α t cd solves the conservative equation 30 t c d x 2 c d 2 da solving this equation is not trivial in general since it depends on the boundary condition at the interface x ξ t with the linear regime neglecting the effect of the boundary condition on the shape of the saturated part of the profile we obtain for x ξ t the solution 31 c d x t da 2 π da t e da x 2 2 da t and 32 c s x t c d x t α t h ξ t x thus assuming that the linear regime does not significantly influence the shape of the profile in the saturated regime leads to a weak coupling approximation for the dynamics of diffusion and reaction the concentration in the saturated regime is the result of superimposing a linear concentration decay α t corresponding to the constant rate r c α on the conservative diffusion problem this leads for the interface behavior to 33a ξ t da t da ln da 2 π α 2 1 t 2 da t 33b f t α ξ t 1 t da t valid for t σ the duration of the saturated regime for t σ we set ξ t f t 0 as discussed before as mentioned above we consider configurations for which the saturated regime is present initially which means that the maximum initial concentration is above α for the gaussian initial condition this means α 2 π time σ then corresponds to the time when the peak of the concentration profile at x 0 reaches α it follows that σ solves ξ σ 0 which gives 34 1 σ 2 da σ da 2 π α 2 this is a cubic equation for σ with a single positive root an analytical solution exists but it is not particularly useful or insightful and the root can easily be found numerically under the weak coupling approximation the saturated regime mass has the analytical solution 35 m s t erf da da t ξ t 2 2 α t ξ t while we are not aware of a general closed form solution for the mass in the linear regime the latter can easily be obtained by numerically computing the integrals in eq 24b the total mass is then the sum of the two regime masses and the effective kinetics rm can be computed from eq 18 in the diffusion and reaction dominated limits analytical solutions can be obtained these regimes are discussed in detail in appendix c 4 3 effective kinetics we compare the results for the total mass and the temporal effective kinetics rt t under the weak coupling approximation against numerical simulations in fig 7 overall the approximation provides very good predictions unsurprisingly da 1 together with low values of α leads to the most discrepancy between simulations and semi analytical solutions since it corresponds to a long saturated regime with reaction and diffusion acting on similar timescales nonetheless the weakly coupled formulation provides a reasonable approximation even in this regime capturing the main features of the dynamics of the total mass a more detailed analysis of the performance of this approximation in terms of the interface dynamics is provided in appendix d we now use the weak coupling approximation to gain insight into the enhancement and non monotonic behavior of the effective kinetics the latter can be understood by examining the derivative drm dm in particular the condition for non monotonic effective kinetics is d r m m 1 d m 0 because the linear regime is always reached for small masses m so that d r m m d m 1 0 using the chain rule in eq 18 for the effective mass kinetics we obtain for the change in reaction rate with total mass 36 d r m m d m m t m r m m as shown in appendix e the first and second times derivatives of the total mass are given by 37a m t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t 37b m t m ℓ t f t the interpretation of the first result is straightforward the total rate of loss of mass is the sum of the reactive mass loss rates in each regime with the linear regime being characterized by a rate proportional to mass and the saturated regime consuming concentration at a constant rate α within a region of length 2ξ the remaining terms involved in the change of the mass in each regime correspond to transfer between regimes and therefore do not affect the total mass the result for the temporal change m in the rate m of mass consumption is more subtle because it is affected by transfer processes the rate in the linear regime changes according to the negative of the change of mass therein due to the linear character of the reaction in the saturated regime the reaction rate changes as 2 α ξ due to change in size of the saturated region thus the rate of change of mass which is the negative of the reaction rate changes as 2 α ξ in turn the mass in the linear regime changes as 2 α ξ due to movement of the boundary compensating the change in saturated regime rate finally the mass in the linear regime also increases according to the diffusive flux f t the net rate change resulting from these processes is given by m ℓ t f t the result for m t leads according eq 18 to 38 r m m m ℓ t m 2 α ξ t m and using the result for m t we find 39 d r m m d m m ℓ t m f t m m ℓ t m 2 α ξ t m the initial condition corresponding to unit mass m 1 and time t m 1 0 is characterized by 40 d r m m d m m 1 m ℓ 0 f 0 m ℓ 0 2 α ξ 0 thus if m ℓ 0 f 0 the initial change is the reaction rate is nonnegative and the maximum reaction rate occurs for m 1 t 0 for m ℓ 0 f 0 the effective kinetics are non monotonic and the maximum reaction rate occurs at some intermediate value m c m ℓ t c f t c corresponding to some time 0 tc σ we will now identify three qualitative damköhler number regimes of reaction enhancement these are characterized by two transition damköhler numbers da 1 and da 2 such that the three regimes correspond to da da 1 da 1 da da 2 and da da 2 we consider first the upper transition number da 2 using eqs 27 28 and 33b for the initial masses interface position and boundary flux under the weak coupling approximation the condition m ℓ 0 f 0 for drm dm to switch signs at some intermediate mass mc becomes da da 2 where 41 da 2 α ln 2 π α 2 erfc ln 2 π α 2 2 we note that this criterion is well approximated by the small and large α expansions 42 da 2 ln 2 π α 2 α 1 1 2 π α 2 π 1 2 π α 2 1 with the crossover between these two α dependencies occurring for α 0 2 for a given α and da da 2 the effective kinetics are monotonic and the maximum rate occurs at m 1 it is given by r m 1 m l 0 2 α ξ 0 from eq 38 using eqs 27 and 28 we obtain for the maximum enhancement r max r max α 43 r max α 1 erfc ln 2 π α 2 2 2 ln 2 π α 2 note the independence on da this expression is well approximated by the low and high α expansions 44 r max 2 1 ln 2 π α 2 ln 2 π α 2 α 1 2 π 1 1 2 π α 2 1 2 π α 2 1 with the crossover occurring for α 0 1 next we consider the limit of small da for a given α for sufficiently small da we have da da 2 so that the effective kinetics are non monotonic diffusion dominated dynamics occur for da π α 2 see eq c 23 in c 2 in this regime we have m ℓ t 1 for t σ using eqs c 20 and c 22 for the boundary position and flux under diffusion dominated dynamics we obtain tc σd see also eq c 21 we conclude that r max m ℓ σ 1 this means that in agreement with the trend observed in fig 6c in the limit of small da at fixed α the maximum reaction rate is approximately unity and occurs after diffusion has placed roughly all the mass in the linear regime with little loss due to reaction thus in this limit the maximum reaction enhancement is 45 r max 1 α independent of da to leading order since this regime occurs for da π α 2 we set 46 da 1 π α 2 10 so that the regime is characterized by da da 1 for a given α the dependence of the maximum effective reaction rate on da thus follows three regimes i a plateau of maximum enhancement for low da below a first transition damköhler da 1 ii a decrease of the maximum reaction rate up to a second transition damköhler da 2 and iii a second plateau at large damköhler the weak coupling approximation accurately captures the non monotonic behavior of the effective kinetics fig 8 a and their enhancement relative to the batch kinetics fig 8b the weak coupling approximation allows for deriving analytical expressions for the two plateaus and the associated transition damköhler numbers and for accurate and efficient numerical computation of the complex intermediate da behavior we summarize these findings in fig 9 5 accelerated consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria to illustrate the phenomena described above we compute effective reaction rates for nutrient pulses consumed by bacteria under michaelis menten kinetics and investigate the influence of pulse size on the maximum reaction rate we consider michaelis menten parameters representative of nutrient consumption by e coli natarajan and srienc 2000 see eq 1 and table 1 we consider a pulse of nutrient in a solution of homogeneous bacterial concentration b we assume here that the bacterial concentration does not evolve in time which requires the division rate to be much slower than the nutrient consumption rate the nutrient is introduced as a pulse of width s 0 in the direction x and uniform in the y and z directions in the x direction the spatial domain is assumed much wider than the pulse at all times and in the y z plane the latter is assumed to occupy the full available area s while we focus here on the one dimensional problem the derivations above could easily be extended to localized pulses in three dimensional systems by expressing eq 13 in radial coordinates the nutrient pulse thus diffuses in the x direction and follows the reactive transport eq 13 where the maximum consumption rate μ is a function of the concentration b of bacteria 47 μ μ c b with μc the rate of consumption of the nutrient by a single bacterium for a given initial dimensional mass m 0 of nutrient the initial nutrient concentration is c 0 m 0 s 0 s therefore α is given by 48 α s 0 k s m 0 covering a broad range of values depending on pulse size fig 10 a shows the damköhler number associated with a given pulse width s 0 and bacterial concentration b expressed as a fraction of the maximum bacterial concentration b max koch 1961 since the damköhler number is proportional to s 0 2 μ see eq 12 it varies broadly with pulse size and bacterial concentration expressing s 0 in terms of α the system s trajectory in the da α plane when varying s 0 is therefore characterized by the relation 49 da m 0 2 μ 2 d k 3 s 2 α 2 we show these trajectories for different bacterial concentrations in fig 10b when varying the initial pulse size of a pulse of given mass all the different regimes discussed in the previous sections are explored from low da and α for small pulses which corresponds to the maximum enhancement relative to the batch to large da and α which corresponds to the reaction dominated regime where the global and local kinetics are identical for large s 0 and therefore low c 0 most of the mass is initially in the linear regime in this situation the effective reaction rate is therefore maximum similar reaction rates are however reached in the opposite situation of sharp and highly concentrated pulses due to the effects discussed above the system thus exhibits two optima at low and high s 0 the lowest effective reaction rate is reached for intermediate pulse sizes blue area in fig 10b where a large portion of the mass remains in the saturated regime for a long time for this simple yet very common scenario of a nutrient pulse consumed by bacteria these results illustrate some of the non trivial consequences of our findings for different pulse sizes a broad range of the da α space is explored where the different regimes uncovered in our analysis occur our results could therefore provide a guide for understanding natural systems or designing bacterial cultures under non uniform nutrient conditions in practice these phenomena should be expected to be coupled to other important processes such as bacterial growth chemotaxis or biofilm development which further increase the system s complexity 6 conclusions we have investigated the kinetics of solute pulses locally subject to a michaelis menten reaction which occur in many natural and industrial systems we have analyzed the effective i e global kinetics of such pulse reactors by representing the rate of mass change as a function of mass while for linear local kinetics the global effective kinetics are also linear under nonlinear kinetics the global behavior differs from the local kinetics in the present problem the nonlinearity arises from the transition from linear to constant local reaction rate due to saturation spatial heterogeneity in the concentration profile causes the transition to occur at different times for different spatial locations this fact underlies the difference between local and global kinetics the coupling of diffusion and nonlinear kinetics can lead to non monotonic effective kinetics characterized by an initial enhancement of the effective reaction rate up to a maximum followed by a linear decay of the reaction rate this enhancement is mediated by diffusion which transfers mass from regions where the kinetics are saturated to others where it is linear i e where the reaction rate is locally proportional to concentration this mechanism can significantly accelerate the effective kinetics of pulse reactors relative to a batch reactor of the same size as the initial pulse in which reactants are spatially homogeneous the precise kinetics depend on the initial condition as illustrated by comparing the square initial pulse fig 3 to the gaussian initial pulse fig 6 but the enhancement of effective kinetics through the coupling of diffusion and reaction is expected to be a general result for any non uniform initial condition diffusion always accelerates the transfer of mass from the saturated regime to the linear kinetics regime leading to faster average kinetics than in batch conditions we have numerically explored the different regimes that emerge from this nonlinear reactive transport problem and shown that they can be adequately understood and quantified using a weak coupling approximation this approximation leads to analytical expressions that predict the transitions between different regimes and quantify the enhancement of reaction rates in the end member scenarios we have considered here a piecewise linear approximation of the michaelis menten kinetics to facilitate analytical derivations our methodology could be extended to more complex analytical solutions of full michaelis menten kinetics maggi and la cecilia 2016 schnell and mendoza 1997 for a more precise analysis of reaction enhancement close to the transition between first order and zero order kinetics the mechanisms of reaction enhancement discussed here for one dimensional diffusion are qualitatively similar as those occurring in three dimensions as discussed in appendix g and analytical solutions in spherical coordinates can be derived following the same approach since the diffusion reaction equation is the same of the diffusion reaction equation studied here the mechanisms described here are also relevant for conventional dispersion processes the effect of more complex mixing patterns induced by shear and stretching rolle and le borgne 2019 could be investigated using a similar approach by considering stretching enhanced diffusion captured by lamella mixing models le borgne et al 2015 we have illustrated the consequences of these findings by investigating the dynamics of consumption of nutrient pulses by bacteria varying the bacterial concentration and pulse size allows for exploring the different regimes of nonlinear effective kinetics for a given mass of nutrient the consumption kinetics are characterized by two maxima respectively for localized highly concentrated pulses and for wide dilute pulses a minimum consumption rate is obtained for intermediate pulse sizes and concentrations these findings provide new clues to understand natural bio reactive systems and potentially optimize engineered bacterial cultures either to maximize or minimize consumption rates under non uniform nutrient landscapes furthermore these results provide a new framework to understand and model the effective kinetics of michaelis menten reactions in non homogeneous concentration fields while these kinetics are well known in batch reactors we have uncovered a rich array of behaviors that arise from the coupling of concentration gradients and nonlinear kinetics these results are relevant to a broad range of reactive systems characterized by saturating

project chemicalwalks 792041 appendix a sensitivity of the effective kinetics on da and α in this appendix we provide additional numerical results illustrating how the effective kinetics depend on da and α the non monotonic nature of the effective kinetics is enhanced for decreasing da and increasing α fig a 11 for low da fig a 11a the maximum reaction rate initially increases markedly with decreasing mass before converging to linear decay for high da fig a 11c the effective kinetics approach the local kinetics for increasing α at fixed da the maximum reaction rate increases and occurs for higher masses fig a 11d f at late times once the peak concentration drops below α both the pulse and batch kinetics are linear the transition to linear kinetics happens at time σ for the diffusive problem and σb for the batch problem when all the mass is in the linear regime mass and reaction rates decay exponentially at unit rate regardless of the mixing state see eqs 15 and 16 thus r t is constant at times larger than both σb and σ and given by the ratio of surviving masses a 1 λ r t m t m b t t max σ b σ asσ is always smaller than σb the value of λ can be obtained by evaluating the mass ratio for any time t σb taking t σ b and using eqs 10 and 15 we find a 2 λ m σ α e σ b σ and η 1 λ is thus a measure of the overall enhancement of the effective reaction rate the larger η the more efficient the diffusing pulse reactor is when compared to the batch reactor with η 1 λ 0 being the largest possible value a value of η 0 λ 1 means that mixing has no effect on the overall reaction efficiency negative values of η would mean that the incompletely mixed system is less efficient than the batch but these do not occur for michaelis menten reactions we show the dependence of the overall reaction enhancement η on da and α in fig a 12 when α is low both the diffusion and batch problems start from highly saturated conditions these conditions correspond to less efficient overall reaction when compared to linear kinetics since the effective kinetics are constant rather than linearly increasing with total mass in the batch problem exiting the saturated regime requires mass to be consumed until the uniform concentration drops below α which means reaction proceeds under saturated conditions for a long time on the other hand when da is low diffusion can quickly deform the concentration profile so that a significant portion of mass reacts under linear conditions leading to substantially increased overall reaction efficiency increasing α corresponds to less saturated initial conditions the duration of the saturated regime is reduced and the difference between the two scenarios decreases as da increases diffusion becomes less important until the linear regime is reached so that pulse and batch reactors behave similarly appendix b analytical solution for concentration in terms of boundary dynamics in this appendix we provide details on the derivation of the concentration dynamics under diffusive transport in terms of the boundary position ξ t and the mass flux f t the nondimensional dynamical equations for the saturated and linear regimes may be written

analytical solutions for asymptotic regimes in this appendix we identify and describe reaction and diffusion dominated dynamical regimes we obtain closed form analytical solutions for the behavior of

the lowest value of concentration in this regime is α comparison to eq 32 shows the approximation holds for t 1 the position of the interface is now approximated by c 20 ξ d t da t da ln da 2 π α 2 da

d t α ξ d t da t in this case the condition 2αξ t f t that the reactive contribution to mass loss in the saturated regime be negligible compared to the diffusive contribution for all times t σ is thus da σ d 1 2 this leads to the diffusion dominated condition c 23 da π α 2 which also ensures σd 1 the condition σd 1 implies that the amount of reaction in the linear regime is negligible for t σd thus we find that g t f t and h t b t as expected for a diffusive profile we obtain for t σd c 24a m s t erf ξ d t 2 c 24b m ℓ t erfc ξ d t 2 so that m ℓ σ 1 no appreciable reaction the corresponding reaction enhancement is c 25 η 1 e σ b α α 1 0 α 1 appendix d interface dynamics under the weak coupling approximation in this appendix we assess the performance of the weak coupling approximation in predicting the time evolution of the linear saturated regime interface position ξ t and the diffusive mass flux f t between regimes a comparison of the evolution of the interface position according to eq 33a to full numerical simulations is shown in fig d 13 we show also the analytical solutions corresponding to the diffusive and reactive limits obtained in the previous appendix eqs c 20 and c 2 respectively in the limit of high da for all α the numerical and semi analytical solutions show good quantitative agreement and are also well approximated by the reaction dominated solution for high α for all da eq 33a also provides accurate predictions it interpolates between the diffusion and reaction dominated at low and high da respectively but differs substantially from both at intermediate da as expected low α leads to a worse quantitative approximation except at high da for which the reaction dominated approximation provides a good description note how low α and low da lead to more complex dynamics with a non monotonic evolution of the interface position this occurs because the interface evolution results from the competition of diffusion and reaction with diffusion leading to both a widening and a reduction in the maximum of the concentration profile despite the worse quantitative agreement at low α qualitative features such as non monotonicity are well captured under the weak coupling approximation fig d 14 shows a similar comparison for the diffusive flux f t at the interface computed according to eq 33b the diffusion and reaction dominated limits eqs c 22 and c 4 respectively are also shown in this case low da or high α both lead to good quantitative agreement when da 1 and α is low the weak coupling solution predicts non monotonic behavior whereas numerical simulations show that the diffusive flux is more closely described by the monotonically decreasing diffusion dominated prediction at early times nonetheless the weak coupling approximation captures the transition time to fully linear kinetics well whereas the diffusion dominated approximation does not note that as shown in fig d 15 the mass predictions at high da are accurate despite the quantitative deviations observed for f t at low α this is due to the fact that the magnitude of the diffusive flux is small in this limit and therefore has a negligible effect compared to reaction appendix e temporal derivatives of total mass in this appendix we present details on the calculation of the first and second derivatives of the total mass eq 37 taking the temporal derivative of eq 24 using the definitions in eq 25 we obtain e 1a m s t 2 α ξ t f t 2 α ξ t e 1b m ℓ t m ℓ 0 e t g t h t f t 2 α ξ t using eq 24b for the linear regime mass the latter equation reads e 2 m ℓ t m ℓ t f t 2 α ξ t which has a simple interpretation the first term characterizes the linear regime reaction the second refers to change in mass due to diffusive flux and the third quantifies the direct effect of boundary movement using eq e 1a this equation leads to e 3 m ℓ t m s t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t which since m m ℓ m s yields eq 37a for the first time derivative of the total mass next we differentiate eq 37a yielding e 4 m t m ℓ t 2 α ξ t substituting eq e 2 for m ℓ t leads to eq 37b appendix f simulations of reactive pulses with full michaelis menten kinetics in order to evaluate the effect of the piecewise linear approximation for the local reaction kinetics eq 7 we performed additional numerical simulations using the full michaelis menten reaction kinetics eq 6 the temporal evolution of the mass with full michaelis menten kinetics is found to be very close to the one simulated with the piecewise linear approximation fig f 16 a for low da the maximum reaction rate is slightly smaller than for the approximated kinetics and it occurs a bit earlier fig f 16 b and f 16 c the maximum reaction enhancement r max is however very similar for the full and approximated kinetics for a large range of da and α fig f 17 appendix g simulations of three dimensional reactive pulses in this appendix we investigate the sensitivity of our findings to dimensionality we thus consider a reactive pulse diffusing in three dimensions and solve numerically the reactive transport equation in spherical coordinates g 1 c t 1 2 d a ρ 2 ρ ρ 2 c ρ r c with ρ the radial distance from the initial pulse of mass m 0 v 0 c 0 1 the evolution of the mass and effective reaction rates is found to be similar for one dimensional and three dimensional pulses fig g 18 in three dimensions the maximum reaction rate tends to be larger and to occur earlier fig g 18 b and g 18 c this is due to the fact that diffusion is more efficient at diluting a pulse in three dimensions than in one dimension this enhanced diffusive flux accelerates the transfer of mass from the saturated to the linear regime and thus tends to increase the effective reaction enhancement compared to one dimensional pulses with similar trends as a function of da and α fig g 19 supplementary materials supplementary material associated with this article can be found in the online version at doi 10 1016 j advwatres 2020 103739 appendix

373,reservoirs have been widely used to regulate streamflow to meet both human and natural water requirements this study applies a hidden markov decision tree hm dt model to derive representative reservoir operation modules under various operation conditions i e inflow storage as well as unknown factors and their transitions the dynamic change of operation rules that reflect the impacts of seasonality long term non stationarity and extreme events on reservoir operation the representative operation modules can be applied to reservoirs in the same region that are not observed the capability for simulating dynamic operation behaviors improves the predictive accuracy as compared to regular decision trees using a number of reservoirs located in the same region for training the hm dt model can derive a limited number of representative operation modules in the form of decision trees dt and the transitions between different operation schemes in response to changing operation conditions the application of the hm dt model is demonstrated through a case study of the upper colorado river basin where eight representative operation modules are determined for 50 reservoirs located in the region and the modules are validated with 11 reservoirs in the same region the eight operation modules are classified into three types i e nearly constant release release as a piece wise function of inflow and release almost identical to inflow the identified operation modules and the transition patterns between operation modules can be used to better understand real world operation behaviors improve future operations and build realistic reservoir operation components in basin scale hydrological models 1 introduction with widely and long term construction of reservoirs around the world reservoir operations satisfy human water use purposes simonovic 1992 such as water supply irrigation hydropower generation flooding control and recreation meanwhile streamflow has been widely and extensively altered by reservoir construction and operation over time biemans et al 2011 nilsson et al 2005 it is imperative to provide better support for reservoir operations both through developing more realistic optimization models hejazi and cai 2011 and through better understanding the impacts of reservoirs on natural and human systems wu et al 2020 one special need is to incorporate realistic reservoir operation components into the modeling of large scale hydrological and water resources systems that are generally recognized as coupled hydrological human systems where flow regulation via storage represents one of the primary human interferences to natural hydrological systems sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 wu et al 2020 a realistic reservoir component for a hydrological model will improve the model performance and enable researchers to better identify the impacts of reservoir operations on hydrological processes and to provide improved scientific information for water resources management decision making the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new data mining model namely the hidden markov decision tree model hm dt that can be used to derive a limited number of representative operation modules for a group of reservoirs that are subject to similar climate conditions operation functions and institutional regulations using historical data the model results i e the representative reservoir operation modules along with the identified historical operation patterns can be used to understand the real world reservoir operation behaviors based on a systematic view of the real world operations retrospectively analyze historical operation activities in order to build more realistic optimization models hejazi and cai 2011 and enable operators to identify non optimal operations and potential future improvements specially a unique application of the derived operation modules allows the development of a generic reservoir operation model built on the identified representative operation rules which will be applicable to any reservoir in the study basin region such a model is timely needed to improve existing large scale basin or regional hydrological models by adding a computationally tractable reservoir component that simulates real world operations under the various inflow conditions as well as human responses existing studies followed regular supervised machine learning ml procedures to extract realistic reservoir operation rules based on historical records in those studies reservoir releases are treated as the target variables and the information available to operators for making release decisions such as inflow forecast and storage are considered as independent variables e g shrestha et al 1996 corani et al 2009 yang et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 in particular yang et al 2016 adopted decision trees for simulating the operation of nine major reservoirs in california though these studies were able to reproduce historical reservoir release decisions with acceptable accuracy the procedures used can only be applied to derive static operation rules for a specific reservoir based on its records from the entire study period that is to say the change of operation rules in response to changing operation conditions such as changing climate conditions water demands and operation objectives during the study period cannot be simulated moreover the operation rules are site specific and hard to be extended to other reservoirs meanwhile other studies did not directly extract operation rules from historical records of reservoir operation but derived some useful information to help better understand the real world reservoir operation behaviors and or build improved optimization models for reservoir operation e g hejazi et al 2008 hejazi and cai 2009 and giuliani and herman 2018 hejazi et al 2008 used mutual information to assess the relevance of different hydrological indicators to reservoir release decisions and identified the most relevant factors for 79 reservoirs in california and the great plains the identified factors were then related to properties of the reservoirs such as the location and reservoir size to understand the impacts of these factors on operation behaviors hejazi and cai 2009 developed an input variable selection method which was applied to 22 reservoirs in california to select input variables from 121 potential input hydrological indicators to model the daily release decisions giuliani and herman 2018 extracted the behavior profiles of 172 reservoirs in california using eigen behavior analysis and identified four typical profiles through clustering analysis which were related to the characteristics of the reservoirs such as elevation and capacity these studies are able to derive behavioral characteristics that are generic to a certain type of reservoirs through post processing such as clustering giuliani and herman 2018 in this study we propose a hidden markov decision tree hm dt model to derive a limited number of representative operation modules for reservoirs located in a particular region that are subject to similar climate conditions operation functions and institutional regulations using historical data hidden markov model hmm has been widely used for text mining andrews and vigliocco 2010 dna sequence modeling henderson et al 1997 and speech recognition varga and moore 1990 hmms have also been applied to hydrology and water resources problems such as identifying patterns in daily streamflow pender et al 2015 multidecadal streamflow bracken et al 2014 meteorological droughts khadr 2016 and daily rainfall robertson et al 2004 following existing studies the hidden markov model is applied to recognizing patterns in reservoir operation records with special focus on the transitions of operation schemes over time and the determination of representative reservoir operation rules represented in the form of decision trees the special structure of the hm dt model enables the identification of dynamic operation patterns which will provide two folded benefits compared to existing machine learning studies in the literature i e 1 improved predictive accuracy based on the simulation of the dynamics in reservoir operations and 2 the applicability of the derived representative operation modules to reservoirs without historical records in particular it is assumed that there exist a limited number of representative reservoir operation schemes each represented in the form of decision trees and used under certain operation conditions and the transitions between hidden states are described by a markov process that simulates the transitions of operation schemes over time in addition time series of historical operation records each consisting of inflow storage and release records of different reservoirs are treated as independent observations generated by the same set of operation schemes in this way representative reservoir operation rules are to be determined which can be applied to unobserved reservoirs in the same region the representativeness of the resulted operation schemes will be validated through testing the model performance with reservoirs that are not included in the training process in the rest of this paper the hm dt model developed in this study is introduced first followed by an example of application of the proposed hm dt model to 50 reservoirs and another 11 reservoirs for validation located in the upper colorado basin based on the results discussions on the potential applications of the identified operation rules are provided and conclusions are made 2 methods to determine representative reservoir operation rules applicable to reservoirs located in a certain region it is assumed that reservoirs located within a common region are operated under a small number of representative operation schemes associated with similar climate and institutional constraints besides because reservoirs could be operated differently during different periods in response to changing operation conditions e g water availability conditions it is assumed that the operation of each reservoir can be represented by different operation schemes at different periods following these two assumptions an hm dt model is developed to determine a set of decision trees based on the historical operation records of reservoirs located in a specific region the hm dt model is extended from a typical hmm in a typical hmm bilmes 1998 each signal in a data sequence is assumed to be generated by a probabilistic model linked to an unobserved hidden state and the hidden states transit from one to another following a markov process to simulate the internal dependence over the sequence of signals through maximizing the likelihood of observing the data sequences the parameters for the markov process and the probabilistic models corresponding to each hidden state can be estimated the determined parameters can be further used to analyze the properties of the data such as inferring the physical meaning of each hidden state different from existing studies where the probabilistic models corresponding to each hidden state for generating signals are usually probability distributions bracken et al 2014 pender et al 2015 robertson et al 2004 in this study each hidden state is linked to a decision tree to represent the operation rules the decision trees linked to the hidden states represent the operation rules used under the corresponding hidden states which predict release decisions based on input variables the probability for observing a record each consisting of daily inflow storage and release under a hidden state is estimated by the error of the prediction of the decision tree associated with the hidden state each decision tree is referred to as an operation module or scheme in this study which represents one set of operation rules applicable under certain operation conditions that are identified as hidden states in the hm dt model in particular the hidden states may represent either time varying operation conditions e g different operation objectives or varying demand levels or particular reservoir specifications e g reservoirlocations that are not observed in data records but affect the operation decisions with this capability all operation modules are assumed to take inflow storage and water availability i e storage plus inflow as input variables in order to generalize the operation rules of different reservoirs into a consistent form and to reduce the efforts needed for collecting variables that are hard to be collected or evaluated such as the priorities of different operation objectives for multipurpose reservoirs mason et al 2018 all other variables that may affect release decisions are considered as hidden unobserved variables and handled as hidden states within the hm dt model for example fitting different hidden states to time periods with different operation objectives or reservoirs at different locations such as upstream and downstream reservoirs before training the hm dt model inflow storage and release of each historical operation record are normalized by the historical maximum storage of the reservoir during the study periods this preprocessing step is taken to ensure that the operation records of all reservoirs regardless of the size of reservoirs can be treated as independent samples the appropriateness of such scaling is validated through the validation process of this study where comparable predictive accuracy is obtained for the training and validation data sets with a limited number of representative operation modules besides since reservoir operations are assumed to follow a markov process the training data must be continuous as such if there is a missing data point the historical operation records of a reservoir are broken into continuous parts continuous records with a length longer than a certain length 100 in this study are kept and those not matching the required length are discarded since they cannot sufficiently capture the inherent dependencies of records over time for example if we have 500 daily operation records of a reservoir of which the 1st 50th 51st 300th and 301st 500th records are continuous in time but there are missing records between the 50th and the 51st and between the 300th and the 301st records the first 50 records will be discarded since the number of records is less than 100 the 51st 300th and the 301st 500th records will be treated as two independent continuous time series for the training after the preprocessing all continuous records are treated as independent sample sequences that will be used to train the hm dt model fig 1 provides an illustration of the proposed hm dt model where si is the hidden state associated with the i th record in a sequence d t s i is the decision tree associated with the hidden state si xi is a vector of observed independent variables of the i th record i e storage inflow and water availability yi and y i are the observed and estimated dependent variable i e release decision of the i th record and ε i and p e s i ϵ i are the error of the estimation corresponding to the i th record and the associated error probability respectively as shown in fig 1 in the proposed hm dt model the transition from one hidden state corresponding to an operation module to another is assumed to follow a markov process described by an initial probability vector pi and transition probability matrix pt pi is of length k the expected number of hidden states whose p th element provides the probability for a sample sequence to start from the hidden state p pt is a k k matrix whose pq th element provides the probability for the record with the hidden state p to be followed by a record with the hidden state q under each hidden state release decisions are made with a decision tree model that represents the corresponding operation module under the prescribed hm dt model the likelihood for the observed sequences are estimated as 1 l r 1 r s 1 s 2 s n r p s 1 s 2 s n r pi pt p y 1 y 2 y n r x 1 x 2 x n r s 1 s 2 s n r dt pe where l is the likelihood of the sample sequences under unknown parameters pi pt pe and dt r is the index of observed sequence r is the total number of observed sequences si is the hidden state of the i th record nr is the total number of records of the r th sequence dt is the set of decision trees to be estimated i e dt 1 dt 2 dtk pe is the set of error probabilities associated with the hidden states i e pe 1 pe 2 pek which are assumed to be gaussian p s 1 s 2 s n r p i p t is the probability of hidden sequence of s 1 s 2 s

observing the dependent variables i e y 1 y 2 y n r given the independent variables of each record the hidden state sequence and the set of decision trees and error probabilities which is calculated

record given hidden state si that is p e s i d t s i x i y i in order to estimate the parameters of the model including the pi pt pe and dt the likelihood l is to be maximized which is usually solved using the expectation maximization em algorithm widely used to tackle the computational complexity e g bilmes 1998 in the em algorithm an expectation step and a maximization step are executed iteratively until the likelihood no longer increases with further iterations see the supplemental information si i for more details in the expectation step of each iteration the model parameters determined in the last iteration denoted by θ n are used to determine the following posterior probabilities p s i r h p θ n which represents the posterior probability for the i th record in sequence r to be at hidden state hp estimated based on θ n i e θ n used as prior and p s i r h p s i 1 r h q θ n which represents the posterior probability for two consecutive record i and i 1 in sequence r to be at hidden state hp and hidden state hq respectively estimated based on θ n in the maximization step the parameter estimation is updated with the following equations 4 p t p q n 1 r 1 r i 1 n r 1 p s i r h p s i 1 r h q θ n r 1 r i 1 n r 1 p s i r h p θ n 5 p i p n 1 r 1 r p s 1 r h p θ n r where p t p q n 1 is the estimate for the pq th element of the transition probability matrix for the next iteration and p i p n 1 is the estimate for the p th element of the initial probability vector the optimal decision trees can be approximated by the decision trees trained with each record weighted by the posterior probability p s i r h p θ n details provided in the supplemental information si i and the parameters for the gaussian error distribution can be estimated as 6 μ p n 1 r 1 r i 1 n r p s i

sequence r with module p μ p n 1 is the estimated mean of the gaussian error distribution associated with hidden state p and σ p 2 n 1 is the estimated variance of the gaussian error distribution associated with hidden state p for use in the next iteration the likelihood is estimated in each iteration after the parameters are updated and the iteration stops when the likelihood no longer increases the above procedure is usually computationally complex especially for solving the posterior probabilities in the expectation step and efficient algorithms have been developed as detailed in rabiner 1989 since the em algorithm may end with local optimal solutions a number of random initializations 10 in this study are made and the one with the most increase in likelihood is adopted with the estimated parameters including the decision trees pt pi and pe the hidden sequences can be inferred as the hidden sequence that is most likely to occur under the given parameters details on algorithms to infer the hidden state sequences should be referred to rabiner 1989 3 results the proposed hm dt model is applied to 61 reservoirs see the supplemental information si ii for details of the data located in the upper colorado river basin operated by the us bureau of reclamation usbr the operation records of 50 reservoirs are used to train the model referred to as training data while the records of the remaining 11 reservoirs are used for validating the representativeness of the identified operation modules referred to as validation data in the following the determination of the model parameters is discussed first followed by discussions on the results i e decision trees including the temporal changing patterns of reservoir operation modules and predictive capability of the operation modules of the hm dt model finally three typical examples are illustrated in terms of the seasonality the long term non stationarity and the adaptation of operation rules for drought events 3 1 determination of the model hyperparameters the number of hidden states k and the minimum decrease in impurity in the decision tree itsmin are two important hyperparameters of the model that should be determined the number of hidden states determines the expected number of representative operation schemes the minimum decrease in impurity is used in decision trees to avoid node splits that gain only minimal increase in predictive accuracy thereby controlling the growth of a decision tree the best choice of the hyperparameter combination is determined by testing the model predictive accuracy over different combinations of k and itsmin the model predictive accuracy evaluated by the mean squared error mse for the training data 50 reservoirs and the validation data 11 reservoirs is plotted in fig 2 it is observed that mse for both training and validation data reduces with increasing k but the marginal improvement becomes smaller with a larger k as itsmin decreases the model performance improves for the training data while for the validation data the performances are comparable with itsmin 10 6 and 10 7 but reduce when itsmin is further reduced to 10 8 thus k is selected to be 8 following the elbow method usually used in clustering analysis itsmin 10 7 is selected as a control parameter to prevent overfitting of the decision tree 3 2 operation modules based on the 8 representative operation modules i e see supplemental information si iii for the decision trees representing each operation module three typical types of operation modules are identified including modules 0 and 3 representing the first type module 6 the second type and others the third type for the first type represented by modules 0 and 3 and the second type represented by module 6 inflow conditions are the primary information used for release decisions as shown in fig 3 under modules 0 and 3 belonging to the first type of schemes releases can be characterized as a piece wise function of inflow with each piece being horizontal or almost horizontal with a slightly increasing trend i e nearly constant release within each piece in particular taking the 45 degree line as a reference each horizontal piece usually originates from the 45 degree line when the inflow is relatively low and deviates from it when the inflow is relatively high under the second type of operation schemes represented by module 6 release is approximately identical to inflow as shown in fig 3c where the data points scatter along the 45 degree line the third type of operation scheme is characterized by a constant release modules 1 2 5 and 7 or a near constant release module 4 regardless of inflow and storage conditions as shown in table 1 to further understand the applicability of each operation module to different conditions the statistics of inflow and storage conditions under each of the modules the transition probability matrix as well as the monthly frequency of the application of the operation modules are discussed as below the statistics of inflow and storage conditions under each of the operation modules are summarized in table 2 providing the mean μ and standard deviation σ of inflow and storage as well as the mean value of storage change δs between two consecutive days table 3 provides the transition probability matrix of the hm dt model where each cell in the table is the probability for a hidden state to transit from one to another the temporal distributions of the determined operation modules over months are plotted in fig 4 fig 4 shows that modules 3 4 and 6 are usually applied to the summer months corresponding to the high flow periods hutchins water center at cmu 2020 while all other modules are usually applied during the winter months which correspond to the low flow periods for modules 3 4 and 6 as shown in table 2 storage decreases on average with modules 3 and 6 and storage increases on average with module 4 by further examining the optimal transition matrix obtained from the hm dt model table 3 it is observed that among these three modules module 3 and 6 are usually applied after one of the 3 modules i e 3 4 and 6 and only module 4 is likely to have transitions from another module that is applied during low flow periods this indicates that among all three modules applied to high flow periods it is more likely for module 4 to be applied at the beginning of the high flow periods as can be seen in table 2 among these three modules module 4 is associated with the lowest storage lowest release and positive storage change on average this infers that module 4 is likely to be used for a period to build up storage i e the beginning of high flow season for water supply and power generation furthermore by examining the rows associated with these three modules i e 3 4 and 6 which show probabilities for the hidden states to transit from these three modules to other modules one can see that module 3 is likely to be followed by either module 4 or module 6 module 4 is likely to be followed by either module 3 or 5 and module 6 is likely to be followed by module 3 that again shows that only module 4 is likely to be followed by a module applicable to low flow periods indicating module 4 is the only one among modules 3 4 and 6 that is applicable at the end of a high flow period for building up storage besides it can also be inferred from the above observation on the transition matrix and the statistics shown in table 2 that during a high flow period module 4 is usually first applied to build up storage followed by module 3 for a pre release period for flood control when storage has already been built up and inflow has been moderately increased as shown in table 2 the inflow and storage associated with module 3 is slightly higher than those with module 4 and the average storage change is negative under module 3 module 3 will be further transitioned into module 6 when flood peaks approach as shown in table 2 inflow and storage under module 6 are significantly higher than those under other modules after a flood peak module 3 is used after module 6 to further reduce storage which is also usually associated with relatively large release that can potentially be used for water supply and power generation then module 4 is applied with a purpose of building up storage for water conservation before low flow periods begin among all modules that are applicable during low flow periods modules 0 1 2 5 and 7 as discussed above module 5 is the only one that links with modules applied to high flow periods i e either transitioning from module 5 to 4 before high flow periods or vice versa module 5 is associated with the highest inflow and release and the second highest positive storage change among these five modules applied to low flow periods these observations infer that module 5 is applied immediately before and after high flow seasons for building up storage and also making release to satisfy water demand during periods with relatively high inflow similarly it can be inferred from the transition matrix shown in table 3 and statistics shown in table 2 that module 0 is most likely used before module 5 prior to a high flow season or after module 5 after a high flow season for keeping storage at a relatively constant level with a slightly increasing trend other three modules i e modules 1 2 and 7 remain persistent to themselves for a relatively long time period considering the stable but relatively low release and inflow and positive storage changes underlying modules 1 2 and 7 it is more likely that these modules are applied to low flow periods with low water demand during which storage is carried over for future uses irrigation water supply and hydropower generation 3 3 predictive performance of the operation modules to better evaluate the performance of hm dt the performance of the operation modules determined by the hm dt model is explored and compared with that of decision trees rokach and maimon 2005 implemented with the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 which is a traditional application of machine learning models for reservoir operation simulation e g kumar et al 2013 and yang et al 2016 in particular for each reservoir in the training and validation data sets a decision tree is derived based on the entire historical operation records of the reservoir where the hyperparameter itsmin is determined by a 5 fold cross validation to ensure the best performance of the dts the error statistics are determined and the operation modules of the hm dt and the dts derived for individual reservoirs are compared across different hidden states fig 5 and individual reservoirs fig 6 the statistics of the predictive errors of the modules of hm dt with the training and validation data sets are plotted in fig 5a and b respectively it is observed that the hm dt model with the selected parameters have acceptable and comparable performance for the training and validation data sets this further validates the appropriateness of the assumption of limited number of operation schemes and the selected model hyperparameters in particular modules that are applied to low flow periods i e modules 0 1 2 5 and 7 show better performance compared to those that are applied to high flow periods i e modules 3 4 and 6 this can be largely attributed to the relatively large amount of inflow and release during the high flow periods which results in relatively large absolute errors for comparison predictive errors of dts determined for individual reservoirs for predicting releases under each hidden state are determined as plotted in fig 5c and d compared to the error statistics of the dts the operation modules derived based on the hm dt model can effectively reduce the prediction bias especially for those with high flow periods in particular dts usually underestimate the release decisions under the hidden states which usually occur during high flow periods i e hidden states 3 4 and 6 and overestimate the release decisions under hidden states during low flow periods in contrast the hm dt model can significantly reduce such bias through identifying hidden states and fitting different modules for each of the hidden states in addition fig 6 plots the statistics of the predictive errors of dts and the hm dt model for the 50 reservoirs in the training data set fig 6a and 11 reservoirs in the validation data set fig 6b the operation of reservoirs usually involves multiple hidden states and the prediction errors of dts can be either positively or negatively biased under different hidden states as shown in fig 5 which results in more scattered prediction errors with dts in fig 6 as a result for all reservoirs in the two data sets the hm dt model achieves comparable or better predictive performance than the dts that are determined for individual reservoirs this confirms the capability of the hm dt model for simulating reservoir operation behaviors with a small number of representative operation modules 3 4 dynamic operation patterns reservoir operation changes over time in response to different water availability conditions changing water demands and competing operational objectives this is particularly important as reservoir managers attempt to adapt operations in response to non stationary hydrological conditions conway and mahé 2009 the hm dt model is able to reveal the time varying characteristics of reservoir operation such as the seasonality e g fig 7 the long term non stationarity e g fig 8 and the adaptation of operation schemes for drought events e g fig 9 which are illustrated in the following with silver jack reservoir moon lake and fontenelle reservoir as some typical examples the silver jack reservoir located in gunnison county colorado has a primary purpose of irrigation and recreation as part of the bostwick park project strong seasonality on the historical operation is shown in fig 7 where operation modules 4 and 5 are primarily applied to the low flow season for building up storage and satisfying non agricultural water demands while modules 3 and 6 are applied to the high flow season for supplying irrigation water and flooding control the seasonality can be observed in the historical operation records of most reservoirs considered in this study in addition to seasonality clear long term non stationarity of reservoir operation is also observed which is demonstrated with the moon lake reservoir as an example the reservoir is part of the moon lake project located on the west fork of the lake fork river with a primary operational purpose of irrigation as shown in fig 8 the operation schemes applied to the low flow periods have been shifted from module 7 during the early years 1995 2006 to module 2 shortly during a transitional period 2007 2013 and finally to module 1 during recent years after 2014 with these modules in different periods the reservoir release is nearly constant in each period regardless of inflow and storage conditions but with an increase in the amount of release crossing these periods i e the releases under modules 7 2 and 1 are 3 61 10 6 0 00016553 and 0 0005228 respectively such transitions of operation schemes may reflect an increasing non agricultural water demands during the low flow season in the area that the reservoir serves reservoir operators adapt operation behaviors in response to drought events in order to mitigate the drought damage hejazi and cai 2011 this can be seen from the operation history of the fontenelle reservoir located in southwest wyoming with a primary purpose of water supply and secondary purpose of hydropower generation fish and wildlife and recreation palmer drought severity index pdsi a widely used drought index alley 1984 is also plotted in fig 9 as can be seen modules 3 and 6 are alternatively used in high flow and low flow seasons during years under normal water supply condition moderate or high pdsi while module 4 fits to years with limited water supply low pdsi such adaptation during drought events reduces unnecessary release otherwise resulting from modules 3 and 6 and subsequently improves water conservation 4 discussions the hm dt model derives a set of representative operation modules based on real world operation records that reflect the short term and long term changes in reservoir operation the identified patterns can be used to analyze real world reservoir operation behaviors especially for retrospective analysis of historical operations in order to make possible improvements for future operations of a particular reservoir or one type of reservoirs moreover the hm dt model can be used to enhance hydrologic simulation models by adding a more realistic reservoir operation component based on historical operation records it can also be used to derive ready to use optimal operation rules to replace a complex optimization model bessler et al 2003 deka and chandramouli 2009 kumar et al 2013 raman and chandramouli 1996 it is worthy of noting that the novelty of this study lies in the hd dt model specifically the capability to simulate dynamic operations which improves the predictive accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning methods as shown in figs 5 and 6 and the suitability of the derived operation modules for reservoirs without historical records however this study is not to develop a data based model for any specific reservoirs as most data mining studies did although the model can be used in the way it does not intend to replace any detailed physically based simulation or optimization models developed for particular reservoirs either before discussing the applications of the hm dt some key assumptions of the hm dt on the representativeness of the derived operation modules are further justified 4 1 about some key assumptions of the hm dt in developing the hm dt and deriving the representative operation modules it was assumed that all the reservoirs are subject to the same climate conditions similar operation functions e g mainly for irrigation water supply in the upper colorado basin and institutional regulations inappropriately applying the operation modules may result in predicted releases that are deviated far away from the actual releases e g apparently different set of operation rules should be adopted by water supply reservoirs and run of the river hydropower stations for the simulation of operations of reservoirs in different regions of different types or for future operations which will experience systematic changes that are not observed in the history a new set of operation modules and associated patterns should be derived with the hm dt model which could be finished within reasonable time using the tool presented in this study however questions such as what the extent boundary of such a region is and which and how many reservoirs should be included in the modeling are non trivial in the demonstration case of the upper colorado basin these questions are examined using the validation procedures for hm dt result validation the model performances in predicting the release of reservoirs are compared between the training data set and the validation data set since the reservoirs used for the validation are chosen randomly the validation acceptance qualifies the applicability of the derived operation modules to reservoirs that are located in the same region but are not included in the training phase future work may conduct sensitivity analysis to different sets of reservoirs at the training stage to examine the robustness of the derived operation modules nevertheless more established criteria for the identification of study region should be addressed in future studies synthesis on model performance and derived operation modules across different regions with different sizes and or different climates will help establish criteria in determining the spatial extent for deriving representative operation modules theoretically when applied to relatively small regions in which all or most reservoirs are operated under a similar set of operation schemes the hm dt model will result in a small set of operation modules however the hm dt can also be applied to a large region that has reservoirs with heterogeneous operation behaviors in this case the hm dt model is capable of handling heterogeneous operation behaviors by fitting different sets of hidden states to different types of reservoirs which will result in a relatively large set of operation modules the application of the determined operation modules to simulate the operation behaviors of different types of reservoirs subject to different climate and institutional conditions is theoretically doable especially through clarification of the modules based on their spatial and temporal distributions however under this case the validation will be challenging and the data set used for validation should be carefully selected to include sufficient number of reservoirs so that each operation module could be fully tested with the validation data set in addition to spatial region constraints the applicability of the derived operation modules is also limited by other factors such as types of reservoirs and operating agencies for example reservoirs included in this study are operated by the usbr with a primary function of water supply for irrigation and secondary function of power generation flood control and recreation thus it is most appropriate to apply the derived operation modules to the reservoirs operated by the same agency with similar functions indeed reservoirs with different major functions may operate differently to meet their particular operation objectives for example reservoirs with a primary function of water supply for irrigation such as those in this study usually build up storage during winter periods and release to demands during summer periods while those for hydropower generation may build up their storage as much as possible in order to generate more electrical energy and those afterbay reservoirs and run of the river hydropower generation stations may keep a constant storage throughout a year this also indicates instead of deriving representative operation rules for reservoirs located in a common region it is also worth trying to derive representative operation modules for reservoirs operated by the same operation agencies and or with similar reservoir functions this study did not explicitly consider the upstream downstream relationships of reservoirs within the same river system theoretically typical behaviors of upstream and downstream reservoirs can be captured by the hm dt model through fitting a special set of hidden states and correspondingly operation modules to both upstream and downstream reservoirs which represent the frequent patterns of operations rules that reflect the upstream and downstream relationships in particular two special modules a and b can be identified simultaneously from an upstream and a downstream reservoir respectively reflecting the hydrological connection between the two reservoirs alternatively the hm dt can also explicitly simulate reservoir systems in which reservoirs are operated dependently to do that the upstream downstream or output input relationships must be prescribed as inputs to the hm dt model however this can be challenging since it requires full knowledge on the cooperation scheme of the jointly operated reservoirs in addition inconsistent form of rules may end with different reservoirs i e jointly operated reservoirs and reservoirs operated independently causing difficulties in deriving representative operation modules thus in this study individual reservoirs are treated independently so that the operation rules for all reservoirs can be generalized into a consistent form for the specific purpose of this study as stated above moreover the hm dt model can be used to develop decision trees for a reservoir system as a whole in which all reservoirs are operated dependently the decision trees will be derived to determine releases of all reservoirs with inflow to the reservoir system and storage levels of all reservoirs in the system as inputs this can end with a more complex model which should be resolved by model reduction monshizadeh et al 2014 or regularization schmidt et al 2007 techniques 4 2 understanding real world operation patterns to improve future operations in real world reservoir operations the operation policies should be regularly updated to improve non optimal operations better satisfy evolving water management needs and take advantage of modeling and forecasting skill advances usbr 2001 as an example the historical operation patterns identified by the hm dt model can help realize the updates by providing reservoir operators a systematic view of the historical operations and directions for future improvement in the following the operation of lake powell is provided as an example the inflow storage and release time series are plotted along with the pdsi of the area where lake powell locates utah state in fig 10 with identified modules corresponding to hidden states marked by colors as can be seen with the pdsi values several consecutive drought events occurred in the region starting late 1990s causing significant reduction in storage during 2011 a year in between two drought events hm dt identifies an operation module resulting in high releases which aggravated storage reduction in the following periods as a result of the continuous drought the hydropower generation one of the major functions of lake power decreased seriously to deal with this problem a historically low release was made in 2014 since the filling of lake powell in the 1960s which in turn caused an eight foot level decline of downstream lake mead iams and davis 2013 the occurrences described above showed that the operation in 2011 with high release could have been modified with a better hedging policy you and cai 2008 if the operators had considered more about the drought events coming after that time and put a higher priority to future water use risk this situation can be improved in the future given the advances of long range climate forecasts enhanced operators capability to use the forecasts for risk management and institutional adoptions to reservoir operation regulations to deal with extreme events 4 3 developing a reservoir component for watershed hydrologic models these patterns and characterizations of dynamic real world reservoir operation behaviors can also be used to improve water system simulation or optimization models as demonstrated by wu et al 2020 and hejazi and cai 2011 following previous efforts this section illustrates a plan to provide a generic reservoir operation model for hydrological models based on the operation modules derived in this study as shown in fig 11 the representativeness of the derived modules would allow the developed model to be applicable to any reservoir in the study region and the consistent representative form of the modules would enable the model to have a uniform interface to receive inputs from any reservoirs in the study region to apply the derived operation rules in a hydrological simulation model the hidden state sequence should be determined first which provides the periods that each operation module applies for historical periods with necessary data available for inferring the hidden states the hidden state sequence can be determined through decoding the hidden states based on observed operation records otherwise if the hidden state sequence cannot be directly determined based on operation records the hidden state sequence can be determined using the characterizations of each module for example the time distribution characteristics and the statistics of inflow and storage conditions provided in the result section can help users infer the most possible hidden states for historical periods without observed data or for future periods in addition the derived typical patterns in response to a certain event can also be applied to derive the hidden state sequence such as the pattern of the sequence of modules used in response to a flood event or a drought event as discussed before with the hidden state sequence provided the hydrological simulation model will interact with the reservoir operation component at a daily or longer time step as shown in fig 11 based on the received information from the hydrologic model such as time period inflow storage and water availability the reservoir operation component will determine the operation module to apply which is essentially a set of if then rules derived from the decision trees in turn a release decision will be sent back to the hydrological simulation model and so on to the next modeling time period 4 4 developing a surrogate for complex optimization models the proposed hm dt model can also be used to develop a surrogate for complex optimization models so as to provide ready to use optimal operation rules optimization models with perfect inflow forecast usually require a full set of input data such as inflow and demand over the entire study period to determine the optimal release decisions at all time periods this is not practical for real world reservoir operation decision making since in practice only limited information such as storage and inflow at the current and past time periods and inflow forecasts with limited lead time are available for making release decision at the current time period to resolve this issue machine learning models such as fuzzy logic models and artificial neural networks are used to derive optimal operation rules bessler et al 2003 deka and chandramouli 2009 kumar et al 2013 raman and chandramouli 1996 the input and state variables at the current time period are used as independent input variables and optimal operation decisions i e release decisions as dependent target variable s however as discussed before the direct application of these machine learning approaches to the entire study period results in the neglection of dynamic changes of the optimal operation decisions responding to changing operation conditions using the proposed hm dt model more adaptive operation rules can be obtained specifically optimal release decisions are first determined by an optimization model given historical or projected inflow scenarios then the hm dt model can be applied to the sample sequences of inflow storage and optimal release decisions to determine the optimal operation rules where the optimal release decisions at each time period are treated as dependent variables and the corresponding inflow and storage at the same time period as independent variables the derived decision trees will provide the optimal operation rules and the applicability of each decision tree under different operation conditions can be inferred following the analysis in this study 4 5 comparisons with other studies and actual operation policies in use this study is built on the top of a number of existing studies that used machine learning techniques for either understanding real world reservoir operation rules e g hejazi et al 2008 hejazi and cai 2009 and giuliani and herman 2018 or deriving black box machine learning models for simulating real world operation decisions e g shrestha et al 1996 corani et al 2009 yang et al 2016 and coerver et al 2018 combining the hidden markov model with a traditional machine learning approach i e decision trees as presented in this study effectively addresses both these aspects in particular this study provides a systematic view of real world reservoir operations through identifying representative operation modules and dynamic operation patterns that characterize the transitions between the modules as a data based simulation the hm dt model provides two fold improvements compared to existing studies 1 higher accuracy for predicting release decisions as shown in figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed to the capability of the model to simulate the dynamic operation behaviors and thus reduce prediction bias especially for periods with high inflow 2 the operation modules can be applied to simulating the operation behaviors of reservoirs of the same type that are not included in the training stage of the hm dt which allows the application of the hm dt modules to reservoirs without sufficient observation data both discrepancies and consistencies can be observed when comparing the derived operation modules with the operation rules used for the reservoirs operated by the usbr for the derived operation modules the decision mechanism is simplified by using inflow as the primary factor to decide releases in high flow periods and making relatively constant releases regardless of inflow and storage levels in low flow periods however the real world operation rules are usually subject to more complicated considerations for example for small reservoirs such as those upstream of lake powell the reservoirs have been operated to meet the monthly storage targets or the downstream demands whichever is greater subject to additional constraints such as minimum and maximum releases usbr 2001 for larger reservoirs such as lake powell flaming gorge blue mesa and navajo even more complex decision mechanisms might be adopted for example storage rules could be dynamically updated considering imperfect inflow forecasts usbr 2001 ecosystem services are taken into account e g the operation of flaming gorge dam in spring is set to release following the presence of larval razorback sucker downstream usbr 2020 upstream reservoir operation policies are used to forecast downstream reservoir inflow conditions e g the rules of fontenelle reservoir are used by flaming gorge usbr 2020 in addition multiple operation rules with different priorities are sometimes taken into account due to competing interests of multiple stakeholders e g on top of regular storage rules lake powell is also operated to follow a minimum required release rule that ensures downstream benefits a 602 a storage requirement that ensures the upstream benefits and an equalization rule that balances the upstream and downstream storages usbr 2001 despite of the discrepancies the consistencies between the derived operation modules and the operation rules actually in use lie with the capability of the derived operation modules to represent the daily operation rules to achieve the real world storage rules in particular for many reservoirs the actual rule curves specify the target storage levels at a monthly or even coarser time scale e g monthly storage targets or flood control storage space requirements during the flooding season and either human heuristics or some other sophisticated procedures must be used to determine daily operations specifically both the storage target levels usbr 2001 and the operation modules show strong seasonal patterns with a clear annual cycle of the storage target levels which usually peak at the beginning or in the middle of the high flow season usbr 2001 correspondingly the derived operation modules demonstrate strong seasonality too i e modules 3 4 and 6 for the high flow season and others for low flow seasons thus although the storage target levels set by usbr are not explicitly represented in the operation modules they are reflected by the seasonal delineation of the modules within which the daily operations which play a role in achieving the storage targets are significantly captured specifically due to the occurrences of extraordinarily high inflow the linear and piece wise constant release modules i e modules 3 and 6 are fitted to high flow seasons so that excessive inflow can be appropriately discharged to maintain storage below a certain level for coming floods for low flow season operations the hm dt model results in a relatively constant release to meet the minimum release requirements while building up storage toward the storage targets before the next high flow season which reflects the operations during low flow seasons such as those adopted by usbr during august december for the operation of flaming gorge reservoir usbr 2020 in addition the operation modules can be derived using publicly available historical operation records the representative modules can be derived to operate on any desired temporal resolutions based on received designated inputs for release decisions in particular the derived generic rules and dynamic transition mechanisms make it possible to add a realistic reservoir component to hydrological simulation models which will overcome the practical difficulties in acquiring real world rules from numerous operating agencies matching different temporal resolutions of the operation policies and the physical processes in a hydrological simulation model 5 conclusions in this study an hm dt model is developed to derive representative reservoir operation modules along with the dynamic operation patterns based on historical operation records it is shown that the dynamic feature of reservoir operations which is usually ignored in previous studies can be pinpointed by the hm dt model through modeling the transitions between the operation schemes over time the proposed model is applied to 50 reservoirs in the upper colorado river basin with 11 more reservoirs in the same region for validation and 8 operation modules in the form of decision trees are obtained the operation modules are classified into three types i e modules with an almost constant release regardless of inflow storage and water availability modules with release identical to inflow modules with a piece wise constant relationship between inflow and release comparable model performance is observed between the training and validation data indicating the representativeness of the modules derived by the hm dt model through combining hidden markov models with decision trees this study is able to derive a limited number of representative reservoir operation modules for all reservoirs in a particular region under the various operation conditions i e inflow storage as well as unknown factors and the transitions between operation schemes the dynamic change of operation rules that reflect the impacts of seasonality long term non stationarity and extreme events on reservoir operation in particular through fitting different operation modules to different historical time periods the derived operation modules could achieve better accuracy in predicting release decisions compared to decision trees a typical traditional machine learning approach as shown in figs 5 and 6 the representativeness of the derived modules allows the application of the derived modules to any reservoirs in the same region which consequently enables a unique application for developing a generic reservoir operation simulation model the applications of the resulted reservoir operation rules and identified historical reservoir operation patterns include better understanding the real world reservoir operation behaviors retrospectively analyzing historical operation activities in order to make possible improvements for future operations as well as developing a realistic reservoir operation component for use in hydrological and water resources system modeling in addition the proposed method can also be applied to derive optimal operation rules based on optimal operation decisions determined with optimization models future research directions include testing different types of machine learning models to be combined with hidden markov models such as neural networks and developing effective methods for inferring hidden states for reservoirs not observed during the training phase besides in future studies ready to use reservoir operation modeling components are to be developed using the proposed hm dt model for other regions and to be incorporated into general hydrological simulation models as discussed in this paper finally the operation modules for different regions operation objectives or operating agencies can be derived and compared to better understand their similarities and differences credit authorship contribution statement qiankun zhao conceptualization methodology

373,reservoirs have been widely used to regulate streamflow to meet both human and natural water requirements this study applies a hidden markov decision tree hm dt model to derive representative reservoir operation modules under various operation conditions i e inflow storage as well as unknown factors and their transitions the dynamic change of operation rules that reflect the impacts of seasonality long term non stationarity and extreme events on reservoir operation the representative operation modules can be applied to reservoirs in the same region that are not observed the capability for simulating dynamic operation behaviors improves the predictive accuracy as compared to regular decision trees using a number of reservoirs located in the same region for training the hm dt model can derive a limited number of representative operation modules in the form of decision trees dt and the transitions between different operation schemes in response to changing operation conditions the application of the hm dt model is demonstrated through a case study of the upper colorado river basin where eight representative operation modules are determined for 50 reservoirs located in the region and the modules are validated with 11 reservoirs in the same region the eight operation modules are classified into three types i e nearly constant release release as a piece wise function of inflow and release almost identical to inflow the identified operation modules and the transition patterns between operation modules can be used to better understand real world operation behaviors improve future operations and build realistic reservoir operation components in basin scale hydrological models 1 introduction with widely and long term construction of reservoirs around the world reservoir operations satisfy human water use purposes simonovic 1992 such as water supply irrigation hydropower generation flooding control and recreation meanwhile streamflow has been widely and extensively altered by reservoir construction and operation over time biemans et al 2011 nilsson et al 2005 it is imperative to provide better support for reservoir operations both through developing more realistic optimization models hejazi and cai 2011 and through better understanding the impacts of reservoirs on natural and human systems wu et al 2020 one special need is to incorporate realistic reservoir operation components into the modeling of large scale hydrological and water resources systems that are generally recognized as coupled hydrological human systems where flow regulation via storage represents one of the primary human interferences to natural hydrological systems sivapalan et al 2012 vogel et al 2015 wu et al 2020 a realistic reservoir component for a hydrological model will improve the model performance and enable researchers to better identify the impacts of reservoir operations on hydrological processes and to provide improved scientific information for water resources management decision making the purpose of this paper is to introduce a new data mining model namely the hidden markov decision tree model hm dt that can be used to derive a limited number of representative operation modules for a group of reservoirs that are subject to similar climate conditions operation functions and institutional regulations using historical data the model results i e the representative reservoir operation modules along with the identified historical operation patterns can be used to understand the real world reservoir operation behaviors based on a systematic view of the real world operations retrospectively analyze historical operation activities in order to build more realistic optimization models hejazi and cai 2011 and enable operators to identify non optimal operations and potential future improvements specially a unique application of the derived operation modules allows the development of a generic reservoir operation model built on the identified representative operation rules which will be applicable to any reservoir in the study basin region such a model is timely needed to improve existing large scale basin or regional hydrological models by adding a computationally tractable reservoir component that simulates real world operations under the various inflow conditions as well as human responses existing studies followed regular supervised machine learning ml procedures to extract realistic reservoir operation rules based on historical records in those studies reservoir releases are treated as the target variables and the information available to operators for making release decisions such as inflow forecast and storage are considered as independent variables e g shrestha et al 1996 corani et al 2009 yang et al 2016 coerver et al 2018 in particular yang et al 2016 adopted decision trees for simulating the operation of nine major reservoirs in california though these studies were able to reproduce historical reservoir release decisions with acceptable accuracy the procedures used can only be applied to derive static operation rules for a specific reservoir based on its records from the entire study period that is to say the change of operation rules in response to changing operation conditions such as changing climate conditions water demands and operation objectives during the study period cannot be simulated moreover the operation rules are site specific and hard to be extended to other reservoirs meanwhile other studies did not directly extract operation rules from historical records of reservoir operation but derived some useful information to help better understand the real world reservoir operation behaviors and or build improved optimization models for reservoir operation e g hejazi et al 2008 hejazi and cai 2009 and giuliani and herman 2018 hejazi et al 2008 used mutual information to assess the relevance of different hydrological indicators to reservoir release decisions and identified the most relevant factors for 79 reservoirs in california and the great plains the identified factors were then related to properties of the reservoirs such as the location and reservoir size to understand the impacts of these factors on operation behaviors hejazi and cai 2009 developed an input variable selection method which was applied to 22 reservoirs in california to select input variables from 121 potential input hydrological indicators to model the daily release decisions giuliani and herman 2018 extracted the behavior profiles of 172 reservoirs in california using eigen behavior analysis and identified four typical profiles through clustering analysis which were related to the characteristics of the reservoirs such as elevation and capacity these studies are able to derive behavioral characteristics that are generic to a certain type of reservoirs through post processing such as clustering giuliani and herman 2018 in this study we propose a hidden markov decision tree hm dt model to derive a limited number of representative operation modules for reservoirs located in a particular region that are subject to similar climate conditions operation functions and institutional regulations using historical data hidden markov model hmm has been widely used for text mining andrews and vigliocco 2010 dna sequence modeling henderson et al 1997 and speech recognition varga and moore 1990 hmms have also been applied to hydrology and water resources problems such as identifying patterns in daily streamflow pender et al 2015 multidecadal streamflow bracken et al 2014 meteorological droughts khadr 2016 and daily rainfall robertson et al 2004 following existing studies the hidden markov model is applied to recognizing patterns in reservoir operation records with special focus on the transitions of operation schemes over time and the determination of representative reservoir operation rules represented in the form of decision trees the special structure of the hm dt model enables the identification of dynamic operation patterns which will provide two folded benefits compared to existing machine learning studies in the literature i e 1 improved predictive accuracy based on the simulation of the dynamics in reservoir operations and 2 the applicability of the derived representative operation modules to reservoirs without historical records in particular it is assumed that there exist a limited number of representative reservoir operation schemes each represented in the form of decision trees and used under certain operation conditions and the transitions between hidden states are described by a markov process that simulates the transitions of operation schemes over time in addition time series of historical operation records each consisting of inflow storage and release records of different reservoirs are treated as independent observations generated by the same set of operation schemes in this way representative reservoir operation rules are to be determined which can be applied to unobserved reservoirs in the same region the representativeness of the resulted operation schemes will be validated through testing the model performance with reservoirs that are not included in the training process in the rest of this paper the hm dt model developed in this study is introduced first followed by an example of application of the proposed hm dt model to 50 reservoirs and another 11 reservoirs for validation located in the upper colorado basin based on the results discussions on the potential applications of the identified operation rules are provided and conclusions are made 2 methods to determine representative reservoir operation rules applicable to reservoirs located in a certain region it is assumed that reservoirs located within a common region are operated under a small number of representative operation schemes associated with similar climate and institutional constraints besides because reservoirs could be operated differently during different periods in response to changing operation conditions e g water availability conditions it is assumed that the operation of each reservoir can be represented by different operation schemes at different periods following these two assumptions an hm dt model is developed to determine a set of decision trees based on the historical operation records of reservoirs located in a specific region the hm dt model is extended from a typical hmm in a typical hmm bilmes 1998 each signal in a data sequence is assumed to be generated by a probabilistic model linked to an unobserved hidden state and the hidden states transit from one to another following a markov process to simulate the internal dependence over the sequence of signals through maximizing the likelihood of observing the data sequences the parameters for the markov process and the probabilistic models corresponding to each hidden state can be estimated the determined parameters can be further used to analyze the properties of the data such as inferring the physical meaning of each hidden state different from existing studies where the probabilistic models corresponding to each hidden state for generating signals are usually probability distributions bracken et al 2014 pender et al 2015 robertson et al 2004 in this study each hidden state is linked to a decision tree to represent the operation rules the decision trees linked to the hidden states represent the operation rules used under the corresponding hidden states which predict release decisions based on input variables the probability for observing a record each consisting of daily inflow storage and release under a hidden state is estimated by the error of the prediction of the decision tree associated with the hidden state each decision tree is referred to as an operation module or scheme in this study which represents one set of operation rules applicable under certain operation conditions that are identified as hidden states in the hm dt model in particular the hidden states may represent either time varying operation conditions e g different operation objectives or varying demand levels or particular reservoir specifications e g reservoirlocations that are not observed in data records but affect the operation decisions with this capability all operation modules are assumed to take inflow storage and water availability i e storage plus inflow as input variables in order to generalize the operation rules of different reservoirs into a consistent form and to reduce the efforts needed for collecting variables that are hard to be collected or evaluated such as the priorities of different operation objectives for multipurpose reservoirs mason et al 2018 all other variables that may affect release decisions are considered as hidden unobserved variables and handled as hidden states within the hm dt model for example fitting different hidden states to time periods with different operation objectives or reservoirs at different locations such as upstream and downstream reservoirs before training the hm dt model inflow storage and release of each historical operation record are normalized by the historical maximum storage of the reservoir during the study periods this preprocessing step is taken to ensure that the operation records of all reservoirs regardless of the size of reservoirs can be treated as independent samples the appropriateness of such scaling is validated through the validation process of this study where comparable predictive accuracy is obtained for the training and validation data sets with a limited number of representative operation modules besides since reservoir operations are assumed to follow a markov process the training data must be continuous as such if there is a missing data point the historical operation records of a reservoir are broken into continuous parts continuous records with a length longer than a certain length 100 in this study are kept and those not matching the required length are discarded since they cannot sufficiently capture the inherent dependencies of records over time for example if we have 500 daily operation records of a reservoir of which the 1st 50th 51st 300th and 301st 500th records are continuous in time but there are missing records between the 50th and the 51st and between the 300th and the 301st records the first 50 records will be discarded since the number of records is less than 100 the 51st 300th and the 301st 500th records will be treated as two independent continuous time series for the training after the preprocessing all continuous records are treated as independent sample sequences that will be used to train the hm dt model fig 1 provides an illustration of the proposed hm dt model where si is the hidden state associated with the i th record in a sequence d t s i is the decision tree

a k k matrix whose pq th element provides the probability for the record with the hidden state p to be followed by a record with the hidden state q under each hidden state release decisions are made

record given hidden state si that is p e s i d t s i x i y i in order to estimate the parameters of the model including the pi pt pe and dt the likelihood l is to be maximized which is usually solved using the expectation maximization em algorithm widely used to tackle the computational complexity e g bilmes 1998 in the em algorithm an expectation step and a maximization step are executed iteratively until the likelihood no longer increases with further iterations see the supplemental information si i for more details in the expectation step of each iteration the model parameters determined in the last iteration denoted by θ n are used to determine the following posterior probabilities p s i r h p θ n which represents the posterior probability for the i th record in sequence r to be at hidden state hp estimated based on θ n i e θ n used as prior and p s i r h p s i 1 r h q θ n which represents the posterior probability for two consecutive record i and i 1 in sequence r to be at hidden state hp and hidden state hq respectively estimated based on θ n in the maximization step the parameter estimation is updated with the following equations 4 p t p q n 1 r 1 r i 1 n r 1 p

associated with hidden state p for use in the next iteration the likelihood is estimated in each iteration after the parameters are updated and the iteration stops when the likelihood no longer increases the above procedure is usually computationally complex especially for solving the posterior probabilities in the expectation step and efficient algorithms have been developed as detailed in rabiner 1989 since the em algorithm may end with local optimal solutions a number of random initializations 10 in this study are made and the one with the most increase in likelihood is adopted with the estimated parameters including the decision trees pt pi and pe the hidden sequences can be inferred as the hidden sequence that is most likely to occur under the given parameters details on algorithms to infer the hidden state sequences should be referred to rabiner 1989 3 results the proposed hm dt model is applied to 61 reservoirs see the supplemental information si ii for details of the data located in the upper colorado river basin operated by the us bureau of reclamation usbr the operation records of 50 reservoirs are used to train the model referred to as training data while the records of the remaining 11 reservoirs are used for validating the representativeness of the identified operation modules referred to as validation data in the following the determination of the model parameters is discussed first followed by discussions on the results i e decision trees including the temporal changing patterns of reservoir operation modules and predictive capability of the operation modules of the hm dt model finally three typical examples are illustrated in terms of the seasonality the long term non stationarity and the adaptation of operation rules for drought events 3 1 determination of the model hyperparameters the number of hidden states k and the minimum decrease in impurity in the decision tree itsmin are two important hyperparameters of the model that should be determined the number of hidden states determines the expected number of representative operation schemes the minimum decrease in impurity is used in decision trees to avoid node splits that gain only minimal increase in predictive accuracy thereby controlling the growth of a decision tree the best choice of the hyperparameter combination is determined by testing the model predictive accuracy over different combinations of k and itsmin the model predictive accuracy evaluated by the mean squared error mse for the training data 50 reservoirs and the validation data 11 reservoirs is plotted in fig 2 it is observed that mse for both training and validation data reduces with increasing k but the marginal improvement becomes smaller with a larger k as itsmin decreases the model performance improves for the training data while for the validation data the performances are comparable with itsmin 10 6 and 10 7 but reduce when itsmin is further reduced to 10 8 thus k is selected to be 8 following the elbow method usually used in clustering analysis itsmin 10 7 is selected as a control parameter to prevent overfitting of the decision tree 3 2 operation modules based on the 8 representative operation modules i e see supplemental information si iii for the decision trees representing each operation module three typical types of operation modules are identified including modules 0 and 3 representing the first type module 6 the second type and others the third type for the first type represented by modules 0 and 3 and the second type represented by module 6 inflow conditions are the primary information used for release decisions as shown in fig 3 under modules 0 and 3 belonging to the first type of schemes releases can be characterized as a piece wise function of inflow with each piece being horizontal or almost horizontal with a slightly increasing trend i e nearly constant release within each piece in particular taking the 45 degree line as a reference each horizontal piece usually originates from the 45 degree line when the inflow is relatively low and deviates from it when the inflow is relatively high under the second type of operation schemes represented by module 6 release is approximately identical to inflow as shown in fig 3c where the data points scatter along the 45 degree line the third type of operation scheme is characterized by a constant release modules 1 2 5 and 7 or a near constant release module 4 regardless of inflow and storage conditions as shown in table 1 to further understand the applicability of each operation module to different conditions the statistics of inflow and storage conditions under each of the modules the transition probability matrix as well as the monthly frequency of the application of the operation modules are discussed as below the statistics of inflow and storage conditions under each of the operation modules are summarized in table 2 providing the mean μ and standard deviation σ of inflow and storage as well as the mean value of storage change δs between two consecutive days table 3 provides the transition probability matrix of the hm dt model where each cell in the table is the probability for a hidden state to transit from one to another the temporal distributions of the determined operation modules over months are plotted in fig 4 fig 4 shows that modules 3 4 and 6 are usually applied to the summer months corresponding to the high flow periods hutchins water center at cmu 2020 while all other modules are usually applied during the winter months which correspond to the low flow periods for modules 3 4 and 6 as shown in table 2 storage decreases on average with modules 3 and 6 and storage increases on average with module 4 by further examining the optimal transition matrix obtained from the hm dt model table 3 it is observed that among these three modules module 3 and 6 are usually applied after one of the 3 modules i e 3 4 and 6 and only module 4 is likely to have transitions from another module that is applied during low flow periods this indicates that among all three modules applied to high flow periods it is more likely for module 4 to be applied at the beginning of the high flow periods as can be seen in table 2 among these three modules module 4 is associated with the lowest storage lowest release and positive storage change on average this infers that module 4 is likely to be used for a period to build up storage i e the beginning of high flow season for water supply and power generation furthermore by examining the rows associated with these three modules i e 3 4 and 6 which show probabilities for the hidden states to transit from these three modules to other modules one can see that module 3 is likely to be followed by either module 4 or module 6 module 4 is likely to be followed by either module 3 or 5 and module 6 is likely to be followed by module 3 that again shows that only module 4 is likely to be followed by a module applicable to low flow periods indicating module 4 is the only one among modules 3 4 and 6 that is applicable at the end of a high flow period for building up storage besides it can also be inferred from the above observation on the transition matrix and the statistics shown in table 2 that during a high flow period module 4 is usually first applied to build up storage followed by module 3 for a pre release period for flood control when storage has already been built up and inflow has been moderately increased as shown in table 2 the inflow and storage associated with module 3 is slightly higher than those with module 4 and the average storage change is negative under module 3 module 3 will be further transitioned into module 6 when flood peaks approach as shown in table 2 inflow and storage under module 6 are significantly higher than those under other modules after a flood peak module 3 is used after module 6 to further reduce storage which is also usually associated with relatively large release that can potentially be used for water supply and power generation then module 4 is applied with a purpose of building up storage for water conservation before low flow periods begin among all modules that are applicable during low flow periods modules 0 1 2 5 and 7 as discussed above module 5 is the only one that links with modules applied to high flow periods i e either transitioning from module 5 to 4 before high flow periods or vice versa module 5 is associated with the highest inflow and release and the second highest positive storage change among these five modules applied to low flow periods these observations infer that module 5 is applied immediately before and after high flow seasons for building up storage and also making release to satisfy water demand during periods with relatively high inflow similarly it can be inferred from the transition matrix shown in table 3 and statistics shown in table 2 that module 0 is most likely used before module 5 prior to a high flow season or after module 5 after a high flow season for keeping storage at a relatively constant level with a slightly increasing trend other three modules i e modules 1 2 and 7 remain persistent to themselves for a relatively long time period considering the stable but relatively low release and inflow and positive storage changes underlying modules 1 2 and 7 it is more likely that these modules are applied to low flow periods with low water demand during which storage is carried over for future uses irrigation water supply and hydropower generation 3 3 predictive performance of the operation modules to better evaluate the performance of hm dt the performance of the operation modules determined by the hm dt model is explored and compared with that of decision trees rokach and maimon 2005 implemented with the scikit learn library pedregosa et al 2011 which is a traditional application of machine learning models for reservoir operation simulation e g kumar et al 2013 and yang et al 2016 in particular for each reservoir in the training and validation data sets a decision tree is derived based on the entire historical operation records of the reservoir where the hyperparameter itsmin is determined by a 5 fold cross validation to ensure the best performance of the dts the error statistics are determined and the operation modules of the hm dt and the dts derived for individual reservoirs are compared across different hidden states fig 5 and individual reservoirs fig 6 the statistics of the predictive errors of the modules of hm dt with the training and validation data sets are plotted in fig 5a and b respectively it is observed that the hm dt model with the selected parameters have acceptable and comparable performance for the training and validation data sets this further validates the appropriateness of the assumption of limited number of operation schemes and the selected model hyperparameters in particular modules that are applied to low flow periods i e modules 0 1 2 5 and 7 show better performance compared to those that are applied to high flow periods i e modules 3 4 and 6 this can be largely attributed to the relatively large amount of inflow and release during the high flow periods which results in relatively large absolute errors for comparison predictive errors of dts determined for individual reservoirs for predicting releases under each hidden state are determined as plotted in fig 5c and d compared to the error statistics of the dts the operation modules derived based on the hm dt model can effectively reduce the prediction bias especially for those with high flow periods in particular dts usually underestimate the release decisions under the hidden states which usually occur during high flow periods i e hidden states 3 4 and 6 and overestimate the release decisions under hidden states during low flow periods in contrast the hm dt model can significantly reduce such bias through identifying hidden states and fitting different modules for each of the hidden states in addition fig 6 plots the statistics of the predictive errors of dts and the hm dt model for the 50 reservoirs in the training data set fig 6a and 11 reservoirs in the validation data set fig 6b the operation of reservoirs usually involves multiple hidden states and the prediction errors of dts can be either positively or negatively biased under different hidden states as shown in fig 5 which results in more scattered prediction errors with dts in fig 6 as a result for all reservoirs in the two data sets the hm dt model achieves comparable or better predictive performance than the dts that are determined for individual reservoirs this confirms the capability of the hm dt model for simulating reservoir operation behaviors with a small number of representative operation modules 3 4 dynamic operation patterns reservoir operation changes over time in response to different water availability conditions changing water demands and competing operational objectives this is particularly important as reservoir managers attempt to adapt operations in response to non stationary hydrological conditions conway and mahé 2009 the hm dt model is able to reveal the time varying characteristics of reservoir operation such as the seasonality e g fig 7 the long term non stationarity e g fig 8 and the adaptation of operation schemes for drought events e g fig 9 which are illustrated in the following with silver jack reservoir moon lake and fontenelle reservoir as some typical examples the silver jack reservoir located in gunnison county colorado has a primary purpose of irrigation and recreation as part of the bostwick park project strong seasonality on the historical operation is shown in fig 7 where operation modules 4 and 5 are primarily applied to the low flow season for building up storage and satisfying non agricultural water demands while modules 3 and 6 are applied to the high flow season for supplying irrigation water and flooding control the seasonality can be observed in the historical operation records of most reservoirs considered in this study in addition to seasonality clear long term non stationarity of reservoir operation is also observed which is demonstrated with the moon lake reservoir as an example the reservoir is part of the moon lake project located on the west fork of the lake fork river with a primary operational purpose of irrigation as shown in fig 8 the operation schemes applied to the low flow periods have been shifted from module 7 during the early years 1995 2006 to module 2 shortly during a transitional period 2007 2013 and finally to module 1 during recent years after 2014 with these modules in different periods the reservoir release is nearly constant in each period regardless of inflow and storage conditions but with an increase in the amount of release crossing these periods i e the releases under modules 7 2 and 1 are 3 61 10 6 0 00016553 and 0 0005228 respectively such transitions of operation schemes may reflect an increasing non agricultural water demands during the low flow season in the area that the reservoir serves reservoir operators adapt operation behaviors in response to drought events in order to mitigate the drought damage hejazi and cai 2011 this can be seen from the operation history of the fontenelle reservoir located in southwest wyoming with a primary purpose of water supply and secondary purpose of hydropower generation fish and wildlife and recreation palmer drought severity index pdsi a widely used drought index alley 1984 is also plotted in fig 9 as can be seen modules 3 and 6 are alternatively used in high flow and low flow seasons during years under normal water supply condition moderate or high pdsi while module 4 fits to years with limited water supply low pdsi such adaptation during drought events reduces unnecessary release otherwise resulting from modules 3 and 6 and subsequently improves water conservation 4 discussions the hm dt model derives a set of representative operation modules based on real world operation records that reflect the short term and long term changes in reservoir operation the identified patterns can be used to analyze real world reservoir operation behaviors especially for retrospective analysis of historical operations in order to make possible improvements for future operations of a particular reservoir or one type of reservoirs moreover the hm dt model can be used to enhance hydrologic simulation models by adding a more realistic reservoir operation component based on historical operation records it can also be used to derive ready to use optimal operation rules to replace a complex optimization model bessler et al 2003 deka and chandramouli 2009 kumar et al 2013 raman and chandramouli 1996 it is worthy of noting that the novelty of this study lies in the hd dt model specifically the capability to simulate dynamic operations which improves the predictive accuracy as compared to traditional machine learning methods as shown in figs 5 and 6 and the suitability of the derived operation modules for reservoirs without historical records however this study is not to develop a data based model for any specific reservoirs as most data mining studies did although the model can be used in the way it does not intend to replace any detailed physically based simulation or optimization models developed for particular reservoirs either before discussing the applications of the hm dt some key assumptions of the hm dt on the representativeness of the derived operation modules are further justified 4 1 about some key assumptions of the hm dt in developing the hm dt and deriving the representative operation modules it was assumed that all the reservoirs are subject to the same climate conditions similar operation functions e g mainly for irrigation water supply in the upper colorado basin and institutional regulations inappropriately applying the operation modules may result in predicted releases that are deviated far away from the actual releases e g apparently different set of operation rules should be adopted by water supply reservoirs and run of the river hydropower stations for the simulation of operations of reservoirs in different regions of different types or for future operations which will experience systematic changes that are not observed in the history a new set of operation modules and associated patterns should be derived with the hm dt model which could be finished within reasonable time using the tool presented in this study however questions such as what the extent boundary of such a region is and which and how many reservoirs should be included in the modeling are non trivial in the demonstration case of the upper colorado basin these questions are examined using the validation procedures for hm dt result validation the model performances in predicting the release of reservoirs are compared between the training data set and the validation data set since the reservoirs used for the validation are chosen randomly the validation acceptance qualifies the applicability of the derived operation modules to reservoirs that are located in the same region but are not included in the training phase future work may conduct sensitivity analysis to different sets of reservoirs at the training stage to examine the robustness of the derived operation modules nevertheless more established criteria for the identification of study region should be addressed in future studies synthesis on model performance and derived operation modules across different regions with different sizes and or different climates will help establish criteria in determining the spatial extent for deriving representative operation modules theoretically when applied to relatively small regions in which all or most reservoirs are operated under a similar set of operation schemes the hm dt model will result in a small set of operation modules however the hm dt can also be applied to a large region that has reservoirs with heterogeneous operation behaviors in this case the hm dt model is capable of handling heterogeneous operation behaviors by fitting different sets of hidden states to different types of reservoirs which will result in a relatively large set of operation modules the application of the determined operation modules to simulate the operation behaviors of different types of reservoirs subject to different climate and institutional conditions is theoretically doable especially through clarification of the modules based on their spatial and temporal distributions however under this case the validation will be challenging and the data set used for validation should be carefully selected to include sufficient number of reservoirs so that each operation module could be fully tested with the validation data set in addition to spatial region constraints the applicability of the derived operation modules is also limited by other factors such as types of reservoirs and operating agencies for example reservoirs included in this study are operated by the usbr with a primary function of water supply for irrigation and secondary function of power generation flood control and recreation thus it is most appropriate to apply the derived operation modules to the reservoirs operated by the same agency with similar functions indeed reservoirs with different major functions may operate differently to meet their particular operation objectives for example reservoirs with a primary function of water supply for irrigation such as those in this study usually build up storage during winter periods and release to demands during summer periods while those for hydropower generation may build up their storage as much as possible in order to generate more electrical energy and those afterbay reservoirs and run of the river hydropower generation stations may keep a constant storage throughout a year this also indicates instead of deriving representative operation rules for reservoirs located in a common region it is also worth trying to derive representative operation modules for reservoirs operated by the same operation agencies and or with similar reservoir functions this study did not explicitly consider the upstream downstream relationships of reservoirs within the same river system theoretically typical behaviors of upstream and downstream reservoirs can be captured by the hm dt model through fitting a special set of hidden states and correspondingly operation modules to both upstream and downstream reservoirs which represent the frequent patterns of operations rules that reflect the upstream and downstream relationships in particular two special modules a and b can be identified simultaneously from an upstream and a downstream reservoir respectively reflecting the hydrological connection between the two reservoirs alternatively the hm dt can also explicitly simulate reservoir systems in which reservoirs are operated dependently to do that the upstream downstream or output input relationships must be prescribed as inputs to the hm dt model however this can be challenging since it requires full knowledge on the cooperation scheme of the jointly operated reservoirs in addition inconsistent form of rules may end with different reservoirs i e jointly operated reservoirs and reservoirs operated independently causing difficulties in deriving representative operation modules thus in this study individual reservoirs are treated independently so that the operation rules for all reservoirs can be generalized into a consistent form for the specific purpose of this study as stated above moreover the hm dt model can be used to develop decision trees for a reservoir system as a whole in which all reservoirs are operated dependently the decision trees will be derived to determine releases of all reservoirs with inflow to the reservoir system and storage levels of all reservoirs in the system as inputs this can end with a more complex model which should be resolved by model reduction monshizadeh et al 2014 or regularization schmidt et al 2007 techniques 4 2 understanding real world operation patterns to improve future operations in real world reservoir operations the operation policies should be regularly updated to improve non optimal operations better satisfy evolving water management needs and take advantage of modeling and forecasting skill advances usbr 2001 as an example the historical operation patterns identified by the hm dt model can help realize the updates by providing reservoir operators a systematic view of the historical operations and directions for future improvement in the following the operation of lake powell is provided as an example the inflow storage and release time series are plotted along with the pdsi of the area where lake powell locates utah state in fig 10 with identified modules corresponding to hidden states marked by colors as can be seen with the pdsi values several consecutive drought events occurred in the region starting late 1990s causing significant reduction in storage during 2011 a year in between two drought events hm dt identifies an operation module resulting in high releases which aggravated storage reduction in the following periods as a result of the continuous drought the hydropower generation one of the major functions of lake power decreased seriously to deal with this problem a historically low release was made in 2014 since the filling of lake powell in the 1960s which in turn caused an eight foot level decline of downstream lake mead iams and davis 2013 the occurrences described above showed that the operation in 2011 with high release could have been modified with a better hedging policy you and cai 2008 if the operators had considered more about the drought events coming after that time and put a higher priority to future water use risk this situation can be improved in the future given the advances of long range climate forecasts enhanced operators capability to use the forecasts for risk management and institutional adoptions to reservoir operation regulations to deal with extreme events 4 3 developing a reservoir component for watershed hydrologic models these patterns and characterizations of dynamic real world reservoir operation behaviors can also be used to improve water system simulation or optimization models as demonstrated by wu et al 2020 and hejazi and cai 2011 following previous efforts this section illustrates a plan to provide a generic reservoir operation model for hydrological models based on the operation modules derived in this study as shown in fig 11 the representativeness of the derived modules would allow the developed model to be applicable to any reservoir in the study region and the consistent representative form of the modules would enable the model to have a uniform interface to receive inputs from any reservoirs in the study region to apply the derived operation rules in a hydrological simulation model the hidden state sequence should be determined first which provides the periods that each operation module applies for historical periods with necessary data available for inferring the hidden states the hidden state sequence can be determined through decoding the hidden states based on observed operation records otherwise if the hidden state sequence cannot be directly determined based on operation records the hidden state sequence can be determined using the characterizations of each module for example the time distribution characteristics and the statistics of inflow and storage conditions provided in the result section can help users infer the most possible hidden states for historical periods without observed data or for future periods in addition the derived typical patterns in response to a certain event can also be applied to derive the hidden state sequence such as the pattern of the sequence of modules used in response to a flood event or a drought event as discussed before with the hidden state sequence provided the hydrological simulation model will interact with the reservoir operation component at a daily or longer time step as shown in fig 11 based on the received information from the hydrologic model such as time period inflow storage and water availability the reservoir operation component will determine the operation module to apply which is essentially a set of if then rules derived from the decision trees in turn a release decision will be sent back to the hydrological simulation model and so on to the next modeling time period 4 4 developing a surrogate for complex optimization models the proposed hm dt model can also be used to develop a surrogate for complex optimization models so as to provide ready to use optimal operation rules optimization models with perfect inflow forecast usually require a full set of input data such as inflow and demand over the entire study period to determine the optimal release decisions at all time periods this is not practical for real world reservoir operation decision making since in practice only limited information such as storage and inflow at the current and past time periods and inflow forecasts with limited lead time are available for making release decision at the current time period to resolve this issue machine learning models such as fuzzy logic models and artificial neural networks are used to derive optimal operation rules bessler et al 2003 deka and chandramouli 2009 kumar et al 2013 raman and chandramouli 1996 the input and state variables at the current time period are used as independent input variables and optimal operation decisions i e release decisions as dependent target variable s however as discussed before the direct application of these machine learning approaches to the entire study period results in the neglection of dynamic changes of the optimal operation decisions responding to changing operation conditions using the proposed hm dt model more adaptive operation rules can be obtained specifically optimal release decisions are first determined by an optimization model given historical or projected inflow scenarios then the hm dt model can be applied to the sample sequences of inflow storage and optimal release decisions to determine the optimal operation rules where the optimal release decisions at each time period are treated as dependent variables and the corresponding inflow and storage at the same time period as independent variables the derived decision trees will provide the optimal operation rules and the applicability of each decision tree under different operation conditions can be inferred following the analysis in this study 4 5 comparisons with other studies and actual operation policies in use this study is built on the top of a number of existing studies that used machine learning techniques for either understanding real world reservoir operation rules e g hejazi et al 2008 hejazi and cai 2009 and giuliani and herman 2018 or deriving black box machine learning models for simulating real world operation decisions e g shrestha et al 1996 corani et al 2009 yang et al 2016 and coerver et al 2018 combining the hidden markov model with a traditional machine learning approach i e decision trees as presented in this study effectively addresses both these aspects in particular this study provides a systematic view of real world reservoir operations through identifying representative operation modules and dynamic operation patterns that characterize the transitions between the modules as a data based simulation the hm dt model provides two fold improvements compared to existing studies 1 higher accuracy for predicting release decisions as shown in figs 5 and 6 which can be attributed to the capability of the model to simulate the dynamic operation behaviors and thus reduce prediction bias especially for periods with high inflow 2 the operation modules can be applied to simulating the operation behaviors of reservoirs of the same type that are not included in the training stage of the hm dt which allows the application of the hm dt modules to reservoirs without sufficient observation data both discrepancies and consistencies can be observed when comparing the derived operation modules with the operation rules used for the reservoirs operated by the usbr for the derived operation modules the decision mechanism is simplified by using inflow as the primary factor to decide releases in high flow periods and making relatively constant releases regardless of inflow and storage levels in low flow periods however the real world operation rules are usually subject to more complicated considerations for example for small reservoirs such as those upstream of lake powell the reservoirs have been operated to meet the monthly storage targets or the downstream demands whichever is greater subject to additional constraints such as minimum and maximum releases usbr 2001 for larger reservoirs such as lake powell flaming gorge blue mesa and navajo even more complex decision mechanisms might be adopted for example storage rules could be dynamically updated considering imperfect inflow forecasts usbr 2001 ecosystem services are taken into account e g the operation of flaming gorge dam in spring is set to release following the presence of larval razorback sucker downstream usbr 2020 upstream reservoir operation policies are used to forecast downstream reservoir inflow conditions e g the rules of fontenelle reservoir are used by flaming gorge usbr 2020 in addition multiple operation rules with different priorities are sometimes taken into account due to competing interests of multiple stakeholders e g on top of regular storage rules lake powell is also operated to follow a minimum required release rule that ensures downstream benefits a 602 a storage requirement that ensures the upstream benefits and an equalization rule that balances the upstream and downstream storages usbr 2001 despite of the discrepancies the consistencies between the derived operation modules and the operation rules actually in use lie with the capability of the derived operation modules to represent the daily operation rules to achieve the real world storage rules in particular for many reservoirs the actual rule curves specify the target storage levels at a monthly or even coarser time scale e g monthly storage targets or flood control storage space requirements during the flooding season and either human heuristics or some other sophisticated procedures must be used to determine daily operations specifically both the storage target levels usbr 2001 and the operation modules show strong seasonal patterns with a clear annual cycle of the storage target levels which usually peak at the beginning or in the middle of the high flow season usbr 2001 correspondingly the derived operation modules demonstrate strong seasonality too i e modules 3 4 and 6 for the high flow season and others for low flow seasons thus although the storage target levels set by usbr are not explicitly represented in the operation modules they are reflected by the seasonal delineation of the modules within which the daily operations which play a role in achieving the storage targets are significantly captured specifically due to the occurrences of extraordinarily high inflow the linear and piece wise constant release modules i e modules 3 and 6 are fitted to high flow seasons so that excessive inflow can be appropriately discharged to maintain storage below a certain level for coming floods for low flow season operations the hm dt model results in a relatively constant release to meet the minimum release requirements while building up storage toward the storage targets before the next high flow season which reflects the operations during low flow seasons such as those adopted by usbr during august december for the operation of flaming gorge reservoir usbr 2020 in addition the operation modules can be derived using publicly available historical operation records the representative modules can be derived to operate on any desired temporal resolutions based on received designated inputs for release decisions in particular the derived generic rules and dynamic transition mechanisms make it possible to add a realistic reservoir component to hydrological simulation models which will overcome the practical difficulties in acquiring real world rules from numerous operating agencies matching different temporal resolutions of the operation policies and the physical processes in a hydrological simulation model 5 conclusions in this study an hm dt model is developed to derive representative reservoir operation modules along with the dynamic operation patterns based on historical operation records it is shown that the dynamic feature of reservoir operations which is usually ignored in previous studies can be pinpointed by the hm dt model through modeling the transitions between the operation schemes over time the proposed model is applied to 50 reservoirs in the upper colorado river basin with 11 more reservoirs in the same region for validation and 8 operation modules in the form of decision trees are obtained the operation modules are classified into three types i e modules with an almost constant release regardless of inflow storage and water availability modules with release identical to inflow modules with a piece wise constant relationship between inflow and release comparable model performance is observed between the training and validation data indicating the representativeness of the modules derived by the hm dt model through combining hidden markov models with decision trees this study is able to derive a limited number of representative reservoir operation modules for all reservoirs in a particular region under the various operation conditions i e inflow storage as well as unknown factors and the transitions between operation schemes the dynamic change of operation rules that reflect the impacts of seasonality long term non stationarity and extreme events on reservoir operation in particular through fitting different operation modules to different historical time periods the derived operation modules could achieve better accuracy in predicting release decisions compared to decision trees a typical traditional machine learning approach as shown in figs 5 and 6 the representativeness of the derived modules allows the application of the derived modules to any reservoirs in the same region which consequently enables a unique application for developing a generic reservoir operation simulation model the applications of the resulted reservoir operation rules and identified historical reservoir operation patterns include better understanding the real world reservoir operation behaviors retrospectively analyzing historical operation activities in order to make possible improvements for future operations as well as developing a realistic reservoir operation component for use in hydrological and water resources system modeling in addition the proposed method can also be applied to derive optimal operation rules based on optimal operation decisions determined with optimization models future research directions include testing different types of machine learning models to be combined with hidden markov models such as neural networks and developing effective methods for inferring hidden states for reservoirs not observed during the training phase besides in future studies ready to use reservoir operation modeling components are to be developed using the proposed hm dt model for other regions and to be incorporated into general hydrological simulation models as discussed in this paper finally the operation modules for different regions operation objectives or operating agencies can be derived and compared to better understand their similarities and differences credit authorship contribution statement qiankun zhao conceptualization methodology

374,we use approximate bayesian computation and the kullback leibler divergence measure to quantify to what extent horizontal and vertical equivalent electrical conductivity time series observed during tracer tests constrain the 2 d geostatistical parameters of multivariate gaussian log hydraulic conductivity fields considering a perfect and known relationship between salinity and electrical conductivity at the point scale we find that the horizontal equivalent electrical conductivity time series best constrain the geostatistical properties the variance controlling the spreading rate of the solute is the best constrained geostatistical parameter followed by the integral scales in the vertical direction we find that horizontally layered models with moderate to high variance have the best resolved parameters since the salinity field at the averaging scale e g the model resolution in tomograms is typically non ergodic our results serve as a starting point for quantifying uncertainty due to small scale heterogeneity in laboratory experiments tomographic results and hydrogeophysical inversions involving dc data keywords equivalent electrical conductivity approximate bayesian computation geostatistics solute spreading and mixing hydrogeophysics 1 introduction time lapse electrical geophysical methods are popular in hydrogeology e g binley et al 2015 singha et al 2015 as they provide non intrusive means for remote and dense spatio temporal sampling related to flow and transport processes among these the direct current dc method is cost effective easy to employ and probably the most commonly used binley et al 2015 it has been thoroughly assessed through numerical investigations e g vanderborght et al 2005 singha and gorelick 2005 fowler and moysey 2011 laboratory and controlled tank experiments slater et al 2000 koestel et al 2008 jougnot et al 2018 and field investigations e g daily et al 1992 binley et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 dc measurements are generally based on two pairs of electrodes one pair for establishing a known electrical current between two points and the other for measuring the resultant electrical voltage between two other points e g keller and frischknecht 1966 in the context of time lapse dc tomographic experiments the measurement process is repeated using multiple current and voltage electrode pairs at different positions and the measurement protocol is repeated over time such a measurement process is often referred to as time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and it outputs time series of electrical resistances voltage over injected current that in saturated media carry information about the time evolution of the salinity distribution e g lesmes and friedman 2005 the time lapse ert method has been applied during conservative saline tracer tests to extract both flow and transport information retrieval of hydraulic conductivity from such data is discussed for example in kemna et al 2002 and vanderborght et al 2005 and the range of applications span from the calibration of mean hydraulic conductivity values binley et al 2002 to retrieval of the full distribution of hydraulic conductivity pollock and cirpka 2012 extraction of solute transport parameters has been studied in detail and kemna et al 2002 for instance provided a field demonstration of retrieving equivalent 1 d stream tube advective dispersive transport parameters in the context of 3 d conservative saline transport results later corroborated numerically by vanderborght et al 2005 also koestel et al 2008 inferred the 3 d distribution of solute velocities and dispersivities in a soil column using time lapse ert data over time the use of geoelectrical monitored tracer tests has evolved from qualitative analyses such as saline plume motion detection and geometry delineation e g slater et al 2000 to obtain quantitative and spatially resolved hydrological constraints nevertheless using time lapse dc data for quantitative hydrogeological purposes remains a persistent challenge singha et al 2015 this challenge is intimately related to the use of time lapse inversion methodologies that provide resolution limited time evolving images of electrical resistivity or conductivity through time singha et al 2015 the most common approach to translate resulting geophysical time lapse tomograms into salinity distributions rests on two strong assumptions the first is that there exists a petrophysical relationship e g archie 1942 with known spatially invariant parameters defined at the discretization scale of the tomogram implying that it corresponds to the representative elementary volume rev scale hill 1963 of bulk electrical conductivity and consequently that the impact of salinity heterogeneity is negligible below this scale the second assumption is that the resolution of the geophysical tomogram is the same as the model discretization which is hardly true for any electrical survey in reality the tomogram represents spatially varying weighted averages over a much larger volume e g friedel 2003 with these two assumptions temporal differences in time lapse tomograms can readily be translated into estimates of salinity differences unfortunately this approach typically leads to an underestimation of actual tracer mass with errors often approaching one order of magnitude e g binley et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 laloy et al 2012 research has addressed the second assumption by upscaling the petrophysical relationship to the tomographic resolution using either linearized inverse theory day lewis et al 2005 nussbaumer et al 2019 or monte carlo based simulation approaches e g moysey et al 2005 in this work we are primarily concerned with the first assumption namely that the impact of salinity variations is negligible below a given scale to avoid complications inherent to tomographic imaging we focus here on the case of a time evolving equivalent electrical conductivity tensor of a 2 d square sample of unit length that is invaded by a saline i e electrically conductive tracer in a tomographic setting this scale can be thought of as the model resolution at a given location of interest for this case the equivalent electrical conductivity in a given direction is readily obtained basically by dividing the electric current with the imposed voltage the total current is the macroscopic flux of the internal current density field i e the distribution of small scale currents within the sample that for a given internal distribution of local conductivities is established such that its associated energy loss due to joule s dissipation integrated over the domain is minimized e g feynman et al 2011 bernabé and revil 1995 this governing principle leads to patterns of current channelling and deflection through and from high and low electrical conductivity zones respectively and it governs the time variations of the current density field as the saline tracer invades the sample e g li and oldenburg 1991 accurate prediction of the time evolution of the equivalent electrical conductivity of the medium thus requires accounting for interactions occurring throughout the domain and given an arbitrarily shaped time evolving electrical conductivity field this remains an open upscaling problem belonging to the family of conductivity upscaling in spatially non stationary fields e g sanchez vila et al 2006 and references therein the current lack of physically accurate upscaling procedures impedes reliable quantitative analyses of a saline plume s fate from geoelectrical monitoring for instance in the most common case where archie s petrophysical law archie 1942 is used to infer the mean saline concentration within the sample from its equivalent electrical conductivity the underlying assumption is that the internal electrical conductivity field behaves as an additive property that can be upscaled by taking its arithmetic average this is only true if the electrical conductivity field is constant or if its distribution is layered and the equivalent electrical conductivity is measured parallel to this layering corresponding to the upper wiener bound e g milton and sawicki 2003 in general since portions of the concentration field are by passed by the established current patterns the upper wienner bound does not apply and this leads to the above mentioned apparent mass loss as demonstrated for example in a recent laboratory study jougnot et al 2018 these issues also impact the performance of many fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approaches and modeling studies that interpret equivalent electrical conductivity time series using equivalent transport parameters within an advective dispersive description e g kemna et al 2002 vanderborght et al 2005 koestel et al 2008 on a more positive note the discussion above also suggests that electrical conductivity time series at a given scale carry statistical information on the concentration field and its temporal evolution here we investigate to what extent tracer tests associated with time series of equivalent electrical properties a pre defined scale can be used to infer geostatistical properties of hydraulic conductivity fields below this scale this is achieved by considering inference within a bayesian inference framework e g gelman et al 2013 tarantola 2005 more specifically through an approximate bayesian computational approach e g beaumont et al 2002 sisson et al 2018 for comparison purposes the mass breakthrough curve is also evaluated and its information content is compared to its electrical peers using a bayesian approach allows assessing the information gained on the properties of interest with respect to their assumed prior statistics we perform our study using a database consisting of 105 synthetically generated equivalent electrical conductivity tensor and mass breakthrough time series collected during saline tracer tests within a 2 d domain with hydraulic heterogeneity prescribed by multivariate gaussian fields we consider advectively dominated solute transport i e high péclet numbers where the concentration field evolution is predominantly determined by the underlying flow field which in turn depends on the underlying hydraulic conductivity field under the constant applied pressure gradient in this study we consider idealized scenarios as it is assumed that there is no spatial variations in petrophysical properties and that the petrophysical relationship is known in section 2 we review the basic governing equations describing groundwater flow solute transport and electrical conduction together with their numerical implementations in section 3 we introduce the inference problem of interest along with the bayesian inference tools the main results are presented and discussed in sections 4 and 5 respectively section 6 concludes the paper 2 governing equations and problem setup 2 1 groundwater flow for steady state flow and in the absence of sources or sinks mass conservation of an incompressible fluid is expressed by the continuity equation for the specific discharge q x 1 q x 0 where x x y t denotes the 2 d position vector and x and y the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively darcy s law relates q x with the hydraulic conductivity field k x and the hydraulic head h x via 2 q x k x h x adopting darcy s law the groundwater flow equation reads 3 k x h x k x 2 h x 0 it is customary to treat the log hydraulic conductivity field y x ln k x within a geostatistical framework with y x modelled as a second order spatially stationary ergodic random function in this study we consider multivariate gaussian random fields with an exponential covariance structure e g rubin 2003 with a mean μ y and a variance σ y 2 the integral scales of the field are expressed by the integral scale i y in the vertical direction and an anisotropy factor λ i x i y after specifying k x the flow field q x is obtained by solving eq 3 with prescribed boundary conditions section 2 4 2 2 2 solute transport the evolution of the concentration field c x t of a passive tracer being transported within the steady state flow field q x can be described within an eulerian framework using the advection dispersion equation 4 θ c x t t q x c x t θ d c x t 0 where θ is the porosity and d is the dispersion tensor in this study we assume a spatially constant porosity and dispersion tensor and furthermore we assume zero dispersivity in this case and considering eq 1 eq 4 simplifies to the advection diffusion equation with constant coefficients 5 θ c t q x c θ d m 2 c 0 where dm denotes the molecular diffusion coefficient after solving for c x t the flux weighted tracer mass breakthrough time series m t are defined by 6 m t γ o u t q x x c x t d x γ o u t q x x d x with q x x being the flow component in the x direction and γ out the outflow boundary of the model domain 2 3 dc conduction electric charge conservation is in the dc problem expressed by the continuity equation of the current density field j x t at time lapse acquisition time t in the absence of current sources and net accumulation of electric charge it takes the following form 7 j x t 0 ohm s law relates j x t with the electrical conductivity σ x t and the electric field e x t via the linear relationship j x t σ x t e x t adopting the quasistatic approximation e x t 0 allows to express e x t ϕ x t where ϕ x t is the electrical potential writing j x t in terms of ϕ x t as j x t σ x t ϕ x t and replacing this expression into eq 7 results in the governing laplace equation for the electrical potentials 8 σ x t ϕ x t σ x t 2 ϕ x t 0 we consider the horizontal and vertical components of the equivalent electrical conductivity tensor time series of a 2 d square sample of unit length this implies solving eq 8 with alternative mixed dirichlet neumann boundary conditions or excitation modes for σh t σv t a constant electrical potential difference δϕh δϕv along the horizontal vertical direction is imposed with zero electrical potential gradient along the top and bottom left and right boundaries the resulting electrical potential fields are respectively ϕ h x t and ϕ v x t the corresponding equivalent electrical conductivity time series are computed as 9 σ h t 1 δ ϕ h γ y σ x t x ϕ h x t d x and 10 σ v t 1 δ ϕ v γ x σ x t y ϕ v x t d x where the integration paths γ y and γ x are any two given contours separating the left and right boundaries and the top and bottom boundaries respectively and the integrands in each equation is the horizontal or vertical component of the current density field resulting from each excitation mode 2 4 numerical implementations and problem setup we create a database of 105 time series of σh t σv t and m t that are collected during tracer tests simulated within multivariate gaussian log hydraulic conductivity realizations in a square shaped domain of side length l 1 m discretized into 250 250 elements 2 4 1 generation of hydraulic conductivity fields the log hydraulic conductivity field realizations y x are generated using the fast circulant embedding technique see dietrich and newsam 1997 for details a given realization depends on the specified geostatistical model parameters and r a 250 250 a random draw from a standard normal distribution the geostatistical model parameters determine the spatial regularity smoothness class while r determines the locations of high and low log hydraulic conductivity values relative to the mean value μy of the geostatistical model here μy is fixed at 6 while remaining parameters are treated as random variables m σ y 2 i y λ described by a joint probability density function pdf π m the variance σ y 2 is randomly drawn from a uniform pdf with support 0 5 5 the integral scale i y is drawn from a log uniform pdf with support l 25 l 2 m and the anisotropy factor λ i x i y is drawn from a uniform pdf with support 1 l i y i e conditionally on i y the discretization implies that heterogeneities obtained with the smallest integral scales are resolved with at least 10 cells in each direction the log uniform distribution of i y is here chosen to favor realizations with finely structured fields the generated sample of the geostatistical model parameters of size p 10 5 is represented in fig 1 note that each draw is associated with a unique r which together form a log hydraulic conductivity field realization 2 4 2 flow simulations the groundwater flow equation eq 3 is solved numerically using the open source finite difference solver modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the prescribed boundary conditions are a horizontal head gradient of 0 05 inducing flow from left to right and no flow conditions for the top and bottom boundaries the head gradient value was chosen such that for a homogeneous field equal to exp μy the tracer arrival time occurs approximately at half of the simulated time duration of the tracer experiment in the simulations the hydraulic conductivity between two adjacent cells is taken as their harmonic mean the chosen numerical scheme used to solve the system of linear equations is the preconditioned conjugate gradient method hill 1990 2 4 3 transport simulations the advection diffusion equation eq 5 is solved using the groundwater solute transport simulator package mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 the initial condition is a homogeneous concentration field of 0 01 g l 1 and the boundary conditions are i constant concentration of 1 g l 1 along the left boundary ii no flux along the top and bottom boundaries and iii free flux along the right boundary the porosity is assumed constant and equal to 0 3 for the advection term in eq 5 the third order total variation diminishing tvd approach cox and nishikawa 1991 is used the tvd solver was found to be very robust and showed minimal numerical dispersion when benchmarked against planar fronts nevertheless in order to mask the small numerical dispersion the diffusion coefficient was slightly increased from d m 1 6 10 9 m 2 s 1 the standard value for the diffusion coefficient of salt in water to d m 2 10 8 m 2 s 1 the latter larger value is obtained by fitting the analytical solution for a concentration profile for a step injection in 1 d e g ogata and banks 1961 to a tvd calculated concentration profile obtained for a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field equal to μy when the diffusion coefficient is imposed to be the one of salt in water each simulated tracer experiment lasts for 4 103 s and during this time period 400 equidistant samples c i x i 1 400 of the simulated concentration fields are recorded at times t i 1 δ t with δ t 4 10 3 s 400 10 s the injected tracer typically does not fully replace the initial background tracer at the end of the simulation period this is a consequence of the short simulation time imposed by computational constraints and large low velocity regions the mean péclet number is 6 103 defined as p e u d m where u is the tracer velocity for the constant hydraulic conductivity field 2 4 4 electrical simulations for each sampled concentration field c i x the 2 d square domain is alternatively excited by imposing an electrical potential difference of 1 v with a pair of line electrodes along either the vertical or horizontal boundaries of the sample the remaining boundaries are prescribed zero electrical potential gradient normal to the boundaries the resulting electrical potential fields ϕ i h x and ϕ i v x associated to the horizontal and vertical modes respectively are computed by numerically solving the laplace equation eq 8 with the finite element solver module of the python library pygimli rücker et al 2017 for simplicity the input electrical conductivity distribution σ i x used for solving the boundary value problems at each time step is assumed to be perfectly and linearly related to the transport simulation output c i x the resulting normalized dimensionless time series denoted as σh σv and m vary within 0 01 1 the data generation is summarized by the pseudo code in algorithm 1 3 inference problem we are interested in assessing to what extent the time series σh σv and m may constrain the geostatistical parameters m σ y 2 i y λ we consider the following five combinations of time series d h σ h d v σ v d m m d h v σ h σ v d h v m σ h σ v m the data vectors d h d v and d m are used to assess the individual performance of each type of time series d h v is used to evaluate the performance of electrical data alone and d h v m is used to evaluate the value of using all the data at the same time we cast the problem as a bayesian inference framework as outlined below 3 1 bayesian inference framework in a finite dimensional bayesian inference framework a model is described in terms of m random variables with realizations m m 1 m m that can be used as input to a physical forward simulator producing n simulated data d s i m f m e g gelman et al 2013 tarantola 2005 the prior probability density function π m is updated using bayes theorem to a posterior probability density function π m d o b s after considering the observed data d o b s d 1 d n using a likelihood function π d o b s m this function evaluates the likelihood of any model realization given and the residual error vector e d o b s d s i m and an assumed underlying observational noise model e g tarantola 2005 bayes theorem in its unnormalized form reads 11 π m d o b s π d o b s m π m in our context the prior is given by the pdf described in section 2 4 1 and d o b s is the noise contaminated output of the forward simulator f m t when evaluated using one of the test cases m t described in section 4 2 for the electrical time series f m is formed by the sequential application of the following forward mappings i the realization of the hydraulic conductivity field k x ii solving the groundwater flow eq 3 iii the advection diffusion eq 5 iv the laplace eq 8 and v evaluating the equations defining σh 9 and σv 10 3 2 posterior density approximation in bayesian inference monte carlo mc sampling can be used to approximate π m d o b s by a mc integration over a finite sample of the sought distribution e g mosegaard and tarantola 1995 gelman et al 2013 the simplest approach is acceptance rejection sampling ars which consists of drawing samples m proportionally to the prior density and accepting them as samples of the posterior density proportionally to their likelihood π d o b s m this is an exact sampling method e g mosegaard and tarantola 1995 and it can be used off line using a large ensemble of prior model realizations given that unlike in a markov chain mc mcmc sampling method there is no dependence between the model proposals its main disadvantage is that since the parameter search is unguided unlike mcmc the probability of acceptance decreases exponentially with the dimensionality m of the model parameter space as more dimensions are added to the problem the ratio of the hyper volume of high likelihood values regions of large acceptance probability to the total volume of the model space decreases exponentially to zero e g scales 1996 curtis and lomax 2001 this so called curse of dimensionality may result in unrealistically large prior model samples even when addressing only a handful of parameters in the context of this study we are interested in only three geostatistical parameters section 2 1 possibly suggesting that ars could be a good choice however when the scale of the modelling domain is insufficiently large compared to the integral scales of the field y x under consideration ergodic conditions are not fulfilled implying a potentially high dependence on r section 2 4 1 this high dimensional variable is different for each realization of y x and it ultimately controls the locations of high and low hydraulic conductivity regions even if we are uninterested in r as such it forms part of our data generation process and thus it enters the inference problem as a nuisance variable e g gelman et al 2013 that needs to be accounted for consequently our definition of the forward simulator given above has to be expanded to f m r assuming independence of m and r examples the actual inference problem to solve reads 12 π m r d o b s π d o b s m r π m π r to obtain the sought density we need to marginalize π m r d with respect to r 13 π m d π m r d d r due to its higher dimensionality more than 62 500 variables in our examples the problem expressed by eq 12 is practically impossible to handle with the formal bayesian ars algorithm for this reason we resort to an approximate version of the ars that is outlined in the following subsection 3 2 1 abc acceptance rejection sampling algorithm the ars algorithm implemented within an approximate bayesian computational abc framework labelled approximate acceptance rejection sampling aars algorithm from now on is an approximate sampling method that produces a smooth approximation of π m d the reader is referred to sisson et al 2018 for an overview on abc methods the aars algorithm requires two additional inputs i a distance metric ρ d s i m d o b s for comparing the calculated data with the observed data and ii a kernel density function k h ρ for weighting the distance metric and defining an acceptance probability together they replace the likelihood function in our work the distance metric ρ d s i m d o b s is taken as the l 1 norm 14 ρ d s i m d o b s 1 n 1 n d s i m d o b s and the kernel density is chosen to be a uniform function 15 k h ρ 1 0 ρ h 1 0 1 ρ h where the acceptance bandwidth h is chosen such that the 0 5 th percentile of the distribution of ρ ordered from the lowest to the highest distance are accepted in our case this means that k h ρ accepts the models producing the s 500 lowest distances out of the k 10 5 sampled prior samples the aars algorithm described in pseudo code in algorithm 2 proceeds similarly to the formal ars algorithm considering algorithm 2 it can be noticed that the aars algorithm draws samples from the joint distribution 16 π a a r s m r d d o b s k h ρ π d o b s d m r π m π r which when integrated over all generated data instances gives the aars approximation of the r marginalized posterior density 17 π a a r s m d o b s π a a r s m r d d o b s d d or 18 π a a r s m d o b s π m k h ρ π d o b s d m r d d as pointed out by sisson et al 2018 from eq 18 the aars can be interpreted as a formal bayesian ars algorithm using an approximated likelihood function that is a kernel density estimation kde of the true likelihood 19 π a a r s d o b s m r k h ρ π d o b s d m r d d for building the empirical posterior probability densities we perform kde over the samples obtained from π a a r s m d o b s for consistency the prior pdf section 2 4 1 is computed by performing kde over the generated sample of size p 10 5 the kde approach is described in the following subsection 3 2 2 multivariate kernel density estimation kde given a sample x x 1 x s of size s of m variate random vectors belonging to a common distribution described by the density g the kde estimator g of g is given by e g wand and jones 1994 20 g h x 1 s i 1 s k h x x i with the estimator function k h defined as 21 k h x h 1 2 k h 1 2 x where the kernel function k is a symmetric multivariate density furthermore h is the determinant of the m m bandwidth matrix h which is symmetric and positive definite in general and if the m variables are assumed independent it is diagonal with entries h i given as h i h σ i where h is the bandwidth parameter and σi the standard deviation of the ith component of the random variable the estimator of eq 20 is an average of kernel densities that are centered at the sample points and whose decay is controlled by h the particular choice of k does not substantially influence the performance of the kde approach but the choice of the bandwidth h defining h i e the tails of k is a most crucial aspect given that under or over smoothed estimators will be produced if it is taken too small or large respectively e g wand and jones 1994 in the present work k is chosen as the standard multivariate normal function 22 k h x 2 π n 2 h 1 2 e x p 1 2 x t h 1 x for h a common choice when dealing with unimodal distributions as the ones expected in this study is based on silverman s rule of thumb e g silverman 1986 23 h s 4 m 2 1 m 4 d 1 m 4 the reliability of the used information measure subsection 3 3 largely depends on the quality of the input density estimations provided by the kde approach e g budka et al 2011 considering the trade offs pertaining to the choice of h a manual tuning process was necessary which resulted in the choice of h 0 75 h s for the results presented herein 3 3 information measure kullback leibler divergence the degree of knowledge brought by the observed data d o b s pertaining to the geostatistical model parameters is evaluated by comparing our approximation of π m d o b s with π m the kullback leibler divergence kld kullback and leibler 1951 also termed relative information content tarantola 2005 is probably the most widely used quantitative measure for comparing pdfs 24 k l d π m d o b s π m π m d o b s l n π m d o b s π m d m where the base of the logarithm is taken as e giving the information in units of nats e g cover and thomas 2012 the integration of eq 10 is performed over the support of the densities and the kld is finite as the support of π m d o b s is contained in the support of π m e g cover and thomas 2012 the kld is zero when π m d o b s π m i e the data carry no information about the model parameters and it increases as the posterior becomes more compact with respect to the prior as a consequence of conditioning to the data note that when the prior and posterior densities are gaussian with the same mean but the standard deviation of the posterior is half the standard deviation of the prior then the kld is 0 27 nats since our samples are drawn from approximate posterior densities π a a r s m d o b s that are kde i e smoothed versions of the target densities π m d o b s eq 18 the chosen aars approach provides a conservative framework for assessing the information content in terms of the kld measure since it is always true that 25 k l d π a a r s m d o b s π m k l d π m d o b s π m which implies that the information content in the considered time series is at least as large as the estimates obtained by our analysis 4 results we first show two examples of generated data for end member cases of weak and strong hydraulic heterogeneity then we describe the results obtained for different geostatistical parameter value combinations in terms of the kld and bias measures in doing so we discuss results obtained for one r realization as well as ensemble statistics deduced from 50 r realizations 4 1 two examples of generated data fig 2 shows an example of data obtained for a weakly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field with σ y 2 i y λ 0 005 0 130 m 3 179 fig 2a resulting in an approximately constant flow field fig 2b the corresponding concentration field shown at the sampling time 103 s when the tracer occupies approximately 50 of the model domain displays an overall planar front fig 2c the time series of σh and σv fig 2d evolve according to the lower and upper wiener bounds these upscaling formulas for laminated materials e g milton and sawicki 2003 correspond to the harmonic and arithmetic means of the local electrical conductivities respectively the arithmetic averaging governing σv is manifested by linear scaling with time in this case σv forms an almost perfect predictor of the mean salinity μc within the sample σh on the contrary strongly underestimates μc for this case the mean velocity of the tracer front is given by the time derivative of σv fig 2e information that is available before the mass flux m time series shows any response these easily interpretable results are now contrasted with those obtained for a strongly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field defined with σ y 2 i y λ 5 111 0 085 m 1 028 the resulting field has small scale structures and is close to isotropic fig 3 a yet its associated flow field exhibits pronounced channeling fig 3b resulting in a highly heterogeneous concentration field fig 3c neither σh nor σv follow any known upscaling law they both start to vary much earlier than m fig 2d which only reacts when the tracer arrives at the outlet these early variations are clearly seen in the time derivatives of the electrical responses fig 2e which are non zero from the moment the tracer injection starts and exhibit small peaks that are related to internal connection events of the solute that are invisible to m both σh and m show a steep increase around 103 s and a large peak in their time derivatives corresponding to early breakthrough arrival for this case μc is at early times much larger than all data and is asymptotically approximated by m followed in order of magnitude by σh and σv 4 2 test cases we now apply the bayesian inference approach using three different combinations of the geostatistical model parameter values i m 1 4 70 0 06 m 1 50 this leads to a strongly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field that is approximately isotropic and exhibits small structures fig 4a ii m 2 0 80 0 06 m 10 00 this leads to a mildly to moderately heterogeneous field that exhibits a high degree of layering fig 4d iii m 3 4 70 0 38 m 1 50 this leads to a highly heterogeneous field exhibiting large scale structures fig 4g in fig 4 example realizations of generated log hydraulic conductivity fields for the three test cases are shown together with their corresponding flow and concentration fields 4 3 information assessment of data types for each test case of the model vector m 50 datasets d j o b s section 3 are simulated using hydraulic conductivity fields created with different r realizations the forward responses are contaminated with noise having zero mean and a mean deviation of 0 005 representing 50 of the baseline electrical conductivity the evaluation of the different data types and geostatistical parameter values is considered both in terms of the ensemble of realizations ensemble performance and in terms of randomly picked single realizations i e the fields shown in fig 4 in addition to the estimated joint posterior pdf we also consider the corresponding marginal distributions to evaluate the ability of the data to constrain individual geostatistical parameters for the marginal analysis we also consider a relative bias measure computed as the ratio of the mean bias of the marginal posteriors with respect to the true values of m to the mean bias of the marginal priors with respect to the true values from now on we drop the superscript obs when referring to the observed conditioning data 4 3 1 test case m 1 table 1 summarizes the results obtained for test case m 1 when considering the joint klds obtained for the ensemble of realizations we find that d h v has the largest mean kld closely followed by d h v m the least informative data type d m has a mean kld that is 75 of the one for d h v while d h and d v have values in between the kld standard deviations have similar values among all the data types and represent 20 of the mean values we now turn to the results obtained for the fields in fig 4a c and the corresponding time series highlighted in fig 5a c for this specific realization the klds span a small range of only 13 also the ordering is different and the most and least informative data sets for this case are d h and d v respectively this illustrates together with the standard deviations of the klds discussed above the stochastic variations that are inherent under non ergodic conditions the variability in the generated data due to variations in the r realizations for a given geostatistical model is indicated by the insets in fig 5a c the posterior model samples obtained by the aars algorithm and used for building the empirical posterior pdfs for each type of data are shown in fig 5 the density distribution of these 3 d clouds of points convey a qualitative view of the ability of the different data types to constrain the geostatistical parameters no eye catching differences distinguish the different point clouds reflecting the rather similar values of the associated klds the klds computed for the marginal posterior pdfs labelled marginal klds from now on are the largest for σ y 2 followed by iy and λ that on average represent 50 and 25 of the klds of σ y 2 respectively we find that σ y 2 is best constrained by d h producing the largest marginal kld and the smallest bias for this parameter the poorest performance is achieved by d m that has both the smallest marginal kld and the largest bias this can be seen in the estimated marginal posterior probability density fig 6 a displaying a mass distribution which is the furthest away from the true value σ y 2 4 70 for iy on the contrary d m features the highest marginal kld and the smallest bias fig 6b the ability of the data to constrain λ is low fig 6c with d h v m featuring the highest marginal kld the relative mean biases are negatively correlated with the associated kld measure showing consistency between the two measures 4 3 2 test case m 2 table 2 summarizes the results obtained for test case m 2 when considering the joint posterior klds for the ensemble we find that d hvm is the most informative dataset followed by d h and d hv far behind featuring mean klds that are 60 of d hvm are d v and d m of the individual data sets we find that d h is much more informative than d v and d m the standard deviations have similar magnitudes and represent 20 35 of the mean values we now consider the results obtained using the time series fig 7a c obtained from the fields in fig 4d f the ranking for the joint klds are similar to the ensemble mean klds except that d h performs the best the point clouds of the posterior samples fig 7 clearly shows that d h fig 7a constrain the geostatistical model parameters much better than d v fig 7b and d m fig 7c the marginal klds are again the largest for σ y 2 followed by those of i y and λ we find that σ y 2 is the most constrained by d h and the least constrained by d m as reflected by their marginal klds and the compactness of their posterior pdfs fig 8 a all the marginal pdfs for σ y 2 exhibit a small bias towards larger variances with the smallest and largest biases exhibited for d hvm and d m respectively for i y the marginal kld associated with d h is well above the others fig 8b the secondmost and thirdmost best performing data set for this parameter are d hv and d hvm while d m performs the poorest the marginal klds and biases for λ fig 8b follow the ranking of i y for this test case m 2 the data better constrain the geostatistical parameters than for test case m 1 as reflected by generally much larger kld values 4 3 3 test case m 3 table 3 summarizes the performance of the different datasets for test case m 3 considering the ensemble statistics of the joint posterior klds we find that d hv has the largest mean kld closely followed by d hvm and d h again d m features the smallest mean kld with a values that is 63 of that for d hv the standard deviations are varying within 15 and represent 25 of the mean values we now consider the results from the data time series fig 9a c obtained from the fields in figs 4g i the joint kld for d h is the largest closely followed by d hv and d hvm their klds are 30 higher than the others the point clouds of posterior model realizations fig 9 are rather similar but the results obtained from d h fig 9a are more compact compared to d v and d m for instance there is minimal scatter in the λ direction c f fig 9b and the high σ y 2 is better constrained c f fig 9c the marginal klds are again the highest for σ y 2 followed by iy and λ the relative mean biases show a similar trend being smallest for σ y 2 the marginal probability densities for σ y 2 fig 10 a show that d h best constrain this parameter followed by d hv and d hvm the marginal kld for d h are only 10 larger than for d hv and d hvm but its bias is 30 lower note also that d m is strongly biased towards too low σ y 2 for iy and λ both klds and biases indicate that d h d hv and d hvm are the most informative while d v has the poorest performance 5 discussion 5 1 general findings the absolute values of the computed klds and biases are dependent on the choices made when approximating the posterior probability densities section 2 2 such as the width of the acceptance kernel of the aars algorithm algorithm 2 and the bandwidth of the kernel density function used to represent the probability densities for this reason we focus our discussion below on relative differences between datasets and test cases we first summarize the main results that apply to all test cases before discussing the test cases one by one after this we discuss broader implications of this research considering the ensemble statistics of 50 hydraulic conductivity realizations for each test case we find that the information content of d h measured by the kld is higher than d v which in turn is higher than d m for the three test cases considered m 1 table 1 m 2 table 2 and m 3 table 3 the added value of combining different data types d hv and d hvm is generally found to be comparatively low when considering individual hydraulic conductivity realizations and associated fields fig 4 we generally obtain relative rankings of the different data types that are consistent with those of the ensemble means given that we consider non ergodic model domains the actual locations of high and low hydraulic conductivities governed by the nuisance variable r plays an important role in the data generating process its impact is manifested by the comparatively high standard deviations of the kld estimates tables 1 3 and in the variability of the generated time series figs 5a c 7a c and 9a c despite this inherent stochastic variability we consistently find that the best constrained parameter is σ y 2 followed by iy and λ the individual test cases are discussed in detail below 5 2 lessons learned from the three test cases test case m 1 features a highly heterogeneous field k x with relatively small structures fig 4a for which one could possibly assume that ergodic conditions are fullfilled and consequently that the geostatistical parameters are well represented within the modelling domain yet it corresponds to the least constrained test case indeed the r realization plays here a very important role implying a rather weak mapping from the time series to the geostatistical parameters of interest to understand this note first that σh and σv are only sensitive to the underlying geostatistical parameters through the solute spreading patterns that these parameters induce indeed the electrical responses result from optimal current patterns established throughout the highly non ergodic and time evolving distribution of local concentrations i e conductivities that are in turn driven by the flow field q x as in the example in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity field k x has small scale structures and is close to isotropic fig 4a but its associated flow field q x exhibits pronounced channeling fig 4b this tendency of the flow field to concentrate in preferential flow channels for high σ y 2 is well known e g cvetkovic et al 1996 hence an ergodic k x is no guarantee of well sensed geostatistical parameters when using geoelectrically monitored saline tracer tests nevertheless compared to the prior the estimated marginal posterior densities suggest that the geostatistical model that needs a comparatively high σ y 2 fig 6a and very small or high iy fig 6b are unlikely test case m 2 corresponds to a layered distribution of hydraulic conductivity with a moderate σ y 2 the klds table 2 and consequently the constraining nature of the time series are much higher than for test cases m 1 table 1 and m 3 table 3 for m 2 the smallest variations between the r realizations are observed fig 7a c since the actual location of the flow channels is of secondary importance in the data generating process the hydraulic conductivity field fig 4d and its associated flow field fig 4e are visually more similar to each other than for m 1 this is a consequence of the large anisotropy factor imposing horizontally continuous structures within which the flow field channels are naturally developed both σh and m are highly sensitive to the arrival of horizontal connections that are established by the solute when it arrives to the outlet considering the marginal klds we find that high and low σ y 2 values are incompatible with the data fig 8a as is large iy for this test case m 2 λ is particularly interesting as its true value is high and therefore of low prior probability fig 8c we see a strong ability of all time series including σh to constrain this parameter test case m 3 is a highly heterogeneous test case that distinguishes itself from m 1 by its larger iy a consequence of the resulting larger structures is that the generated data vary widely between the different hydraulic conductivity realizations see insets in fig 9a c yet the klds table 3 are higher than for test case m 1 considering the marginal posterior pdfs all datasets indicate that the underlying geostatistical model has a high σ y 2 fig 10a at least a moderately high iy fig 10b and that the field is close to isotropic fig 10c 5 3 physical insights and open questions in our idealized numerical investigation we found consistently that geoelectrical data performed better than mass breakthrough data in constraining the geostatistical parameters this is a consequence of the fact that for a given geostatistical model the actual positioning of high and low hydraulic conductivity fields governed by the nuisance variable r has a larger impact on the mass breakthrough data than on the geoelectrical data e g compare the insets in fig 9a c we understand this as a consequence of the local flux averaged nature of the tracer breakthrough compared to the more integrative non linear volume averaging of the electrical responses over the concentration field additionally since m is only sensitive to the time evolution of the solute concentration field at the outlet it cannot determine the causality of the arrival times that is if they originate from large horizontal correlation scales or from high variance for instance we also found that σh always has a higher constraining power than σv this can be understood by noting that σh is sensitive to electrical conduction paths created by the concentration field in the flow direction leading to a very strong sensitivity to tracer arrivals at the outlet e g fig 2e or the generally steep slopes in the generated time series in the insets of figs 5a 7 a and 9 a in fig 11 we plot the generated current density distributions determining σh and σv for the concentration fields shown in figs 4c f and j we see that for σh figs 11a c the support of the current density field i e the regions of high current flow is almost coincident with the area occupied by the invading tracer driven by the flow field this does not occur for σv figs 11d f indicating why σh is more informative than σv clearly σv results from current patterns that are mainly constrained by vertical connection bottlenecks that become more common further away from the inlet region this can be appreciated by the high density of current field streamlines observed at the inlet regions in figs 11 d 1111e and 11f this suggests that the main ability of σv to sense the geostatistical parameters is through its sensitivity to the trailing end of the tracer front again it is the connectivity aspect of the electrical data that is at play our results also suggest a strong dependence on the injection type for a pulse injection we expect σh to be much less informative compared to the present continuous injection case as there will be no horizontal connections of salinity to sense that is the connectivity created by establishing a continuous concentration field across the domain is very helpful for electrical based inference of geostatistical properties from tracer tests for all test cases we find that σ y 2 is the best constrained parameter this is explained by the fact that σ y 2 controls the spreading rate of the solute e g gelhar and axness 1983 and is thus a first order feature of the time series it will determine the time spacing or pace of occurrence of the horizontal connection events as sensed particularly well by σh however also the trailing part of the tracer field as sensed by σv is affected by σ y 2 one open question is to what extent the electrical data can constrain mixing and spreading intuitively there should be a strong sensitivity to the spreading width as σh is highly sensitive to the front of the tracer plume and σv to its end since solute spreading ultimately controls solute mixing e g villermaux 2019 the high sensitivity of the electrical data to the former indicates that these data are able to at least quantify the mixing potential of the solute e g de dreuzy et al 2012 this will be the topic of future research furthermore the equivalent electrical conductivity tensor time series is determined by the time evolution of the concentration field which in turn is driven by the flow field this suggests that that the electrical data might be more strongly related with the flow field than the geostatistical model of log hydraulic conductivity in the future we plan to study the geoelectrical sensitivity to flow field descriptors e g koponen et al 1996 englert et al 2006 similarly we would like to relate the electrical data to concentration field descriptors however as the concentration field is time variant this is more challenging to summarize than the steady state flow field one possibility is to relate it to the spatial distribution of localized temporal moments of the solute concentration field cirpka and kitanidis 2000 5 4 implications for field based studies our work has several implications for field based and laboratory based electrical time lapse monitoring of tracer tests the first is that ignoring significant tracer concentration heterogeneity below a given scale will tend to underestimate mass when interpreting tomograms fig 3d and bias inferred transport parameters when performing a fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion this can be circumvented through appropriate geostatistics based time lapse hydrogeophysical inversions e g kowalsky et al 2005 provided that overly simple model parameterizations are avoided hinnell et al 2010 furthermore we demonstrate for non ergodic situations common to many hydrogeophysically monitored tracer tests that both the locations of high and low hydraulic conductivities in our case controlled by r and the geostatistical model have a strong impact on the measured data suggesting that inversion approaches should attempt to constrain both of these aspects laloy et al 2015 our results suggest that for a well designed time lapse experiment it might be possible to infer geostatistical parameters with relatively few measurement configurations that is without the need to actually resolve the tracer plume indeed all the inferences performed in this study are based on upscaled equivalent values at the scale of the experiment another implication is that strong geoelectrical responses are mainly linked to preferential current pathways that in clay free formations are dependent on a near continuous high salinity region between the current electrodes this suggests that continuous compared to pulse injections are preferable and that it could be beneficial to favor measurement configurations with one of the current electrodes located in the tracer source region i e in the pit in which injection is performed or in a packed off injection interval in a borehole it also suggests that using push pull technology for electrode installations thereby allowing for more of a 3 d localization of electrodes without associated borehole effects doetsch et al 2010 and costly boreholes could enable improved imaging by allowing the tracer to arrive to the electrodes pidlisecky et al 2006 furthermore unaccounted saline tracer heterogeneity should lead to anisotropic behavior at larger scales for instance when interpreting crosshole time lapse data with two boreholes using so called ab mn configurations current and potential electrodes in different boreholes leading to mainly vertical current patterns or am bn configurations one current and potential eletrode in each borehole leading to mainly horizontal current patterns bing and greenhalgh 2001 then it might be essential to account for anisotropy in the inversion to avoid inversion artifacts herwanger et al 2004 furthermore we expect that any inferred upscaled anisotropy measures such as anisotropy factors could guide the interpretation about the spatial organization of the concentration field below the resolution scale of the resulting tomograms e g different behaviors of σh and σv in fig 3d 6 conclusions we use approximate bayesian computation to assess to what extent equivalent electrical conductivity time series associated with tracer tests constrain geostatistical parameters governing small scale structure we consider an idealized set up in which local concentration and electrical conductivity is linearly and perfectly correlated implying that the results correspond to a best case scenario by considering three different geostatistical test models and ensemble statistics of 50 corresponding hydraulic conductivity field realizations we find that σh is the most informative data type followed by σv and m the added value of combining different time series is comparatively low we further find that σ y 2 is the best constrained geostatistical parameter followed by i y and λ the geostatistical parameters are the best constrained when considering data generated with a large λ ignoring concentration heterogeneity i e assuming well mixed conditions below a given scale leads to underestimated solute mass when interpreting electrical data this is a consequence of non linear averaging and suggests that hydrogeophysical data interpretations and coupled hydrogeophysical inversions need to consider highly resolved hydraulic conductivity fluid flow concentration and electrical simulations in order to avoid biased results casting the inference problem within a geostatistical framework decreases the number of electrical configurations needed to constrain the geostatistical parameters since the electrical data are primarily sensitive to the presence or not of a connected high concentration field between current electrodes we recommend experimental setups favoring continuous tracer injections including measurement configurations with one electrode located within the tracer injection area credit authorship contribution statement alejandro fernandez visentini writing original draft writing review editing methodology conceptualization software formal

374,we use approximate bayesian computation and the kullback leibler divergence measure to quantify to what extent horizontal and vertical equivalent electrical conductivity time series observed during tracer tests constrain the 2 d geostatistical parameters of multivariate gaussian log hydraulic conductivity fields considering a perfect and known relationship between salinity and electrical conductivity at the point scale we find that the horizontal equivalent electrical conductivity time series best constrain the geostatistical properties the variance controlling the spreading rate of the solute is the best constrained geostatistical parameter followed by the integral scales in the vertical direction we find that horizontally layered models with moderate to high variance have the best resolved parameters since the salinity field at the averaging scale e g the model resolution in tomograms is typically non ergodic our results serve as a starting point for quantifying uncertainty due to small scale heterogeneity in laboratory experiments tomographic results and hydrogeophysical inversions involving dc data keywords equivalent electrical conductivity approximate bayesian computation geostatistics solute spreading and mixing hydrogeophysics 1 introduction time lapse electrical geophysical methods are popular in hydrogeology e g binley et al 2015 singha et al 2015 as they provide non intrusive means for remote and dense spatio temporal sampling related to flow and transport processes among these the direct current dc method is cost effective easy to employ and probably the most commonly used binley et al 2015 it has been thoroughly assessed through numerical investigations e g vanderborght et al 2005 singha and gorelick 2005 fowler and moysey 2011 laboratory and controlled tank experiments slater et al 2000 koestel et al 2008 jougnot et al 2018 and field investigations e g daily et al 1992 binley et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 dc measurements are generally based on two pairs of electrodes one pair for establishing a known electrical current between two points and the other for measuring the resultant electrical voltage between two other points e g keller and frischknecht 1966 in the context of time lapse dc tomographic experiments the measurement process is repeated using multiple current and voltage electrode pairs at different positions and the measurement protocol is repeated over time such a measurement process is often referred to as time lapse electrical resistivity tomography ert and it outputs time series of electrical resistances voltage over injected current that in saturated media carry information about the time evolution of the salinity distribution e g lesmes and friedman 2005 the time lapse ert method has been applied during conservative saline tracer tests to extract both flow and transport information retrieval of hydraulic conductivity from such data is discussed for example in kemna et al 2002 and vanderborght et al 2005 and the range of applications span from the calibration of mean hydraulic conductivity values binley et al 2002 to retrieval of the full distribution of hydraulic conductivity pollock and cirpka 2012 extraction of solute transport parameters has been studied in detail and kemna et al 2002 for instance provided a field demonstration of retrieving equivalent 1 d stream tube advective dispersive transport parameters in the context of 3 d conservative saline transport results later corroborated numerically by vanderborght et al 2005 also koestel et al 2008 inferred the 3 d distribution of solute velocities and dispersivities in a soil column using time lapse ert data over time the use of geoelectrical monitored tracer tests has evolved from qualitative analyses such as saline plume motion detection and geometry delineation e g slater et al 2000 to obtain quantitative and spatially resolved hydrological constraints nevertheless using time lapse dc data for quantitative hydrogeological purposes remains a persistent challenge singha et al 2015 this challenge is intimately related to the use of time lapse inversion methodologies that provide resolution limited time evolving images of electrical resistivity or conductivity through time singha et al 2015 the most common approach to translate resulting geophysical time lapse tomograms into salinity distributions rests on two strong assumptions the first is that there exists a petrophysical relationship e g archie 1942 with known spatially invariant parameters defined at the discretization scale of the tomogram implying that it corresponds to the representative elementary volume rev scale hill 1963 of bulk electrical conductivity and consequently that the impact of salinity heterogeneity is negligible below this scale the second assumption is that the resolution of the geophysical tomogram is the same as the model discretization which is hardly true for any electrical survey in reality the tomogram represents spatially varying weighted averages over a much larger volume e g friedel 2003 with these two assumptions temporal differences in time lapse tomograms can readily be translated into estimates of salinity differences unfortunately this approach typically leads to an underestimation of actual tracer mass with errors often approaching one order of magnitude e g binley et al 2002 singha and gorelick 2005 laloy et al 2012 research has addressed the second assumption by upscaling the petrophysical relationship to the tomographic resolution using either linearized inverse theory day lewis et al 2005 nussbaumer et al 2019 or monte carlo based simulation approaches e g moysey et al 2005 in this work we are primarily concerned with the first assumption namely that the impact of salinity variations is negligible below a given scale to avoid complications inherent to tomographic imaging we focus here on the case of a time evolving equivalent electrical conductivity tensor of a 2 d square sample of unit length that is invaded by a saline i e electrically conductive tracer in a tomographic setting this scale can be thought of as the model resolution at a given location of interest for this case the equivalent electrical conductivity in a given direction is readily obtained basically by dividing the electric current with the imposed voltage the total current is the macroscopic flux of the internal current density field i e the distribution of small scale currents within the sample that for a given internal distribution of local conductivities is established such that its associated energy loss due to joule s dissipation integrated over the domain is minimized e g feynman et al 2011 bernabé and revil 1995 this governing principle leads to patterns of current channelling and deflection through and from high and low electrical conductivity zones respectively and it governs the time variations of the current density field as the saline tracer invades the sample e g li and oldenburg 1991 accurate prediction of the time evolution of the equivalent electrical conductivity of the medium thus requires accounting for interactions occurring throughout the domain and given an arbitrarily shaped time evolving electrical conductivity field this remains an open upscaling problem belonging to the family of conductivity upscaling in spatially non stationary fields e g sanchez vila et al 2006 and references therein the current lack of physically accurate upscaling procedures impedes reliable quantitative analyses of a saline plume s fate from geoelectrical monitoring for instance in the most common case where archie s petrophysical law archie 1942 is used to infer the mean saline concentration within the sample from its equivalent electrical conductivity the underlying assumption is that the internal electrical conductivity field behaves as an additive property that can be upscaled by taking its arithmetic average this is only true if the electrical conductivity field is constant or if its distribution is layered and the equivalent electrical conductivity is measured parallel to this layering corresponding to the upper wiener bound e g milton and sawicki 2003 in general since portions of the concentration field are by passed by the established current patterns the upper wienner bound does not apply and this leads to the above mentioned apparent mass loss as demonstrated for example in a recent laboratory study jougnot et al 2018 these issues also impact the performance of many fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion approaches and modeling studies that interpret equivalent electrical conductivity time series using equivalent transport parameters within an advective dispersive description e g kemna et al 2002 vanderborght et al 2005 koestel et al 2008 on a more positive note the discussion above also suggests that electrical conductivity time series at a given scale carry statistical information on the concentration field and its temporal evolution here we investigate to what extent tracer tests associated with time series of equivalent electrical properties a pre defined scale can be used to infer geostatistical properties of hydraulic conductivity fields below this scale this is achieved by considering inference within a bayesian inference framework e g gelman et al 2013 tarantola 2005 more specifically through an approximate bayesian computational approach e g beaumont et al 2002 sisson et al 2018 for comparison purposes the mass breakthrough curve is also evaluated and its information content is compared to its electrical peers using a bayesian approach allows assessing the information gained on the properties of interest with respect to their assumed prior statistics we perform our study using a database consisting of 105 synthetically generated equivalent electrical conductivity tensor and mass breakthrough time series collected during saline tracer tests within a 2 d domain with hydraulic heterogeneity prescribed by multivariate gaussian fields we consider advectively dominated solute transport i e high péclet numbers where the concentration field evolution is predominantly determined by the underlying flow field which in turn depends on the underlying hydraulic conductivity field under the constant applied pressure gradient in this study we consider idealized scenarios as it is assumed that there is no spatial variations in petrophysical properties and that the petrophysical relationship is known in section 2 we review the basic governing equations describing groundwater flow solute transport and electrical conduction together with their numerical implementations in section 3 we introduce the inference problem of interest along with the bayesian inference tools the main results are presented and discussed in sections 4 and 5 respectively section 6 concludes the paper 2 governing equations and problem setup 2 1 groundwater flow for steady state flow and in the absence of sources or sinks mass conservation of an incompressible fluid is expressed by the continuity equation for the specific discharge q x 1 q x 0 where x x y t denotes the 2 d position vector and x and y the horizontal and vertical coordinates respectively darcy s law relates q x with the hydraulic conductivity field k x and the hydraulic head h x via 2 q x k x h x adopting darcy s law the groundwater flow equation reads 3 k x h x k x 2 h x 0 it is customary to treat the log hydraulic conductivity field y x ln k x within a geostatistical framework with y x modelled as a second order spatially stationary ergodic random function in this study we consider multivariate gaussian random fields with an exponential covariance structure e g rubin 2003 with a mean μ y and a variance σ y 2 the integral scales of the field are expressed by the integral scale i y in the vertical direction and an anisotropy factor λ i x i y after specifying k x the flow field q x is obtained by solving eq 3 with prescribed boundary conditions section 2 4 2 2 2 solute transport the evolution of the concentration field c x t of a passive tracer being transported within the steady state flow field q x can be described within an eulerian framework using the advection dispersion equation 4 θ c x t t q x c x t θ d c x t 0 where θ is the porosity and d is the dispersion tensor in this study we assume a spatially constant porosity and dispersion tensor and furthermore we assume zero dispersivity in this case and considering eq 1 eq 4 simplifies to the advection diffusion equation with constant coefficients 5 θ c t q x c θ d m 2 c 0 where dm denotes the molecular diffusion coefficient after solving for c x t the flux weighted tracer mass breakthrough time series m t are defined by 6 m t γ o u t q x x c x t d x γ o u t q x x d x with q x x being the flow component in the x direction and γ out the outflow boundary of the model domain 2 3 dc conduction electric charge conservation is in the dc problem expressed by the continuity equation of the current density field j x t at time lapse acquisition time t in the absence of current sources and net accumulation of electric charge it takes the following form 7 j x t 0 ohm s law relates j x t with the electrical conductivity σ x t and the electric field e x t via the linear relationship j x t σ x t e x t adopting the quasistatic approximation e x t 0 allows to express e x t ϕ x t where ϕ x t is the electrical potential writing j x t in terms of ϕ x t as j x t σ x t ϕ x t and replacing this expression into eq 7 results in the governing laplace equation for the electrical potentials 8 σ x t ϕ x t σ x t 2 ϕ x t 0 we consider the horizontal and vertical components of the equivalent electrical conductivity tensor time series of a 2 d square sample of unit length this implies solving eq 8 with alternative mixed dirichlet neumann boundary conditions or excitation modes for σh t σv t a constant electrical potential difference δϕh δϕv along the horizontal vertical direction is imposed with zero electrical potential gradient along the top and bottom left and right boundaries the resulting electrical potential fields are respectively ϕ h x t and ϕ v x t the corresponding equivalent electrical conductivity time series are computed as 9 σ h t 1 δ ϕ h γ y σ x t x ϕ h x t d x and 10 σ v t 1 δ ϕ v γ x σ x t y ϕ v x t d x where the integration paths γ y and γ x are any two given contours separating the left and right boundaries and the top and bottom boundaries respectively and the integrands in each equation is the horizontal or vertical component of the current density field resulting from each excitation mode 2

hydraulic conductivity values relative to the mean value μy of the geostatistical model here μy is fixed at 6 while remaining parameters are treated as random variables m σ y 2 i y λ described by a joint probability density function pdf π m the variance σ y 2 is randomly drawn from a uniform pdf with support 0 5 5 the integral scale i y is drawn from a log uniform pdf with support l 25 l 2 m and the anisotropy factor λ i x i y is drawn from a uniform pdf with support 1 l i y i e conditionally on i y the discretization implies that heterogeneities obtained with the smallest integral scales are resolved with at least 10 cells in each direction the log uniform distribution of i y is here chosen to favor realizations with finely structured fields the generated sample of the geostatistical model parameters of size p 10 5 is represented in fig 1 note that each draw is associated with a unique r which together form a log hydraulic conductivity field realization 2 4 2 flow simulations the groundwater flow equation eq 3 is solved numerically using the open source finite difference solver modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 the prescribed boundary conditions are a horizontal head gradient of 0 05 inducing flow from left to right and no flow conditions for the top and bottom boundaries the head gradient value was chosen such that for a homogeneous field equal to exp μy the tracer arrival time occurs approximately at half of the simulated time duration of the tracer experiment in the simulations the hydraulic conductivity between two adjacent cells is taken as their harmonic mean the chosen numerical scheme used to solve the system of linear equations is the preconditioned conjugate gradient method hill 1990 2 4 3 transport simulations the advection diffusion equation eq 5 is solved using the groundwater solute transport simulator package mt3d usgs bedekar et al 2016 the initial condition is a homogeneous concentration field of 0 01 g l 1 and the boundary conditions are i constant concentration of 1 g l 1 along the left boundary ii no flux along the top and bottom boundaries and iii free flux along the right boundary the porosity is assumed constant and equal to 0 3 for the advection term in eq 5 the third order total variation diminishing tvd approach cox and nishikawa 1991 is used the tvd solver was found to be very robust and showed minimal numerical dispersion when benchmarked against planar fronts nevertheless in order to mask the small numerical dispersion the diffusion coefficient was slightly increased from d m 1 6 10 9 m 2 s 1 the standard value for the diffusion coefficient of salt in water to d m 2 10 8 m 2 s 1 the latter larger value is obtained by fitting the analytical solution for a concentration profile for a step injection in 1 d e g ogata and banks 1961 to a tvd calculated concentration profile obtained for a homogeneous hydraulic conductivity field equal to μy when the diffusion coefficient is imposed to be the one of salt in water each simulated tracer experiment lasts for 4 103 s and during this time period 400 equidistant samples c i x i 1 400 of the simulated concentration fields are recorded at times t i 1 δ t with δ t 4 10 3 s 400 10 s the injected tracer typically does not fully replace the initial background tracer at the end of the simulation period this is a consequence of the short simulation time imposed by computational constraints and large low velocity regions the mean péclet number is 6 103 defined as p e u d m where u is the tracer velocity for the constant hydraulic conductivity field 2 4 4 electrical simulations for each sampled concentration field c i x the 2 d square domain is alternatively excited by imposing an electrical potential difference of 1 v with a pair of line electrodes along either the vertical or horizontal boundaries of the sample the remaining boundaries are prescribed zero electrical potential gradient normal to the boundaries the resulting electrical potential fields ϕ i h x and ϕ i v x associated to the horizontal and vertical modes respectively are computed by numerically solving the laplace equation eq 8 with the finite element solver module of the python library pygimli rücker et al 2017 for simplicity the input electrical conductivity distribution σ i x used for solving the boundary value problems at each time step is assumed to be perfectly and linearly related to the transport simulation output c i x the resulting normalized dimensionless time series denoted as σh σv and m vary within 0 01 1 the data generation is summarized by the pseudo code in algorithm 1 3 inference problem we are interested in assessing to what extent the time series σh σv and m may constrain the geostatistical parameters m σ y 2 i y λ we consider the following five combinations of time series d h σ h d v σ v d m m d h v σ h σ v d h v m σ h σ v m the data vectors d h d v and d m are used to assess the individual performance of each type of time series d h v is used to evaluate the performance of electrical data alone and d h v m is used to evaluate the value of using all the data at the same time we cast the problem as a bayesian inference framework as outlined below 3 1 bayesian inference framework in a finite dimensional bayesian inference framework a model is described in terms of m random variables with realizations m m 1 m m that can be used as input to a physical forward simulator producing n simulated data d s i m f m e g gelman et al 2013 tarantola 2005 the prior probability density function π m is updated using bayes theorem to a posterior probability density function π m d o b s after considering the observed data d o b s d 1 d n using a likelihood function π d o b s m this function evaluates the likelihood of any model realization given and the residual error vector e d o b s d s i m and an assumed underlying observational noise model e g tarantola 2005 bayes theorem in its unnormalized form reads 11 π m d

the test cases m t described in section 4 2 for the electrical time series f m is formed by the sequential application of the following forward mappings i the realization of the hydraulic conductivity

bayesian inference monte carlo mc sampling can be used to approximate π m d o b s by a mc integration over a finite sample of the sought distribution e g mosegaard and tarantola 1995 gelman et al 2013 the simplest approach is acceptance rejection sampling ars which consists of drawing samples m proportionally to the prior density and accepting them as samples of the posterior density proportionally to their likelihood π d o b s m this is an exact sampling method e g mosegaard and tarantola 1995 and it can be used off line using a large ensemble of prior model realizations given that unlike in a markov chain mc mcmc sampling method there is no dependence between the model proposals its main disadvantage is that since the parameter search is unguided unlike mcmc the probability of acceptance decreases exponentially with the dimensionality m of the model parameter space as more dimensions are added to the problem the ratio of the hyper volume of high likelihood values regions of large acceptance probability to the total volume of the model space decreases exponentially to zero e g scales 1996 curtis and lomax 2001 this so called curse of dimensionality may result in unrealistically large prior model samples even when addressing only a handful of parameters in the context of this study we are interested in only three geostatistical parameters section 2 1 possibly suggesting that ars could be a good choice however when the scale of the modelling domain is insufficiently large compared to the integral scales of the field y x under consideration ergodic conditions are not fulfilled implying a potentially high dependence on r section 2 4 1 this high dimensional variable is different for each realization of y x and it ultimately controls the locations of high and low hydraulic conductivity regions even if we are uninterested in r as such it forms part of our data generation process and thus it enters the inference problem as a nuisance variable e g gelman et al 2013 that needs to be accounted for consequently our definition of the forward simulator given above has to be expanded to f m r assuming independence of m and r examples the actual inference problem to solve reads 12 π m r d o b s π d o b s m r π m π r to obtain the sought density we need to marginalize π m r d with respect to r 13 π m d π m r d d r due to its higher dimensionality more than 62 500 variables in our examples the problem expressed by eq 12 is practically impossible to handle with the formal bayesian ars algorithm for this reason we resort to an approximate version of the ars that is outlined in the following subsection 3 2 1 abc acceptance rejection sampling algorithm the ars algorithm implemented within an approximate bayesian computational abc framework labelled approximate acceptance rejection sampling aars algorithm from now on is an approximate sampling method that produces a smooth approximation of π m d the reader is referred to sisson et al 2018 for an overview on abc methods the aars algorithm requires two additional inputs i a distance metric ρ d s i m d o b s for comparing the calculated data with the observed data and ii a kernel density function k h ρ for weighting the distance metric and defining an acceptance probability together they replace the likelihood function in our work the distance metric ρ d s i m d o b s is taken as the l 1 norm 14 ρ d s i m d o b s 1 n 1 n d s i m d o b s and the kernel density is chosen to be a uniform function 15 k h ρ 1 0 ρ h 1 0 1 ρ h where the acceptance bandwidth h is chosen such that the 0 5 th percentile of the distribution of ρ ordered from the lowest to the highest distance are accepted in our case this means that k h ρ accepts the models producing the s 500 lowest distances out of the k 10 5 sampled prior samples the aars algorithm described in pseudo code in algorithm 2 proceeds similarly to the formal ars algorithm considering algorithm 2 it can be noticed that the aars algorithm draws samples from the joint distribution 16 π a a r s m r d d o b s k h ρ π d o b s d m r π m π r which when integrated over all generated data instances gives the aars approximation of the r marginalized posterior density 17 π a a r s m d o b s π a a r s m r d d o b s d d or 18 π a a r s m d o b s π m k h ρ π d o b s d m r d d as pointed out by sisson et al 2018 from eq 18 the aars can be interpreted as a formal bayesian ars algorithm using an approximated likelihood function that is a kernel density estimation kde of the true likelihood 19 π a a r s d o b s m r k h ρ π d o b s d m r d d for building the empirical posterior probability densities we perform kde over the samples obtained from π a a r s m d o b s for consistency the prior pdf section 2 4 1 is computed by performing kde over the generated sample of size p 10 5 the kde approach is described in the following subsection 3 2 2 multivariate kernel density estimation kde given a sample x x 1 x s of size s of m variate random vectors belonging to a common distribution described by the density g the kde estimator g of g is given by e g wand and jones 1994 20 g h x 1 s i 1 s k h x x i with the estimator function k h defined as 21 k h x h 1 2 k h 1 2 x where the kernel function k is a symmetric multivariate density furthermore h is the determinant of the m m bandwidth matrix h which is symmetric and positive definite in general and if the m variables are assumed independent it is diagonal with entries h i given as h i h σ i where h is the bandwidth parameter and σi the standard deviation of the ith component of the random variable the estimator of eq 20 is an average of kernel densities that are centered at the sample points and whose decay is controlled by h the particular choice of k does not substantially influence the performance of the kde approach but the choice of the bandwidth h defining h i e the tails of k is a most crucial aspect given that under or over smoothed estimators will be produced if it is taken too small or large respectively e g wand and jones 1994 in the present work k is chosen as the standard multivariate normal function 22 k h x 2 π n 2 h 1 2 e x p 1 2 x t h 1 x for h a common choice when dealing with unimodal distributions as the ones expected in this study is based on silverman s rule of thumb e g silverman 1986 23 h s 4 m 2 1 m 4 d 1 m 4 the reliability of the used information measure subsection 3 3 largely depends on the quality of the input density estimations provided by the kde approach e g budka et al 2011 considering the trade offs pertaining to the choice of h a manual tuning process was necessary which resulted in the choice of h 0 75 h s for the results presented herein 3 3 information measure kullback leibler divergence the degree of knowledge brought by the observed data d o b s pertaining to the geostatistical model parameters is evaluated by comparing our approximation of π m d o b s with π m the kullback leibler divergence kld kullback and leibler 1951 also termed relative information content tarantola 2005 is probably the most widely used quantitative measure for comparing pdfs 24 k l d π m d o b s π m π m d o b s l n π m d o b s π m d m where the base of the logarithm is taken as e giving the information in units of nats e g cover and thomas 2012 the integration of eq 10 is performed over the support of the densities and the kld is finite as the support of π m d o b s is contained in the support of π m e g cover and thomas 2012 the kld is zero when π m d o b s π m i e the data carry no information about the model parameters and it increases as the posterior becomes more compact with respect to the prior as a consequence of conditioning to the data note that when the prior and posterior densities are gaussian with the same mean but the standard deviation of the posterior is half the standard deviation of the prior then the kld is 0 27 nats since our samples are drawn from approximate posterior densities π a a r s m d o b s that are kde i e smoothed versions of the target densities π m d o b s eq 18 the chosen aars approach provides a conservative framework for assessing the information content in terms of the kld measure since it is always true that 25 k l d π a a r s m d o b s π m k l d π m d o b s π m which implies that the information content in the considered time series is at least as large as the estimates obtained by our analysis 4 results we first show two examples of generated data for end member cases of weak and strong hydraulic heterogeneity then we describe the results obtained for different geostatistical parameter value combinations in terms of the kld and bias measures in doing so we discuss results obtained for one r realization as well as ensemble statistics deduced from 50 r realizations 4 1 two examples of generated data fig 2 shows an example of data obtained for a weakly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field with σ y 2 i y λ 0 005 0 130 m 3 179 fig 2a resulting in an approximately constant flow field fig 2b the corresponding concentration field shown at the sampling time 103 s when the tracer occupies approximately 50 of the model domain displays an overall planar front fig 2c the time series of σh and σv fig 2d evolve according to the lower and upper wiener bounds these upscaling formulas for laminated materials e g milton and sawicki 2003 correspond to the harmonic and arithmetic means of the local electrical conductivities respectively the arithmetic averaging governing σv is manifested by linear scaling with time in this case σv forms an almost perfect predictor of the mean salinity μc within the sample σh on the contrary strongly underestimates μc for this case the mean velocity of the tracer front is given by the time derivative of σv fig 2e information that is available before the mass flux m time series shows any response these easily interpretable results are now contrasted with those obtained for a strongly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field defined with σ y 2 i y λ 5 111 0 085 m 1 028 the resulting field has small scale structures and is close to isotropic fig 3 a yet its associated flow field exhibits pronounced channeling fig 3b resulting in a highly heterogeneous concentration field fig 3c neither σh nor σv follow any known upscaling law they both start to vary much earlier than m fig 2d which only reacts when the tracer arrives at the outlet these early variations are clearly seen in the time derivatives of the electrical responses fig 2e which are non zero from the moment the tracer injection starts and exhibit small peaks that are related to internal connection events of the solute that are invisible to m both σh and m show a steep increase around 103 s and a large peak in their time derivatives corresponding to early breakthrough arrival for this case μc is at early times much larger than all data and is asymptotically approximated by m followed in order of magnitude by σh and σv 4 2 test cases we now apply the bayesian inference approach using three different combinations of the geostatistical model parameter values i m 1 4 70 0 06 m 1 50 this leads to a strongly heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field that is approximately isotropic and exhibits small structures fig 4a ii m 2 0 80 0 06 m 10 00 this leads to a mildly to moderately heterogeneous field that exhibits a high degree of layering fig 4d iii m 3 4 70 0 38 m 1 50 this leads to a highly heterogeneous field exhibiting large scale structures fig 4g in fig 4 example realizations of generated log hydraulic conductivity fields for the three test cases are shown together with their corresponding flow and concentration fields 4 3 information assessment of data types for each test case of the model vector m 50 datasets d j o b s section 3 are simulated using hydraulic conductivity fields created with different r realizations the forward responses are contaminated with noise having zero mean and a mean deviation of 0 005 representing 50 of the baseline electrical conductivity the evaluation of the different data types and geostatistical parameter values is considered both in terms of the ensemble of realizations ensemble performance and in terms of randomly picked single realizations i e the fields shown in fig 4 in addition to the estimated joint posterior pdf we also consider the corresponding marginal distributions to evaluate the ability of the data to constrain individual geostatistical parameters for the marginal analysis we also consider a relative bias measure computed as the ratio of the mean bias of the marginal posteriors with respect to the true values of m to the mean bias of the marginal priors with respect to the true values from now on we drop the superscript obs when referring to the observed conditioning data 4 3 1 test case m 1 table 1 summarizes the results obtained for test case m 1 when considering the joint klds obtained for the ensemble of realizations we find that d h v has the largest mean kld closely followed by d h v m the least informative data type d m has a mean kld that is 75 of the one for d h v while d h and d v have values in between the kld standard deviations have similar values among all the data types and represent 20 of the mean values we now turn to the results obtained for the fields in fig 4a c and the corresponding time series highlighted in fig 5a c for this specific realization the klds span a small range of only 13 also the ordering is different and the most and least informative data sets for this case are d h and d v respectively this illustrates together with the standard deviations of the klds discussed above the stochastic variations that are inherent under non ergodic conditions the variability in the generated data due to variations in the r realizations for a given geostatistical model is indicated by the insets in fig 5a c the posterior model samples obtained by the aars algorithm and used for building the empirical posterior pdfs for each type of data are shown in fig 5 the density distribution of these 3 d clouds of points convey a qualitative view of the ability of the different data types to constrain the geostatistical parameters no eye catching differences distinguish the different point clouds reflecting the rather similar values of the associated klds the klds computed for the marginal posterior pdfs labelled marginal klds from now on are the largest for σ y 2 followed by iy and λ that on average represent 50 and 25 of the klds of σ y 2 respectively we find that σ y 2 is best constrained by d h producing the largest marginal kld and the smallest bias for this parameter the poorest performance is achieved by d m that has both the smallest marginal kld and the largest bias this can be seen in the estimated marginal posterior probability density fig 6 a displaying a mass distribution which is the furthest away from the true value σ y 2 4 70 for iy on the contrary d m features the highest marginal kld and the smallest bias fig 6b the ability of the data to constrain λ is low fig 6c with d h v m featuring the highest marginal kld the relative mean biases are negatively correlated with the associated kld measure showing consistency between the two measures 4 3 2 test case m 2 table 2 summarizes the results obtained for test case m 2 when considering the joint posterior klds for the ensemble we find that d hvm is the most informative dataset followed by d h and d hv far behind featuring mean klds that are 60 of d hvm are d v and d m of the individual data sets we find that d h is much more informative than d v and d m the standard deviations have similar magnitudes and represent 20 35 of the mean values we now consider the results obtained using the time series fig 7a c obtained from the fields in fig 4d f the ranking for the joint klds are similar to the ensemble mean klds except that d h performs the best the point clouds of the posterior samples fig 7 clearly shows that d h fig 7a constrain the geostatistical model parameters much better than d v fig 7b and d m fig 7c the marginal klds are again the largest for σ y 2 followed by those of i y and λ we find that σ y 2 is the most constrained by d h and the least constrained by d m as reflected by their marginal klds and the compactness of their posterior pdfs fig 8 a all the marginal pdfs for σ y 2 exhibit a small bias towards larger variances with the smallest and largest biases exhibited for d hvm and d m respectively for i y the marginal kld associated with d h is well above the others fig 8b the secondmost and thirdmost best performing data set for this parameter are d hv and d hvm while d m performs the poorest the marginal klds and biases for λ fig 8b follow the ranking of i y for this test case m 2 the data better constrain the geostatistical parameters than for test case m 1 as reflected by generally much larger kld values 4 3 3 test case m 3 table 3 summarizes the performance of the different datasets for test case m 3 considering the ensemble statistics of the joint posterior klds we find that d hv has the largest mean kld closely followed by d hvm and d h again d m features the smallest mean kld with a values that is 63 of that for d hv the standard deviations are varying within 15 and represent 25 of the mean values we now consider the results from the data time series fig 9a c obtained from the fields in figs 4g i the joint kld for d h is the largest closely followed by d hv and d hvm their klds are 30 higher than the others the point clouds of posterior model realizations fig 9 are rather similar but the results obtained from d h fig 9a are more compact compared to d v and d m for instance there is minimal scatter in the λ direction c f fig 9b and the high σ y 2 is better constrained c f fig 9c the marginal klds are again the highest for σ y 2 followed by iy and λ the relative mean biases show a similar trend being smallest for σ y 2 the marginal probability densities for σ y 2 fig 10 a show that d h best constrain this parameter followed by d hv and d hvm the marginal kld for d h are only 10 larger than for d hv and d hvm but its bias is 30 lower note also that d m is strongly biased towards too low σ y 2 for iy and λ both klds and biases indicate that d h d hv and d hvm are the most informative while d v has the poorest performance 5 discussion 5 1 general findings the absolute values of the computed klds and biases are dependent on the choices made when approximating the posterior probability densities section 2 2 such as the width of the acceptance kernel of the aars algorithm algorithm 2 and the bandwidth of the kernel density function used to represent the probability densities for this reason we focus our discussion below on relative differences between datasets and test cases we first summarize the main results that apply to all test cases before discussing the test cases one by one after this we discuss broader implications of this research considering the ensemble statistics of 50 hydraulic conductivity realizations for each test case we find that the information content of d h measured by the kld is higher than d v which in turn is higher than d m for the three test cases considered m 1 table 1 m 2 table 2 and m 3 table 3 the added value of combining different data types d hv and d hvm is generally found to be comparatively low when considering individual hydraulic conductivity realizations and associated fields fig 4 we generally obtain relative rankings of the different data types that are consistent with those of the ensemble means given that we consider non ergodic model domains the actual locations of high and low hydraulic conductivities governed by the nuisance variable r plays an important role in the data generating process its impact is manifested by the comparatively high standard deviations of the kld estimates tables 1 3 and in the variability of the generated time series figs 5a c 7a c and 9a c despite this inherent stochastic variability we consistently find that the best constrained parameter is σ y 2 followed by iy and λ the individual test cases are discussed in detail below 5 2 lessons learned from the three test cases test case m 1 features a highly heterogeneous field k x with relatively small structures fig 4a for which one could possibly assume that ergodic conditions are fullfilled and consequently that the geostatistical parameters are well represented within the modelling domain yet it corresponds to the least constrained test case indeed the r realization plays here a very important role implying a rather weak mapping from the time series to the geostatistical parameters of interest to understand this note first that σh and σv are only sensitive to the underlying geostatistical parameters through the solute spreading patterns that these parameters induce indeed the electrical responses result from optimal current patterns established throughout the highly non ergodic and time evolving distribution of local concentrations i e conductivities that are in turn driven by the flow field q x as in the example in fig 2 the hydraulic conductivity field k x has small scale structures and is close to isotropic fig 4a but its associated flow field q x exhibits pronounced channeling fig 4b this tendency of the flow field to concentrate in preferential flow channels for high σ y 2 is well known e g cvetkovic et al 1996 hence an ergodic k x is no guarantee of well sensed geostatistical parameters when using geoelectrically monitored saline tracer tests nevertheless compared to the prior the estimated marginal posterior densities suggest that the geostatistical model that needs a comparatively high σ y 2 fig 6a and very small or high iy fig 6b are unlikely test case m 2 corresponds to a layered distribution of hydraulic conductivity with a moderate σ y 2 the klds table 2 and consequently the constraining nature of the time series are much higher than for test cases m 1 table 1 and m 3 table 3 for m 2 the smallest variations between the r realizations are observed fig 7a c since the actual location of the flow channels is of secondary importance in the data generating process the hydraulic conductivity field fig 4d and its associated flow field fig 4e are visually more similar to each other than for m 1 this is a consequence of the large anisotropy factor imposing horizontally continuous structures within which the flow field channels are naturally developed both σh and m are highly sensitive to the arrival of horizontal connections that are established by the solute when it arrives to the outlet considering the marginal klds we find that high and low σ y 2 values are incompatible with the data fig 8a as is large iy for this test case m 2 λ is particularly interesting as its true value is high and therefore of low prior probability fig 8c we see a strong ability of all time series including σh to constrain this parameter test case m 3 is a highly heterogeneous test case that distinguishes itself from m 1 by its larger iy a consequence of the resulting larger structures is that the generated data vary widely between the different hydraulic conductivity realizations see insets in fig 9a c yet the klds table 3 are higher than for test case m 1 considering the marginal posterior pdfs all datasets indicate that the underlying geostatistical model has a high σ y 2 fig 10a at least a moderately high iy fig 10b and that the field is close to isotropic fig 10c 5 3 physical insights and open questions in our idealized numerical investigation we found consistently that geoelectrical data performed better than mass breakthrough data in constraining the geostatistical parameters this is a consequence of the fact that for a given geostatistical model the actual positioning of high and low hydraulic conductivity fields governed by the nuisance variable r has a larger impact on the mass breakthrough data than on the geoelectrical data e g compare the insets in fig 9a c we understand this as a consequence of the local flux averaged nature of the tracer breakthrough compared to the more integrative non linear volume averaging of the electrical responses over the concentration field additionally since m is only sensitive to the time evolution of the solute concentration field at the outlet it cannot determine the causality of the arrival times that is if they originate from large horizontal correlation scales or from high variance for instance we also found that σh always has a higher constraining power than σv this can be understood by noting that σh is sensitive to electrical conduction paths created by the concentration field in the flow direction leading to a very strong sensitivity to tracer arrivals at the outlet e g fig 2e or the generally steep slopes in the generated time series in the insets of figs 5a 7 a and 9 a in fig 11 we plot the generated current density distributions determining σh and σv for the concentration fields shown in figs 4c f and j we see that for σh figs 11a c the support of the current density field i e the regions of high current flow is almost coincident with the area occupied by the invading tracer driven by the flow field this does not occur for σv figs 11d f indicating why σh is more informative than σv clearly σv results from current patterns that are mainly constrained by vertical connection bottlenecks that become more common further away from the inlet region this can be appreciated by the high density of current field streamlines observed at the inlet regions in figs 11 d 1111e and 11f this suggests that the main ability of σv to sense the geostatistical parameters is through its sensitivity to the trailing end of the tracer front again it is the connectivity aspect of the electrical data that is at play our results also suggest a strong dependence on the injection type for a pulse injection we expect σh to be much less informative compared to the present continuous injection case as there will be no horizontal connections of salinity to sense that is the connectivity created by establishing a continuous concentration field across the domain is very helpful for electrical based inference of geostatistical properties from tracer tests for all test cases we find that σ y 2 is the best constrained parameter this is explained by the fact that σ y 2 controls the spreading rate of the solute e g gelhar and axness 1983 and is thus a first order feature of the time series it will determine the time spacing or pace of occurrence of the horizontal connection events as sensed particularly well by σh however also the trailing part of the tracer field as sensed by σv is affected by σ y 2 one open question is to what extent the electrical data can constrain mixing and spreading intuitively there should be a strong sensitivity to the spreading width as σh is highly sensitive to the front of the tracer plume and σv to its end since solute spreading ultimately controls solute mixing e g villermaux 2019 the high sensitivity of the electrical data to the former indicates that these data are able to at least quantify the mixing potential of the solute e g de dreuzy et al 2012 this will be the topic of future research furthermore the equivalent electrical conductivity tensor time series is determined by the time evolution of the concentration field which in turn is driven by the flow field this suggests that that the electrical data might be more strongly related with the flow field than the geostatistical model of log hydraulic conductivity in the future we plan to study the geoelectrical sensitivity to flow field descriptors e g koponen et al 1996 englert et al 2006 similarly we would like to relate the electrical data to concentration field descriptors however as the concentration field is time variant this is more challenging to summarize than the steady state flow field one possibility is to relate it to the spatial distribution of localized temporal moments of the solute concentration field cirpka and kitanidis 2000 5 4 implications for field based studies our work has several implications for field based and laboratory based electrical time lapse monitoring of tracer tests the first is that ignoring significant tracer concentration heterogeneity below a given scale will tend to underestimate mass when interpreting tomograms fig 3d and bias inferred transport parameters when performing a fully coupled hydrogeophysical inversion this can be circumvented through appropriate geostatistics based time lapse hydrogeophysical inversions e g kowalsky et al 2005 provided that overly simple model parameterizations are avoided hinnell et al 2010 furthermore we demonstrate for non ergodic situations common to many hydrogeophysically monitored tracer tests that both the locations of high and low hydraulic conductivities in our case controlled by r and the geostatistical model have a strong impact on the measured data suggesting that inversion approaches should attempt to constrain both of these aspects laloy et al 2015 our results suggest that for a well designed time lapse experiment it might be possible to infer geostatistical parameters with relatively few measurement configurations that is without the need to actually resolve the tracer plume indeed all the inferences performed in this study are based on upscaled equivalent values at the scale of the experiment another implication is that strong geoelectrical responses are mainly linked to preferential current pathways that in clay free formations are dependent on a near continuous high salinity region between the current electrodes this suggests that continuous compared to pulse injections are preferable and that it could be beneficial to favor measurement configurations with one of the current electrodes located in the tracer source region i e in the pit in which injection is performed or in a packed off injection interval in a borehole it also suggests that using push pull technology for electrode installations thereby allowing for more of a 3 d localization of electrodes without associated borehole effects doetsch et al 2010 and costly boreholes could enable improved imaging by allowing the tracer to arrive to the electrodes pidlisecky et al 2006 furthermore unaccounted saline tracer heterogeneity should lead to anisotropic behavior at larger scales for instance when interpreting crosshole time lapse data with two boreholes using so called ab mn configurations current and potential electrodes in different boreholes leading to mainly vertical current patterns or am bn configurations one current and potential eletrode in each borehole leading to mainly horizontal current patterns bing and greenhalgh 2001 then it might be essential to account for anisotropy in the inversion to avoid inversion artifacts herwanger et al 2004 furthermore we expect that any inferred upscaled anisotropy measures such as anisotropy factors could guide the interpretation about the spatial organization of the concentration field below the resolution scale of the resulting tomograms e g different behaviors of σh and σv in fig 3d 6 conclusions we use approximate bayesian computation to assess to what extent equivalent electrical conductivity time series associated with tracer tests constrain geostatistical parameters governing small scale structure we consider an idealized set up in which local concentration and electrical conductivity is linearly and perfectly correlated implying that the results correspond to a best case scenario by considering three different geostatistical test models and ensemble statistics of 50 corresponding hydraulic conductivity field realizations we find that σh is the most informative data type followed by σv and m the added value of combining different time series is comparatively low we further find that σ y 2 is the best constrained geostatistical parameter followed by i y and λ the geostatistical parameters are the best constrained when considering data generated with a large λ ignoring concentration heterogeneity i e assuming well mixed conditions below a given scale leads to underestimated solute mass when interpreting electrical data this is a consequence of non linear averaging and suggests that hydrogeophysical data interpretations and coupled hydrogeophysical inversions need to consider highly resolved hydraulic conductivity fluid flow concentration and electrical simulations in order to avoid biased results casting the inference problem within a geostatistical framework decreases the number of electrical configurations needed to constrain the geostatistical parameters since the electrical data are primarily sensitive to the presence or not of a connected high concentration field between current electrodes we recommend experimental setups favoring continuous tracer injections including measurement configurations with one electrode located within the tracer injection area credit authorship contribution statement alejandro fernandez visentini writing original draft writing review editing methodology conceptualization software formal
