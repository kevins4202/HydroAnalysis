4840,remote sensing products have been widely used in water resources assessment and management however the accuracy varies in different products water budget closure provides an important breakthrough for better assessing the uncertainties and quantifying error sources of satellite based data products using water budget imbalance especially in ungauged basins where conventional verification methods are not applicable however the commonly used assessment methods mainly refer to closure residual of water budget δ re s or its proportion to corresponding mean precipitation p δ re s p which have apparent limitations due to the dimensional effects in the former method and the high dependence on precipitation in the latter one more critically these two methods do not consider measured values referring to in situ values in gauged basins or average values of multiple satellite products in ungauged basins as in this study as benchmarks of water budget components in the assessment of satellite based hydrological data products resulting in a wrong choice because the closure result is subject to the mutual cancellation in the errors of water budget components from different satellite based products this study proposes a novel error based method to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products for both gauged and ungauged basins based on water budget equation measured values and the omission error oe which is generally overlooked in existing studies the method is applied to a typical closed basin the tarim river basin trb of china to verify the applicability and reliability of the proposed method sixty combinations of water budget components from various satellite sources can be designed based on five precipitation p products four evapotranspiration et products and three terrestrial water storage change twsc products first order reliability method form is employed to assess the reliability of water budget closure results caused by the errors of satellite sources the results indicated that different combinations produced different annual δ re s and δ re s p indicating great water budget closure errors for different combinations due to errors in different satellite sources the oe error from satellite based hydrological data products of water budget components clearly showed a greater impact on water budget imbalance than water budget components indicating that oe error is important for understanding quality of satellite products by comparing the results of δ re s and δ re s p it can be seen that our proposed method had great advantages in assessment of satellite products with a low dependence on p and a better comparability between different combinations the value of our assessment criterion ranges from 0 to 1 which is easier to understand in practice the combinations of water budget components from trmm 3b43 p gpm 3imerghh p gldas noah025 et and grace twsc products show satisfactory water budget closure results in trb using our proposed method the proposed method provides a new aspect for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products especially in ungauged basins which provides insights into water resources management in basins keywords remote sensing water budget closure error analysis tarim river basin 1 introduction remote sensing has been used and will be continuously used in many fields due to its advanced technical development particularly in water resources management satellite based hydrological data products mainly referring to precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage tws provide plenty of valuable information necessary for hydrologic analysis such as floods and droughts which is critical to water resources management cui et al 2019 hassan et al 2020 shao et al 2019 currently a number of satellite based hydrological data products from recent and ongoing satellite missions have been retrieved at various time and space scales for example the long term global precipitation products retrieved by the combination of microwave and infrared satellite measurements such as the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg khan and maggioni 2019 sahoo et al 2011 shen et al 2020 the large scale global et products retrieved using energy balance scheme penman monteith method priestley taylor method and hargreaves method such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis paca et al 2019 the global twsc products derived from the measurement of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2019 lv et al 2017 wouters et al 2019 and the global surface runoff and baseflow products obtained from large scale terrestrial hydrological models driven by long term satellite remote sensing products such as the surface and subsurface runoff simulation from the global land data assimilation system gldas xie et al 2019 although these satellite based hydrological data products can be verified in areas with measured data large uncertainties are still inevitable due to sparse gauges and measurement stations especially in less developed countries where in situ measurements are rare or even not existent bui et al 2020 sheffield et al 2009 to make matters worse there is no methods to evaluate the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in ungauged basins therefore they might still show significant differences in time and spatial variability making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of satellite products munier et al 2014 fortunately water storage changes are linked to p et and r via the terrestrial water budget equation forming a hydrological system meaning that water budget closure can provide an opportunity to verify the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in gauged and especially in ungauged basins assessment of water budget closure has become a basic condition for verifying the reliability of hydrological data products and has been widely concerned in research and application fields dagan et al 2019 pan and wood 2006 rodell et al 2015 abera et al 2017 proulx et al 2013 aires 2014 soltani et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in literature the most commonly used methods for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure are the closure residual of water budget δ re s p e t r t w s c usually defined as water budget imbalance the ratio of this residual to corresponding average precipitation p δ re s p or a combination of both methods by combining multiple available satellite data products of p et r and twsc denager et al 2020 moreira et al 2019 wang et al 2014a 2014b sahoo et al 2011 soltani et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 for example sahoo et al 2011 concluded a 5 to 25 closure residual of water budget relative to mean annual precipitation using various satellite based products in 10 basins over the world soltani et al 2020 studied the seasonal variation of water budget closure based on different satellite sources using methods of δ re s and δ re s p there is no doubt that both methods can help intuitively illustrate water budget closure errors caused by the uncertainties of hydrological data products in gauged and ungauged basins and play a significant role in water resources management however the aforementioned methods also show some common limitations due to the lack of consideration of measured values of water budget components which may result in a false closure result due to mutual cancellation in the errors of water budget components from various satellite sources for example a good closure result with small δ re s or δ re s p does not mean that satellite products of water budget components are absolutely satisfactory because parallel estimation errors of water budget components from these satellite products may cause values of them to be canceled to each other resulting in a closure residual of zero parallel error situation therefore one cannot conclude that retrieved data products of water budget components have a good quality in this situation due to the lack of comparison with measured values sahoo et al 2011 in addition the results of δ re s p has a high dependence on magnitude of precipitation p resulting in the incomparability of results in different basins even worse a good closure residual may lead to a poor result of δ re s p in arid basins due to the small precipitation and conversely a poor closure residual may achieve a good result of δ re s p in humid basins due to the large precipitation therefore the introduction of a benchmark measured values into currently used assessment methods is urgently needed to ensure that both the total error and the closure error of satellite based hydrological data products are satisfactory to solve this an important error term named as the omission error oe of water budget components the error between measured and true values is derived based on water budget equation as an intermediate process for quantifying the total error of water budget the sum of data errors and oe error of water budget components with respect to the oe error it is well known that water budget equation requires the true values of input variables to ensure the exact balance between both sides of the equal sign however the measured values of water budget components are not equal to their true values therefore in addition to data error between estimated and measured values for each water budget component there is an error term measuring the difference between measured and true values of water budget components this widespread and well known error term is called the oe error in this study it is noted that although we cannot quantify the oe error for each water budget component due to the unknow true values the sum of oe errors of all water budget components can be quantified using water budget closure see section 2 4 for detail which provides an important opportunity to verify the satellite based hydrological data products based on the above analysis an error based method composed of two indexes the total error of water budget closure used for assessing data errors of satellite products between estimated and measured values and the non closure degree of water budget changing from 0 to 1 used for verifying closure errors of satellite products is proposed to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in gauged and ungauged basins the proposed method was applied to the trb to verify the reliability of this method by comparing with δ re s and δ re s p sixty combinations of water budget components from five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products are designed to achieve this purpose in summary the questions to be addressed in this study are 1 how do different combinations of water budget components from multiple satellite products and reanalyze data products affect water budget imbalance by using methods of δ re s and δ re s p 2 how does the oe error term affect water budget imbalance compared to water budget components p et r and twsc and 3 what is the reliability of the proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure in practical applications these questions are answered by analyzing assessment results of water budget closure using methods of δ re s and δ re s p and the method proposed in this study based on sixty satellite data combinations from five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products first closure residuals of these sixty combinations from various satellite sources are compared to show the impact of different combinations on results of δ re s second combinations of satellite sources with small δ re s reflecting good closure results are selected and then the differences of δ re s p for these selected combinations are compared to show the high dependence of this method on precipitation in assessment of hydrological data products third combinations with poor medium and good δ re s p results are selected for analyzing contribution of oe errors to water budget imbalance and verifying the results of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products finally form is employed to verify the reliability of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products this paper is organized as follows study area and satellite data products used in this study are briefly introduced in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively section 2 3 mainly introduces water budget equation and corresponding satellite data processing procedure section 2 4 focuses on the derivation of oe error term and hydrological data product assessment method proposed in this study section 2 5 is a brief introduction of form method for verifying the reliability of our proposed method section 3 presents results and discussion about water budget closure analysis used for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products based on different combinations of water budget components at monthly and annual scales using δ re s and δ re s p and the method proposed in this study the last section summarizes our conclusions of this study the results can provide a novel perspective for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trb with a total area of about 1 02 106 km2 is the largest inland river basin in china xu et al 2019 and is surrounded by high mountains like tien shan eastern pamir kunlun and karakorum mountains see fig 1 the basin has a typically closed and independent hydrological system with no surface outflow and negligible subsurface outflow wang et al 2013 the mainstream of tarim river is about 1321 km with the confluence of three tributaries i e the aksu the yarkand and the hotan rivers in headwater of the basin huang et al 2018 however only the aksu river is the perennial tributary supplying 70 80 of the discharge to the entire tarim river system guo et al 2013 yang et al 2019 precipitation is unevenly distributed over space and time in the basin the annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 500 mm at the mountain areas and about 50 80 mm at the basin plain areas mainly covered by the taklamakan desert su et al 2016 highest precipitation is typically recorded in june july and august tao et al 2011 runoff is mainly generated by precipitation and glacier snow meltwater in upper mountainous regions where glacier snow meltwater accounts for 38 5 gao et al 2010 recent studies have indicated that temperature and precipitation have increased significantly in the trb over the period from 1961 to 2014 at rates of as much as 0 26 c 10a and 6 19 mm 10a respectively shen et al 2013 hartmann et al 2016 the increase of temperature caused an increase in glacier snow meltwater tao et al 2011 li et al 2020 therefore water budget components are changing in trb due to the complex land cover covered by ice snow and large scale desert climate change and characteristics of runoff which is mainly generated by precipitation and glacier snow meltwater in upper mountainous regions xu et al 2019 huang et al 2018 special land cover and hydrological features make it a typical case study for verifying our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure 2 2 satellite data products used in this study satellite data products of water budget components used in this study are summarized in table 1 multiple products are considered for individual component of water budget in total five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products are collected and considered in this study the precipitation products include trmm 3b43 gpm 3imerghh persiann cdr chirps and era5 among which the first three are satellite products and the last era5 is the atmospheric reanalysis product these precipitation products are derived from different satellite sensors i e infrared and microwave and different inversion methods the application and comparison of these products can help understand the influence of these factors on the accuracy of water budget closure the et products include gldas noah025 3h fldas noah01 c gl m mod16a2 and terraclimate among which the first two are global land data assimilation products that ingests satellite and ground based observational datasets mod16a2 is the result of modeling actual et using energy balance scheme by the penman monteith method and terraclimate is an interpolation product from the worldclim dataset and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 although the products of gldas noah025 3h fldas noah01 c gl m and terraclimate also produce precipitation products we did not consider them due to the following reasons on the one hand the selected precipitation products above have involved different types of satellite sensors or inversion methods in addition they are bias corrected and the accuracy of these products is verified in many basins over the globe hobeichi et al 2020a 2020b khan and maggioni 2019 sahoo et al 2011 on the other hand the same data sources used to derive precipitation and et might cause the high correlation between precipitation and et and then affect the accuracy comparison between our proposed method and the commonly used budget closure assessment methods because the first step of verifying our proposed method is to select combinations of water budget components with good δ re s and then combine with good medium and poor δ re s p for verifying the applicability and reliability of our proposed method see sections 3 2 and 3 3 for detail the high data correlation can easily lead to the good δ re s azarderakhsh et al 2011 pan et al 2012 and affect the selection of combinations for method comparison twsc products are derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace produced with different preprocessing and postprocessing by three centers csr u texas center for space research gfz geoforschungszentrum potsdam and jpl nasa jet propulsion laboratory munier et al 2014 all these data products are collectively referred to as satellite data products in this study for easy notation although some of them are reanalysis and data assimilation products we do not consider runoff in this study because trb is a typically closed basin with no or negligible outflow and outflow with respect to basins that have surface or and subsurface inflow or and outflow they should be considered as it is an important component of water budget the precipitation and et products are considered based on data availability in google earth engine gee which is a platform providing scientific communities with plenty of freely available satellite remote sensing data grace is currently the only global satellite observation system for twsc it is worth noting that grace products of twsc are available at monthly time scale and can only be used for large river basins about 300 km due to its coarse spatial resolution sahoo et al 2011 in addition grace products of twsc are not continuous on a monthly scale there may be no observation data in some months the gap in grace data in missing months are filled with the average value of the previous and following months soltani et al 2020 if there is no observation data for consecutive months linear regression analysis is employed for interpolating missing data all data products of water budget components used in this study are aggregated to a temporal resolution of 1 month by data summation and remapped to the basin scale by data averaging before performing the analysis of water budget closure at the basin scale 2 3 water budget equation this section briefly describes water budget equation and required postprocessing of its input variables due to gravitational anomalies of grace satellite products terrestrial water budget can be defined as the balance between the change in water storage δtwsc and the difference between the incoming water fluxes of precipitation and outgoing fluxes of et and streamflow r in basins sahoo et al 2011 therefore the general water budget model in time t can be expressed as 1 δ t w s c n t 1 t n p t r t e t t d t where δtwsc is the change in terrestrial water storage t is the time such as one month n is the number of t such as 12 months in a year p is precipitation r is streamflow et is evapotranspiration since twsc of grace is the change in equivalent water thickness relative to a time mean baseline monthly gravitational anomalies relative to a 2004 2010 time mean baseline it should be postprocessed by the difference of two adjacent observed values before being substituted into water budget model soltani et al 2020 2 δ t w s c j t w s c j t w s c j 1 where δtwscj is the postprocessed change in water storage in month j twscj and twscj 1 are observed changes in water storage of grace in month j and j 1 respectively accordingly water budget components p r et from various satellite data products should be adjusted by average of two adjacent values due to the postprocessing of twsc therefore changes in twsc can also be described as 3 δ w j 1 2 p j p j 1 1 2 r j r j 1 1 2 e t j e t j 1 since water budget model reflects an ideal water cycle process δtwscj is not equal to δwj therefore closure residual of water budget can be calculated as 4 δ re s j δ t w s c j δ w j where δresj is closure residual of water budget in j month 2 4 the method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure this section mainly describes derivation processes of oe error of water budget and the method proposed in this study for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure data errors of water budget components are first calculated the specific derivation process of oe error is then introduced finally the method for calculating non closure degree ncd closure degree cd of water budget and contributions of each error terms to water budget imbalance for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products are introduced the specific processes are described as follows 1 data errors of water budget components data errors of water budget components ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d are expressed using the absolute error based on satellite retrieved and measured values as follows 5 ε i d v i e v i m where i is the i th water budget component p et r twsc ε i d is the absolute error of the i th component v i e is the estimated value of the i th component i e the satellite data products in this study and v i m is the measured value of the i th component 2 derivation of oe error of water budget the oe error is derived from water budget equation it is easy to understand that true values of water budget components can be represented using their satellite retrieved values and corresponding error terms as follows 6 p t p e ε p e t t e t e ε et r t r e ε r δ t w s c t δ t w s c e ε twsc where p t e t t r t δ t w s c t refers to assumed true values of water budget components p e e t e r e δ t w s c e are satellite retrieved values of water budget components and ε p ε et ε r ε twsc are corresponding signed error terms of water budget components by substituting eq 6 into water budget equation δ t w s c t p t r t e t t the following expression can be obtained 7 p e e t e r e δ t w s c e ε et ε r ε twsc ε p we approximately assume that the true value for each water budget component is equal to the sum of its satellite retrieved value data error and oe error therefore according to description of oe error in section 1 and the fact that the merged value of multiple satellite products is close to the true values error terms in eq 7 can be further decomposed into the sum of data errors calculated in eq 5 and oe errors as follows 8 ε p ε p d ε p o ε et ε et d ε et o ε r ε r d ε r o ε twsc ε twsc d ε twsc o where ε p o ε et o ε r o ε twsc o are omission error terms of water budget components by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and letting ε o ε twsc o ε et o ε r o ε p o 9 p a ε p d ε p o e t a ε et d ε et o r a ε r d ε r o δ s t g a ε twsc d ε twsc o finally we can obtain the sum of oe error ε o of water budget components 10 ε o p a e t a r a δ t w s c a ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d where ε o is the sum of oe errors of water budget components 3 the method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure the closure residual of water budget δres is calculated in eq 4 the total error of water budget can be expressed as ε wbc ε o ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d we calculate the sum of absolute values to avoid the multiple cancellation of errors in water budget components resulting in a false closure in general a set of satellite retrieved water budget component products p et r and twsc can be considered satisfactory if the following conditions are met first we expect that the total error of water budget ε wbc is as small as possible to reduce the gap between satellite retrieved and true values avoiding multiple cancellation of errors in water budget components of water budget components this kind of error is also what we try to reduce in data production of water budget components second we expect that closure residual of water budget δres caused fully by satellite inversion based on different sensors and inversion algorithms accounts for a small proportion of the total water budget error ε wbc to result in a small water budget imbalance therefore the index of ε wbc and the percentage of δres to ε wbc are employed to assess water budget closure in this study and the latter is defined as no closure degree ncd of water budget as follows 11 ncd δ re s ε o ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d δ re s ε wbc 12 cd 1 n c d 1 δ re s ε wbc where cd is the closure degree of water budget and ncd is the no closure degree of water budget both changes from 0 to 1 the contribution of the data error for each water budget component or the sum of oe error of all water budget components to water budget imbalance can be assessed as follows 13 co n i ε i ε wbc where ε i is the data error of the i th water budget component p et r twsc in eq 5 or the oe error in eq 10 co n i is the contribution degree of the i th error term to water budget imbalance the larger the value the greater the influence of the error term to water budget imbalance 2 5 first order reliability method the form is a widely used method for analyzing the structural reliability of the studied system zhao et al 2020 the method uses a limit state function lsf defined by taylor expansion in eq 14 to approximate the failure function of the studied system soltani et al 2020 the method was then used to calculate the shortest distance between the failure surface and the origin in the space of the reduced variables with the constraint of g y 0 by finding a point y called the most probable failure point the shortest distance is called the reliability index β y see soltani et al 2020 for detailed application processes of this method 14 g y l t g y m g y m t y y m where g y is the failure function of hydrologic system quantified by water budget closure l t is the linearization of the lsf y y1 y2 yn is the vector of n variables in g y function ym is the expansion point and g y is the first order gradient vector of g y after reliability index β was calculated the failure probability of hydrologic system can be approximated by 15 p f φ β where pf is the failure probability of hydrologic system the smaller the value the lower the uncertainties in water budget component products and the higher the reliability of hydrologic system φ β is the cumulative distribution of the standard normal variate madsen et al 1986 in this study the form is used to validate the results of ncd used for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products using water budget closure the failure function g y of hydrologic system is defined as follows 16 g y ncd n c d p δ re s ε m ε et ε r ε twsc ε p n c d p where ncdp is the state limit of water budget closure error that can be accepted we set the value to be 0 2 because many current studies showed that the closure residual of water budget based on satellite based products is between 5 and 25 of corresponding average precipitation long et al 2014 sahoo et al 2011 we considered that when ncd of hydrologic system is less than 0 2 the data of water budget components from satellite based products is satisfactory 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of water budget components fig 2 shows the temporal variation of various satellite data products of water budget components from 2003 to 2017 in trb the precipitation values of the five products showed similar seasonal variation with peak and bottom values appeared in nearly the same months however magnitudes of these precipitation products were clearly different and the reanalysis product of era5 with the monthly average precipitation changing between 2 88 and 60 93 mm had greater values than the remaining four rs retrieved products with the monthly average precipitation changing between 0 05 and 60 93 mm in the trb this is caused by the difference in algorithms of dataset production between reanalysis and rs retrievals era5 product is predicted by combining model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics copernicus climate change service 2017 however satellite products are retrieved using observed data from infrared microwave sensors of multiple satellites therefore the results of these two kinds of products may show differences especially in regions without verification by measured values some studies over the globe have verified that era5 is more likely to overestimate precipitation than satellite based products over the drier regions and even the wetter regions amjad et al 2020 chen et al 2020 the satellite estimates differ significantly for individual river basins has been verified by some studies although the phase of the seasonal cycles of these satellite estimated products agrees well wang et al 2015 the monthly averaged et products showed the same seasonal cycle variation as that of p the difference in magnitudes was also evident the monthly averaged et changed between 0 and 30 92 mm without considering mod16a2 which changed between 16 01 and 40 75 mm in trb therefore the mod16a2 et in the basin was obviously greater than other products this is because mod16a2 product has nodata in the central part of the basin covered mainly by the taklimakan desert see fig 3 and we calculate the average of et over the basin based on pixels with et values as a result for the mod16a2 product only the surrounding area of the basin mainly covered by mountains with high et values are averaged regarding as the average of et over the basin the twsc of grace csr and grace jpl products showed similar temporal variations with the value changing between 22 71 and 36 73 mm but the changes were very different from grace gfz with the value changing between 77 95 and 67 27 mm in trb fig 3 showed an obvious spatial variation of water budget components with high value areas in surrounding boundaries and low value areas in center of the basin due to significant differences of land cover in trb more importantly in addition to twsc the spatial distribution of water budget components was obviously different for different products this distributional difference of water budget components may affect results of water budget closure however it is difficult to conclude which data set is better we considered them all in forming different combinations in this study for analyzing the impact of different combinations on water budget closure so as to reflecting the quality of satellite data products 3 2 water budget closure residuals from different satellite product combinations this section assesses satellite based hydrological data products by analyzing the impact of different satellite data combinations on water budget closure using δ re s and δ re s p and verifies the high dependence of δ re s p on p fig 4 gives the closure residuals of sixty combinations of water budget components from which it can be seen that closure residuals of water budget changed from 50 to 50 mm month in trb and most of them changed from 20 to 20 mm month the results were consisted with most studies in other basins sahoo et al 2011 kurkute et al 2020 these illustrated that different combinations of water budget components from various satellite products greatly affected closure residuals of water budget it is worth noting that the difficulty to close water budget due to the insufficient accuracy of individual datasets and their inconsistencies had been discussed in most previous studies azarderakhsh et al 2011 therefore some experiments have been conducted to close water budget by using assimilation strategies hobeichi et al 2020ae 2020bf 2020ag 2020bh sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 munier et al 2014 even if it is impossible for any single satellite sensor instrument to measure all the water budget components simultaneously wang et al 2015 this maybe one of reasons for determining good closure residuals in different combinations in order to verify results of δ re s p for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products twenty four combinations with small δ re s were selected in table 2 based on the following two principles 1 the absolute value of monthly averaged residual δ re s was less than 8 mm to ensure a good closure for selected combinations we used 8 mm as a threshold because many combinations meet this condition in trb 2 the distance between upper and lower quartiles of closure residuals was less than 15 mm for restricting temporal fluctuations of closure residuals fig 5 gives the annual δ re s p for the selected twenty four combinations it can be seen that annual averaged δ re s p changes from 0 10 to 0 54 except for combinations of gpm gldas csr and gpm gldas jpl with δ re s p values of 1 14 and 1 13 respectively this showed that the value of δ re s p was not from 0 to 1 although closure residuals of these combinations were small their results of δ re s p vary greatly showing a great impact of different combinations of water budget components from various satellite products on water budget closure greater values of gpm gldas csr and gpm gldas jpl were mainly caused by the small precipitation of gpm compared to other precipitation products see fig 2 resulting in the large results of δ re s p for these combinations due to the small denominators this illustrated the high dependence of this method on precipitation value in assessment of satellite data products in addition to these two combinations 60 combinations showed values of δ re s p changed between 0 10 and 0 30 and 40 combinations changed between 0 30 and 0 54 in trb in literature some studies concluded that water budget closure errors of δ re s p in most their studies areas changed from 0 05 to 0 25 5 to 25 in the form of percentage long et al 2014 sahoo et al 2011 there are also studies concluded greater results of δ re s p such as 0 30 wang et al 2014a and even from 3 00 to 1 30 soltani et al 2020 3 3 errors and closure degree of water budget for assessing satellite data products this section focuses on the comparison of oe errors and water budget component errors and the application and comparison of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components it is worth noting that measured values of water budget components are necessary in our proposed method as they are benchmarks for calculating data errors of water budget components in eq 5 however to ensure enough measured values is difficult for each water budget component in some basins even worse satellite based products of water budget components are provided at the grid scale without sufficiently fine spatial observations to validate the products of water budget components zhang et al 2018 therefore the following two situations should be considered in our proposed method if there are enough measured values in assessment basins we can substitute them into equations in section 2 4 as benchmarks to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products therefore the proposed method with consideration of measured values can more effectively evaluate the accuracy of hydrological data products from aspects of the closure error and the total error of water budget however if there are no measured values in ungauged basins the merged results of multiple satellite products can be used to substitute the measured values this substitution can effectively compare the gap between the data product to be verified and merged multiple data products for each water budget component while avoiding parallel error situations mentioned above many studies concluded that the merged results of multiple satellite products are closer to measured values of water budget components abera et al 2017 proulx et al 2013 aires 2014 yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 because merged results of multiple satellite products can better reduce systematic bias which had been minimized during product production and random errors which are hard to avoid of water budget components compared to the single one therefore one prefers to replace measured values by the merged values of multiple satellite products in the absence of sufficient measured data in literature many merging technologies are applied in specific studies including the error uncertainty based method the linear weighting method and the ensemble mean of multiple products munier et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 yao et al 2014 the ensemble mean method is employed to merge multiple products of individual water budget component in trb for substituting measured values of water budget components used in section 2 4 we use the ensemble mean method rather than error uncertainty based method because some satellite products used in this study have no official error estimates released and the studies about error uncertainty of these products cannot be found in our study area even if some products of water budget components have published results of error estimates these results are in areas of product verification and cannot be transferred directly to our study area in addition trb is a typical arid watershed which is covered mainly by taklimakan desert water budget components of p et and twsc are small in the basin therefore the differences of errors among multiple satellite products may be small for individual water budget component sahoo et al 2011 yao et al 2014 more importantly the ensemble mean method of multiple products can help verify rationality of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products more easily because we can clearly know which combinations are closer to ensembled mean values six combinations with good medium and poor results of δ re s p with values of about 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 were selected from twenty four combinations given in fig 5 to calculate data errors of water budget components oe errors cd and ncd of these combinations using methods in section 2 4 the selected combinations were persiann gldas jpl with δ re s p 0 10 gpm terra jpl with δ re s p 0 10 trmm gldas jpl with δ re s p 0 22 gpm fldas jpl with δ re s p 0 20 trmm terra jpl with δ re s p 0 37 and chirps terra jpl with δ re s p 0 35 fig 6 gives the data errors of p et and twsc and oe errors at monthly and annual scales it can be seen that the annual oe errors changed from 1 94 to 377 43 mm with the average of 87 74 mm and were evidently higher than data errors of water budget components such as precipitation changed from 2 46 to 178 05 mm with the average of 37 97 mm et changed from 5 55 to 81 41 mm with the average of 40 34 mm and twsc changed from 0 06 to 20 75 mm with the average of 10 00 mm the contribution of oe errors average of 45 36 to water budget imbalance in table 3 is greater than contributions of water budget components with values of 22 91 p 25 39 et and 6 34 twsc similar to annual scales the error analysis at monthly scales in fig 6 also showed the evidently higher oe error than p et and twsc errors for each water budget combination this proves that oe error had a great impact on water budget imbalance and cannot be ignored in assessment of the accuracy of satellite data products however oe errors in combinations of gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl were not significantly greater than data errors of water budget components on the contrast precipitation error was the largest in these two combinations this is related to our replacement of measured values with merged multiple satellite products for water budget components it can be seen from fig 2 that gpm relative to the precipitation products of persiann trmm and chirps which are included in the selected six combinations above had the largest distance with the merged average precipitation of multiple products meaning that gpm product had the largest data errors compared with precipitation products of persiann trmm and chirps another important reason is that products of gpm p fldas et and terra et were all underestimated compared to their corresponding average values merged from multiple satellite products according to eq 10 the sign operation of oe error was to offset each other when precipitation and et were underestimated simultaneously according to boxplots of errors of water budget closure in fig 7 oe error had the maximum spacings between upper and lower quartiles compared with water budget components indicating that the temporal variation distribution of this error term is more dispersed table 3 shows the results of ncd and the contribution of water budget component errors to water budget imbalance it can be seen that there is no obvious difference in total errors of water budget for these six combinations with persiann gldas jpl having the largest total error of water budget and ncd value from results of cd changed from 0 71 to 0 89 and corresponding ncd changed from 0 11 to 0 29 the closure results of these six combinations were satisfactory in order to show the rationality of ncd method for assessing satellite data products of water budget components its results were compared with results of δ re s p we can easily find that the results of these two methods had good consistency except for the combination of persiann gldas jpl that is both methods can distinguish water budget imbalance of different combinations satisfactorily and their results were consistent this fully illustrates the rationality of the ncd method the only inconsistent combination persiann gldas jpl of the two methods was mainly caused by the high dependence of δ re s p results on p it can be seen from fig 2 that persiann product had the largest precipitation values except era5 product which was eliminated during closure residual selections in section 3 2 therefore although the combination had the greatest δ re s value meaning the worst closure result compared to other combinations see table 3 its results of δ re s p was smallest meaning the best closure result of water budget however the results of ncd was almost unaffected by the magnitude of precipitation and showed the worst closure result of this combination because the results of ncd was determined by the total error of water budget and percentage of closure residual in total error most importantly ncd changed from 0 to 1 so that one can easily compare water budget imbalance for different combinations and basins using this method 3 4 probability assessment of water budget closure this section was designed to assess the reliability of water budget closure by using from method due to data errors in water budget components table 4 is the results of the reliability index β and failure probability pf of water budget closure the low values of pf for combinations of trmm gldas jpl gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl with values of 0 34 0 32 and 0 23 showed satisfactory water budget closure results using these satellite data combinations the ncd of these three combinations were 0 15 0 15 and 0 11 they were smaller than the limit state threshold failure risk of hydrologic system set in this study with the value of 0 2 this is the main reason for the low pf conversely the combination of trmm terra jpl persiann gldas jpl and chirps terra jpl had large pf with values of 0 73 0 69 and 0 69 due to the large ncd of these combinations greater than 0 2 limit state threshold constraint the results of from verified the reliability of combinations of trmm gldas jpl gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl in trb due to low errors of water budget components and the applicability of ncd method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components it is worth noting that all water budget components considered in our proposed methods are precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage change twsc water storage and flux variables related to the terrestrial water cycle such as soil moisture and snowmelt are included in these components for example the amount of snowmelt is already included in amount of et estimate and twsc estimate because the amount of water from snow melt is consumed either by sublimation or by recharging soil water for the et products such as mod16a2 used in this study the amount of et is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth s surface to the atmosphere it includes the sublimation of permanent snow and ice the grace observes changes in water storage by monitoring the monthly changes in gravity which is quantified by monthly changes in mass according to the documentation of grace the gravity variations studied by grace include changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean runoff and ground water storage on land masses exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the ocean and variations of mass within earth therefore the changes in terrestrial mass is actually included the changes of snow melt entering into soil however the coarse spatial resolution of grace products determined that the study of water budget closure is limited to large scale river basins the separate estimation of components of terrestrial water storage may provide an opportunity for small scale studies of water budget closure since products for some components of terrestrial water storage such as soil moisture and snowmelt have been produced although the accurate simulation of all components of terrestrial water storage is still very difficult 4 conclusions the purpose of this study is to propose a new error based method to help better assess the accuracy and error sources of satellite data products from the perspective of water budget closure an important error term the oe error was introduced for forming this method the proposed method was applied to a typical closed basin the trb to verify the applicability and reliability of this method for assessing the quality of satellite data products sixty combinations of water budget components from different satellite products were designed to compare advantages and disadvantages of results of ncd proposed in this study and current normally used methods δ re s and δ re s p the results concluded that different combinations of satellite products of water budget components produced very different results of closure residuals of water budget showing a great impact of satellite data combinations on water budget closure monthly closure residuals of water budget changed from 50 to 50 mm for sixty combinations and their annual closure residuals changed from 143 18 to 225 10 mm the results of closure residuals of corresponding average precipitation changed from 2 63 to 0 85 and ncd changed from 0 11 to 0 29 for the selected combinations with satisfactory closure residuals in trb these fully illustrated the great water budget closure errors from different satellite product combinations reflected in the great impact of satellite combinations on water budget closure the large difference of assessment results based on different combinations may be caused by many reasons such as low accuracy of these products in unverified areas due to the sparseness of in situ measurements the mismatched spatial and temporal resolution and the different sensors and retrieval algorithms of them the oe error was proved to be an important error term leading to water budget imbalance in this study the results of annual oe error changed from 1 94 to 377 43 mm with an average of 87 74 mm was much larger than errors of water budget components according to the contribution of error terms to water budget imbalance with the value of 45 36 for oe error 22 91 for precipitation error 25 39 for et error and 6 34 for twsc error the oe error term had the largest contribution to water budget imbalance therefore oe error term plays a great role in understanding the accuracy of satellite products and further studies should be focused on reducing of this error term to improve water budget closure from various satellite sources the results of ncd based on combinations with poor medium and good δ re s p proved the applicability of the proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components a consistent closure results of water budget was concluded by using ncd and δ re s p except for the combination of persiann gldas jpl with largest δ re s of selected combinations however δ re s p concluded a good closure results of water budget for this combination due to its high dependence on p the proposed method showed advantages for avoiding the influence of single water budget component on results of water budget closure which

4840,remote sensing products have been widely used in water resources assessment and management however the accuracy varies in different products water budget closure provides an important breakthrough for better assessing the uncertainties and quantifying error sources of satellite based data products using water budget imbalance especially in ungauged basins where conventional verification methods are not applicable however the commonly used assessment methods mainly refer to closure residual of water budget δ re s or its proportion to corresponding mean precipitation p δ re s p which have apparent limitations due to the dimensional effects in the former method and the high dependence on precipitation in the latter one more critically these two methods do not consider measured values referring to in situ values in gauged basins or average values of multiple satellite products in ungauged basins as in this study as benchmarks of water budget components in the assessment of satellite based hydrological data products resulting in a wrong choice because the closure result is subject to the mutual cancellation in the errors of water budget components from different satellite based products this study proposes a novel error based method to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products for both gauged and ungauged basins based on water budget equation measured values and the omission error oe which is generally overlooked in existing studies the method is applied to a typical closed basin the tarim river basin trb of china to verify the applicability and reliability of the proposed method sixty combinations of water budget components from various satellite sources can be designed based on five precipitation p products four evapotranspiration et products and three terrestrial water storage change twsc products first order reliability method form is employed to assess the reliability of water budget closure results caused by the errors of satellite sources the results indicated that different combinations produced different annual δ re s and δ re s p indicating great water budget closure errors for different combinations due to errors in different satellite sources the oe error from satellite based hydrological data products of water budget components clearly showed a greater impact on water budget imbalance than water budget components indicating that oe error is important for understanding quality of satellite products by comparing the results of δ re s and δ re s p it can be seen that our proposed method had great advantages in assessment of satellite products with a low dependence on p and a better comparability between different combinations the value of our assessment criterion ranges from 0 to 1 which is easier to understand in practice the combinations of water budget components from trmm 3b43 p gpm 3imerghh p gldas noah025 et and grace twsc products show satisfactory water budget closure results in trb using our proposed method the proposed method provides a new aspect for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products especially in ungauged basins which provides insights into water resources management in basins keywords remote sensing water budget closure error analysis tarim river basin 1 introduction remote sensing has been used and will be continuously used in many fields due to its advanced technical development particularly in water resources management satellite based hydrological data products mainly referring to precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage tws provide plenty of valuable information necessary for hydrologic analysis such as floods and droughts which is critical to water resources management cui et al 2019 hassan et al 2020 shao et al 2019 currently a number of satellite based hydrological data products from recent and ongoing satellite missions have been retrieved at various time and space scales for example the long term global precipitation products retrieved by the combination of microwave and infrared satellite measurements such as the integrated multi satellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement gpm imerg khan and maggioni 2019 sahoo et al 2011 shen et al 2020 the large scale global et products retrieved using energy balance scheme penman monteith method priestley taylor method and hargreaves method such as moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis paca et al 2019 the global twsc products derived from the measurement of the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tapley et al 2019 lv et al 2017 wouters et al 2019 and the global surface runoff and baseflow products obtained from large scale terrestrial hydrological models driven by long term satellite remote sensing products such as the surface and subsurface runoff simulation from the global land data assimilation system gldas xie et al 2019 although these satellite based hydrological data products can be verified in areas with measured data large uncertainties are still inevitable due to sparse gauges and measurement stations especially in less developed countries where in situ measurements are rare or even not existent bui et al 2020 sheffield et al 2009 to make matters worse there is no methods to evaluate the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in ungauged basins therefore they might still show significant differences in time and spatial variability making it difficult to evaluate the accuracy of satellite products munier et al 2014 fortunately water storage changes are linked to p et and r via the terrestrial water budget equation forming a hydrological system meaning that water budget closure can provide an opportunity to verify the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in gauged and especially in ungauged basins assessment of water budget closure has become a basic condition for verifying the reliability of hydrological data products and has been widely concerned in research and application fields dagan et al 2019 pan and wood 2006 rodell et al 2015 abera et al 2017 proulx et al 2013 aires 2014 soltani et al 2020 liu et al 2020 in literature the most commonly used methods for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure are the closure residual of water budget δ re s p e t r t w s c usually defined as water budget imbalance the ratio of this residual to corresponding average precipitation p δ re s p or a combination of both methods by combining multiple available satellite data products of p et r and twsc denager et al 2020 moreira et al 2019 wang et al 2014a 2014b sahoo et al 2011 soltani et al 2020 zhang et al 2016 for example sahoo et al 2011 concluded a 5 to 25 closure residual of water budget relative to mean annual precipitation using various satellite based products in 10 basins over the world soltani et al 2020 studied the seasonal variation of water budget closure based on different satellite sources using methods of δ re s and δ re s p there is no doubt that both methods can help intuitively illustrate water budget closure errors caused by the uncertainties of hydrological data products in gauged and ungauged basins and play a significant role in water resources management however the aforementioned methods also show some common limitations due to the lack of consideration of measured values of water budget components which may result in a false closure result due to mutual cancellation in the errors of water budget components from various satellite sources for example a good closure result with small δ re s or δ re s p does not mean that satellite products of water budget components are absolutely satisfactory because parallel estimation errors of water budget components from these satellite products may cause values of them to be canceled to each other resulting in a closure residual of zero parallel error situation therefore one cannot conclude that retrieved data products of water budget components have a good quality in this situation due to the lack of comparison with measured values sahoo et al 2011 in addition the results of δ re s p has a high dependence on magnitude of precipitation p resulting in the incomparability of results in different basins even worse a good closure residual may lead to a poor result of δ re s p in arid basins due to the small precipitation and conversely a poor closure residual may achieve a good result of δ re s p in humid basins due to the large precipitation therefore the introduction of a benchmark measured values into currently used assessment methods is urgently needed to ensure that both the total error and the closure error of satellite based hydrological data products are satisfactory to solve this an important error term named as the omission error oe of water budget components the error between measured and true values is derived based on water budget equation as an intermediate process for quantifying the total error of water budget the sum of data errors and oe error of water budget components with respect to the oe error it is well known that water budget equation requires the true values of input variables to ensure the exact balance between both sides of the equal sign however the measured values of water budget components are not equal to their true values therefore in addition to data error between estimated and measured values for each water budget component there is an error term measuring the difference between measured and true values of water budget components this widespread and well known error term is called the oe error in this study it is noted that although we cannot quantify the oe error for each water budget component due to the unknow true values the sum of oe errors of all water budget components can be quantified using water budget closure see section 2 4 for detail which provides an important opportunity to verify the satellite based hydrological data products based on the above analysis an error based method composed of two indexes the total error of water budget closure used for assessing data errors of satellite products between estimated and measured values and the non closure degree of water budget changing from 0 to 1 used for verifying closure errors of satellite products is proposed to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products in gauged and ungauged basins the proposed method was applied to the trb to verify the reliability of this method by comparing with δ re s and δ re s p sixty combinations of water budget components from five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products are designed to achieve this purpose in summary the questions to be addressed in this study are 1 how do different combinations of water budget components from multiple satellite products and reanalyze data products affect water budget imbalance by using methods of δ re s and δ re s p 2 how does the oe error term affect water budget imbalance compared to water budget components p et r and twsc and 3 what is the reliability of the proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure in practical applications these questions are answered by analyzing assessment results of water budget closure using methods of δ re s and δ re s p and the method proposed in this study based on sixty satellite data combinations from five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products first closure residuals of these sixty combinations from various satellite sources are compared to show the impact of different combinations on results of δ re s second combinations of satellite sources with small δ re s reflecting good closure results are selected and then the differences of δ re s p for these selected combinations are compared to show the high dependence of this method on precipitation in assessment of hydrological data products third combinations with poor medium and good δ re s p results are selected for analyzing contribution of oe errors to water budget imbalance and verifying the results of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products finally form is employed to verify the reliability of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products this paper is organized as follows study area and satellite data products used in this study are briefly introduced in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively section 2 3 mainly introduces water budget equation and corresponding satellite data processing procedure section 2 4 focuses on the derivation of oe error term and hydrological data product assessment method proposed in this study section 2 5 is a brief introduction of form method for verifying the reliability of our proposed method section 3 presents results and discussion about water budget closure analysis used for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products based on different combinations of water budget components at monthly and annual scales using δ re s and δ re s p and the method proposed in this study the last section summarizes our conclusions of this study the results can provide a novel perspective for assessing the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products using water budget closure 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the trb with a total area of about 1 02 106 km2 is the largest inland river basin in china xu et al 2019 and is surrounded by high mountains like tien shan eastern pamir kunlun and karakorum mountains see fig 1 the basin has a typically closed and independent hydrological system with no surface outflow and negligible subsurface outflow wang et al 2013 the mainstream of tarim river is about 1321 km with the confluence of three tributaries i e the aksu the yarkand and the hotan rivers in headwater of the basin huang et al 2018 however only the aksu river is the perennial tributary supplying 70 80 of the discharge to the entire tarim river system guo et al 2013 yang et al 2019 precipitation is unevenly distributed over space and time in the basin the annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 500 mm at the mountain areas and about 50 80 mm at the basin plain areas mainly covered by the taklamakan desert su et al 2016 highest precipitation is typically recorded in june july and august tao et al 2011 runoff is mainly generated by precipitation and glacier snow meltwater in upper mountainous regions where glacier snow meltwater accounts for 38 5 gao et al 2010 recent studies have indicated that temperature and precipitation have increased significantly in the trb over the period from 1961 to 2014 at rates of as much as 0 26 c 10a and 6 19 mm 10a respectively shen et al 2013 hartmann et al 2016 the increase of temperature caused an increase in glacier snow meltwater tao et al 2011 li et al 2020 therefore water budget components are changing in trb due to the complex land cover covered by ice snow and large scale desert climate change and characteristics of runoff which is mainly generated by precipitation and glacier snow meltwater in upper mountainous regions xu et al 2019 huang et al 2018 special land cover and hydrological features make it a typical case study for verifying our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure 2 2 satellite data products used in this study satellite data products of water budget components used in this study are summarized in table 1 multiple products are considered for individual component of water budget in total five precipitation products four et products and three twsc products are collected and considered in this study the precipitation products include trmm 3b43 gpm 3imerghh persiann cdr chirps and era5 among which the first three are satellite products and the last era5 is the atmospheric reanalysis product these precipitation products are derived from different satellite sensors i e infrared and microwave and different inversion methods the application and comparison of these products can help understand the influence of these factors on the accuracy of water budget closure the et products include gldas noah025 3h fldas noah01 c gl m mod16a2 and terraclimate among which the first two are global land data assimilation products that ingests satellite and ground based observational datasets mod16a2 is the result of modeling actual et using energy balance scheme by the penman monteith method and terraclimate is an interpolation product from the worldclim dataset and the japanese 55 year reanalysis jra55 although the products of gldas noah025 3h fldas noah01 c gl m and terraclimate also produce precipitation products we did not consider them due to the following reasons on the one hand the selected precipitation products above have involved different types of satellite sensors or inversion methods in addition they are bias corrected and the accuracy of these products is verified in many basins over the globe hobeichi et al 2020a 2020b khan and maggioni 2019 sahoo et al 2011 on the other hand the same data sources used to derive precipitation and et might cause the high correlation between precipitation and et and then affect the accuracy comparison between our proposed method and the commonly used budget closure assessment methods because the first step of verifying our proposed method is to select combinations of water budget components with good δ re s and then combine with good medium and poor δ re s p for verifying the applicability and reliability of our proposed method see sections 3 2 and 3 3 for detail the high data correlation can easily lead to the good δ re s azarderakhsh et al 2011 pan et al 2012 and affect the selection of combinations for method comparison twsc products are derived from the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace produced with different preprocessing and postprocessing by three centers csr u texas center for space research gfz geoforschungszentrum potsdam and jpl nasa jet propulsion laboratory munier et al 2014 all these data products are collectively referred to as satellite data products in this study for easy notation although some of them are reanalysis and data assimilation products we do not consider runoff in this study because trb is a typically closed basin with no or negligible outflow and outflow with respect to basins that have surface or and subsurface inflow or and outflow they should be considered as it is an important component of water budget the precipitation and et products are considered based on data availability in google earth engine gee which is a platform providing scientific communities with plenty of freely available satellite remote sensing data grace is currently the only global satellite observation system for twsc it is worth noting that grace products of twsc are available at monthly time scale and can only be used for large river basins about 300 km due to its coarse spatial resolution sahoo et al 2011 in addition grace products of twsc are not continuous on a monthly scale there may be no observation data in some months the gap in grace data in missing months are filled with the average value of the previous and following months soltani et al 2020 if there is no observation data for consecutive months linear regression analysis is employed for interpolating missing data all data products of water budget components used in this study are aggregated to a temporal resolution of 1 month by data summation and remapped to the basin scale by data averaging before performing the analysis of water budget closure at the basin scale 2 3 water budget equation this section briefly describes water budget equation and required postprocessing of its input variables due to gravitational anomalies of grace satellite products terrestrial water budget can be defined as the balance between the change in water storage δtwsc and the difference between the incoming water fluxes of precipitation and outgoing fluxes of et and streamflow r in basins sahoo et al 2011 therefore the general water budget model in time t can be expressed as 1 δ t w s c n t 1 t n p t r t e t t d t where δtwsc is the change in terrestrial water storage t is the time such as one month n is the number of t such as 12 months in a year p is precipitation r is streamflow et is evapotranspiration since twsc of grace is the change in equivalent water thickness relative to a time mean baseline monthly gravitational anomalies relative to a 2004 2010 time mean baseline it should be postprocessed by the difference of two adjacent observed values before being substituted into water budget model soltani et al 2020 2 δ t w s c j t w s c j t w s c j 1 where δtwscj is the postprocessed change in water storage in month j twscj and twscj 1 are observed changes in water storage of grace in month j and j 1 respectively accordingly water budget components p r et from various satellite data products should be adjusted by average of two adjacent values due to the postprocessing of twsc therefore changes in twsc can also be described as 3 δ w j 1 2 p j p j 1 1 2 r j r j 1 1 2 e t j e t j 1 since water budget model reflects an ideal water cycle process δtwscj is not equal to δwj therefore closure residual of water budget can be calculated as 4 δ re s j δ t w s c j δ w j where δresj is closure residual of water budget in j month 2 4 the method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure this section mainly describes derivation processes of oe error of water budget and the method proposed in this study for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure data errors of water budget components are first calculated the specific derivation process of oe error is then introduced finally the method for calculating non closure degree ncd closure degree cd of water budget and contributions of each error terms to water budget imbalance for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products are introduced the specific processes are described as follows 1 data errors of water budget components data errors of water budget components ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d are expressed using the absolute error based on satellite retrieved and measured values as follows 5 ε i d v i e v i m where i is the i th water budget component p et r twsc ε i d is the absolute error of the i th component v i e is the estimated value of the i th component i e the satellite data products in this study and v i m is the measured value of the i th component 2 derivation of oe error of water budget the oe error is derived from water budget equation it is easy to understand that true values of water budget components can be represented using their satellite retrieved values and corresponding error terms as follows 6 p t p e ε p e t t e t e ε et r t r e ε r δ t w s c t δ t w s c e ε twsc where p t e t t r t δ t w s c t refers to assumed true values of water budget components p e e t e r e δ t w s c e are satellite retrieved values of water budget components and ε p ε et ε r ε twsc are corresponding signed error terms of water budget components by substituting eq 6 into water budget equation δ t w s c t p t r t e t t the following expression can be obtained 7 p e e t e r e δ t w s c e ε et ε r ε twsc ε p we approximately assume that the true value for each water budget component is equal to the sum of its satellite retrieved value data error and oe error therefore according to description of oe error in section 1 and the fact that the merged value of multiple satellite products is close to the true values error terms in eq 7 can be further decomposed into the sum of data errors calculated in eq 5 and oe errors as follows 8 ε p ε p d ε p o ε et ε et d ε et o ε r ε r d ε r o ε twsc ε twsc d ε twsc o where ε p o ε et o ε r o ε twsc o are omission error terms of water budget components by substituting eq 8 into eq 7 and letting ε o ε twsc o ε et o ε r o ε p o 9 p a ε p d ε p o e t a ε et d ε et o r a ε r d ε r o δ s t g a ε twsc d ε twsc o finally we can obtain the sum of oe error ε o of water budget components 10 ε o p a e t a r a δ t w s c a ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d where ε o is the sum of oe errors of water budget components 3 the method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products using water budget closure the closure residual of water budget δres is calculated in eq 4 the total error of water budget can be expressed as ε wbc ε o ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d we calculate the sum of absolute values to avoid the multiple cancellation of errors in water budget components resulting in a false closure in general a set of satellite retrieved water budget component products p et r and twsc can be considered satisfactory if the following conditions are met first we expect that the total error of water budget ε wbc is as small as possible to reduce the gap between satellite retrieved and true values avoiding multiple cancellation of errors in water budget components of water budget components this kind of error is also what we try to reduce in data production of water budget components second we expect that closure residual of water budget δres caused fully by satellite inversion based on different sensors and inversion algorithms accounts for a small proportion of the total water budget error ε wbc to result in a small water budget imbalance therefore the index of ε wbc and the percentage of δres to ε wbc are employed to assess water budget closure in this study and the latter is defined as no closure degree ncd of water budget as follows 11 ncd δ re s ε o ε p d ε et d ε r d ε twsc d δ re s ε wbc 12 cd 1 n c d 1 δ re s ε wbc where cd is the closure degree of water budget and ncd is the no closure degree of water budget both changes from 0 to 1 the contribution of the data error for each water budget component or the sum of oe error of all water budget components to water budget imbalance can be assessed as follows 13 co n i ε i ε wbc where ε i is the data error of the i th water budget component p et r twsc in eq 5 or the oe error in eq 10 co n i is the contribution degree of the i th error term to water budget imbalance the larger the value the greater the influence of the error term to water budget imbalance 2 5 first order reliability method the form is a widely used method for analyzing the structural reliability of the studied system zhao et al 2020 the method uses a limit state function lsf defined by taylor expansion in eq 14 to approximate the failure function of the studied system soltani et al 2020 the method was then used to calculate the shortest distance between the failure surface and the origin in the space of the reduced variables with the constraint of g y 0 by finding a point y called the most probable failure point the shortest distance is called the reliability index β y see soltani et al 2020 for detailed application processes of this method 14 g y l t g y m g y m t y y m where g y is the failure function of hydrologic system quantified by water budget closure l t is the linearization of the lsf y y1 y2 yn is the vector of n variables in g y function ym is the expansion point and g y is the first order gradient vector of g y after reliability index β was calculated the failure probability of hydrologic system can be approximated by 15 p f φ β where pf is the failure probability of hydrologic system the smaller the value the lower the uncertainties in water budget component products and the higher the reliability of hydrologic system φ β is the cumulative distribution of the standard normal variate madsen et al 1986 in this study the form is used to validate the results of ncd used for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products using water budget closure the failure function g y of hydrologic system is defined as follows 16 g y ncd n c d p δ re s ε m ε et ε r ε twsc ε p n c d p where ncdp is the state limit of water budget closure error that can be accepted we set the value to be 0 2 because many current studies showed that the closure residual of water budget based on satellite based products is between 5 and 25 of corresponding average precipitation long et al 2014 sahoo et al 2011 we considered that when ncd of hydrologic system is less than 0 2 the data of water budget components from satellite based products is satisfactory 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal changes of water budget components fig 2 shows the temporal variation of various satellite data products of water budget components from 2003 to 2017 in trb the precipitation values of the five products showed similar seasonal variation with peak and bottom values appeared in nearly the same months however magnitudes of these precipitation products were clearly different and the reanalysis product of era5 with the monthly average precipitation changing between 2 88 and 60 93 mm had greater values than the remaining four rs retrieved products with the monthly average precipitation changing between 0 05 and 60 93 mm in the trb this is caused by the difference in algorithms of dataset production between reanalysis and rs retrievals era5 product is predicted by combining model data with observations from across the world into a globally complete and consistent dataset using the laws of physics copernicus climate change service 2017 however satellite products are retrieved using observed data from infrared microwave sensors of multiple satellites therefore the results of these two kinds of products may show differences especially in regions without verification by measured values some studies over the globe have verified that era5 is more likely to overestimate precipitation than satellite based products over the drier regions and even the wetter regions amjad et al 2020 chen et al 2020 the satellite estimates differ significantly for individual river basins has been verified by some studies although the phase of the seasonal cycles of these satellite estimated products agrees well wang et al 2015 the monthly averaged et products showed the same seasonal cycle variation as that of p the difference in magnitudes was also evident the monthly averaged et changed between 0 and 30 92 mm without considering mod16a2 which changed between 16 01 and 40 75 mm in trb therefore the mod16a2 et in the basin was obviously greater than other products this is because mod16a2 product has nodata in the central part of the basin covered mainly by the taklimakan desert see fig 3 and we calculate the average of et over the basin based on pixels with et values as a result for the mod16a2 product only the surrounding area of the basin mainly covered by mountains with high et values are averaged regarding as the average of et over the basin the twsc of grace csr and grace jpl products showed similar temporal variations with the value changing between 22 71 and 36 73 mm but the changes were very different from grace gfz with the value changing between 77 95 and 67 27 mm in trb fig 3 showed an obvious spatial variation of water budget components with high value areas in surrounding boundaries and low value areas in center of the basin due to significant differences of land cover in trb more importantly in addition to twsc the spatial distribution of water budget components was obviously different for different products this distributional difference of water budget components may affect results of water budget closure however it is difficult to conclude which data set is better we considered them all in forming different combinations in this study for analyzing the impact of different combinations on water budget closure so as to reflecting the quality of satellite data products 3 2 water budget closure residuals from different satellite product combinations this section assesses satellite based hydrological data products by analyzing the impact of different satellite data combinations on water budget closure using δ re s and δ re s p and verifies the high dependence of δ re s p on p fig 4 gives the closure residuals of sixty combinations of water budget components from which it can be seen that closure residuals of water budget changed from 50 to 50 mm month in trb and most of them changed from 20 to 20 mm month the results were consisted with most studies in other basins sahoo et al 2011 kurkute et al 2020 these illustrated that different combinations of water budget components from various satellite products greatly affected closure residuals of water budget it is worth noting that the difficulty to close water budget due to the insufficient accuracy of individual datasets and their inconsistencies had been discussed in most previous studies azarderakhsh et al 2011 therefore some experiments have been conducted to close water budget by using assimilation strategies hobeichi et al 2020ae 2020bf 2020ag 2020bh sheffield et al 2009 pan et al 2012 munier et al 2014 even if it is impossible for any single satellite sensor instrument to measure all the water budget components simultaneously wang et al 2015 this maybe one of reasons for determining good closure residuals in different combinations in order to verify results of δ re s p for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products twenty four combinations with small δ re s were selected in table 2 based on the following two principles 1 the absolute value of monthly averaged residual δ re s was less than 8 mm to ensure a good closure for selected combinations we used 8 mm as a threshold because many combinations meet this condition in trb 2 the distance between upper and lower quartiles of closure residuals was less than 15 mm for restricting temporal fluctuations of closure residuals fig 5 gives the annual δ re s p for the selected twenty four combinations it can be seen that annual averaged δ re s p changes from 0 10 to 0 54 except for combinations of gpm gldas csr and gpm gldas jpl with δ re s p values of 1 14 and 1 13 respectively this showed that the value of δ re s p was not from 0 to 1 although closure residuals of these combinations were small their results of δ re s p vary greatly showing a great impact of different combinations of water budget components from various satellite products on water budget closure greater values of gpm gldas csr and gpm gldas jpl were mainly caused by the small precipitation of gpm compared to other precipitation products see fig 2 resulting in the large results of δ re s p for these combinations due to the small denominators this illustrated the high dependence of this method on precipitation value in assessment of satellite data products in addition to these two combinations 60 combinations showed values of δ re s p changed between 0 10 and 0 30 and 40 combinations changed between 0 30 and 0 54 in trb in literature some studies concluded that water budget closure errors of δ re s p in most their studies areas changed from 0 05 to 0 25 5 to 25 in the form of percentage long et al 2014 sahoo et al 2011 there are also studies concluded greater results of δ re s p such as 0 30 wang et al 2014a and even from 3 00 to 1 30 soltani et al 2020 3 3 errors and closure degree of water budget for assessing satellite data products this section focuses on the comparison of oe errors and water budget component errors and the application and comparison of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components it is worth noting that measured values of water budget components are necessary in our proposed method as they are benchmarks for calculating data errors of water budget components in eq 5 however to ensure enough measured values is difficult for each water budget component in some basins even worse satellite based products of water budget components are provided at the grid scale without sufficiently fine spatial observations to validate the products of water budget components zhang et al 2018 therefore the following two situations should be considered in our proposed method if there are enough measured values in assessment basins we can substitute them into equations in section 2 4 as benchmarks to assess the accuracy of satellite based hydrological data products therefore the proposed method with consideration of measured values can more effectively evaluate the accuracy of hydrological data products from aspects of the closure error and the total error of water budget however if there are no measured values in ungauged basins the merged results of multiple satellite products can be used to substitute the measured values this substitution can effectively compare the gap between the data product to be verified and merged multiple data products for each water budget component while avoiding parallel error situations mentioned above many studies concluded that the merged results of multiple satellite products are closer to measured values of water budget components abera et al 2017 proulx et al 2013 aires 2014 yu et al 2020 zhu et al 2019 because merged results of multiple satellite products can better reduce systematic bias which had been minimized during product production and random errors which are hard to avoid of water budget components compared to the single one therefore one prefers to replace measured values by the merged values of multiple satellite products in the absence of sufficient measured data in literature many merging technologies are applied in specific studies including the error uncertainty based method the linear weighting method and the ensemble mean of multiple products munier et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 yao et al 2014 the ensemble mean method is employed to merge multiple products of individual water budget component in trb for substituting measured values of water budget components used in section 2 4 we use the ensemble mean method rather than error uncertainty based method because some satellite products used in this study have no official error estimates released and the studies about error uncertainty of these products cannot be found in our study area even if some products of water budget components have published results of error estimates these results are in areas of product verification and cannot be transferred directly to our study area in addition trb is a typical arid watershed which is covered mainly by taklimakan desert water budget components of p et and twsc are small in the basin therefore the differences of errors among multiple satellite products may be small for individual water budget component sahoo et al 2011 yao et al 2014 more importantly the ensemble mean method of multiple products can help verify rationality of our proposed method for assessing the accuracy of hydrological data products more easily because we can clearly know which combinations are closer to ensembled mean values six combinations with good medium and poor results of δ re s p with values of about 0 1 0 2 and 0 3 were selected from twenty four combinations given in fig 5 to calculate data errors of water budget components oe errors cd and ncd of these combinations using methods in section 2 4 the selected combinations were persiann gldas jpl with δ re s p 0 10 gpm terra jpl with δ re s p 0 10 trmm gldas jpl with δ re s p 0 22 gpm fldas jpl with δ re s p 0 20 trmm terra jpl with δ re s p 0 37 and chirps terra jpl with δ re s p 0 35 fig 6 gives the data errors of p et and twsc and oe errors at monthly and annual scales it can be seen that the annual oe errors changed from 1 94 to 377 43 mm with the average of 87 74 mm and were evidently higher than data errors of water budget components such as precipitation changed from 2 46 to 178 05 mm with the average of 37 97 mm et changed from 5 55 to 81 41 mm with the average of 40 34 mm and twsc changed from 0 06 to 20 75 mm with the average of 10 00 mm the contribution of oe errors average of 45 36 to water budget imbalance in table 3 is greater than contributions of water budget components with values of 22 91 p 25 39 et and 6 34 twsc similar to annual scales the error analysis at monthly scales in fig 6 also showed the evidently higher oe error than p et and twsc errors for each water budget combination this proves that oe error had a great impact on water budget imbalance and cannot be ignored in assessment of the accuracy of satellite data products however oe errors in combinations of gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl were not significantly greater than data errors of water budget components on the contrast precipitation error was the largest in these two combinations this is related to our replacement of measured values with merged multiple satellite products for water budget components it can be seen from fig 2 that gpm relative to the precipitation products of persiann trmm and chirps which are included in the selected six combinations above had the largest distance with the merged average precipitation of multiple products meaning that gpm product had the largest data errors compared with precipitation products of persiann trmm and chirps another important reason is that products of gpm p fldas et and terra et were all underestimated compared to their corresponding average values merged from multiple satellite products according to eq 10 the sign operation of oe error was to offset each other when precipitation and et were underestimated simultaneously according to boxplots of errors of water budget closure in fig 7 oe error had the maximum spacings between upper and lower quartiles compared with water budget components indicating that the temporal variation distribution of this error term is more dispersed table 3 shows the results of ncd and the contribution of water budget component errors to water budget imbalance it can be seen that there is no obvious difference in total errors of water budget for these six combinations with persiann gldas jpl having the largest total error of water budget and ncd value from results of cd changed from 0 71 to 0 89 and corresponding ncd changed from 0 11 to 0 29 the closure results of these six combinations were satisfactory in order to show the rationality of ncd method for assessing satellite data products of water budget components its results were compared with results of δ re s p we can easily find that the results of these two methods had good consistency except for the combination of persiann gldas jpl that is both methods can distinguish water budget imbalance of different combinations satisfactorily and their results were consistent this fully illustrates the rationality of the ncd method the only inconsistent combination persiann gldas jpl of the two methods was mainly caused by the high dependence of δ re s p results on p it can be seen from fig 2 that persiann product had the largest precipitation values except era5 product which was eliminated during closure residual selections in section 3 2 therefore although the combination had the greatest δ re s value meaning the worst closure result compared to other combinations see table 3 its results of δ re s p was smallest meaning the best closure result of water budget however the results of ncd was almost unaffected by the magnitude of precipitation and showed the worst closure result of this combination because the results of ncd was determined by the total error of water budget and percentage of closure residual in total error most importantly ncd changed from 0 to 1 so that one can easily compare water budget imbalance for different combinations and basins using this method 3 4 probability assessment of water budget closure this section was designed to assess the reliability of water budget closure by using from method due to data errors in water budget components table 4 is the results of the reliability index β and failure probability pf of water budget closure the low values of pf for combinations of trmm gldas jpl gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl with values of 0 34 0 32 and 0 23 showed satisfactory water budget closure results using these satellite data combinations the ncd of these three combinations were 0 15 0 15 and 0 11 they were smaller than the limit state threshold failure risk of hydrologic system set in this study with the value of 0 2 this is the main reason for the low pf conversely the combination of trmm terra jpl persiann gldas jpl and chirps terra jpl had large pf with values of 0 73 0 69 and 0 69 due to the large ncd of these combinations greater than 0 2 limit state threshold constraint the results of from verified the reliability of combinations of trmm gldas jpl gpm fldas jpl and gpm terra jpl in trb due to low errors of water budget components and the applicability of ncd method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components it is worth noting that all water budget components considered in our proposed methods are precipitation p evapotranspiration et runoff r and terrestrial water storage change twsc water storage and flux variables related to the terrestrial water cycle such as soil moisture and snowmelt are included in these components for example the amount of snowmelt is already included in amount of et estimate and twsc estimate because the amount of water from snow melt is consumed either by sublimation or by recharging soil water for the et products such as mod16a2 used in this study the amount of et is the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the earth s surface to the atmosphere it includes the sublimation of permanent snow and ice the grace observes changes in water storage by monitoring the monthly changes in gravity which is quantified by monthly changes in mass according to the documentation of grace the gravity variations studied by grace include changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean runoff and ground water storage on land masses exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the ocean and variations of mass within earth therefore the changes in terrestrial mass is actually included the changes of snow melt entering into soil however the coarse spatial resolution of grace products determined that the study of water budget closure is limited to large scale river basins the separate estimation of components of terrestrial water storage may provide an opportunity for small scale studies of water budget closure since products for some components of terrestrial water storage such as soil moisture and snowmelt have been produced although the accurate simulation of all components of terrestrial water storage is still very difficult 4 conclusions the purpose of this study is to propose a new error based method to help better assess the accuracy and error sources of satellite data products from the perspective of water budget closure an important error term the oe error was introduced for forming this method the proposed method was applied to a typical closed basin the trb to verify the applicability and reliability of this method for assessing the quality of satellite data products sixty combinations of water budget components from different satellite products were designed to compare advantages and disadvantages of results of ncd proposed in this study and current normally used methods δ re s and δ re s p the results concluded that different combinations of satellite products of water budget components produced very different results of closure residuals of water budget showing a great impact of satellite data combinations on water budget closure monthly closure residuals of water budget changed from 50 to 50 mm for sixty combinations and their annual closure residuals changed from 143 18 to 225 10 mm the results of closure residuals of corresponding average precipitation changed from 2 63 to 0 85 and ncd changed from 0 11 to 0 29 for the selected combinations with satisfactory closure residuals in trb these fully illustrated the great water budget closure errors from different satellite product combinations reflected in the great impact of satellite combinations on water budget closure the large difference of assessment results based on different combinations may be caused by many reasons such as low accuracy of these products in unverified areas due to the sparseness of in situ measurements the mismatched spatial and temporal resolution and the different sensors and retrieval algorithms of them the oe error was proved to be an important error term leading to water budget imbalance in this study the results of annual oe error changed from 1 94 to 377 43 mm with an average of 87 74 mm was much larger than errors of water budget components according to the contribution of error terms to water budget imbalance with the value of 45 36 for oe error 22 91 for precipitation error 25 39 for et error and 6 34 for twsc error the oe error term had the largest contribution to water budget imbalance therefore oe error term plays a great role in understanding the accuracy of satellite products and further studies should be focused on reducing of this error term to improve water budget closure from various satellite sources the results of ncd based on combinations with poor medium and good δ re s p proved the applicability of the proposed method for assessing the accuracy of satellite data products of water budget components a consistent closure results of water budget was concluded by using ncd and δ re s p except for the combination of persiann gldas jpl with largest δ re s of selected combinations however δ re s p concluded a good closure results of water budget for this combination due to its high dependence on p the proposed method showed advantages for avoiding the influence of single water budget component on results of water budget closure which

4841,fluvial morphology in compound river channels usually undergoes drastic variation during extreme floods due to scour and erosion processes those processes can be highly dynamic consisting of multiple elements e g bed form migration bank erosion riprap break down etc that are inter dependent the existence of bridge abutments and embankments that lead to flow contraction on the floodplain brings more complexity and uncertainty the present study investigated flood related processes around bridge sites in a compound channel with different abutment embankment configurations results show that a longer abutment embankment pushes the high shearing zone on the floodplain around abutment toe further towards the bank slope and causes a higher risk of undercutting at the toe area while vertical flow pressurization had a more significant effect on enhancing general bed shearing the main channel bank tends to retain a constant slope 2 1 as scour progresses gradually during floods the channel bed scour is closely related to the unit discharge contraction ratio determined by both lateral and vertical flow contractions regarding the interaction between dynamic processes migrating bed forms enhanced sediment erosion by cyclic embedment winnowing processes when they met destabilized loose riprap rocks thus rocks sliding into the main channel may cause a higher risk of bed subsidence and then embankment failure in total four bed form migration types i e interaction types are observed for different abutment embankment lengths and flow intensities in general the observed processes provide a clear picture of how channel morphology is altered dynamically by multiple factors during extreme floods additionally the findings in this study are integrated under a framework to evaluate the potential scour and erosion hazards in a real river section it is found that those hazards may go beyond individual sites affecting each other and then the morphological evolution at a catchment

features dynamic processes e g bed form migration in the main channel while much weaker bed mobility is usually observed on the floodplain e g a clear water flow regime or lateral transfer of some fine sediments from the main channel this non uniformity is usually accompanied by significant transverse momentum exchange and turbulent mixing which have been studied extensively by physical experiments in the last two decades those studies were designed for straight compound channels babaeyan koopaei et al 2002 van prooijen et al 2005 yang et al 2013 koziol 2013 proust et al 2017 proust and nikora 2020 meandering compound channels shiono et al 2009 liu et al 2016 2018 shan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 pan et al 2019 or a straight rectangular channel with lateral roughness transition vermaas et al 2011 in the meantime proust et al 2006 studied the influence of abrupt floodplain contraction and peltier et al 2013 measured the turbulence around embankments on the floodplain of a compound channel however most of the abovementioned experiments were performed using fixed beds which benefited flow measurements but limited the understanding of the morphological evolution of erodible river channels the causes of erosion in compound channels are usually multifold including general sediment transport flow induced bank failure and obstructions on the floodplain or in the main channel bridge abutments and the attached embankments are the most typical lateral obstructions on floodplains abutments usually work in proximity to and together with earth filled embankments to support bridge decks and other superstructures at river crossings and those sites may appear consecutively along the channel in a small catchment area although abutments are usually set back on floodplains and unsubmerged in dry seasons flood flows may cause a significant rise in stage and lead to significant flow contraction around the abutment toe areas and the corresponding macro turbulence those flow features are responsible for sediment scour on alluvial beds during extreme floods extensive scour damages may occur and alter the channel morphology this process is usually dynamic and influenced by multiple elements e g sediment riprap obstructions etc fig 1 shows two typical cases of the variation of water surface area in dry and flooding seasons as well as the eroded bed patterns generated during floods specifically in fig 1a apparent bed form migration can be seen in the main channel and on the channel bank left photo that were entirely submerged during a flood right photo the floodplain especially around the abutment toe was heavily inundated with a high risk of sediment scour a similar scenario can be seen in fig 1b for a relatively straight channel section significant scour and bank erosion around the abutment toe was caused by repeated floods right photo excessive scour and erosion impair the stability of the embankment and bring a significant risk of bridge failure which is usually followed by economic losses and possibly the losses of human lives the epic flood that occurred in georgia usa in 2009 showed that the damage of flood flows to bridges in the entire catchment can be devastating gotvald and mccallum 2010 the focus of previous studies on abutment scour was generally restrained to single sites with simplified hydraulic conditions that are relatively static however flooding rivers in the real world are usually accompanied by a series of dynamic processes that are severely understudied although the research on abutment scour initiated as early as the mid 1950s by laursen and toch 1956 the studies published before the late 1990s generally adopted simple experimental set ups e g clear water scour at vertical abutments in simple rectangular channels without protection a comprehensive summary of the early research can be referred to in melville and coleman 2000 since the early 2000s researchers have started to investigate more complicated aspects of abutment scour e g the dependence of scour depth and location on time cardoso and bettess 1999 coleman et al 2003 ballio et al 2010 hong and abid 2019 the

scour pattern in compound channels sturm 2006 yorozuya and ettema 2015 and abutment breaching ettema et al 2015 2016 idil bektur and ettema 2017 hong et al 2015 made significant contributions by integrating clear water local and contraction scour at setback abutments and proposing a modified scour predictor several comprehensive reports including barkdoll et al 2007 ettema et al 2010 and sturm et al 2011 should also be noted as each of them covers more than one of the abovementioned studies while providing more details sturm et al 2018 further studied the interaction of different modes of scour at a bridge crossing including processes of abutment and contraction scour for both live bed and clear water scour conditions in a compound channel however most of the abovementioned studies only focused on clear water flow regimes without comprehensive sediment transport which limits the application of the findings thus it is necessary to extend those efforts by considering the complexity under live bed flow regimes in general our current knowledge of dynamic physical processes in flooded rivers is still inadequate especially when setback obstructions exist concurrently with significant bed mobility thus this study intends to answer three interrelated research questions how does channel morphology evolve dynamically with comprehensive sediment transport in the main channel during extreme floods how do bed forms propagate deform and influence sediment erosion when passing through a bridge contraction and how do riprap rocks interact with other sediment processes break down and contribute to the post flood channel morphology at bridge sites besides it is also expected that the fluvial morphology not only at individual sites but also in the entire catchment would be affected if multiple scour and erosion hazards occur in proximity within a catchment area we aim to propose a framework for the preliminary evaluation of catchment risks based on the main findings this study is a continuation of two previous studies yang et al in press melville et al in press specifically the former was focused on the flow field with fixed unscoured channel bed while the latter studied the effect of streamwise abutment length on clear water scour at vertical wall abutments this study made further efforts to investigate more close to reality scenarios using an erodible compound channel three spill through abutment configurations and three bridge inundation conditions the phenomenon of bed form migration during floods is well simulated new insights into the abovementioned research questions are provided and the intended framework is then examined using the case of a real river channel 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a 1 54 m wide 1 2 m deep and 45 m long flume recirculating both water and sediment all sediment slurry was guided into the main channel to ensure no sediment transport on the floodplain a 1 08 m wide floodplain a 0 26 m wide main channel bank at a 2 1 side slope and a 0 2 m wide main channel bottom were built along the flume a 4 6 m long test section was located 30 m downstream from the inlet section to simulate the fully erodible channel while the floodplain and main channel bed were fixed outside the test section bank protections were set at the transitions between fixed beds and the test section to minimize the effect of unrealistic edge scour the flume was filled with uniform quartz sand with a median diameter d 50 0 84 mm and a geometric standard deviation σ g 1 30 the entire set up was designed to represent a prototype bridge section with a two lane bridge at a 1 45 geometric scale the abutment models were in a spill through form consisting of pile supported stub and non erodible embankment with 2 1 side slopes around 27 to the horizontal plane riprap rocks were used as scour countermeasures placed at the spill through slopes and around the toe of the abutment as a launching apron the selection of the rock sizes and apron dimensions were determined based on the recommendations in hec 23 lagasse et al 2009 besides the floodplain in the upstream channel is roughened using rocks that simulate the effect of rigid vegetation fig 2 shows the configuration of the compound channel built in the flume and the dimensions of the abutments and scour countermeasures twenty two

coleman 2000 was used to calculate the critical velocity variable flow intensity on the floodplain the flow on the floodplain was under clear water condition u fl u f l c 1 0 where u fl is the mean flow velocity on the upstream floodplain and u f l c is the critical velocity for sediment incipient motion on the floodplain as an example ssa fs q signifies that the test was performed using a short setback abutment ssa with a relatively small flow intensity q while the bridge deck was not submerged i e free surface fs flow table 1 summarizes the experimental parameters in this study the data of flow depth and velocity shown in table 1 were measured using a fixed pre scour compound channel more details about the measurements are provided in yang et al in press a four receiver vectrino down looking adv nortek as was used to measure flow velocity at three cross sections including the approach upstream section the downstream end of the bridge deck and the downstream section far from the abutment for each cross section the grid of measurement had a resolution of 5 mm in the vertical direction and 10 50 mm in the transverse direction the discharge subdivisions in the main channel including bank slope and the floodplain were then calculated based on the measured data the method of soulsby 1981 was used to estimate the bed shear stress real time bed elevations were recorded in three locations p1 p2 and p3 at the contracted region as shown in fig 2a the distances to the right flume wall the main channel side were 100 mm 330 mm and 460 mm respectively the measured scour depth d s f p is the vertical distance from pre scour floodplain level to the level of the most scoured point the tailwater levels in this study were well controlled and stayed constant i e y f 0 from the downstream section to the sump where water was recirculated by pumps all the experiments ran for a specific duration of time to ensure the dynamic equilibrium status was reached 3 bank erosion and channel bed scour this section presents post test bed morphology and channel scour data and then attention is paid to the long term erosion pattern of main channel bank during floods as stated by simons and senturk 1992 sediment particles on a side slope have lower critical shear stresses compared with those on a horizontal plane under the flow conditions in this study the main channel bank was still be eroded to some extent even in the absence of the abutment structure and the bridge deck this portion of erosion is difficult to distinguish from the final topography in the case of a compound channel in coarse alluvium with no obstruction a self formed stable main channel bank may deform observably during an extreme flood event besides other components of scour would occur simultaneously if any structures intrude into the flow therefore the total scour at a bridge site is actually a combination of scour components concurrently induced by all possible factors including the side slope factor two types of main channel bank reaction subject to sediment erosion are usually observed i e slope decrease see fig 3 a or slope retreat see fig 3b as stated by osman and thorne 1988 and thorne and abt 1993 in this study bank slope retreat was found to be the predominant behavior both within or out of the contracted region the existence of concurrent erosion at the main channel bank complicates the scour process and the scour estimation at bridge abutments the overall scour process is affected by several elements including erosion resistant properties of the bank material water depth differences between the main channel and the floodplain the initial main channel bank slope before a flood event and the magnitude of the high stress region as well as its distribution across the section with a strong mass transfer from floodplain to the main channel this region is located along the main channel bank e g proust et al 2013 fig 4 shows the transverse bed morphologies for short setback abutments ssa and long setback abutments lsa measured at the downstream end of the bridge deck after terminating the experiments it can be seen that for both long setback and short setback abutments the main channel bank tended to maintain its original slope 2 1 after scour for most of the experiments despite the main channel degradation for short setback abutments with pressure flows so and ot see fig 4a the main channel bank retreated towards the abutment toe and invaded into the space beneath the embankment leaving the abutment undercut and undermining the stability of the structure this mechanism will be further discussed in the following sections for long setback abutments see fig 4b the main channel bank still tended to retreat to the abutment toe area where the riprap apron was initially set except for test lsa fs q but the stability of the abutment itself was not threatened generally the abutment setback distance has a significant effect on the scour geometry at the bridge section but does not alter the behavioral pattern of the main channel bank fig 5 shows the pre scour distribution of normalized reynolds shear stress u v u 2 for lateral shearing and u w u 2 for vertical shearing at the approach section and the bridge section for overtopping flows specifically u and w are the longitudinal and vertical fluctuating velocity components and u is the pre scour approach shear velocity in the middle of the main channel it can be seen that in fig 5a vertical pressurization is a key factor to the enhancement of lateral shearing the main scour driven factor on the main channel bank and near the floodplain s edge comparatively the strength of vertical shearing is much weaker but generally follow the same pattern of distribution in the displayed transects see fig 5b this similarity also suggests that the turbulent flows in this study are isotropic it is found that the length of lateral contraction does not significantly alter the shear strength in the main channel which explains the similar bank behaviors shown in fig 4 however a longer lateral contraction pushes the high shearing zone near the abutment toe further towards the main channel bank thereby leading to a greater risk of undercutting and total bank failure in summary although vertical contraction has a more predominant effect on enhancing shearing on the channel slope than lateral contraction the combined scour driven force is determined by the overall flow redistribution around the bridge section more analysis ensues in the following paragraphs to further investigate the effect of flow contraction on channel bed scour fig 6 shows the variation of the normalized scour depth d s f p y m 0 and the normalized maximum post scour flow depth y max y m 0 with the extent of flow contraction a schematic drawing of scoured channel cross section is given in fig 6a both melville 1992 and melville et al 2006a stated that scour depth may increase with the increasing abutment length i e greater lateral contraction in this study we found that channel bed scour is also significantly influenced by vertical flow pressurization while the variation of the discharge itself does not significantly affect the scour depth directly as shown in fig 6b it can be seen that the data of pressure flow so and ot generally follow the same trend while fs flows tend to cause significantly smaller scour depth relative to the depth of tailwater although greater flow pressurization may produce deeper scour depth e g from so to ot the value of the normalized form d s f p y m 0 does not change significantly another approach for understanding the effect of abutment length is the dependence of scour depth on a discharge contraction ratio this parameter is fundamentally determined by the abutment length for a given channel configuration and it has extensive applicability especially in compound channels where the transverse flow distribution is non uniform since the majority of the scour holes were located in the region of the main channel and main channel bank even for the long setback abutment unit discharge contraction ratio in the main channel q m 2 q m 1 is used herein in fig 6c a nearly linear relationship exist between q m 2 q m 1 and y max y m 0 where y max is the maximum post scour water depth and y m 0 is the mean flow depth in the whole main channel far downstream of the bridge the clear water scour data of hong et al 2015 and abid 2017 also displayed and are generally consistent with the data of this study it should be noted that q m 2 includes the overtopping discharge and y m 0 is used to account for the geometrical non uniformity in the main channel and on main channel bank in the figure the data of different flow types fs so and ot flows generally follow the same trend as q m 2 q m 1 is an integrated indicator of flow contraction regardless of detailed main channel geometry previous studies including laursen 1960 ettema et al 2010 and hong et al 2015 have shown the dependence of clear water contraction scour on q m 2 q m 1 the data of this study further prove the appropriateness of using q m 2 q m 1 as a key factor to estimate the potential channel scour in a contracted and erodible compound channel for both live bed and clear water flow conditions 4 behavior of migrating dunes the previous results show the post test cross sectional profiles and the time averaged scour depth values however multiple dynamic processes existed and interacted with each other during the experiments and thus the bed morphology varied instantaneously with time in this study bed forms propagated mainly in the form of dunes the propagation of bed forms inevitably altered the scour pattern at the bridge section and was found to endanger the geo stability of the abutment conversely the propagating mode of bed forms was also affected by the obstructions previous studies e g chiew and lim 2000 indicated that under live bed scour conditions dune troughs were the main cause of the destabilization of riprap rocks during embedment processes however observations of the scour process in this study showed that dune crests could also exacerbate the erosion at the bridge section it was found that when a large amplitude sand crest avalanched into the bridge section the flow area was accordingly reduced increasing the mean flow velocity in the contracted section and thus further promoting erosion around the abutment toe this phenomenon was particularly apparent for short setback abutments ssa under such circumstances sediment particles close to the abutment toe are prone to winnowing leading to disintegration of the riprap apron in other words large amplitude dune crests cause deposition at the downstream portion of the bridge section reduce the flow area increase the flow velocity and then exacerbate the winnowing process at the upstream portion of the bridge section close to the abutment toe when the apron rocks near the abutment toe were removed scour undercut the spill slope material and the abutment was threatened by a geotechnical failure in summary dune troughs led to embedment of the peripheral riprap in the main channel while dune crests tended to intensify the sediment winnowing failure close to the abutment toe the more detailed behavior of riprap rocks and embankment failures is discussed in the following sections in the present study upstream of the bridge section well developed bed forms migrated mainly in the deeper main channel and occupied part of the main channel bank area however the mode of dune migration was subject to significant variability in the bridge section based on laboratory observations bed form migration through the bridge section can be classified into four types bed forms did not directly interact with the abutment and the riprap while migrating downstream as shown in fig 7 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with long setback abutments lsa in these cases the abutment was significantly set back from the main channel so that there was sufficient space for the dunes passing through the bridge section without interfering with the abutment small secondary ripples formed in a relatively independent scour trench on the floodplain which did not merge with the scour hole in the main channel bed forms shifted laterally towards the abutment at the bridge section to a significant extent and were dissected by the scour trench on the floodplain as shown in fig 8 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with medium setback abutments msa in these cases riprap rocks destabilized by the retreated bank slid down to the region of the original main channel while the laterally shifted dunes interacted with the rocks showing significant embedment and winnowing phenomena the scour holes were mainly located at the bridge section bed forms shifted laterally after passing the bridge section towards the scour hole located at the downstream side of the abutment as shown in fig 9 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with short setback abutments ssa and relatively small flow intensities q in these cases deep and large scour holes formed downstream of the abutment and dunes were found to avalanche into the scour hole bed form amplitudes decreased significantly while passing the abutment as shown in fig 10 these bed forms typically occurred with short setback abutments ssa and with relatively large flow intensities q in these cases the flow was significantly accelerated at the bridge section due to the significant contraction and the flow rapidly carried away the sediment particles and reduced the height of the dunes dunes gradually recovered after passing the scour holes forming downstream of the bridge section the downstream migration of the scour hole has also been reported by hong and abid 2019 for clear water flow conditions the possible causes for this phenomenon include the shear layer between the flow recirculation zone and the contracted flow region the flow relief downstream of the submerged deck and the overtopping flow that impinges on the bed downstream of the bridge contraction in this study the migration of the scour hole occurred for all ssa experiments and msa experiments under pressure flow conditions so and ot however the existing research findings are not able to provide a quantitative relationship between the scour hole location and relevant flow features more study is needed to address this issue in the future figs 7 10 provide qualitative descriptions of the behaviors of bed forms to better reflect the magnitude and the transverse extent of migrating bed forms at the bridge section fig 11 displays the temporal evolution of scour depth measured at the three locations p1 p3 as shown in fig 2a specifically fig 11a f show the scour evolution of long setback abutment lsa experiments it can be observed that for similar flow intensity either q or q pressure flow conditions so and ot at the bridge section led to significant main channel degradation at p1 more intense flows q caused not only bed level fluctuations with greater magnitudes and frequencies but also more severe undermining at the floodplain edge p3 as shown in fig 11a c and e bed forms were somewhat apparent on the floodplain and caused small scale fluctuations at p3 due to channel slope in addition fig 11f h compare the scour evolution features with different abutment lengths it can be seen that with more severe lateral contraction from lsa to msa and then ssa scour at the main channel p1 became more and more significant and dominating while the bed forms tended to be washed out when passing the bridge sections due to the greatly accelerated flow in fig 11h the effect of bed forms in the main channel p1 is almost negligible 5 behavior of riprap rocks it is mentioned in the last section that with scour development and bed forms migrating through the bridge section the rocks of the riprap apron can be gradually destabilized and undermined the damage to the apron can not only threaten the stability of the abutment toe but also enhancing the subsidence of the main channel bed further detailed analysis ensues in this study neither riprap shear erosion nor a total disintegration occurred during the experiments in general two dominant riprap behaviors were observed slide down and embedment figs 7 10 show the approximate range of the apron slide down zone because the riprap rocks used were uniform winnowing erosion caused by sliding rocks was usually observed and was the primary mode of destabilization in this study in addition due to the propagation of bed forms the embedment of riprap rocks was frequently observed in the main channel and at the toe of the main channel bank for tests with relatively large bed forms as previously stated by chiew 1995 chiew 2004 and chiew and lim 2000 both riprap slide down and embedment at bridge piers are related to the bed level degradation caused by migrating bed forms in this study similar processes were observed for scour at bridge abutments and can be classified into six phases as summarized in table 2 soon after the commencement of each experiment rapid scour occurred on the main channel bank and at the edge of the floodplain which induced differential mobility between the riprap and sediment particles the initiation of scour is related to the high reynold stress u v at the floodplain edge and along the main channel bank in the presence of a transverse flow towards the main channel proust et al 2013 riprap rocks of the apron became mobile once the sediment particles beneath or close to them were carried away and the rate of sliding decreased as the sediment erosion proceeded this process generally developed much faster for tests with relatively large flow rates denoted by q embedment mainly occurred to riprap rocks that slid into the main channel chiew and lim 2000 explained that the large values of d 50 d 50 d 50 is the median diameter of riprap rocks and the propagation of bed forms are the main causes of this behavior the entire riprap layer eventually subsided on top of the re built main channel and retreated main channel bank while the subsidence was mainly attributable to winnowing see table 3 fig 12 shows a typical slide down process of riprap rocks the test was performed with a medium setback abutment an overtopping flow type and a relatively small flow rate msa ot q it can be found that bank erosion occurred almost immediately after the commencement of scour five minutes and most of the rocks slid down in the first two hours then with the progress of scour 10 80 h the extent of slide down deteriorated slowly together with a noticeable degradation of the main channel bed which is in accord with the processes stated above fig 13 shows a typical riprap induced winnowing embedment process in the main channel with migrating dunes it can be seen that a winnowing process prevailed for 70 min until the next dune crest reached the bridge section leading to significant subsidence of the main channel bed a large dune started passing the bridge section after a further 10 min causing embedment of the riprap rocks raising of the main channel bed level and facilitating another period of winnowing the cyclic winnowing embedment processes gradually exacerbated the degradation of the main channel bed and enabled more riprap rocks on the retreated bank slope to slide down in general the physical processes mentioned above are interrelated and together lead to the eventual abutment failure together the behavior of the riprap rocks was similar when subject to the fs so and ot flow conditions as the slide down and embedment processes are governed by a similar abovementioned sediment erosion mechanism the only difference observed was the rate of sliding and embedding which were dominated by the flow intensity at the bridge section with different extents of flow contraction the recorded time lapse videos used to produce figs 12 and 13 are also provided as supplementary materials and can be accessed using link in the appendix 6 embankment failure the geotechnical failure of the embankment as a probable consequence of the dynamic processes discussed in the previous sections bank erosion bed form migration and the break down of riprap apron may fundamentally threaten the safety of local infrastructures in practice a spill through abutment usually comprises a stub supported by a pile cap on a group of piles and an approach embankment that is commonly earth filled ettema et al 2010 identified three different conditions of abutment scour in compound channels when both the bed and the embankment are erodible a condition a hydraulic scour of the main channel causes bank failure and abutment face undercut b condition b hydraulic scour on the flood plain causes failure at the abutment face and c condition c both a and b together cause the breaching of the embankment and the exposure of the abutment column however only a rigid non erodible embankment was used in this paper as the purpose of the present study is investigating scour at the bridge section and thus the criterion of failure is defined as when erosion reaches the toe of the abutment therefore only condition a and b mentioned above were observed in the present study more information about embankment breaching processes can be referred to in ettema et al 2016 and idil bektur and ettema 2017 in the present study erosion reached the toe of the spill through slope in 4 experiments out of 18 in total for short setback abutments ssa under pressure flows so and ot as shown in fig 14 a d as mentioned in the previous sections riprap rocks slid down and were embedded as scour developed and the bank retreated when the most vulnerable apron rock adjacent to the abutment toe lost its stability flow opened up a small gap into the floodplain sediment beneath the embankment sediment particles were then washed out intermittently until an equilibrium status was reached for the four failure cases erosion extended deep into the embankment exposing the piles and rendering the whole abutment toe unsupported another controlled test was also performed to investigate the effect of a geotextile while the other conditions were similar to test ssa ot q the scour pattern of the controlled test is shown in fig 14e the cloth material was set beneath the launching apron to protect the abutment toe from scour excavation without the geotextile filter in fig 14d the failure was initiated at the abutment toe 70 min after the commencement of the experiment with the gap enlarged progressively and concurrently with the embedding process of the rocks at the abutment toe after 24 h a destructive opening was observed and the whole embankment foundation was undermined by contrast with the geotextile filter in place in fig 14e winnowing and rock embedment were effectively mitigated the failure around the abutment toe started after 20 h after 24 h erosion around the abutment toe was still insignificant and the abutment retained its integrity however the geotextile was partially exposed at the end of the test which is detrimental as the flow may lift the whole geotextile as reported by eve 1999 the existence of geotextile filters may induce further edge failure of the riprap and another concern in the present study is that the scale effect of the filter is difficult to evaluate therefore geotextiles were not used in any other experiments in this study 7 risks at a catchment scale an application general erosion risks beyond individual sites may arise when extreme floods occur in a catchment with multiple bridge sites constructed within a close spatial distance under the combined influence of intense sediment transport in the main channel and overland flows in the entire catchment sediment scour and channel subsidence occurring at specific sites may interact with each other and amplify the variation of bed morphology thus this section aims to provide an analysis of such risks using the case of a real and typical river section the findings and conclusions in the previous sections will be incorporated for application fig 15 shows a typical example in the catchment of chattahoochee river that flows through many highly urbanized areas near atlanta and was a major source of overland flows in the epic flood in 2009 gotvald and mccallum 2010 during which a large number of infrastructures were severely damaged the upper chattahoochee river basin is subjected to a significant influence of sediment transport and erosion and the substrate composition is similar to the sediment tested in this study faye et al 1978 the river section shown in fig 15 locates in the northwest of atlanta two groups of bridge sites can be identified according to the spatial proximity group 1 features a section of meandering channel and group 2 is situated within a relatively straight section seven bridge sites in total are included in the figure specifically bridge 1 3 4 and 6 are railway bridges with relatively narrow abutments embankments in the streamwise direction and bridge 2 5 and 7 are multi lane motorway bridges that show longer streamwise contraction all the abutments are protected by riprap rocks the potential flood related hazards are marked schematically see the legend further analysis of detailed risks ensues based on the main findings in this study the bridge sites of group 1 are located immediately downstream of the confluence of chattahoochee river and peachtree creek during the flood in autumn 2009 the water level in peachtree creek increased drastically over 6 m inundating many bridges and contributing to the severe flooding of the chattahoochee basin downstream as shown in fig 15 major overland flow paths are on the right bank around bridge 1 so that the right earth filled embankment roadbed is subjected to a risk of breaching if so the flow will be severely contracted at bridge 2 with a potential of overtopping as the elevation of bridge 2 and its embankments are much higher than bridge 1 considering that the scour hole at short setback abutment tends to migrate downstream the scour holes at the right side of bridge 1 and 2 may merge on the floodplain under extreme conditions and exacerbate bank erosion in contrast the left abutment of bridge 2 locates near the bankline and shows a higher risk of undercutting if the toe area is not strengthened particularly the abutments of bridge 3 are set back from the main channel and thus clear water scour may become predominant during floods however the large and highly skewed piers constructed on the channel bank may potentially facilitate bank erosion and enhance main channel subsidence for extreme flows although this effect is not considered in this study more information can be found in oben nyarko and ettema 2011 and abid 2017 bridge 4 is a relatively separate site with less influence from upstream sites but factors like the near bankline abutments densely constructed piers and a low deck elevation lead to moderate risk of channel erosion and embankment failure more detailed studies are needed to quantify those hazards accurately compared with group 1 the bridge sites of group 2 are located in a relatively straight section with wider floodplain and larger flow passage area and thus the risk of bridge deck inundation is also much lower floodplain scour around abutment toes becomes predominant except for the left bank of bridge 7 where the abutment is close to the bankline the scour of main channel bed will be mainly caused by the contracted and accelerated flow it should also be noted that the railway bridge bridge 6 is also supported by densely constructed piers like bridge 4 therefore the risk of excessive bank erosion facilitated by pier scour should not be ignored to summarize group 1 is subjected to a higher risk of abutment and channel scour and embankment failure due to the close proximity the restricted flow passage space and the potential interaction of sediment processes particularly bridge 2 has the highest risk considering its location close to the river confluence and bridge 1 abutment configuration the left abutment is near the bankline and the low deck elevation maybe submerged during extreme floods in general the findings of the present study can assist the general risk screening for similar river channels and provide practical guidance for engineering design and construction the conclusions show some insights and a long ignored problem i e a combination of hydrology and hydraulics that can be further studied in the future with the assistance of more detailed physical and numerical modelling 8 summary and conclusions in this study laboratory experiments addressing the dynamic physical processes in compound river channels are performed setback bridge abutments embankments were constructed with riprap protection on the floodplain to test the combined influence on channel erosion that is usually the outcome of several hydro geomorphic processes synthesized during floods such processes include the erosion of the main channel bank the migration of bed forms and the disintegration of riprap rocks the risk of a total bridge failure arises when the synthesis of those processes undermines the abutment and threatens the geotechnical stability of the embankment the drastic variations of channel morphology and the related hazards are closely connected with extreme hydrologic events and research on this connection is evidently of both scientific and practical significance regarding the post scour channel profiles slope retreat was found to be the predominant behavior of the main channel bank in floods under the influence of those dynamic processes the main channel bank was eroded gradually towards the abutment toe while keeping the original slope 2 1 thus the post scour channel profile at the bridge section can be approximated using an idealized trapezoid similar to the shape of the pre scour channel the scour depth can be estimated using the unit discharge contraction ratio in the main channel q m 2 q m 1 the relation between scour depth and q m 2 q m 1 is consistent to the previous studies with under clear water conditions besides the measurement of pre scour reynolds shear stress provides another perspective on bank erosion it was found that a longer lateral contraction does not affect the shear strength in the main channel but would push the high shearing zone around abutment toe further towards the bank slope thereby leading to a greater risk of undercutting in contrast flow pressurization had a more apparent influence on enhancing general bed shearing at the bridge section this phenomenon explains the finding in this study that embankment failure occurred for short setback abutments ssa under pressure flow conditions so and ot while the riprap apron was still partially maintained in other cases focusing on the dynamic processes observed during experiments we found that the post scour channel morphology can be further explained by the behaviors of bed forms and riprap rocks as well as the interaction between then migrating bed forms generally stayed in the main channel for long setback abutments lsa but would shift transversely towards the floodplain for longer abutments msa and interact with destabilized riprap rocks for ssa tests bed forms were constrained and damped in the main channel at the bridge section and would either shift towards the downstream floodplain for smaller discharges or recover in the main channel for larger discharges at where bed forms interacted with destabilized loose rocks dune troughs played an important role in enhancing sediment erosion by winnowing i e sediment particles were eroded via the gaps between the exposed rocks when riprap rocks slid into the main channel the intermittent arrival of dune crests and troughs led to cyclic rock embedment and exposure during which the winnowing effect exacerbated the subsidence of the main channel bed accordingly to maintain a stable slope following main channel subsidence the retreated main channel bank would further undermine the abutment toe and lead to higher risks of embankment failure in general the final channel morphology is the outcome of a series of physical processes that interact with each other while amplifying the extent of sediment erosion a real river section is used as an example to evaluate the potential scour and erosion hazards based on the main experimental findings in this paper besides during extreme floods a greater risk may arise with amplified erosion on a catchment scale if multiple bridges are constructed in close proximity the analysis shows that major risks exist at the highly curved region around bridge 2 where floodplain scour can potentially merge and the outer bank is subjected to a greater risk of embankment failure due to the short setback distance besides deck submergence and potential embankment breach upstream at bridge 1 occurring during extreme floods may further threaten the safety of bridge 2 generally the findings in this study can assist in evaluating scour and erosion risks for extreme hydrologic events more experimental and numerical studies should be performed to further quantify the influence of each factor and refine this evaluation framework credit authorship contribution statement yifan yang conceptualization formal analysis data curation visualization writing original draft

4841,fluvial morphology in compound river channels usually undergoes drastic variation during extreme floods due to scour and erosion processes those processes can be highly dynamic consisting of multiple elements e g bed form migration bank erosion riprap break down etc that are inter dependent the existence of bridge abutments and embankments that lead to flow contraction on the floodplain brings more complexity and uncertainty the present study investigated flood related processes around bridge sites in a compound channel with different abutment embankment configurations results show that a longer abutment embankment pushes the high shearing zone on the floodplain around abutment toe further towards the bank slope and causes a higher risk of undercutting at the toe area while vertical flow pressurization had a more significant effect on enhancing general bed shearing the main channel bank tends to retain a constant slope 2 1 as scour progresses gradually during floods the channel bed scour is closely related to the unit discharge contraction ratio determined by both lateral and vertical flow contractions regarding the interaction between dynamic processes migrating bed forms enhanced sediment erosion by cyclic embedment winnowing processes when they met destabilized loose riprap rocks thus rocks sliding into the main channel may cause a higher risk of bed subsidence and then embankment failure in total four bed form migration types i e interaction types are observed for different abutment embankment lengths and flow intensities in general the observed processes provide a clear picture of how channel morphology is altered dynamically by multiple factors during extreme floods additionally the findings in this study are integrated under a framework to evaluate the potential scour and erosion hazards in a real river section it is found that those hazards may go beyond individual sites affecting each other and then the morphological evolution at a catchment

features dynamic processes e g bed form migration in the main channel while much weaker bed mobility is usually observed on the floodplain e g a clear water flow regime or lateral transfer of some fine sediments from the main channel this non uniformity is usually accompanied by significant transverse momentum exchange and turbulent mixing which have been studied extensively by physical experiments in the last two decades those studies were designed for straight compound channels babaeyan koopaei et al 2002 van prooijen et al 2005 yang et al 2013 koziol 2013 proust et al 2017 proust and nikora 2020 meandering compound channels shiono et al 2009 liu et al 2016 2018 shan et al 2018 wang et al 2020 pan et al 2019 or a straight rectangular channel with lateral roughness transition vermaas et al 2011 in the meantime proust et al 2006 studied the influence of abrupt floodplain contraction and peltier et al 2013 measured the turbulence around embankments on the floodplain of a compound channel however most of the abovementioned experiments were performed using fixed beds which benefited flow measurements but limited the understanding of the morphological evolution of erodible river channels the causes of erosion in compound channels are usually multifold including general sediment transport flow induced bank failure and obstructions on the floodplain or in the main channel bridge abutments and the attached embankments are the most typical lateral obstructions on floodplains abutments usually work in proximity to and together with earth filled embankments to support bridge decks and other superstructures at river crossings and those sites may appear consecutively along the channel in a small catchment area although abutments are usually set back on floodplains and unsubmerged in dry seasons flood flows may cause a significant rise in stage and lead to significant flow contraction around the abutment toe areas and the corresponding macro turbulence those flow features are responsible for sediment scour on alluvial beds during extreme floods extensive scour damages may occur and alter the channel morphology this process is usually dynamic and influenced by multiple elements e g sediment riprap obstructions etc fig 1 shows two typical cases of the variation of water surface area in dry and flooding seasons as well as the eroded bed patterns generated during floods specifically in fig 1a apparent bed form migration can be seen in the main channel and on the channel bank left photo that were entirely submerged during a flood right photo the floodplain especially around the abutment toe was heavily inundated with a high risk of sediment scour a similar scenario can be seen in fig 1b for a relatively straight channel section significant scour and bank erosion around the abutment toe was caused by repeated floods right photo excessive scour and erosion impair the stability of the embankment and bring a significant risk of bridge failure which is usually followed by economic losses and possibly the losses of human lives the epic flood that occurred in georgia usa in 2009 showed that the damage of flood flows to bridges in the entire catchment can be devastating gotvald and mccallum 2010 the focus of previous studies on abutment scour was generally restrained to single sites with simplified hydraulic conditions that are relatively static however flooding rivers in the real world are usually accompanied by a series of dynamic processes that are severely understudied although the research on abutment scour initiated as early as the mid 1950s by laursen and toch 1956 the studies published before the late 1990s generally adopted simple experimental set ups e g clear water scour at vertical abutments in simple rectangular channels without protection a comprehensive summary of the early research can be referred to in melville and coleman 2000 since the early 2000s researchers have started to investigate more complicated aspects of abutment scour e g the dependence of scour depth and location on time cardoso and bettess 1999 coleman et al 2003 ballio et al 2010 hong and abid 2019 the performance of riprap as scour countermeasures in compound channels melville et al 2006a 2006b 2007 morales et al 2008 pier abutment interactions oben nyarko and ettema 2011 the categorization of scour pattern in compound channels sturm 2006 yorozuya and ettema 2015 and abutment breaching ettema et al 2015 2016 idil bektur and ettema 2017 hong et al 2015 made significant contributions by integrating clear water local and contraction scour at setback abutments and proposing a modified scour predictor several comprehensive reports including barkdoll et al 2007 ettema et al 2010 and sturm et al 2011 should also be noted as each of them covers more than one of the abovementioned studies while providing more details sturm et al 2018 further studied the interaction of different modes of scour at a bridge crossing including processes of abutment and contraction scour for both live bed and clear water scour conditions in a compound channel however most of the abovementioned studies only focused on clear water flow regimes without comprehensive sediment transport which limits the application of the findings thus it is necessary to extend those efforts by considering the complexity under live bed flow regimes in general our current knowledge of dynamic physical processes in flooded rivers is still inadequate especially when setback obstructions exist concurrently with significant bed mobility thus this study intends to answer three interrelated research questions how does channel morphology evolve dynamically with comprehensive sediment transport in the main channel during extreme floods how do bed forms propagate deform and influence sediment erosion when passing through a bridge contraction and how do riprap rocks interact with other sediment processes break down and contribute to the post flood channel morphology at bridge sites besides it is also expected that the fluvial morphology not only at individual sites but also in the entire catchment would be affected if multiple scour and erosion hazards occur in proximity within a catchment area we aim to propose a framework for the preliminary evaluation of catchment risks based on the main findings this study is a continuation of two previous studies yang et al in press melville et al in press specifically the former was focused on the flow field with fixed unscoured channel bed while the latter studied the effect of streamwise abutment length on clear water scour at vertical wall abutments this study made further efforts to investigate more close to reality scenarios using an erodible compound channel three spill through abutment configurations and three bridge inundation conditions the phenomenon of bed form migration during floods is well simulated new insights into the abovementioned research questions are provided and the intended framework is then examined using the case of a real river channel 2 experimental set up the experiments were conducted in a 1 54 m wide 1 2 m deep and 45 m long flume recirculating both water and sediment all sediment slurry was guided into the main channel to ensure no sediment transport on the floodplain a 1 08 m wide floodplain a 0 26 m wide main channel bank at a 2 1 side slope and a 0 2 m wide main channel bottom were built along the flume a 4 6 m long test section was located 30 m downstream from the inlet section to simulate the fully erodible channel while the floodplain and main channel bed were fixed outside the test section bank protections were set at the transitions between fixed beds and the test section to minimize the effect of unrealistic edge scour the flume was filled with uniform quartz sand with a median diameter d 50 0 84 mm and a geometric standard deviation σ g 1 30 the entire set up was designed to represent a prototype bridge section with a two lane bridge at a 1 45 geometric scale the abutment models were in a spill through form consisting of pile supported stub and non erodible embankment with 2 1 side slopes around 27 to the horizontal plane riprap rocks were used as scour countermeasures placed at the spill through slopes and around the toe of the abutment as a launching apron the selection of the rock sizes and apron dimensions were determined based on the recommendations in hec 23 lagasse et al 2009 besides the floodplain in the upstream channel is roughened using rocks that simulate the effect of rigid vegetation fig 2 shows the configuration of the compound channel built in the flume and the dimensions of the abutments and scour countermeasures twenty two experiments in total were performed in this study including a matrix of conditions of deck submergence abutment length and flow intensity as summarized below three submergence conditions free surface fs submerged orifice so and overtopping ot each condition features a certain range of approach flow depth four spill through abutment lengths long setback abutment lsa l a b f 0 5 medium setback abutment msa l a b f 0 65 short setback abutment ssa l a b f 0 8 and no abutment na l a b f 0 specifically l a is abutment length from the abutment toe to the flume wall and b f is the width of the floodplain variable flow intensity in the main channel the flow in the main channel was under live bed conditions and the flow intensity ratio can be categorized into two groups according to the values the first group had relatively smaller flow intensities 1 00 u m u m c 1 15 and is denoted by q hereinafter the other group had larger flow intensities 1 34 u m u m c 1 71 and is denoted by q hereinafter specifically u m is the mean flow velocity in the upstream main channel and u m c is the critical velocity for sediment incipient motion in the main channel the method of melville and coleman 2000 was used to calculate the critical velocity variable flow intensity on the floodplain the flow on the floodplain was under clear water condition u fl u f l c 1 0 where u fl is the mean flow velocity on the upstream floodplain and u f l c is the critical velocity for sediment incipient motion on the floodplain as an example ssa fs q signifies that the test was performed using a short setback abutment ssa with a relatively small flow intensity q while the bridge deck was not submerged i e free surface fs flow table 1 summarizes the experimental parameters in this study the data of flow depth and velocity shown in table 1 were measured using a fixed pre scour compound channel more details about the measurements are provided in yang et al in press a four receiver vectrino down looking adv nortek as was used to measure flow velocity at three cross sections including the approach upstream section the downstream end of the bridge deck and the downstream section far from the abutment for each cross section the grid of measurement had a resolution of 5 mm in the vertical direction and 10 50 mm in the transverse direction the discharge subdivisions in the main channel including bank slope and the floodplain were then calculated based on the measured data the method of soulsby 1981 was used to estimate the bed shear stress real time bed elevations were recorded in three locations p1 p2 and p3 at the contracted region as shown in fig 2a the distances to the right flume wall the main channel side were 100 mm 330 mm and 460 mm respectively the measured scour depth d s f p is the vertical distance from pre scour floodplain level to the level of the most scoured point the tailwater levels in this study were well controlled and stayed constant i e y f 0 from the downstream section to the sump where water was recirculated by pumps all the experiments ran for a specific duration of time to ensure the dynamic equilibrium status was reached 3 bank erosion and channel bed scour this section presents post test bed morphology and channel scour data and then attention is paid to the long term erosion pattern of main channel bank during floods as stated by simons and senturk 1992 sediment particles on a side slope have lower critical shear stresses compared with those on a horizontal plane under the flow conditions in this study the main channel bank was still be eroded to some extent even in the absence of the abutment structure and the bridge deck this portion of erosion is difficult to distinguish from the final topography in the case of a compound channel in coarse alluvium with no obstruction a self formed stable main channel bank may deform observably during an extreme flood event besides other components of scour would occur simultaneously if any structures intrude into the flow therefore the total scour at a bridge site is actually a combination of scour components concurrently induced by all possible factors including the side slope factor two types of main channel bank reaction subject to sediment erosion are usually observed i e slope decrease see fig 3 a or slope retreat see fig 3b as stated by osman and thorne 1988 and thorne and abt 1993 in this study bank slope retreat was found to be the predominant behavior both within or out of the contracted region the existence of concurrent erosion at the main channel bank complicates the scour process and the scour estimation at bridge abutments the overall scour process is affected by several elements including erosion resistant properties of the bank material water depth differences between the main channel and the floodplain the initial main channel bank slope before a flood event and the magnitude of the high stress region as well as its distribution across the section with a strong mass transfer from floodplain to the main channel this region is located along the main channel bank e g proust et al 2013 fig 4 shows the transverse bed morphologies for short setback abutments ssa and long setback abutments lsa measured at the downstream end of the bridge deck after terminating the experiments it can be seen that for both long setback and short setback abutments the main channel bank tended to maintain its original slope 2 1 after scour for most of the experiments despite the main channel degradation for short setback abutments with pressure flows so and ot see fig 4a the main channel bank retreated towards the abutment toe and invaded into the space beneath the embankment leaving the abutment undercut and undermining the stability of the structure this mechanism will be further discussed in the following sections for long setback abutments see fig 4b the main channel bank still tended to retreat to the abutment toe area where the riprap apron was initially set except for test lsa fs q but the stability of the abutment itself was not threatened generally the abutment setback distance has a significant effect on the scour geometry at the bridge section but does not alter the behavioral pattern of the main channel bank fig 5 shows the pre scour distribution of normalized reynolds shear stress u v u 2 for lateral shearing and u w u 2 for vertical shearing at the approach section and the bridge section for overtopping flows specifically u and w are the longitudinal and vertical fluctuating velocity components and u is the pre scour approach shear velocity in the middle of the main channel it can be seen that in fig 5a vertical pressurization is a key factor to the enhancement of lateral shearing the main scour driven factor on the main channel bank and near the floodplain s edge comparatively the strength of vertical shearing is much weaker but generally follow the same pattern of distribution in the displayed transects see fig 5b this similarity also suggests that the turbulent flows in this study are isotropic it is found that the length of lateral contraction does not significantly alter the shear strength in the main channel which explains the similar bank behaviors shown in fig 4 however a longer lateral contraction pushes the high shearing zone near the abutment toe further towards the main channel bank thereby leading to a greater risk of undercutting and total bank failure in summary although vertical contraction has a more predominant effect on enhancing shearing on the channel slope than lateral contraction the combined scour driven force is determined by the overall flow redistribution around the bridge section more analysis ensues in the following paragraphs to further investigate the effect of flow contraction on channel bed scour fig 6 shows the variation of the normalized scour depth d s f p y m 0 and the normalized maximum post scour flow depth y max y m 0 with the extent of flow contraction a schematic drawing of scoured channel cross section is given in fig 6a both melville 1992 and melville et al 2006a stated that scour depth may increase with the increasing abutment length i e greater lateral contraction in this study we found that channel bed scour is also significantly influenced by vertical flow pressurization while the variation of the discharge itself does not significantly affect the scour depth directly as shown in fig 6b it can be seen that the data of pressure flow so and ot generally follow the same trend while fs flows tend to cause significantly smaller scour depth relative to the depth of tailwater although greater flow pressurization may produce deeper scour depth e g from so to ot the value of the normalized form d s f p y m 0 does not change significantly another approach for understanding the effect of abutment length is the dependence of scour depth on a discharge contraction ratio this parameter is fundamentally determined by the abutment length for a given channel configuration and it has extensive applicability especially in compound channels where the transverse flow distribution is non uniform since the majority of the scour holes were located in the region of the main channel and main channel bank even for the long setback abutment unit discharge contraction ratio in the main channel q m 2 q m 1 is used herein in fig 6c a nearly linear relationship exist between q m 2 q m 1 and y max y m 0 where y max is the maximum post scour water depth and y m 0 is the mean flow depth in the whole main channel far downstream of the bridge the clear water scour data of hong et al 2015 and abid 2017 also displayed and are generally consistent with the data of this study it should be noted that q m 2 includes the overtopping discharge and y m 0 is used to account for the geometrical non uniformity in the main channel and on main channel bank in the figure the data of different flow types fs so and ot flows generally follow the same trend as q m 2 q m 1 is an integrated indicator of flow contraction regardless of detailed main channel geometry previous studies including laursen 1960 ettema et al 2010 and hong et al 2015 have shown the dependence of clear water contraction scour on q m 2 q m 1 the data of this study further prove the appropriateness of using q m 2 q m 1 as a key factor to estimate the potential channel scour in a contracted and erodible compound channel for both live bed and clear water flow conditions 4 behavior of migrating dunes the previous results show the post test cross sectional profiles and the time averaged scour depth values however multiple dynamic processes existed and interacted with each other during the experiments and thus the bed morphology varied instantaneously with time in this study bed forms propagated mainly in the form of dunes the propagation of bed forms inevitably altered the scour pattern at the bridge section and was found to endanger the geo stability of the abutment conversely the propagating mode of bed forms was also affected by the obstructions previous studies e g chiew and lim 2000 indicated that under live bed scour conditions dune troughs were the main cause of the destabilization of riprap rocks during embedment processes however observations of the scour process in this study showed that dune crests could also exacerbate the erosion at the bridge section it was found that when a large amplitude sand crest avalanched into the bridge section the flow area was accordingly reduced increasing the mean flow velocity in the contracted section and thus further promoting erosion around the abutment toe this phenomenon was particularly apparent for short setback abutments ssa under such circumstances sediment particles close to the abutment toe are prone to winnowing leading to disintegration of the riprap apron in other words large amplitude dune crests cause deposition at the downstream portion of the bridge section reduce the flow area increase the flow velocity and then exacerbate the winnowing process at the upstream portion of the bridge section close to the abutment toe when the apron rocks near the abutment toe were removed scour undercut the spill slope material and the abutment was threatened by a geotechnical failure in summary dune troughs led to embedment of the peripheral riprap in the main channel while dune crests tended to intensify the sediment winnowing failure close to the abutment toe the more detailed behavior of riprap rocks and embankment failures is discussed in the following sections in the present study upstream of the bridge section well developed bed forms migrated mainly in the deeper main channel and occupied part of the main channel bank area however the mode of dune migration was subject to significant variability in the bridge section based on laboratory observations bed form migration through the bridge section can be classified into four types bed forms did not directly interact with the abutment and the riprap while migrating downstream as shown in fig 7 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with long setback abutments lsa in these cases the abutment was significantly set back from the main channel so that there was sufficient space for the dunes passing through the bridge section without interfering with the abutment small secondary ripples formed in a relatively independent scour trench on the floodplain which did not merge with the scour hole in the main channel bed forms shifted laterally towards the abutment at the bridge section to a significant extent and were dissected by the scour trench on the floodplain as shown in fig 8 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with medium setback abutments msa in these cases riprap rocks destabilized by the retreated bank slid down to the region of the original main channel while the laterally shifted dunes interacted with the rocks showing significant embedment and winnowing phenomena the scour holes were mainly located at the bridge section bed forms shifted laterally after passing the bridge section towards the scour hole located at the downstream side of the abutment as shown in fig 9 these bed forms typically occurred in experiments with short setback abutments ssa and relatively small flow intensities q in these cases deep and large scour holes formed downstream of the abutment and dunes were found to avalanche into the scour hole bed form amplitudes decreased significantly while passing the abutment as shown in fig 10 these bed forms typically occurred with short setback abutments ssa and with relatively large flow intensities q in these cases the flow was significantly accelerated at the bridge section due to the significant contraction and the flow rapidly carried away the sediment particles and reduced the height of the dunes dunes gradually recovered after passing the scour holes forming downstream of the bridge section the downstream migration of the scour hole has also been reported by hong and abid 2019 for clear water flow conditions the possible causes for this phenomenon include the shear layer between the flow recirculation zone and the contracted flow region the flow relief downstream of the submerged deck and the overtopping flow that impinges on the bed downstream of the bridge contraction in this study the migration of the scour hole occurred for all ssa experiments and msa experiments under pressure flow conditions so and ot however the existing research findings are not able to provide a quantitative relationship between the scour hole location and relevant flow features more study is needed to address this issue in the future figs 7 10 provide qualitative descriptions of the behaviors of bed forms to better reflect the magnitude and the transverse extent of migrating bed forms at the bridge section fig 11 displays the temporal evolution of scour depth measured at the three locations p1 p3 as shown in fig 2a specifically fig 11a f show the scour evolution of long setback abutment lsa experiments it can be observed that for similar flow intensity either q or q pressure flow conditions so and ot at the bridge section led to significant main channel degradation at p1 more intense flows q caused not only bed level fluctuations with greater magnitudes and frequencies but also more severe undermining at the floodplain edge p3 as shown in fig 11a c and e bed forms were somewhat apparent on the floodplain and caused small scale fluctuations at p3 due to channel slope in addition fig 11f h compare the scour evolution features with different abutment lengths it can be seen that with more severe lateral contraction from lsa to msa and then ssa scour at the main channel p1 became more and more significant and dominating while the bed forms tended to be washed out when passing the bridge sections due to the greatly accelerated flow in fig 11h the effect of bed forms in the main channel p1 is almost negligible 5 behavior of riprap rocks it is mentioned in the last section that with scour development and bed forms migrating through the bridge section the rocks of the riprap apron can be gradually destabilized and undermined the damage to the apron can not only threaten the stability of the abutment toe but also enhancing the subsidence of the main channel bed further detailed analysis ensues in this study neither riprap shear erosion nor a total disintegration occurred during the experiments in general two dominant riprap behaviors were observed slide down and embedment figs 7 10 show the approximate range of the apron slide down zone because the riprap rocks used were uniform winnowing erosion caused by sliding rocks was usually observed and was the primary mode of destabilization in this study in addition due to the propagation of bed forms the embedment of riprap rocks was frequently observed in the main channel and at the toe of the main channel bank for tests with relatively large bed forms as previously stated by chiew 1995 chiew 2004 and chiew and lim 2000 both riprap slide down and embedment at bridge piers are related to the bed level degradation caused by migrating bed forms in this study similar processes were observed for scour at bridge abutments and can be classified into six phases as summarized in table 2 soon after the commencement of each experiment rapid scour occurred on the main channel bank and at the edge of the floodplain which induced differential mobility between the riprap and sediment particles the initiation of scour is related to the high reynold stress u v at the floodplain edge and along the main channel bank in the presence of a transverse flow towards the main channel proust et al 2013 riprap rocks of the apron became mobile once the sediment particles beneath or close to them were carried away and the rate of sliding decreased as the sediment erosion proceeded this process generally developed much faster for tests with relatively large flow rates denoted by q embedment mainly occurred to riprap rocks that slid into the main channel chiew and lim 2000 explained that the large values of d 50 d 50 d 50 is the median diameter of riprap rocks and the propagation of bed forms are the main causes of this behavior the entire riprap layer eventually subsided on top of the re built main channel and retreated main channel bank while the subsidence was mainly attributable to winnowing see table 3 fig 12 shows a typical slide down process of riprap rocks the test was performed with a medium setback abutment an overtopping flow type and a relatively small flow rate msa ot q it can be found that bank erosion occurred almost immediately after the commencement of scour five minutes and most of the rocks slid down in the first two hours then with the progress of scour 10 80 h the extent of slide down deteriorated slowly together with a noticeable degradation of the main channel bed which is in accord with the processes stated above fig 13 shows a typical riprap induced winnowing embedment process in the main channel with migrating dunes it can be seen that a winnowing process prevailed for 70 min until the next dune crest reached the bridge section leading to significant subsidence of the main channel bed a large dune started passing the bridge section after a further 10 min causing embedment of the riprap rocks raising of the main channel bed level and facilitating another period of winnowing the cyclic winnowing embedment processes gradually exacerbated the degradation of the main channel bed and enabled more riprap rocks on the retreated bank slope to slide down in general the physical processes mentioned above are interrelated and together lead to the eventual abutment failure together the behavior of the riprap rocks was similar when subject to the fs so and ot flow conditions as the slide down and embedment processes are governed by a similar abovementioned sediment erosion mechanism the only difference observed was the rate of sliding and embedding which were dominated by the flow intensity at the bridge section with different extents of flow contraction the recorded time lapse videos used to produce figs 12 and 13 are also provided as supplementary materials and can be accessed using link in the appendix 6 embankment failure the geotechnical failure of the embankment as a probable consequence of the dynamic processes discussed in the previous sections bank erosion bed form migration and the break down of riprap apron may fundamentally threaten the safety of local infrastructures in practice a spill through abutment usually comprises a stub supported by a pile cap on a group of piles and an approach embankment that is commonly earth filled ettema et al 2010 identified three different conditions of abutment scour in compound channels when both the bed and the embankment are erodible a condition a hydraulic scour of the main channel causes bank failure and abutment face undercut b condition b hydraulic scour on the flood plain causes failure at the abutment face and c condition c both a and b together cause the breaching of the embankment and the exposure of the abutment column however only a rigid non erodible embankment was used in this paper as the purpose of the present study is investigating scour at the bridge section and thus the criterion of failure is defined as when erosion reaches the toe of the abutment therefore only condition a and b mentioned above were observed in the present study more information about embankment breaching processes can be referred to in ettema et al 2016 and idil bektur and ettema 2017 in the present study erosion reached the toe of the spill through slope in 4 experiments out of 18 in total for short setback abutments ssa under pressure flows so and ot as shown in fig 14 a d as mentioned in the previous sections riprap rocks slid down and were embedded as scour developed and the bank retreated when the most vulnerable apron rock adjacent to the abutment toe lost its stability flow opened up a small gap into the floodplain sediment beneath the embankment sediment particles were then washed out intermittently until an equilibrium status was reached for the four failure cases erosion extended deep into the embankment exposing the piles and rendering the whole abutment toe unsupported another controlled test was also performed to investigate the effect of a geotextile while the other conditions were similar to test ssa ot q the scour pattern of the controlled test is shown in fig 14e the cloth material was set beneath the launching apron to protect the abutment toe from scour excavation without the geotextile filter in fig 14d the failure was initiated at the abutment toe 70 min after the commencement of the experiment with the gap enlarged progressively and concurrently with the embedding process of the rocks at the abutment toe after 24 h a destructive opening was observed and the whole embankment foundation was undermined by contrast with the geotextile filter in place in fig 14e winnowing and rock embedment were effectively mitigated the failure around the abutment toe started after 20 h after 24 h erosion around the abutment toe was still insignificant and the abutment retained its integrity however the geotextile was partially exposed at the end of the test which is detrimental as the flow may lift the whole geotextile as reported by eve 1999 the existence of geotextile filters may induce further edge failure of the riprap and another concern in the present study is that the scale effect of the filter is difficult to evaluate therefore geotextiles were not used in any other experiments in this study 7 risks at a catchment scale an application general erosion risks beyond individual sites may arise when extreme floods occur in a catchment with multiple bridge sites constructed within a close spatial distance under the combined influence of intense sediment transport in the main channel and overland flows in the entire catchment sediment scour and channel subsidence occurring at specific sites may interact with each other and amplify the variation of bed morphology thus this section aims to provide an analysis of such risks using the case of a real and typical river section the findings and conclusions in the previous sections will be incorporated for application fig 15 shows a typical example in the catchment of chattahoochee river that flows through many highly urbanized areas near atlanta and was a major source of overland flows in the epic flood in 2009 gotvald and mccallum 2010 during which a large number of infrastructures were severely damaged the upper chattahoochee river basin is subjected to a significant influence of sediment transport and erosion and the substrate composition is similar to the sediment tested in this study faye et al 1978 the river section shown in fig 15 locates in the northwest of atlanta two groups of bridge sites can be identified according to the spatial proximity group 1 features a section of meandering channel and group 2 is situated within a relatively straight section seven bridge sites in total are included in the figure specifically bridge 1 3 4 and 6 are railway bridges with relatively narrow abutments embankments in the streamwise direction and bridge 2 5 and 7 are multi lane motorway bridges that show longer streamwise contraction all the abutments are protected by riprap rocks the potential flood related hazards are marked schematically see the legend further analysis of detailed risks ensues based on the main findings in this study the bridge sites of group 1 are located immediately downstream of the confluence of chattahoochee river and peachtree creek during the flood in autumn 2009 the water level in peachtree creek increased drastically over 6 m inundating many bridges and contributing to the severe flooding of the chattahoochee basin downstream as shown in fig 15 major overland flow paths are on the right bank around bridge 1 so that the right earth filled embankment roadbed is subjected to a risk of breaching if so the flow will be severely contracted at bridge 2 with a potential of overtopping as the elevation of bridge 2 and its embankments are much higher than bridge 1 considering that the scour hole at short setback abutment tends to migrate downstream the scour holes at the right side of bridge 1 and 2 may merge on the floodplain under extreme conditions and exacerbate bank erosion in contrast the left abutment of bridge 2 locates near the bankline and shows a higher risk of undercutting if the toe area is not strengthened particularly the abutments of bridge 3 are set back from the main channel and thus clear water scour may become predominant during floods however the large and highly skewed piers constructed on the channel bank may potentially facilitate bank erosion and enhance main channel subsidence for extreme flows although this effect is not considered in this study more information can be found in oben nyarko and ettema 2011 and abid 2017 bridge 4 is a relatively separate site with less influence from upstream sites but factors like the near bankline abutments densely constructed piers and a low deck elevation lead to moderate risk of channel erosion and embankment failure more detailed studies are needed to quantify those hazards accurately compared with group 1 the bridge sites of group 2 are located in a relatively straight section with wider floodplain and larger flow passage area and thus the risk of bridge deck inundation is also much lower floodplain scour around abutment toes becomes predominant except for the left bank of bridge 7 where the abutment is close to the bankline the scour of main channel bed will be mainly caused by the contracted and accelerated flow it should also be noted that the railway bridge bridge 6 is also supported by densely constructed piers like bridge 4 therefore the risk of excessive bank erosion facilitated by pier scour should not be ignored to summarize group 1 is subjected to a higher risk of abutment and channel scour and embankment failure due to the close proximity the restricted flow passage space and the potential interaction of sediment processes particularly bridge 2 has the highest risk considering its location close to the river confluence and bridge 1 abutment configuration the left abutment is near the bankline and the low deck elevation maybe submerged during extreme floods in general the findings of the present study can assist the general risk screening for similar river channels and provide practical guidance for engineering design and construction the conclusions show some insights and a long ignored problem i e a combination of hydrology and hydraulics that can be further studied in the future with the assistance of more detailed physical and numerical modelling 8 summary and conclusions in this study laboratory experiments addressing the dynamic physical processes in compound river channels are performed setback bridge abutments embankments were constructed with riprap protection on the floodplain to test the combined influence on channel erosion that is usually the outcome of several hydro geomorphic processes synthesized during floods such processes include the erosion of the main channel bank the migration of bed forms and the disintegration of riprap rocks the risk of a total bridge failure arises when the synthesis of those processes undermines the abutment and threatens the geotechnical stability of the embankment the drastic variations of channel morphology and the related hazards are closely connected with extreme hydrologic events and research on this connection is evidently of both scientific and practical significance regarding the post scour channel profiles slope retreat was found to be the predominant behavior of the main channel bank in floods under the influence of those dynamic processes the main channel bank was eroded gradually towards the abutment toe while keeping the original slope 2 1 thus the post scour channel profile at the bridge section can be approximated using an idealized trapezoid similar to the shape of the pre scour channel the scour depth can be estimated using the unit discharge contraction ratio in the main channel q m 2 q m 1 the relation between scour depth and q m 2 q m 1 is consistent to the previous studies with under clear water conditions besides the measurement of pre scour reynolds shear stress provides another perspective on bank erosion it was found that a longer lateral contraction does not affect the shear strength in the main channel but would push the high shearing zone around abutment toe further towards the bank slope thereby leading to a greater risk of undercutting in contrast flow pressurization had a more apparent influence on enhancing general bed shearing at the bridge section this phenomenon explains the finding in this study that embankment failure occurred for short setback abutments ssa under pressure flow conditions so and ot while the riprap apron was still partially maintained in other cases focusing on the dynamic processes observed during experiments we found that the post scour channel morphology can be further explained by the behaviors of bed forms and riprap rocks as well as the interaction between then migrating bed forms generally stayed in the main channel for long setback abutments lsa but would shift transversely towards the floodplain for longer abutments msa and interact with destabilized riprap rocks for ssa tests bed forms were constrained and damped in the main channel at the bridge section and would either shift towards the downstream floodplain for smaller discharges or recover in the main channel for larger discharges at where bed forms interacted with destabilized loose rocks dune troughs played an important role in enhancing sediment erosion by winnowing i e sediment particles were eroded via the gaps between the exposed rocks when riprap rocks slid into the main channel the intermittent arrival of dune crests and troughs led to cyclic rock embedment and exposure during which the winnowing effect exacerbated the subsidence of the main channel bed accordingly to maintain a stable slope following main channel subsidence the retreated main channel bank would further undermine the abutment toe and lead to higher risks of embankment failure in general the final channel morphology is the outcome of a series of physical processes that interact with each other while amplifying the extent of sediment erosion a real river section is used as an example to evaluate the potential scour and erosion hazards based on the main experimental findings in this paper besides during extreme floods a greater risk may arise with amplified erosion on a catchment scale if multiple bridges are constructed in close proximity the analysis shows that major risks exist at the highly curved region around bridge 2 where floodplain scour can potentially merge and the outer bank is subjected to a greater risk of embankment failure due to the short setback distance besides deck submergence and potential embankment breach upstream at bridge 1 occurring during extreme floods may further threaten the safety of bridge 2 generally the findings in this study can assist in evaluating scour and erosion risks for extreme hydrologic events more experimental and numerical studies should be performed to further quantify the influence of each factor and refine this evaluation framework credit authorship contribution statement yifan yang conceptualization formal analysis data curation visualization writing original draft

4842,the dynamics of fog droplets depend on their size and chemical composition as well on the ambient conditions such as relative humidity rh and turbulence we analyze the droplet size distribution dsd in clouds and fog and how it covaries with the air humidity we developed a new setup to remove fog droplets from the foggy air in order to quantify rh in the droplet free air the setup consists of a newly developed fog droplet separator with an attached h2o gas analyzer and precision thermometer the fog droplet separator works similarly to an active fog collector yet with a high collection efficiency of 98 4 for the liquid water content the water vapor concentration and the air temperature are measured in the droplet free air at a frequency of 1 hz using this system and a fm100 fog monitor we analyzed the droplet size distribution dsd and studied how it covaries with rh we examined two long lasting fog events in march and april 2017 on mt lulin taiwan we found that the dsd differed between data with high rh 100 3 and low rh 99 7 for one event we were able to confirm the hypothesis of the köhler theory which states that droplets are smaller at a low rh than at a high rh in the other event the droplets were larger at low rh which was caused either by entrainment of air masses of different compositions or by droplet growth from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size or by a decrease of droplet sizes beyond the critical diameter with decreasing rh the results show that the developed setup is appropriate to analyze how the dsd covaries with rh in fog keywords fog air humidity droplet size distribution fog microphysics fog droplet separator liquid water content 1 introduction the impact of clouds on atmospheric radiation transfer and energy balance is among the most relevant yet least understood processes in climate change research stocker et al 2013 fog and cloud droplets scatter incident light with intensities that depend on their size and on the wavelength of the light e g friedlander 2000 thus these droplets strongly influence the transfer of radiant energy throughout the atmosphere stocker et al 2013 more specifically one of the key issues in theoretical and applied clouds physics is understanding the relationships between vapor pressure and the microphysical characteristics of clouds korolev and isaac 2006 the albedo of liquid clouds increases with increasing droplet number concentration dnc with decreasing droplet size ds and generally with increasing total droplet surface area a sheer alteration of the droplet size distribution dsd thus changes the optical properties of a cloud stocker et al 2013 besides effects on radiation cloud dncs and dsds exert a strong influence on the lifetime of clouds and on chemical processing of gases and particles overall the droplet sizes of fog and clouds are of great interest in atmospheric physics and climate research the ds in clouds depends on the relative humidity rh although the rh values of clouds and fogs usually remain close to 100 considerable deviations from such conditions have been observed e g korolev and isaac 2006 inside fogs rh can vary swiftly between sub saturated and supersaturated conditions gonser et al 2012 as such the spatial and temporal non uniformity of the humidity inside clouds and fogs results in a correspondingly rapid spatial variation of the concentration of cloud drops and the cloud liquid water content lwc pruppacher and klett 1996 the dependency between ds and rh is described in the köhler curve which combines the two opposing effects that determine the vapor pressure e over an aqueous solution droplet and eventually the rh in equilibrium with a single droplet of diameter d after seinfeld and pandis 2006 e e 0 r h e x p a d b d 3 here e0 is the saturation vapor pressure over a flat water surface of given temperature t the term a d with a 4 σ m r t σ surface tension of pure water m molecular weight of water r gas constant t temperature is the kelvin effect which tends to increase the vapor pressure with decreasing droplet size and the term b d 3 with b 6 n s m π ρ d 3 ns number of moles of solute ρ density is the solute effect which decreases vapor pressure with decreasing diameters seinfeld and pandis 2006 at small diameters the solute effect dominates beyond a critical diameter the kelvin effect dominates droplets with diameters smaller than the critical diameter are in stable equilibrium with their environment whereas if the droplet size exceeds the critical diameter there is no stable equilibrium size for the droplet and it may grow indefinitely the particle is thus considered activated seinfeld and pandis 2006 clouds and fogs are not homogeneous bodies but contain air masses with higher rh and other air masses with lower rh pruppacher and klett 1996 as such it is critical to determine the gas phase humidity content in air however measuring the relative humidity in the range of around 100 is an instrumental challenge particularly under real world conditions and requires specialized equipment gonser et al 2012 the main measurement challenge arises from making sure that the presence of fog droplets does not affect the measurements of water vapor concentration and temperature for example when using an open path optical analyzer for water vapor errors may be caused through erroneous readings from aerosol particles in the sampling path or deposited on the sensor s windows gonser et al 2012 which would result in a slight overestimation of humidity when fog is present in the sample path the expected maximum error is on the order of 0 2 such overestimations are particularly discernible when a narrow dsd is present broader dsd spectra yield less intense overestimations gonser et al 2012 techniques to measure rh in clouds are infrared absorption which has been employed in airborne cloud physics studies korolev and isaac 2006 and the tunable diode laser hintsa et al 1999 may 1998 may et al 2001 which has been successfully employed in cloud studies davis et al 2007 further to separate aerosol particles and droplets before rh analysis conventional impactors and counterflow virtual impactors which employ a gas flow in a direction opposite to the motion of the particles have been used noone et al 1992 boulter et al 2006 early versions of such devices used aircraft flight speed or wind tunnel flow to impart momentum to the particles later vacuum pumps were used to provide the flow pumped counterflow virtual impactor boulter et al 2006 it is the scope of our study to employ instrumentation for water vapor concentration measurements that is widely used in atmospheric boundary layer studies baldocchi et al 2001 and to combine it with an efficient device to separate fog droplets from the gas phase in order to determine the water vapor concentration in fog we therefore developed a setup to separate the fog droplets from the air and to measure the water vapor concentration as well as the air temperature precisely in order to quantify rh at a relatively short time scale of one second for this purpose we constructed a fog droplet separator which produces droplet free air upon which we could measure air temperature and rh the setup was tested and employed under field conditions so that fluctuations of the microphysical conditions in foggy air could be studied we followed the hypotheses that the variability of water vapor in fog is high and that this variability is measurable with high enough precision and temporal resolution to provide insight into the structures and processes driving the variability of fog dsd here we present results from a feasibility study at a subtropical mountain observatory 2 material and methods 2 1 measurement site the measurements took place on top of mt lulin in the yu shan national park central taiwan 23 28 06 n 120 52 25 e with 2862 m above sea level the exposed site lies frequently in the free troposphere and is therefore generally free from boundary layer pollution wai et al 2008 but is rather exposed to long range transport of air pollutants from various source regions in se asia lin et al 2013 the average annual temperature is 10 c and the average annual precipitation 4000 mm simon et al 2016 a continuously operating meteorology and air chemistry site and the frequent occurrence of fog cloudy conditions at temperatures above 0 c set favorable conditions for this feasibility study 2 2 instrumentation the setup consisted of a newly developed fog droplet separator with an attached li 7200 co2 h2o infrared gas analyzer li cor bioscience lincoln nebraska usa and precision thermometer tr 1050f rbr ltd ottawa ontario canada fig 1 a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor droplet measurement technology boulder colorado usa a present weather detector pwd11 vaisala helsinki finland and an r3 50 sonic anemometer gill instruments ltd lymington hampshire uk the nominal accuracies of the h2o analyzer and the temperature probe are within 2 of the reading and within 0 002 k respectively the fog droplet separator works similarly to an active fog collector klemm et al 2008 it consists of a fan unit and a collecting unit which is however not used to collect fog water but to produce a virtually droplet free air stream the collecting unit contains ptfe teflon strands on six frames with two screens each resulting in a total number of twelve screens the strands have a diameter of 0 44 mm and are spaced 1 06 mm apart the double screens have an attack angle of 35 accepting the collection efficiency of 98 4 at conditions typical for mt lulin c f section 2 3 the remaining 1 6 lwc corresponds to an rh of 0 0093 at air temperature ta 15 c when lwc is evaporated into the gas phase a counterflow manifold was installed into the downstream section of the droplet separator whereby the counterflow arrangement further excluded remaining fog droplets from entering the air stream within the manifold air was aspirated with a mean flow rate of 22 2 l min 1 through a 4 mm inner diameter stainless steel pipe the air stream passed the precision thermometer and flowed through the gas analyzer the thermometer was protected from incident radiation by the manifold with the described configuration undisturbed measurements of ta and rh in droplet free air could be realized with a frequency of 1 hz for the precision thermometer and with 10 hz for the gas analyzer hence rh could be measured precisely the droplet spectrometer was installed with a southwest orientation 236 which is the main wind direction at the measurement site 2 3 data processing remember that rh is defined as the ratio of partial pressure of water vapor e versus the saturation vapor pressure of a flat water surface e0 at the ambient temperature ta seinfeld and pandis 2006 the partial pressure was determined by the ideal gas law and the saturation vapor pressure by the magnus formula groselj 2011 this resulted in the following formula r h c 1000 4 615227 t a 273 15 611 2 e x p 17 62 t a 243 12 t a with c being the water vapor concentration in g m 3 and ta being the air temperature in c while the air temperature was logged with a frequency of 1 hz the one second mean of the water vapor concentration was calculated by block averaging the 10 hz data for the fm100 data of the droplet size distribution dsd the particle counts which were also recorded at 10 hz were summed up over one second intervals further the fm100 data was merged into size bins as proposed by gonser et al 2012 and further employed by el madany et al 2016 this resulted in 23 droplet size classes instead of the original 40 size classes this reduction of size classes is necessary to account for the shape of the mie curve describing the single wavelength scattering cross section of droplets from which the droplet diameters are computed in addition we exclusively used data with a 30 min mean wind direction of 30 from the orientation of the fm100 inlet all dnc and lwc data were normalized by the width of the respective droplet class the resulting dnc is in units of cm 3 µm 1 and the lwc in units of mg m 3 µm 1 outliers in the dsd were flattened by applying a savitzky golay smoothing filter savitzky and golay 1964 our calculations are different from those by el madany et al 2016 in that we used a different value for the mean airspeed within the instrument which was 15 3 m s 1 the absolute calibration of the water vapor probe is not sufficient to arrive at an accurate estimate of rh within 1 or even less therefore we followed the idea of korolev and isaac 2006 to assume that the average rh within a cloud is 100 we therefore set the mean of the rh data of individual fog events to 100 through offset adjustment we then analyze high frequency deviations of the rh readings from that average value these deviations are considered reliable because the 10 hz reading of the water vapor probe are again accurate within 2 on an absolute scale in other words if the rh estimate drops for example from 100 0 to 99 5 the deviation 0 5 rh is accurate within 2 of its value i e within 0 01 rh the accuracy of the temperature probe is high enough to be ignored during these considerations for high quality data it is necessary that the measurements of water vapor concentration and air temperature are not essentially disturbed by fog droplets this was realized by performing these measurements in virtually droplet free air produced by the fog droplet separator the collection efficiency was calculated after wrzesinsky 2003 for each droplet of diameter d its stokes number std within the droplet separator was calculated as s t d ρ h 2 o d 2 v a i r c o s α 9 η a i r d s with ρ h 2 o being the density of water kg m 3 d the droplet diameter vair being the air speed vair 7 1 m s 1 α the inclination of the collection strands α 35 ηair the dynamic viscosity of air kg m 1 s 1 and ds the collection strand diameter ds 0 44 mm the collection efficiency εs d of a screen for that droplet is computed after demoz et al 1996 and correction of a print error there as ε s d s t d 3 s t d 3 0 753 s t d 2 2 796 s t d 0 202 and eventually the total collection efficiency εtot d of all screens for a droplet of diameter d as ε t o t d 1 1 ε s d f n with f being the proportion of the area of the air stream that is covered by the strands of one screen f 0 293 and n being the number of screens n 12 the computed total collection efficiencies εtot d range from 0 952 to 0 984 in the droplet diameter range covered by the fm100 2 µm d 50 µm a computational application of these efficiencies to droplet size spectra typical for taiwan mountain fog gonser et al 2012 leads to a volume weighted overall collection efficiency of the droplet separator for lwc of 98 4 accepting the theoretical approach applied here the uncertainty of this number is very small 3 results there were two long lasting 12 h fog events during our experimental period the first one l1 lasted from 2017 03 25 16 43 hrs local time through 2017 03 26 22 06 hrs the second one l2 from 2017 03 31 17 57 hrs through 2017 04 01 12 52 hrs in the beginning and the end phases of these fog events the visibility fluctuated largely so that only the middle section with a visibility constantly below 1000 m was used for further analysis fig 2 during the second long lasting fog event l2 there was a big outlier of rh which was excluded from further analysis further there were two short fog events of which one could not be used for analysis due to wind directions which diverged more than 30 from the orientation of the fm 100 nozzle the other short event s1 lasted almost two hours from 2017 03 28 14 28 hrs to 16 23 hrs the statistics of the relative humidity during these three events is listed in table 1 the average rh was 100 00 in all events per definition we observed large deviations from that average with standard deviations of 0 36 rh l2 to 3 46 rh s1 overall the short event s1 exhibited the biggest variations of rh table 1 to compare the dsd of air masses with higher than average rh to air masses with lower than average rh fig 3 a deadband of 0 3 was used to separate all data with an rh around 100 fig 2 to analyze the dsd the median of the dnc and the lwc of the different channels were calculated the data in the smallest droplet size class from 2 µm to 2 7 µm show very small dncs throughout this seems implausible and it contradicts results found in other studies e g kunkel 1984 gonser et al 2012 we therefore excluded this size class from further analysis fig 3 shows the median dnc and the cumulated lwc for events l1 and l2 separated for the respective rh ranges the dsds with all data are very similar to those of the data around rh 100 data not shown there is a clear difference to the dsds of air masses with high or low rh data with rh 99 7 contain 24 and 16 of all data in l1 and l2 respectively whereas data with rh 100 3 contain 32 and 23 of all data in l1 and l2 respectively table 1 for l1 the ds of the maximum dnc decreases from 12 3 µm for data with rh 99 7 to 8 5 µm for data with 99 7 rh 100 3 and further down to 5 9 µm for data with rh 100 3 fig 3 upper left panel for l2 this trend is the other way round the ds of the maximum dnc starts at 8 5 µm for data with rh 99 7 and 99 7 rh 100 3 and increases to 12 3 µm for data with rh 100 3 the same trends apply to the ds of the lwc fig 3 right panels shows the cumulative lwcs as functions of the droplet diameters the mean volume diameters mvd which are the ds of the 50 levels of the respective ogive functions shown in fig 3 decrease with increasing rh in l1 but increase with increasing rh for l2 for l1 the mvd starts at 15 4 µm for data with rh 99 7 and 99 7 rh 100 3 and decreases to 13 2 µm for data with rh 100 3 for l2 this value starts at 11 4 µm for data with rh 99 7 increases to 13 2 µm at 99 7 rh 100 3 and increases further to 17 8 µm for data with rh 100 3 when considering the total dnc and lwc of the dsds note that fog event l1 has a higher total dnc and lwc with higher rh whereas fog event l2 has a lower total dnc with higher rh and only small changes of the total lwc with changing rh the geometric mean of the ds from the dsds of l1 is higher with a lower rh but for l2 it is higher with a higher rh fog event s1 has generally much smaller dnc and lwc values but there is a slight trend for total dnc and lwc as well as for the geometric means of the dsds where higher values correspond with a higher rh table 2 4 discussion with the newly developed setup including the fog droplet separator and the temperature and humidity probes it is possible to measure the variability of rh in fog with high precision and temporal resolution the variability of rh in fog is rather impressive during our measuring period we successfully measured and analyzed two long lasting fog events as well as one short fog event while more events need to be analyzed to identify the driving structures and processes in more detail we were able to examine the relationships between the rh and dsd in the observed fog events and with the employed methodology politovich and cooper 1988 deduced from research flights through 147 clouds over miles city montana that the supersaturation within these clouds ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 with an average of 0 corresponding to 100 rh for almost all regions of clouds for which the average droplet concentration was at least 50 cm 3 the two fog events in our measuring period which have a mean dnc of at least 50 cm 1 are l1 and l2 table 2 in l1 74 5 of the supersaturation values ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 but the minimum and maximum values of rh are 95 91 and 101 57 in that period in l2 more of the supersaturation values ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 i e 81 1 in addition the minimum and maximum are somewhat closer to this range at 98 90 and 100 94 respectively thus most of the supersaturation values lay in the range given by politovich and cooper 1988 but there are bigger peaks of rh in our data showing that a high variability of water vapor existed during our fog events with respect to the köhler curve fig 4 note that generally smaller droplets exist at lower rh and bigger droplets exist at higher rh however this situation strictly applies only to single droplets that are not activated droplets with a diameter smaller than for droplet d in fig 4 or to the comparison of single droplets at rh below 100 with droplets of the same composition but at rh above 100 i e a b and c compared to d e and f in fig 4 above 100 and after activation of cloud condensation nuclei to the right of region d in fig 4 the further condensation process leads to a decrease of the gas phase humidity content to an increase of the lwc and to a modification of the dsd gonser et al 2012 as we compared the fog conditions with rh 99 7 with those of 99 7 rh 100 3 and eventually with conditions of rh 100 3 the observed increase of lwc with increasing rh during l1 table 2 is in accordance with the köhler theory for individual droplets yet as the mean ds of dnc and lwc is decreasing with increasing rh table 2 this leads to the presumption that the largest droplets could be established within our category of 99 7 rh 100 3 fig 4 region f under these conditions the droplet size decreases with increasing rh i e they move from region f in fig 4 to region e the increase of the small droplets number concentrations with an increasing rh in l1 fig 3 and table 2 likely is an effect of the droplet size detection limit of the fm100 with an increasing rh the droplets in stable equilibrium may grow from the diameter of droplet a in fig 4 to the diameter of droplet b in fig 4 and may then grow from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size this explanation is also supported by the fact that the total dnc is increasing with increasing rh table 2 for different köhler curves due to different type nuclei see below the detection limit intersects at different rh values so this explanation is also relevant for rh values higher than the category rh 99 7 in fog event l2 the mean ds of both distributions of dnc and lwc increases with increasing rh table 2 this indicates that the large droplets exist under conditions with a rh still above 100 3 under these conditions the ds increases from air masses with rh 99 7 regions a and b in fig 4 to air masses with 99 7 rh 100 3 fig 4 region c and further to air masses with rh 100 3 fig 4 regions d and e in this fog event there are not as many droplets that grow from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size which is shown by smaller numbers of small droplets with increasing rh fig 3 and also by decreasing total dnc with increasing rh larger ds values with higher rh are also shown by fog event s1 table 2 in general fog event s1 differs considerably from the two long lasting fog events not only by its shorter duration but also by its very small total dnc lwc and ds values table 2 certainly these considerations need to be met with caution when describing a dsd of a fog event it cannot be assumed that all droplets have the same salt content which would lead to the description of the köhler curve of a specific droplet the observed real world dsd is more complex the two observed long lasting fog events l1 and l2 behave differently within the same change of rh when nuclei with different sizes and composition are present there are numerous possibilities for different droplet sizes in the same rh some droplets may contain soluble material and others insoluble material some may contain both pruppacher and klett 1996 for example at a temperature of 20 c for an aqueous solution drop containing 10 16 g nacl the critical diameter is 0 39 µm at a supersaturation of 0 37 for another droplet containing 10 13 g nacl the critical diameter is 12 7 µm at a supersaturation of 0 011 for a droplet with 1012 g nacl the critical diameter is as large as 40 µm at a supersaturation of only 0 0036 pruppacher and klett 1996 for l1 the decreasing mean ds of the distribution of the dnc with increasing rh table 2 can also be explained by differences in the concentration and composition of the salts in the solution droplet with a mean ds of 10 1 µm for rh 99 7 it is reasonable to assume that the critical diameter of a droplet with this ds is higher than that and so the nucleus could consist of around 1013 g nacl or more or of other salts that act in a similar way further the smaller droplet sizes at higher rh values could also be explained by the presence of much smaller amounts of salts within individual nuclei at air masses with high rh as compared to air masses with low rh so that the critical diameters of these droplets at high rh are also much smaller this is possible by entrainment of air volumes of different composition and history into the cloud gonser et al 2012 for l2 similar amounts of salt are likely present in droplets within air masses of both low and high rh because the ds increases with increasing rh table 2 in addition very rapidly occurring differences in dsd and rh observed in our real world test conditions cannot happen exclusively through condensation and evaporation processes as described in the köhler curve the involved diffusion is too slow other possible processes leading to the differences of the dsd could be turbulence effects and their influence on collision and coalescence gonser et al 2012 to fully understand the relationship and covariation between the dsd and air humidity in fog it is necessary to observe more fog events and to have a stronger focus on entrainment processes our methodological approach as well as the study site employed in this study are suitable for such future studies for further studies it is also required to have a better resolution of small droplets in sizes up to our second size class top threshold at 3 7 µm this applies especially for cases when the ds values are below 2 µm which were excluded from the analysis this is important especially when considering that smaller aerosols scatter more light per unit mass and have a longer atmospheric lifetime than larger aerosols penner et al 2001 for example the typical drop size spectra in fog at otis air force base massachusetts shown by pruppacher and klett 1996 shows the highest dnc at droplet sizes below 5 µm and a decrease for higher droplet diameters with the exception of a plateau or a second peak at diameters around 20 µm to 30 µm in some cases in our data the decrease begins at a diameter higher than 10 µm fig 3 but the dsd of the lwc is similar to the one shown by pruppacher and klett 1996 their maximum lwc is at a ds near 10 µm or near 30 µm or has peaks at both of these values the maxima of the fog events l1 and l2 16 6 µm and 14 2 µm respectively data not shown in detail are also near 10 µm only the maximum of the lwc distribution of l2 for rh 100 3 shows a bigger ds at 23 µm and is therefore closer to pruppacher and klett s 1996 second value of 30 µm fog event s1 is the only one where the maximum value for the mean distribution of lwc is at 5 9 µm outside of this range 5 summary and conclusion clouds and fog are heterogenous systems in which turbulent transport entrainment and energy fluxes lead to varying conditions on various spatial and temporal scales the droplet size distributions dsd change as well as the relative humidity rh does certainly the microphysical equilibrium conditions such as the size of a droplet as a function of its chemical composition and the ambient rh as predicted by the köhler theory are not always established nevertheless the observed covariations of dsd and rh can be largely understood by applying the köhler theory further processes such entrainment and turbulence need to be studied in more detail to develop a better understanding of cloud microphysics one important step is the quantification of the ambient rh at a high enough temporal resolution so that deviations from equilibrium can be quantified on the relevant scales we developed and employed a new setup to calculate the rh in the droplet free air of fog and to link it with the dsd it consists of three main parts first a droplet separator on the principle of an active fogwater collector optimized for high collection efficiency for lwc 98 4 separated the droplets from the remaining air stream second a high precision thermometer designed for ocean research allowed a high precision temperature reading finally the water vapor content of the droplet free air was measured with an infrared analyzer originally designed for eddy covariance applications the absolute calibration of rh needed to be done during data post processing with the assumption that the long term 1 h average rh in fog is 100 short term deviations from that value could be quantified precisely at a temporal resolution of 1 hz we found during our field campaign in early 2017 at mt lulin in central taiwan that the variability of water vapor inside a single fog event is high standard deviations of rh 0 49 3 46 and 0 36 rh for one second measurements during three fog events respectively and we analyzed it in conjunction with the dsd as measured with a fm100 fog monitor the analysis showed that the dsds of air masses with high rh 100 3 of air masses with low rh 99 7 and of air masses with rh around 100 are very different inside a single fog event the differences can be partly explained by classic interpretation of the köhler curve in that we found an increase of the droplet size with increasing rh however there are also other mechanisms that have to be considered for deeper analysis and were not analyzed in our experimental setup for example the chemical composition of the droplets plays an important role further collision and coalescence of droplets due to turbulence needs to be studied in more detail to develop a better understanding of the relationship and covariation between the dsd and air humidity in fog our methodological approach also needs to be complemented with a better size resolution of small fog droplets nonetheless our new approach offers several advantages over previous methods and represents a

4842,the dynamics of fog droplets depend on their size and chemical composition as well on the ambient conditions such as relative humidity rh and turbulence we analyze the droplet size distribution dsd in clouds and fog and how it covaries with the air humidity we developed a new setup to remove fog droplets from the foggy air in order to quantify rh in the droplet free air the setup consists of a newly developed fog droplet separator with an attached h2o gas analyzer and precision thermometer the fog droplet separator works similarly to an active fog collector yet with a high collection efficiency of 98 4 for the liquid water content the water vapor concentration and the air temperature are measured in the droplet free air at a frequency of 1 hz using this system and a fm100 fog monitor we analyzed the droplet size distribution dsd and studied how it covaries with rh we examined two long lasting fog events in march and april 2017 on mt lulin taiwan we found that the dsd differed between data with high rh 100 3 and low rh 99 7 for one event we were able to confirm the hypothesis of the köhler theory which states that droplets are smaller at a low rh than at a high rh in the other event the droplets were larger at low rh which was caused either by entrainment of air masses of different compositions or by droplet growth from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size or by a decrease of droplet sizes beyond the critical diameter with decreasing rh the results show that the developed setup is appropriate to analyze how the dsd covaries with rh in fog

distribution dsd thus changes the optical properties of a cloud stocker et al 2013 besides effects on radiation cloud dncs and dsds exert a strong influence on the lifetime of clouds and on chemical processing of gases and particles overall the droplet sizes of fog and clouds are of great interest in atmospheric physics and climate research the ds in clouds depends on the relative humidity rh although the rh values of clouds and fogs usually remain close to 100 considerable deviations from such conditions have been observed e g korolev and isaac 2006 inside fogs rh can vary swiftly between sub saturated and supersaturated conditions gonser et al 2012 as such the spatial and temporal non uniformity of the humidity inside clouds and fogs results in a correspondingly rapid spatial variation of the concentration of cloud drops and the cloud liquid water content lwc pruppacher and klett 1996 the dependency between ds and rh is described in the köhler curve which combines the two opposing effects that determine the vapor pressure e over an aqueous solution droplet and eventually the rh in equilibrium with a single droplet of diameter d after seinfeld and pandis 2006 e e 0 r h e x p a d b d 3 here e0 is the saturation vapor pressure over a flat water surface of given temperature t the term a d with a 4 σ m r t σ surface tension of pure water m molecular weight of water r gas constant t temperature is the kelvin effect which tends to increase the vapor pressure with decreasing droplet size and the term b d 3 with b 6 n s m π ρ d 3 ns number of moles of solute ρ density is the solute effect which decreases vapor pressure with decreasing diameters seinfeld and pandis 2006 at small diameters the solute effect dominates beyond a critical diameter the kelvin effect dominates droplets with diameters smaller than the critical diameter are in stable equilibrium with their environment whereas if the droplet size exceeds the critical diameter there is no stable equilibrium size for the droplet and it may grow indefinitely the particle is thus considered activated seinfeld and pandis 2006 clouds and fogs are not homogeneous bodies but contain air masses with higher rh and other air masses with lower rh pruppacher and klett 1996 as such it is critical to determine the gas phase humidity content in air however measuring the relative humidity in the range of around 100 is an instrumental challenge particularly under real world conditions and requires specialized equipment gonser et al 2012 the main measurement challenge arises from making sure that the presence of fog droplets does not affect the measurements of water vapor concentration and temperature for example when using an open path optical analyzer for water vapor errors may be caused through erroneous readings from aerosol particles in the sampling path or deposited on the sensor s windows gonser et al 2012 which would result in a slight overestimation of humidity when fog is present in the sample path the expected maximum error is on the order of 0 2 such overestimations are particularly discernible when a narrow dsd is present broader dsd spectra yield less intense overestimations gonser et al 2012 techniques to measure rh in clouds are infrared absorption which has been employed in airborne cloud physics studies korolev and isaac 2006 and the tunable diode laser hintsa et al 1999 may 1998 may et al 2001 which has been successfully employed in cloud studies davis et al 2007 further to separate aerosol particles and droplets before rh analysis conventional impactors and counterflow virtual impactors which employ a gas flow in a direction opposite to the motion of the particles have been used noone et al 1992 boulter et al 2006 early versions of such devices used aircraft flight speed or wind tunnel flow to impart momentum to the particles later vacuum pumps were used to provide the flow pumped counterflow virtual impactor boulter et al 2006 it is the scope of our study to employ instrumentation for water vapor concentration measurements that is widely used in atmospheric boundary layer studies baldocchi et al 2001 and to combine it with an efficient device to separate fog droplets from the gas phase in order to determine the water vapor concentration in fog we therefore developed a setup to separate the fog droplets from the air and to measure the water vapor concentration as well as the air temperature precisely in order to quantify rh at a relatively short time scale of one second for this purpose we constructed a fog droplet separator which produces droplet free air upon which we could measure air temperature and rh the setup was tested and employed under field conditions so that fluctuations of the microphysical conditions in foggy air could be studied we followed the hypotheses that the variability of water vapor in fog is high and that this variability is measurable with high enough precision and temporal resolution to provide insight into the structures and processes driving the variability of fog dsd here we present results from a feasibility study at a subtropical mountain observatory 2 material and methods 2 1 measurement site the measurements took place on top of mt lulin in the yu shan national park central taiwan 23 28 06 n 120 52 25 e with 2862 m above sea level the exposed site lies frequently in the free troposphere and is therefore generally free from boundary layer pollution wai et al 2008 but is rather exposed to long range transport of air pollutants from various source regions in se asia lin et al 2013 the average annual temperature is 10 c and the average annual precipitation 4000 mm simon et al 2016 a continuously operating meteorology and air chemistry site and the frequent occurrence of fog cloudy conditions at temperatures above 0 c set favorable conditions for this feasibility study 2 2 instrumentation the setup consisted of a newly developed fog droplet separator with an attached li 7200 co2 h2o infrared gas analyzer li cor bioscience lincoln nebraska usa and precision thermometer tr 1050f rbr ltd ottawa ontario canada fig 1 a droplet spectrometer fm100 fog monitor droplet measurement technology boulder colorado usa a present weather detector pwd11 vaisala helsinki finland and an r3 50 sonic anemometer gill instruments ltd lymington hampshire uk the nominal accuracies of the h2o analyzer and the temperature probe are within 2 of the reading and within 0 002 k respectively the fog droplet separator works similarly to an active fog collector klemm et al 2008 it consists of a fan unit and a collecting unit which is however not used to collect fog water but to produce a virtually droplet free air stream the collecting unit contains ptfe teflon strands on six frames with two screens each resulting in a total number of twelve screens the strands have a diameter of 0 44 mm and are spaced 1 06 mm apart the double screens have an attack angle of 35 accepting the collection efficiency of 98 4 at conditions typical for mt lulin c f section 2 3 the remaining 1 6 lwc corresponds to an rh of 0 0093 at air temperature ta 15 c when lwc is evaporated into the gas phase a counterflow manifold was installed into the downstream section of the droplet separator whereby the counterflow arrangement further excluded remaining fog droplets from entering the air stream within the manifold air was aspirated with a mean flow rate of 22 2 l min 1 through a 4 mm inner diameter stainless steel pipe the air stream passed the precision thermometer and flowed through the gas analyzer the thermometer was protected from incident radiation by the manifold with the described configuration undisturbed measurements of ta and rh in droplet free air could be realized with a frequency of 1 hz for the precision thermometer and with 10 hz for the gas analyzer hence rh could be measured precisely the droplet spectrometer was installed with a southwest orientation 236 which is the main wind direction at the measurement site 2 3 data processing remember that rh is defined as the ratio of partial pressure of water vapor e versus the saturation vapor pressure of a flat water surface e0 at the ambient temperature ta seinfeld and pandis 2006 the partial pressure was determined by the ideal gas law and the saturation vapor pressure by the magnus formula groselj 2011 this resulted in the following formula r h c 1000 4 615227 t a 273 15 611 2 e x p 17 62 t a 243 12 t a with c being the water vapor concentration in g m 3 and ta being the air temperature in c while the air temperature was logged with a frequency of 1 hz the one second mean of the water vapor concentration was calculated by block averaging the 10 hz data for the fm100 data of the droplet size distribution dsd the particle counts which were also recorded at 10 hz were summed up over one second intervals further the fm100 data was merged into size bins as proposed by gonser et al 2012 and further employed by el madany et al 2016 this resulted in 23 droplet size classes instead of the original 40 size classes this reduction of size classes is necessary to account for the shape of the mie curve describing the single wavelength scattering cross section of droplets from which the droplet diameters are computed in addition we exclusively used data with a 30 min mean wind direction of 30 from the orientation of the fm100 inlet all dnc and lwc data were normalized by the width of the respective droplet class the resulting dnc is in units of cm 3 µm 1 and the lwc in units of mg m 3 µm 1 outliers in the dsd were flattened by applying a savitzky golay smoothing filter savitzky and golay 1964 our calculations are different from those by el madany et al 2016 in that we used a different value for the mean airspeed within the instrument which was 15 3 m s 1 the absolute calibration of the water vapor probe is not sufficient to arrive at an accurate estimate of rh within 1 or even less therefore we followed the idea of korolev and isaac 2006 to assume that the average rh within a cloud is 100 we therefore set the mean of the rh data of individual fog events to 100 through offset adjustment we then analyze high frequency deviations of the rh readings from that average value these deviations are considered reliable because the 10 hz reading of the water vapor probe are again accurate within 2 on an absolute scale in other words if the rh estimate drops for example from 100 0 to 99 5 the deviation 0 5 rh is accurate within 2 of its value i e within 0 01 rh the accuracy of the temperature probe is high enough to be ignored during these considerations for high quality data it is necessary that the measurements of water vapor concentration and air temperature are not essentially disturbed by fog droplets this was realized by performing these measurements in virtually droplet free air produced by the fog droplet separator the collection efficiency was calculated after wrzesinsky 2003 for each droplet of diameter d its stokes number std within the droplet separator was calculated as s t d ρ h 2 o d 2 v a i r c o s α 9 η a i r d s with ρ h 2 o being the density of water kg m 3 d the droplet diameter vair being the air speed vair 7 1 m s 1 α the inclination of the collection strands α 35 ηair the dynamic viscosity of air kg m 1 s 1 and ds the collection strand diameter ds 0 44 mm the collection efficiency εs d of a screen for that droplet is computed after demoz et al 1996 and correction of a print error there as ε s d s t d 3 s t d 3 0 753 s t d 2 2 796 s t d 0 202 and eventually the total collection efficiency εtot d of all screens for a droplet of diameter d as ε t o t d 1 1 ε s d f n with f being the proportion of the area of the air stream that is covered by the strands of one screen f 0 293 and n being the number of screens n 12 the computed total collection efficiencies εtot d range from 0 952 to 0 984 in the droplet diameter range covered by the fm100 2 µm d 50 µm a computational application of these efficiencies to droplet size spectra typical for taiwan mountain fog gonser et al 2012 leads to a volume weighted overall collection efficiency of the droplet separator for lwc of 98 4 accepting the theoretical approach applied here the uncertainty of this number is very small 3 results there were two long lasting 12 h fog events during our experimental period the first one l1 lasted from 2017 03 25 16 43 hrs local time through 2017 03 26 22 06 hrs the second one l2 from 2017 03 31 17 57 hrs through 2017 04 01 12 52 hrs in the beginning and the end phases of these fog events the visibility fluctuated largely so that only the middle section with a visibility constantly below 1000 m was used for further analysis fig 2 during the second long lasting fog event l2 there was a big outlier of rh which was excluded from further analysis further there were two short fog events of which one could not be used for analysis due to wind directions which diverged more than 30 from the orientation of the fm 100 nozzle the other short event s1 lasted almost two hours from 2017 03 28 14 28 hrs to 16 23 hrs the statistics of the relative humidity during these three events is listed in table 1 the average rh was 100 00 in all events per definition we observed large deviations from that average with standard deviations of 0 36 rh l2 to 3 46 rh s1 overall the short event s1 exhibited the biggest variations of rh table 1 to compare the dsd of air masses with higher than average rh to air masses with lower than average rh fig 3 a deadband of 0 3 was used to separate all data with an rh around 100 fig 2 to analyze the dsd the median of the dnc and the lwc of the different channels were calculated the data in the smallest droplet size class from 2 µm to 2 7 µm show very small dncs throughout this seems implausible and it contradicts results found in other studies e g kunkel 1984 gonser et al 2012 we therefore excluded this size class from further analysis fig 3 shows the median dnc and the cumulated lwc for events l1 and l2 separated for the respective rh ranges the dsds with all data are very similar to those of the data around rh 100 data not shown there is a clear difference to the dsds of air masses with high or low rh data with rh 99 7 contain 24 and 16 of all data in l1 and l2 respectively whereas data with rh 100 3 contain 32 and 23 of all data in l1 and l2 respectively table 1 for l1 the ds of the maximum dnc decreases from 12 3 µm for data with rh 99 7 to 8 5 µm for data with 99 7 rh 100 3 and further down to 5 9 µm for data with rh 100 3 fig 3 upper left panel for l2 this trend is the other way round the ds of the maximum dnc starts at 8 5 µm for data with rh 99 7 and 99 7 rh 100 3 and increases to 12 3 µm for data with rh 100 3 the same trends apply to the ds of the lwc fig 3 right panels shows the cumulative lwcs as functions of the droplet diameters the mean volume diameters mvd which are the ds of the 50 levels of the respective ogive functions shown in fig 3 decrease with increasing rh in l1 but increase with increasing rh for l2 for l1 the mvd starts at 15 4 µm for data with rh 99 7 and 99 7 rh 100 3 and decreases to 13 2 µm for data with rh 100 3 for l2 this value starts at 11 4 µm for data with rh 99 7 increases to 13 2 µm at 99 7 rh 100 3 and increases further to 17 8 µm for data with rh 100 3 when considering the total dnc and lwc of the dsds note that fog event l1 has a higher total dnc and lwc with higher rh whereas fog event l2 has a lower total dnc with higher rh and only small changes of the total lwc with changing rh the geometric mean of the ds from the dsds of l1 is higher with a lower rh but for l2 it is higher with a higher rh fog event s1 has generally much smaller dnc and lwc values but there is a slight trend for total dnc and lwc as well as for the geometric means of the dsds where higher values correspond with a higher rh table 2 4 discussion with the newly developed setup including the fog droplet separator and the temperature and humidity probes it is possible to measure the variability of rh in fog with high precision and temporal resolution the variability of rh in fog is rather impressive during our measuring period we successfully measured and analyzed two long lasting fog events as well as one short fog event while more events need to be analyzed to identify the driving structures and processes in more detail we were able to examine the relationships between the rh and dsd in the observed fog events and with the employed methodology politovich and cooper 1988 deduced from research flights through 147 clouds over miles city montana that the supersaturation within these clouds ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 with an average of 0 corresponding to 100 rh for almost all regions of clouds for which the average droplet concentration was at least 50 cm 3 the two fog events in our measuring period which have a mean dnc of at least 50 cm 1 are l1 and l2 table 2 in l1 74 5 of the supersaturation values ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 but the minimum and maximum values of rh are 95 91 and 101 57 in that period in l2 more of the supersaturation values ranged between 0 5 and 0 5 i e 81 1 in addition the minimum and maximum are somewhat closer to this range at 98 90 and 100 94 respectively thus most of the supersaturation values lay in the range given by politovich and cooper 1988 but there are bigger peaks of rh in our data showing that a high variability of water vapor existed during our fog events with respect to the köhler curve fig 4 note that generally smaller droplets exist at lower rh and bigger droplets exist at higher rh however this situation strictly applies only to single droplets that are not activated droplets with a diameter smaller than for droplet d in fig 4 or to the comparison of single droplets at rh below 100 with droplets of the same composition but at rh above 100 i e a b and c compared to d e and f in fig 4 above 100 and after activation of cloud condensation nuclei to the right of region d in fig 4 the further condensation process leads to a decrease of the gas phase humidity content to an increase of the lwc and to a modification of the dsd gonser et al 2012 as we compared the fog conditions with rh 99 7 with those of 99 7 rh 100 3 and eventually with conditions of rh 100 3 the observed increase of lwc with increasing rh during l1 table 2 is in accordance with the köhler theory for individual droplets yet as the mean ds of dnc and lwc is decreasing with increasing rh table 2 this leads to the presumption that the largest droplets could be established within our category of 99 7 rh 100 3 fig 4 region f under these conditions the droplet size decreases with increasing rh i e they move from region f in fig 4 to region e the increase of the small droplets number concentrations with an increasing rh in l1 fig 3 and table 2 likely is an effect of the droplet size detection limit of the fm100 with an increasing rh the droplets in stable equilibrium may grow from the diameter of droplet a in fig 4 to the diameter of droplet b in fig 4 and may then grow from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size this explanation is also supported by the fact that the total dnc is increasing with increasing rh table 2 for different köhler curves due to different type nuclei see below the detection limit intersects at different rh values so this explanation is also relevant for rh values higher than the category rh 99 7 in fog event l2 the mean ds of both distributions of dnc and lwc increases with increasing rh table 2 this indicates that the large droplets exist under conditions with a rh still above 100 3 under these conditions the ds increases from air masses with rh 99 7 regions a and b in fig 4 to air masses with 99 7 rh 100 3 fig 4 region c and further to air masses with rh 100 3 fig 4 regions d and e in this fog event there are not as many droplets that grow from below the detection limit to a detectable droplet size which is shown by smaller numbers of small droplets with increasing rh fig 3 and also by decreasing total dnc with increasing rh larger ds values with higher rh are also shown by fog event s1 table 2 in general fog event s1 differs considerably from the two long lasting fog events not only by its shorter duration but also by its very small total dnc lwc and ds values table 2 certainly these considerations need to be met with caution when describing a dsd of a fog event it cannot be assumed that all droplets have the same salt content which would lead to the description of the köhler curve of a specific droplet the observed real world dsd is more complex the two observed long lasting fog events l1 and l2 behave differently within the same change of rh when nuclei with different sizes and composition are present there are numerous possibilities for different droplet sizes in the same rh some droplets may contain soluble material and others insoluble material some may contain both pruppacher and klett 1996 for example at a temperature of 20 c for an aqueous solution drop containing 10 16 g nacl the critical diameter is 0 39 µm at a supersaturation of 0 37 for another droplet containing 10 13 g nacl the critical diameter is 12 7 µm at a supersaturation of 0 011 for a droplet with 1012 g nacl the critical diameter is as large as 40 µm at a supersaturation of only 0 0036 pruppacher and klett 1996 for l1 the decreasing mean ds of the distribution of the dnc with increasing rh table 2 can also be explained by differences in the concentration and composition of the salts in the solution droplet with a mean ds of 10 1 µm for rh 99 7 it is reasonable to assume that the critical diameter of a droplet with this ds is higher than that and so the nucleus could consist of around 1013 g nacl or more or of other salts that act in a similar way further the smaller droplet sizes at higher rh values could also be explained by the presence of much smaller amounts of salts within individual nuclei at air masses with high rh as compared to air masses with low rh so that the critical diameters of these droplets at high rh are also much smaller this is possible by entrainment of air volumes of different composition and history into the cloud gonser et al 2012 for l2 similar amounts of salt are likely present in droplets within air masses of both low and high rh because the ds increases with increasing rh table 2 in addition very rapidly occurring differences in dsd and rh observed in our real world test conditions cannot happen exclusively through condensation and evaporation processes as described in the köhler curve the involved diffusion is too slow other possible processes leading to the differences of the dsd could be turbulence effects and their influence on collision and coalescence gonser et al 2012 to fully understand the relationship and covariation between the dsd and air humidity in fog it is necessary to observe more fog events and to have a stronger focus on entrainment processes our methodological approach as well as the study site employed in this study are suitable for such future studies for further studies it is also required to have a better resolution of small droplets in sizes up to our second size class top threshold at 3 7 µm this applies especially for cases when the ds values are below 2 µm which were excluded from the analysis this is important especially when considering that smaller aerosols scatter more light per unit mass and have a longer atmospheric lifetime than larger aerosols penner et al 2001 for example the typical drop size spectra in fog at otis air force base massachusetts shown by pruppacher and klett 1996 shows the highest dnc at droplet sizes below 5 µm and a decrease for higher droplet diameters with the exception of a plateau or a second peak at diameters around 20 µm to 30 µm in some cases in our data the decrease begins at a diameter higher than 10 µm fig 3 but the dsd of the lwc is similar to the one shown by pruppacher and klett 1996 their maximum lwc is at a ds near 10 µm or near 30 µm or has peaks at both of these values the maxima of the fog events l1 and l2 16 6 µm and 14 2 µm respectively data not shown in detail are also near 10 µm only the maximum of the lwc distribution of l2 for rh 100 3 shows a bigger ds at 23 µm and is therefore closer to pruppacher and klett s 1996 second value of 30 µm fog event s1 is the only one where the maximum value for the mean distribution of lwc is at 5 9 µm outside of this range 5 summary and conclusion clouds and fog are heterogenous systems in which turbulent transport entrainment and energy fluxes lead to varying conditions on various spatial and temporal scales the droplet size distributions dsd change as well as the relative humidity rh does certainly the microphysical equilibrium conditions such as the size of a droplet as a function of its chemical composition and the ambient rh as predicted by the köhler theory are not always established nevertheless the observed covariations of dsd and rh can be largely understood by applying the köhler theory further processes such entrainment and turbulence need to be studied in more detail to develop a better understanding of cloud microphysics one important step is the quantification of the ambient rh at a high enough temporal resolution so that deviations from equilibrium can be quantified on the relevant scales we developed and employed a new setup to calculate the rh in the droplet free air of fog and to link it with the dsd it consists of three main parts first a droplet separator on the principle of an active fogwater collector optimized for high collection efficiency for lwc 98 4 separated the droplets from the remaining air stream second a high precision thermometer designed for ocean research allowed a high precision temperature reading finally the water vapor content of the droplet free air was measured with an infrared analyzer originally designed for eddy covariance applications the absolute calibration of rh needed to be done during data post processing with the assumption that the long term 1 h average rh in fog is 100 short term deviations from that value could be quantified precisely at a temporal resolution of 1 hz we found during our field campaign in early 2017 at mt lulin in central taiwan that the variability of water vapor inside a single fog event is high standard deviations of rh 0 49 3 46 and 0 36 rh for one second measurements during three fog events respectively and we analyzed it in conjunction with the dsd as measured with a fm100 fog monitor the analysis showed that the dsds of air masses with high rh 100 3 of air masses with low rh 99 7 and of air masses with rh around 100 are very different inside a single fog event the differences can be partly explained by classic interpretation of the köhler curve in that we found an increase of the droplet size with increasing rh however there are also other mechanisms that have to be considered for deeper analysis and were not analyzed in our experimental setup for example the chemical composition of the droplets plays an important role further collision and coalescence of droplets due to turbulence needs to be studied in more detail to develop a better understanding of the relationship and covariation between the dsd and air humidity in fog our methodological approach also needs to be complemented with a better size resolution of small fog droplets nonetheless our new approach offers several advantages over previous methods and represents a

4843,the increased environmental abundance of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen species nr ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 may increase atmospheric nitrous oxide n2o concentrations and thus global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion nitrogen cycling and n2o production reduction and emissions could be amplified in carbonate karst aquifers because of their extensive global range susceptibility to nitrogen contamination and groundwater surface water mixing that varies redox conditions of the aquifer the magnitude of n2o cycling in karst aquifers is poorly known however and thus we sampled thirteen springs discharging from the karstic upper floridan aquifer ufa to evaluate n2o cycling the springs can be separated into three groups based on variations in subsurface residence times differences in surface groundwater interactions and variable dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved oxygen do concentrations these springs are oxic to sub oxic and have no3 concentrations that range from 0 1 to 4 2 mg n no3 l and doc concentrations that range from 0 1 to 50 mg c l maximum spring water n2o concentrations are 3 85 µg n n2o l or 12 times greater than water equilibrated with atmospheric n2o the highest n2o concentrations correspond with the lowest no3 concentrations where recharge water has residence times of a few days partial denitrification to n2o occurs while complete denitrification to n2 is more prominent in springs with longer subsurface residence times springs with short residence times have groundwater emission factors greater than the global average of 0 0060 reflecting n2o production whereas springs with residence times of months to years have groundwater emission factors less than the global average these findings imply that n2o cycling in karst aquifers depends on doc and do concentrations in recharged surface water and subsequent time available for n processing in the subsurface keywords greenhouse gases nitrogen nitrous oxide karst groundwater springs 1 introduction since the start of the 20th century anthropogenic production of nr species has increased by a factor of 10 largely from fossil fuel burning and industrial application of the haber bosch process galloway and cowling 2002 galloway et al 2004 since the end of the 20th century anthropogenic fixation of atmospheric n2 has exceeded that of natural terrestrial n2 fixation galloway and cowling 2002 the subsequent accumulation of anthropogenic nr has important ecological implications through eutrophication and enhancing primary productivity in aquatic systems additional environmental impacts result from processing of nr in aquatic ecosystems including anoxia which creates conditions favorable for the microbial transformation of n species such as n2o n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas with an atmospheric lifespan of approximately 121 years and a warming potential about 265 times that of carbon dioxide co2 and 10 times that of methane ch4

double by 2050 davidson kanter 2014 nearly 40 of total n2o emissions are anthropogenic in nature and originate from a combination of fossil fuel combustion industrial activities and agriculture with the latter estimated to be the largest contributor jurado et al 2018 although n2o is produced by abiotic reactions and microbial metabolisms production through microbial denitrification and nitrification are the greatest contributors to global n2o emissions thomson et al 2012 karst aquifers have physicochemical characteristics that are ideal for nr processing including extensive and rapid surface water groundwater interactions and highly heterogeneous permeability that leads to spatially variable redox conditions ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes cover approximately 20 of earth s ice free land surface goldscheider et al 2020 and depending on the extent of nr processing they could significantly effect global n2o cycling however few studies to date have investigated n2o

elevated n2o concentrations ueda et al 1993 mühlherr and hiscock 1998 hiscock et al 2003 jurado et al 2018 but direct evidence has been lacking in this study we addressed three primary questions 1 could karstic springs be an atmospheric source of n2o 2 do n2o concentrations change with space and time across a karst landscape and 3 how much nr primarily no3 is reduced to n2o the study area is

watershed and is underlain by the carbonate eocene to oligocene carbonate strata fig 1a b these strata include the suwannee limestone 10 30 m thickness ocala limestone 20 80 m thickness and avon park formation sutton et al 2015 within the watershed the ufa is unconfined in the lower reaches and confined in the upper reaches by the miocene hawthorn group the boundary between the confined and unconfined portion of the ufa called the cody escarpment puri and vernon 1964 is the erosional edge of the hawthorn group and is the site of extensive surface water groundwater exchange fig 1a all streams flowing across the escarpment either sink completely into the subsurface or become losing streams the ufa is characterized by intergranular primary porosity of about 20 and can be classified as an eogenetic karst aquifer vacher and mylroie 2002 this primary porosity with an average matrix permeability of 10 13 m2 for the ocala limestone can provide storage for recharged surface water during flooding events florea and vacher 2006 at base flow the matrix porosity may provide 25 50 of groundwater flow to the numerous springs that discharge from water filled caves in the ufa downstream of the cody escarpment rosenau et al 1977 scott et al 2002 ritorto et al 2009 yang et al 2019 regional groundwater flow across the watershed is predominately toward the southwest and includes both slow matrix and fast conduit fracture flow we focus on 13 springs that can be separated into three groups with variable rates of surface water groundwater interactions chemical compositions and groundwater residence times one group of springs the ichetucknee springs group fig 1c includes eight named springs and numerous unnamed smaller springs that discharge 1 to 5 6 m3 sec to the ichetucknee river scott et al 2002 this group has the lowest doc concentrations among the studied spring groups table 1 the ichetucknee springs group can be divided into two sub groups based on their chemical compositions martin gordon 2000 and apparent ages martin et al 2016 group 1a springs head spring blue hole cedar head and coffee springs have higher dissolved oxygen do concentrations and more variable temperatures δt 0 3 0 5 c than group 1b springs mission springs devil s eye mill pond and grassy hole the mean apparent ages based on cfc 12 concentrations of group 1a springs 35 08 0 20 years is younger than group 1b springs 40 47 0 28 years table 2 these characteristics suggest that group 1a springs have shorter and shallower flow paths than group 1b springs martin gordon 2000 the second group of springs are referred to as reversing springs peacock madison blue little river and gilchrist blue because river water with doc and do concentrations greater than groundwater values table 1 periodically intrudes through the spring vents during high flow conditions gulley et al 2011 brown et al 2014 2019 these reversals occur once or twice a year and flood water may reside in the aquifer for days to months before draining back to the surface as the floods recede of this group mean apparent age has been measured only for little river spring the average apparent age which is based on cfc 12 concentrations is 21 years katz et al 2001 heffernan et al 2012 table 2 this apparent age is likely much longer than water that discharges immediately following a reversal when residence times may be days to months e g gulley et al 2011 brown et al 2014 as doc and do are biogeochemically processed in the aquifer groundwater redox state shifts as reflected by variable fe and mn concentrations in water discharging from madison blue spring following reversals brown et al 2019 the third group of springs are part of a sink rise system that occurs where the santa fe river crosses the cody escarpment fig 1d except during flooding all river water is captured by a sinkhole called river sink the river briefly resurges at several karst windows most prominently at sweetwater lake before discharging permanently at river rise spring approximately 7 km downstream from river sink scott et al 2002 water recharged at river sink requires from 6 to 185 h to flow to river rise depending on river stage fig s1 and river rise discharge is commonly greater than discharge into river sink the downstream increase in flow reflects water gained from matrix porosity to the conduits when the groundwater hydraulic head exceeds that of the conduits which should increase average residence times and specific conductivity spc of the discharging water at river rise martin and dean 1999 moore et al 2009 river sink discharge can exceed river rise discharge during high flow events when the conduit hydraulic head is greater than that of the groundwater during these conditions water is assumed to be lost from conduits to matrix porosity martin and dean 1999 bailly comte et al 2010 2011 3 methods water was pumped directly from spring vents using a geotech peristaltic pump and tubing that extended to the shore at the santa fe sink rise system water was pumped through an overflow cup containing sondes connected to a ysi proplus meter that was calibrated daily at all other locations the sondes were deployed directly in the path of discharge above spring vents measured parameters were dissolved oxygen concentrations do saturation and mg l specific conductivity µs cm and temperature c parameters were monitored until values stabilized typically within a few minutes after which the physicochemical parameters were recorded and sampling commenced samples to be measured for total doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn inorganic n organic n no3 and so4 2 concentrations were filtered through 0 45 µm trace metal grade canister filters the doc and tdn samples were preserved with concentrated hcl and nitrate samples were frozen until analysis n2o samples were collected via the headspace extraction method pain et al 2019 e g repo et al 2007 in a 650 ml vessel with 60 ml of sample water displaced with ultra high purity grade helium uhp 99 999 purity or n2 uhp and shaken to equilibration for 3 min the 60 ml of headspace gas was immediately transferred to pre evacuated 75

n2 as the carrier gas calibration standards were prepared by diluting a 0 9700 ppm n2o standard in a he or n2 matrix to 0 25 50 75 100 n2o dilutions were made fresh before each analysis by injecting gases directly into pre evacuated 75 ml glass vials gas concentrations in the headspace samples were converted to dissolved concentrations according to weiss et al 1980 and based on the temperature and salinity of the water all n2o samples were collected in triplicate to assess the relative error of the head space extraction collection method which generated a relative standard deviation of 0 2 µg n n2o l the saturation of n2o was calculated as a percentage relative to atmospheric equilibration with water using the method reported by cooper et al 2017 atmospheric concentration was referenced to the 2019 global average of 332 ppb https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg trends n2o accessed january 2019 or approximately 0 3 µg n n2o l at 21 5 c and 0 1 ppt salinity this global average is similar to the average atmospheric n2o concentrations measured in our field area of 330 ppb range 304 356 ppb n 17 during the course of this study in situ no3 concentrations in clear spring waters of the ichetucknee and reversing springs group were measured with a submersible ultraviolet nitrate analyzer suna which measures no3 concentrations based on absorbance at wavelengths from 217 to 240 nm at the sink rise system elevated doc interferes with the suna and these samples were measured with an automated dionex ics 2100 ion chromatograph at the university of florida clear water spring samples of the ichetucknee and reversing springs groups measured for no3 concentrations with both the suna and ion chromatography were similar 0 05 mg n no3 l difference the ion chromatograph was also used to measure so4 2 concentrations with an error on replicates of 5 and a detection limit of 0 01 mg s so4 2 l and 0 01 mg n no3 l doc and tdn concentrations were analyzed on a shimadzu toc vcsn total element analyzer at the university of florida and the coefficient of variation was less than 2 between sample replicates a student s t test assuming unequal variances was conducted for the different physical and geochemical characteristics of the ichetucknee spring sub groups groups 1a and 1b statistical significance of samples was based on p values 0 05 table 1 to evaluate potential reduction of no3 to n2o groundwater emission factors were calculated as the ratio of n2o mg n n2o l to no3 mg n no3 l concentrations in discharging spring waters according to 1 ef n o 3 n 2 o no 3 e g ipcc hergoualc h et al 2019 reduction of no2 and oxidation of nh4 may also contribute to n2o production however we lack comprehensive measurements of these solute concentrations within spring waters discharging from the unconfined portion of the ufa nr primarily exists as no3 while nh4 concentrations have been reported to be 0 02 mg n l katz et al 2009 and concentrations of no2 are expected to be equally low or lower we estimate contributions of nh4 and no2 to calculated emission factors based on the tdn mg n l concentrations according to 2 ef tdn n 2 o tdn other redox sensitive solutes including ferrous iron fe2 and hydrogen sulfide hs were measured in the field as initial samples were collected from all springs using a field spectrophotometer hach dr 890 portable colorimeter concentrations were below instrumental detection limits 0 01 mg l for both fe2 and sh suggesting these solutes provide little control on redox conditions of spring waters 4 results 4 1 ichetucknee springs group chemical compositions of the two ichetucknee spring sub groups are similar to previous observations martin and gordon 2000 martin et al 2016 median spc values and tdn concentrations are significantly lower in group 1a springs than group 1b table 1 in contrast median do no3 and so4 2 concentrations are significantly higher in group 1a spring waters than group 1b springs p 0 05 table 1 tdn concentrations do not significantly exceed no3 concentrations 0 05 mg n l table 1 suggesting no3 is the dominate nr species present in ichetucknee spring waters group 1b springs have significantly lower n2o concentrations with a range from 0 41 to 1 01 µg n n2o l median 0 57 than group 1a springs which range from 0 68 to 1 72 µg n n2o l median 1 37 p 0 05 these concentrations reflect oversaturation relative to the atmosphere ranging from 132 at devil s eye group 1b to 558 at cedar head spring group 1a fig 2 the do and no3 concentrations correlate positively with n2o concentrations while so4 2 concentrations are inversely correlated and doc concentrations show no correlation fig 3 median values for efno3 range from 0 0007 to 0 0019 eq 1 and group 1b springs have lower median values 0 0009 than group 1a springs 0 0018 median values of eftdn eq 2 are similar to the efno3 value ranging from 0 0009 and 0 0017 for sub groups 1b and 1a respectively table 1 4 2 reversing springs group the reversing springs group has median spc values and do concentrations of 400 µs cm and 1 83 mg l respectively this spring group has higher no3 concentrations than the other two spring groups with a range from 1 9 mg n l at little river spring to 4 2 mg n l at peacock springs median 2 4 mg n l doc and so4 2 concentrations range from 0 26 to 4 6 mg c l median 0 49 mg c l and from 4 1 to 7 9 mg s l median 7 6 mg s l respectively although we lack the tdn concentration for the sample with the highest no3 concentration in this group all other tdn concentrations were higher than the other two groups and range from 1 9 to 3 8 mg n l median 2 7 mg n l and are at most 0 4 mg n l greater than no3 concentrations table 1 these springs exhibit n2o concentrations that range from 1 55 µg n l 502 saturation to 2 90 µg n l 941 saturation at gilchrist blue and peacock springs respectively fig 2 although n2o concentrations were generally lower in samples with higher do concentrations fig 4 these variables are not significantly correlated in contrast no3 doc and so4 2 concentrations increase with do concentrations although only the no3 n2o linear correlation is significant the average ef values are similar but slightly lower than those of the ichetucknee springs group the efno3 values range from 0 0007 to 0 0015 eq 1 while the eftdn values range from 0 0006 to 0 0015 eq 2 4 3 santa fe river sink rise group water compositions at the sink rise system show systematic variations from river sink to river rise that depend on discharge due to the continuous supply of surface water to the sink rise system it contains the highest doc concentrations of all three spring groups the sink rise system also shows greater variance of all solute concentrations including n2o compared to the other two spring groups fig 2 spc values range from 57 2 to 359 7 µs cm at river sink from 70 9 to 476 2 µs cm at sweetwater lake and 69 3 to 526 0 µs cm at river rise table 2 do concentrations range from 2 61 to 9 30 mg l at river sink from 0 96 to 7 83 mg l at sweetwater and 0 65 to 7 16 mg l at river rise median no3 concentrations increase from river sink to river rise with concentrations of 0 12 mg n l for river sink 0 20 mg n l for sweetwater lake and 0 23 mg n l for river rise unlike the other two spring groups tdn concentrations within the sink rise system reach up to 9 times greater than no3 concentrations reflecting the presence of organic n and or other inorganic nr species such as no2 and nh4 assuming a molar c n ratio of 50 1 for terrestrial derived organic c perdue and koprivnjak 2007 a median doc concentration for river rise of 23 4 mg c l indicates the presence of 0 6 mg org n l which indicates most of the excess tdn is organic n rather than no2 or nh4 similar to the other spring groups the highest doc concentrations of all sample sites occur within the sink rise system due to the continuous injection of surface water at river sink with median concentrations of 25 8 mg c l for river sink 25 4 mg c l for sweetwater lake and 23 4 mg c l for river rise median so4 2 concentrations range from 3 3 mg s l at river sink 6 4 mg s l at sweetwater lake and 11 5 mg s l at river rise tdn concentrations at river sink range from 0 2 to 1 3 mg n l from 0 4 to 1 1 mg n l at sweetwater and from 0 3 to 1 2 mg n l at river rise most samples from river sink sweetwater lake and river rise have n2o concentrations that are supersaturated relative to the atmosphere except during elevated discharge when concentrations are near atmospheric equilibrium median n2o concentrations increase from 1 14 µg n n2o l 370 saturation at river sink to 1 36 µg n n2o l 441 saturation at sweetwater to 2 04 µg n n2o l 661 saturation at river rise spring this increase is up to 2 µg n n2o l during most sampling times in contrast with trends of increasing n2o concentrations along the flow path four sampling times had n2o concentrations that decreased from river sink to river rise these samples also contained the highest n2o concentrations measured during this study ranging from 3 45 to 5 09 µg n l 1120 to 1738 saturation within the sink rise system significant positive correlations occur between n2o and no3 and so4 2 concentrations while significant inverse correlations occur between n2o and do and doc fig 5 during base flow conditions when discharge is greater at river rise than river sink efno3 values varied more than 10 fold with time ranging from 0 0032 to 0 0177 with a median value of 0 0086 the eftdn values are lower and range from 0 0007 to 0 0113 with a median value of 0 0042 5 discussion over the past 50 years no3 concentrations are estimated to have risen by a factor of 50 in the ufa from 0 1 mg n no3 l 1 to values as high as 5 mg l 1 katz 2004 albertin et al 2012 increasing no3 concentrations in the ufa have been traced back to multiple anthropogenic sources including fertilizer application 51 animal waste 27 septic tank drainage 12 and natural atmospheric deposition 8 katz et al 2009 nitrate was thought to have little or no attenuation in the ufa because of rapid flow combined with aerobic and organic carbon poor conditions katz et al 2009 this view has changed with observations of excess n2 concentrations and stable isotope analyses of no3 that indicate denitrification is widespread table 2 albertin et al 2012 heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2019 therefore our observations of n2o in springs discharging from the ufa may reflect incomplete denitrification of no3 to n2o incomplete reduction of no3 and accumulation of n2o rather than n2 has been documented in soils and groundwaters due to prevailing oxic conditions osaka et al 2006 laini et al 2011 jahangir et al 2013 mcaleer et al 2017 and high no3 concentrations that inhibit n2o reduction to n2 blackmer and bremner 1978 weymann et al 2008 however the variations in n2o concentrations observed in this study indicate that the extent of denitrification may differ across karst landscapes with variable surface water groundwater interactions groundwater residence times and availability of doc we evaluate these controls based on the spatial and temporal variations of water chemistry and n2o concentrations 5 1 n2o sources despite variations in geochemical and hydrologic conditions among the three spring groups all show a positive correlation between n2o and no3 concentrations implying that elevated no3 concentrations result in greater n2o production the no3 n2o relationships differ between locations however the reversing springs group had the highest no3 concentrations and the sink rise system had the highest n2o concentrations these differences suggest factors other than no3 concentrations contribute to the denitrification rate and specifically the reduction of no3 and n2o within the ichetucknee springs group up to 32 of available no3 is denitrified to n2 as reflected in excess n2 concentrations measured in spring waters heffernan et al 2012 table 2 these concentrations are about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the measured n2o concentrations and suggest that within the ichetucknee springs group much but not all no3 is completely reduced to n2 although excess n2 data are not available for the sink rise system the negative correlation between n2o and do and doc concentrations fig 5a c suggests denitrification may be the primary n2o producing pathway identifying timing and locations of denitrification could be complicated by mixing of the surface water and groundwater if the two sources have different n2o concentrations in addition to water recharging at river sink groundwater sources to river rise are water draining from the matrix porosity to conduits at depths 30 m below land surface and a second minor source from about 400 m below the land surface moore et al 2009 jin et al 2015 this deep source is likely anoxic with negligible no3 and n2o concentrations and thus unlikely to be a source of n2o we assume controls of n2o concentrations are a result of shallow groundwater mixing with river water entering at river sink coupled with production and consumption caused by varying redox conditions and rates of doc remineralization within the matrix porosity fig s2 distinguishing mixing from biogeochemical activity requires information on the mixing extent which can be derived from conservative parameters such as spc carbonate mineral dissolution increases groundwater spc values by up to an order of magnitude more than river water gulley et al 2011 the positive correlation between spc values and no3 and n2o concentrations at river rise fig 5e f suggests draining of groundwater enriched in n2o and no3 relative to river water is a primary control on the n2o concentrations at river rise occasionally during base flow conditions n2o concentrations are elevated at river sink compared to river rise these samples also contained the highest n2o concentrations measured in this study fig s2 were observed following long periods with no increases in river discharge and represent an unknown source of n2o production in the santa fe river headwaters the lack of correlation between n2o and doc in the ichetucknee springs group fig 3a opens the possibility that some of the n2o could be produced by denitrifying microbes using inorganic electron donors such as reduced fe mn and or sulfur species nitrate reduction by pyrite has been documented in laboratory based microbial incubations and flow through experiments according to 3 5 fes 2 14 no 3 4 h 5 fe 2 7 n 2 10 so 4 2 2 h 2 o torrentó et al 2010 2011 this denitrification pathway is thermodynamically favorable and is hypothesized to be active across a range of geological and hydrological settings schwientek et al 2008 juncher jørgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 hayakawa et al 2013 pyrite is common in suwannee limestone of the ufa tihansky knochenmus 2001 particularly in high porosity zones price pichler 2006 and oxidation of pyrite coupled to no3 reduction is consistent with the inverse correlations between so4 2 and n2o and no3 concentrations within the ichetucknee system fig 3b e however dissolution of gypsum in the avon park formation located a few hundred meters below land surface may provide additional so4 2 to these waters miller 1986 without a corresponding reduction of no3 this source may be relevant to the sink rise system considering its deep groundwater source moore et al 2009 jin et al 2015 the so4 2 concentrations are greater in ichetucknee group 1b springs than group 1a springs because of their greater depth of flow martin and gordon 2000 indicating the possibility of a similar enrichment of so4 2 enrichment by gypsum dissolution in the avon park formation if the inverse correlation between n2o and so4 2 concentrations reflects gypsum dissolution then the poor correlation between n2o and doc may reflect doc remineralization through fermentation or the use of electron acceptors other than no3 during the long subsurface residence times 5 2 residence time controls on n2o dynamics the length of time that water and associated reactants involved in nitrogen cycling reactions reside in the subsurface may control n2o concentrations in spring waters these potential drivers can be evaluated based on correlations between reactant and product concentrations for example such correlations have been used in a forested headwater catchment in japan to show that shallow groundwater with high do concentrations presumably with short subsurface residence times had elevated n2o and no3 concentrations whereas deeper groundwater flow paths extending to anoxic portions of the aquifer allowed complete reduction to n2 osaka et al 2006 a similar relationship was found in a sandstone catchment mcaleer et al 2017 in the republic of ireland where n2o concentrations were elevated under oxic to sub oxic conditions do range 4 8 mg l and depleted under anoxic conditions do range 0 3 mg l where n2 concentrations were elevated for the north central florida springs sampled here the n2o concentrations vary inversely across the spectrum of residence times fig 2 with the lowest n2o concentrations in the ichetucknee springs with decades long apparent ages for the discharging groundwater martin et al 2016 and the highest and also most variable concentrations at the santa fe sink rise system where ground water has residence times of hours to days martin and dean 1999 at ichetucknee springs lower n2o concentrations in older spring waters of group 1b springs suggest more complete denitrification to n2 table 2 than group 1a springs which have higher n2o concentrations and younger apparent ages the apparent ages of all springs show inverse correlations with do no3 and n2o concentrations which support increased reduction of do no3 and n2o with longer residence times fig 6 a c although not statistically significant the apparent ages increase with increasing n2 concentrations reported in heffernan et al 2012 for the ichetucknee springs if denitrification is the active n2o producing mechanism then these results suggest that longer subsurface residence times facilitate complete reduction of no3 to n2 fig 6d although the average age of little river spring reversing springs group water has been estimated to be 21 years katz et al 2001 at times following reversals it should have shorter residences times on the order of weeks to months as river water intrudes and then discharges from the aquifer because the reversals also deliver elevated do and doc to the aquifer these solutes would be expected to enhance n2o production within the aquifer the only water sampled from little river springs for this study was collected immediately after a reversal fig s3 and showed an n2o concentration of 2 76 µg n n2o l this value is more than double the median value from the ichetucknee springs group of 1 27 µg n n2o l even though apparent ages of both springs are decades long this greater concentration at little river spring suggests n2o may have been produced during the reversal that occurred immediately prior to sampling or that cumulative effects of multiple reversals create geochemical conditions that are favorable for n2o accumulation none of the other springs within the reversing springs group was sampled immediately following a reversal but nonetheless their n2o concentrations are up to 7 times greater than the minimum n2o concentration observed within the ichetucknee springs group the elevated concentrations in the reversing springs group may thus reflect discharge of n2o produced during the weeks to months that reversal water remains in the aquifer the short residence times for water flowing from river sink to river rise is modulated by gain or loss of water to or from the conduits as recharge into river sink varies with river discharge river rise discharge ranged from 4 to 73 m3 s during sampling times and is commonly greater than discharge into river sink at residence times of approximately 17 h conduits switch from gaining to losing water fig 7 longer residence times up to 72 h occur during periods of low flow when river rise discharge exceeds river sink discharge reflecting a gain of groundwater that is enriched in spc no3 n2o and so4 2 and low in do and doc concentrations the estimated residence times show significant positive correlations with spc n2o no3 and so4 2 concentrations and significant negative correlations with do and doc concentrations fig 8 the correlation between spc and residence time fig 8a suggests that the primary control of variations in n2o concentrations at river rise stems from exchange of water between conduits and matrix porosity at intermediate residence times of 22 to 27 h that correspond to periods soon after conduits switch between gaining and losing water fig 7 n2o concentrations are anomalously high relative to the linear correlations with residence time at river rise fig 8d circled data points the correspondence of increased n2o concentrations at times when doc and do rich surface waters are delivered to the no3 rich groundwater within the matrix porosity suggests that n2o production is enhanced by the exchange of water between the conduits and the surrounding matrix porosity similar to production of n2o following spring reversals because of the limited amount of time hours to days that the recharged river water resides within the matrix porosity complete denitrification to n2 may not occur as supported by the linear increase in n2o concentrations with increasing residence time at river rise fig 8d 5 3 n2o emission factors n2o concentrations in discharging spring waters depend on the extent of nr reduction no3 and or oxidation nh4 to n2o within the aquifer and is commonly evaluated based on emission factor estimates e g ipcc hergoualc h et al 2019 emission factors for aquatic ecosystems are divided into three categories depending on the environment and include groundwater streams and rivers and estuaries the most relevant value of which for comparison to the north central florida springs is the groundwater emission factor ef5g estimates of global groundwater ef values have changed by nearly a factor of ten over the recent decades reflecting the difficulty associated with estimating this value the most recently reported mean ef5g value is 0 0060 tian et al 2019 based on 101 studies of agriculturally impacted groundwater and springs avg ef5g 0 0079 as well as upstream or surface water drainage avg ef5g 0 0040 uncertainties in groundwater emission factors arise from the complex subsurface dynamics in aquifers and heterogeneous production reduction and transport mechanisms of n2o these uncertainties contribute to poorly constrained values for the atmospheric evasion of n2o from aquatic systems yao et al 2020 atmospheric evasion from numerous locations around the world are influenced by spring discharge as reflected by decreasing concentrations of n2o downstream from springs sources ueda et al 1993 osaka et al 2006 furthermore n2o evasion from springs are 60 to 100 times greater than n2o evasion from surrounding soils osaka et al 2006 hedlund et al 2011 evaluation of karst groundwater ef values may thus help constrain the potential for atmospheric evasion of n2o from spring waters the average groundwater efno3 eq 1 values for the sampled north central florida springs is 0 0045 mg n n2o mg n no3 but they show a large range from lows of 0 0007 in the ichetucknee springs and reversing springs groups to as high as 0 0177 for the santa fe river rise the average ef value for north central florida springs is heavily weighted by elevated groundwater ef values estimated for river rise supporting n2o production caused by continuous delivery at river sink of reactants e g doc do and no3 to the subsurface involved in nitrogen cycling however the highest ef values occur at river sink with efno3 values of 0 0627 and eftdn eq 2 values of 0 0131 these high ef values for the river sink water suggest greater reduction and or oxidation of nr species to n2o in surface waters draining from landscapes in the santa fe river headwaters here the ufa is semi confined versus the other spring groups where n2o reduction may be more prominent as shown by low ef factors at the reversing springs and ichetucknee springs groups table 1 the semi confined nature of the region upstream of river sink suggests additional groundwater surface water exchange resulting in n2o production during certain flow conditions similar to the production between river sink and river rise because most of the ufa springs have ef values much lower than the global average the floridan aquifer appears to have a lower potential to contribute n2o to surface waters this low potential for n2o contribution may be common to other anthropogenically impacted eogenetic karst aquifers in addition to the ufa due to spring waters that typically have residence times on the order of years to decades florea and vacher 2006 while the presence of elevated no3 concentrations is inherently required for n2o production these results suggest that the turnover of no3 to n2o in anthropogenically impacted eogenetic karst aquifers with high no3 concentrations is ultimately controlled by the amount of doc and do delivered to the subsurface facilitated by surface groundwater interactions 6 conclusions all of the ufa springs sampled in this study had n2o concentrations that are supersaturated compared to equilibrium with atmospheric concentrations with saturations reaching up to 1250 n2o concentrations increase with increasing connectivity between surface water and groundwater that enhances the input of doc into the subsurface fueling denitrification n2o concentrations are lower where the discharging water has residence times on the order of decades as represented by the ichetucknee springs and reversing springs groups in comparison to spring water with residence times on the order of hours to days as represented by the sink rise system the low concentrations in older spring water likely reflect reduction of a larger portion of the n2o to n2 which is consistent with groundwater ef values for the ichetucknee and reversing springs groups that are about an order of magnitude lower than the newly refined global average for groundwater of 0 0060 tian et al 2019 in contrast median groundwater ef values are around 5 times greater where residence times are short as exemplified by the sink rise system at that location n2o concentrations increase as residence times increase from several hours to several days with decreasing discharge and is a result of continuous input of doc and do rich surface waters into the system these results imply that the initial input of redox sensitive solutes and subsequent subsurface processing times affect n2o fluxes from karst aquifers with longer residence times facilitating further reduction of n2o to n2 prior to discharging to the surface credit authorship contribution statement madison k flint conceptualization validation formal analysis investigation

4843,the increased environmental abundance of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen species nr ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 may increase atmospheric nitrous oxide n2o concentrations and thus global warming and stratospheric ozone depletion nitrogen cycling and n2o production reduction and emissions could be amplified in carbonate karst aquifers because of their extensive global range susceptibility to nitrogen contamination and groundwater surface water mixing that varies redox conditions of the aquifer the magnitude of n2o cycling in karst aquifers is poorly known however and thus we sampled thirteen springs discharging from the karstic upper floridan aquifer ufa to evaluate n2o cycling the springs can be separated into three groups based on variations in subsurface residence times differences in surface groundwater interactions and variable dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved oxygen do concentrations these springs are oxic to sub oxic and have no3 concentrations that range from 0 1 to 4 2 mg n no3 l and doc concentrations that range from 0 1 to 50 mg c l maximum spring water n2o concentrations are 3 85 µg n n2o l or 12 times greater than water equilibrated with atmospheric n2o the highest n2o concentrations correspond with the lowest no3 concentrations where recharge water has residence times of a few days partial denitrification to n2o occurs while complete denitrification to n2 is more prominent in springs with longer subsurface residence times springs with short residence times have groundwater emission factors greater than the global average of 0 0060 reflecting n2o production whereas springs with residence times of months to years have groundwater emission factors less than the global average these findings imply that n2o cycling in karst aquifers depends on doc and do concentrations in recharged surface water and subsequent time available for n processing in the subsurface keywords greenhouse gases nitrogen nitrous oxide karst groundwater springs 1 introduction since the start of the 20th century anthropogenic production of nr species has increased by a factor of 10 largely from fossil fuel burning and industrial application of the haber bosch process galloway and cowling 2002 galloway et al 2004 since the end of the 20th century anthropogenic fixation of atmospheric n2 has exceeded that of natural terrestrial n2 fixation galloway and cowling 2002 the subsequent accumulation of anthropogenic nr has important ecological implications through eutrophication and enhancing primary productivity in aquatic systems additional environmental impacts result from processing of nr in aquatic ecosystems including anoxia which creates conditions favorable for the microbial transformation of n species such as n2o n2o is a powerful greenhouse gas with an atmospheric lifespan of approximately 121 years and a warming potential about 265 times that of carbon dioxide co2 and 10 times that of methane ch4 myhre et al 2013 in addition to its greenhouse warming potential n2o has been the single most important stratospheric ozone depleting substance emitted in the 21st century ravishankara et al 2009 since pre industrial times global n2o emissions have increased approximately 20 in parallel with increased nr abundance galloway et al 2008 butterbach bahl et al 2013 with emissions projected to double by 2050 davidson kanter 2014 nearly 40 of total n2o emissions are anthropogenic in nature and originate from a combination of fossil fuel combustion industrial activities and agriculture with the latter estimated to be the largest contributor jurado et al 2018 although n2o is produced by abiotic reactions and microbial metabolisms production through microbial denitrification and nitrification are the greatest contributors to global n2o emissions thomson et al 2012 karst aquifers have physicochemical characteristics that are ideal for nr processing including extensive and rapid surface water groundwater interactions and highly heterogeneous permeability that leads to spatially variable redox conditions ford and williams 2007 karst landscapes cover approximately 20 of earth s ice free land surface goldscheider et al 2020 and depending on the extent of nr processing they could significantly effect global n2o cycling however few studies to date have investigated n2o cycling within carbonate aquifers despite their large spatial distribution and potential for nr processing this processing would be affected by exchange of surface water and groundwater which controls availability of electron donors e g organic carbon reduced fe mn s nh4 and electron acceptors e g no3 o2 aquifer redox conditions and abiotic and or microbial reactions n2o is an intermediate of denitrification and is produced when no3 is microbially respired and sequentially reduced to n2 n2o production via denitrification has been reported under anoxic to oxic conditions for karstic groundwater albertin et al 2012 heffernan et al 2012 jahangir et al 2013 henson et al 2019 nitrification is an obligately aerobic process in which n2o is produced during nh4 oxidation to no2 as a by product during abiotic decomposition of the intermediate species hydroxylamine nh2oh thomson et al 2012 nitrification has been hypothesized to be active in karstic groundwater and contribute to elevated n2o concentrations ueda et al 1993 mühlherr and hiscock 1998 hiscock et al 2003 jurado et al 2018 but direct evidence has been lacking in this study we addressed three primary questions 1 could karstic springs be an atmospheric source of n2o 2 do n2o concentrations change with space and time across a karst landscape and 3 how much nr primarily no3 is reduced to n2o the study area is the karstic upper floridan aquifer ufa in north central florida usa fig 1 where previous studies provide much information on the timing of surface water and groundwater exchange and subsurface residence times of water discharging from multiple springs analyses of the chemical compositions of the spring water reveal systematic relationships between the residence times organic carbon contents and n2o concentrations that point toward potential controls on n2o production and consumption 2 site descriptions geological and hydrological settings the study area is within the suwannee river watershed and is underlain by the carbonate eocene to oligocene carbonate strata fig 1a b these strata include the suwannee limestone 10 30 m thickness ocala limestone 20 80 m thickness and avon park formation sutton et al 2015 within the watershed the ufa is unconfined in the lower reaches and confined in the upper reaches by the miocene hawthorn group the boundary between the confined and unconfined portion of the ufa called the cody escarpment puri and vernon 1964 is the erosional edge of the hawthorn group and is the site of extensive surface water groundwater exchange fig 1a all streams flowing across the escarpment either sink completely into the subsurface or become losing streams the ufa is characterized by intergranular primary porosity of about 20 and can be classified as an eogenetic karst aquifer vacher and mylroie 2002 this primary porosity with an average matrix permeability of 10 13 m2 for the ocala limestone can provide storage for recharged surface water during flooding events florea and vacher 2006 at base flow the matrix porosity may provide 25 50 of groundwater flow to the numerous springs that discharge from water filled caves in the ufa downstream of the cody escarpment rosenau et al 1977 scott et al 2002 ritorto et al 2009 yang et al 2019 regional groundwater flow across the watershed is predominately toward the southwest and includes both slow matrix and fast conduit fracture flow we focus on 13 springs that can be separated into three groups with variable rates of surface water groundwater interactions chemical compositions and groundwater residence times one group of springs the ichetucknee springs group fig 1c includes eight named springs and numerous unnamed smaller springs that discharge 1 to 5 6 m3 sec to the ichetucknee river scott et al 2002 this group has the lowest doc concentrations among the studied spring groups table 1 the ichetucknee springs group can be divided into two sub groups based on their chemical compositions martin gordon 2000 and apparent ages martin et al 2016 group 1a springs head spring blue hole cedar head and coffee springs have higher dissolved oxygen do concentrations and more variable temperatures δt 0 3 0 5 c than group 1b springs mission springs devil s eye mill pond and grassy hole the mean apparent ages based on cfc 12 concentrations of group 1a springs 35 08 0 20 years is younger than group 1b springs 40 47 0 28 years table 2 these characteristics suggest that group 1a springs have shorter and shallower flow paths than group 1b springs martin gordon 2000 the second group of springs are referred to as reversing springs peacock madison blue little river and gilchrist blue because river water with doc and do concentrations greater than groundwater values table 1 periodically intrudes through the spring vents during high flow conditions gulley et al 2011 brown et al 2014 2019 these reversals occur once or twice a year and flood water may reside in the aquifer for days to months before draining back to the surface as the floods recede of this group mean apparent age has been measured only for little river spring the average apparent age which is based on cfc 12 concentrations is 21 years katz et al 2001 heffernan et al 2012 table 2 this apparent age is likely much longer than water that discharges immediately following a reversal when residence times may be days to months e g gulley et al 2011 brown et al 2014 as doc and do are biogeochemically processed in the aquifer groundwater redox state shifts as reflected by variable fe and mn concentrations in water discharging from madison blue spring following reversals brown et al 2019 the third group of springs are part of a sink rise system that occurs where the santa fe river crosses the cody escarpment fig 1d except during flooding all river water is captured by a sinkhole called river sink the river briefly resurges at several karst windows most prominently at sweetwater lake before discharging permanently at river rise spring approximately 7 km downstream from river sink scott et al 2002 water recharged at river sink requires from 6 to 185 h to flow to river rise depending on river stage fig s1 and river rise discharge is commonly greater than discharge into river sink the downstream increase in flow reflects water gained from matrix porosity to the conduits when the groundwater hydraulic head exceeds that of the conduits which should increase average residence times and specific conductivity spc of the discharging water at river rise martin and dean 1999 moore et al 2009 river sink discharge can exceed river rise discharge during high flow events when the conduit hydraulic head is greater than that of the groundwater during these conditions water is assumed to be lost from conduits to matrix porosity martin and dean 1999 bailly comte et al 2010 2011 3 methods water was pumped directly from spring vents using a geotech peristaltic pump and tubing that extended to the shore at the santa fe sink rise system water was pumped through an overflow cup containing sondes connected to a ysi proplus meter that was calibrated daily at all other locations the sondes were deployed directly in the path of discharge above spring vents measured parameters were dissolved oxygen concentrations do saturation and mg l specific conductivity µs cm and temperature c parameters were monitored until values stabilized typically within a few minutes after which the physicochemical parameters were recorded and sampling commenced samples to be measured for total doc total dissolved nitrogen tdn inorganic n organic n no3 and so4 2 concentrations were filtered through 0 45 µm trace metal grade canister filters the doc and tdn samples were preserved with concentrated hcl and nitrate samples were frozen until analysis n2o samples were collected via the headspace extraction method pain et al 2019 e g repo et al 2007 in a 650 ml vessel with 60 ml of sample water displaced with ultra high purity grade helium uhp 99 999 purity or n2 uhp and shaken to equilibration for 3 min the 60 ml of headspace gas was immediately transferred to pre evacuated 75 ml glass vials and analyzed within 1 week of collection the n2o concentrations were measured at the university of florida with an agilent gas chromatograph 7820 a equipped with a µ ecd electron capture detector 63ni source 350 c makeup gas 5 ch4 argon mixture and an agilent j w gs carbonplot column 30 m length 0 320 mm diameter widebore 3 00 µm film regulated at a temperature of 30 c and uhp n2 as the carrier gas calibration standards were prepared by diluting a 0 9700 ppm n2o standard in a he or n2 matrix to 0 25 50 75 100 n2o dilutions were made fresh before each analysis by injecting gases directly into pre evacuated 75 ml glass vials gas concentrations in the headspace samples were converted to dissolved concentrations according to weiss et al 1980 and based on the temperature and salinity of the water all n2o samples were collected in triplicate to assess the relative error of the head space extraction collection method which generated a relative standard deviation of 0 2 µg n n2o l the saturation of n2o was calculated as a percentage relative to atmospheric equilibration with water using the method reported by cooper et al 2017 atmospheric concentration was referenced to the 2019 global average of 332 ppb https www esrl noaa gov gmd ccgg trends n2o accessed january 2019 or approximately 0 3 µg n n2o l at 21 5 c and 0 1 ppt salinity this global average is similar to the average atmospheric n2o concentrations measured in our field area of 330 ppb range 304 356 ppb n 17 during the course of this study in situ no3 concentrations in clear spring waters of the ichetucknee and reversing springs group were measured with a submersible ultraviolet nitrate analyzer suna which measures no3 concentrations based on absorbance at wavelengths from 217 to 240 nm at the sink rise system elevated doc interferes with the suna and these samples were measured with an automated dionex ics 2100 ion chromatograph at the university of florida clear water spring samples of the ichetucknee and reversing springs groups measured for no3 concentrations with both the suna and ion chromatography were similar 0 05 mg n no3 l difference the ion chromatograph was also used to measure so4 2 concentrations with an error on replicates of 5 and a detection limit of 0 01 mg s so4 2 l and 0 01 mg n no3 l doc and tdn concentrations were analyzed on a shimadzu toc vcsn total element analyzer at the university of florida and the coefficient of variation was less than 2 between sample replicates a student s t test assuming unequal variances was conducted for the different physical and geochemical characteristics of the ichetucknee spring sub groups groups 1a and 1b statistical significance of samples was based on p values 0 05 table 1 to evaluate potential reduction of no3 to n2o groundwater emission factors were calculated as the ratio of n2o mg n n2o l to no3 mg n no3 l concentrations in discharging spring waters according to 1 ef n o 3 n 2 o no 3 e g ipcc hergoualc h et al 2019 reduction of no2 and oxidation of nh4 may also contribute to n2o production however we lack comprehensive measurements of these solute concentrations within spring waters discharging from the unconfined portion of the ufa nr primarily exists as no3 while nh4 concentrations have been reported to be 0 02 mg n l katz et al 2009 and concentrations of no2 are expected to be equally low or lower we estimate contributions of nh4 and no2 to calculated emission factors based on the tdn mg n l concentrations according to 2 ef tdn n 2 o tdn other redox sensitive solutes including ferrous iron fe2 and hydrogen sulfide hs were measured in the field as initial samples were collected from all springs using a field spectrophotometer hach dr 890 portable colorimeter concentrations were below instrumental detection limits 0 01 mg l for both fe2 and sh suggesting these solutes provide little control on redox conditions of spring waters 4 results 4 1 ichetucknee springs group chemical compositions of the two ichetucknee spring sub groups are similar to previous observations martin and gordon 2000 martin et al 2016 median spc values and tdn concentrations are significantly lower in group 1a springs than group 1b table 1 in contrast median do no3 and so4 2 concentrations are significantly higher in group 1a spring waters than group 1b springs p 0 05 table 1 tdn concentrations do not significantly exceed no3 concentrations 0 05 mg n l table 1 suggesting no3 is the dominate nr species present in ichetucknee spring waters group 1b springs have significantly lower n2o concentrations with a range from 0 41 to 1 01 µg n n2o l median 0 57 than group 1a springs which range from 0 68 to 1 72 µg n n2o l median 1 37 p 0 05 these concentrations reflect oversaturation relative to the atmosphere ranging from 132 at devil s eye group 1b to 558 at cedar head spring group 1a fig 2 the do and no3 concentrations correlate positively with n2o concentrations while so4 2 concentrations are inversely correlated and doc concentrations show no correlation fig 3 median values for efno3 range from 0 0007 to 0 0019 eq 1 and group 1b springs have lower median values 0 0009 than group 1a springs 0 0018 median values of eftdn eq 2 are similar to the efno3 value ranging from 0 0009 and 0 0017 for sub groups 1b and 1a respectively table 1 4 2 reversing springs group the reversing springs group has median spc values and do concentrations of 400 µs cm and 1 83 mg l respectively this spring group has higher no3 concentrations than the other two spring groups with a range from 1 9 mg n l at little river spring to 4 2 mg n l at peacock springs median 2 4 mg n l doc and so4 2 concentrations range from 0 26 to 4 6 mg c l median 0 49 mg c l and from 4 1 to 7 9 mg s l median 7 6 mg s l respectively although we lack the tdn concentration for the sample with the highest no3 concentration in this group all other tdn concentrations were higher than the other two groups and range from 1 9 to 3 8 mg n l median 2 7 mg n l and are at most 0 4 mg n l greater than no3 concentrations table 1 these springs exhibit n2o concentrations that range from 1 55 µg n l 502 saturation to 2 90 µg n l 941 saturation at gilchrist blue and peacock springs respectively fig 2 although n2o concentrations were generally lower in samples with higher do concentrations fig 4 these variables are not significantly correlated in contrast no3 doc and so4 2 concentrations increase with do concentrations although only the no3 n2o linear correlation is significant the average ef values are similar but slightly lower than those of the ichetucknee springs group the efno3 values range from 0 0007 to 0 0015 eq 1 while the eftdn values range from 0 0006 to 0 0015 eq 2 4 3 santa fe river sink rise group water compositions at the sink rise system show systematic variations from river sink to river rise that depend on discharge due to the continuous supply of surface water to the sink rise system it contains the highest doc concentrations of all three spring groups the sink rise system also shows greater variance of all solute concentrations including n2o compared to the other two spring groups fig 2 spc values range from 57 2 to 359 7 µs cm at river sink from 70 9 to 476 2 µs cm at sweetwater lake and 69 3 to 526 0 µs cm at river rise table 2 do concentrations range from 2 61 to 9 30 mg l at river sink from 0 96 to 7 83 mg l at sweetwater and 0 65 to 7 16 mg l at river rise median no3 concentrations increase from river sink to river rise with concentrations of 0 12 mg n l for river sink 0 20 mg n l for sweetwater lake and 0 23 mg n l for river rise unlike the other two spring groups tdn concentrations within the sink rise system reach up to 9 times greater than no3 concentrations reflecting the presence of organic n and or other inorganic nr species such as no2 and nh4 assuming a molar c n ratio of 50 1 for terrestrial derived organic c perdue and koprivnjak 2007 a median doc concentration for river rise of 23 4 mg c l indicates the presence of 0 6 mg org n l which indicates most of the excess tdn is organic n rather than no2 or nh4 similar to the other spring groups the highest doc concentrations of all sample sites occur within the sink rise system due to the continuous injection of surface water at river sink with median concentrations of 25 8 mg c l for river sink 25 4 mg c l for sweetwater lake and 23 4 mg c l for river rise median so4 2 concentrations range from 3 3 mg s l at river sink 6 4 mg s l at sweetwater lake and 11 5 mg s l at river rise tdn concentrations at river sink range from 0 2 to 1 3 mg n l from 0 4 to 1 1 mg n l at sweetwater and from 0 3 to 1 2 mg n l at river rise most samples from river sink sweetwater lake and river rise have n2o concentrations that are supersaturated relative to the atmosphere except during elevated discharge when concentrations are near atmospheric equilibrium median n2o concentrations increase from 1 14 µg n n2o l 370 saturation at river sink to 1 36 µg n n2o l 441 saturation at sweetwater to 2 04 µg n n2o l 661 saturation at river rise spring this increase is up to 2 µg n n2o l during most sampling times in contrast with trends of increasing n2o concentrations along the flow path four sampling times had n2o concentrations that decreased from river sink to river rise these samples also contained the highest n2o concentrations measured during this study ranging from 3 45 to 5 09 µg n l 1120 to 1738 saturation within the sink rise system significant positive correlations occur between n2o and no3 and so4 2 concentrations while significant inverse correlations occur between n2o and do and doc fig 5 during base flow conditions when discharge is greater at river rise than river sink efno3 values varied more than 10 fold with time ranging from 0 0032 to 0 0177 with a median value of 0 0086 the eftdn values are lower and range from 0 0007 to 0 0113 with a median value of 0 0042 5 discussion over the past 50 years no3 concentrations are estimated to have risen by a factor of 50 in the ufa from 0 1 mg n no3 l 1 to values as high as 5 mg l 1 katz 2004 albertin et al 2012 increasing no3 concentrations in the ufa have been traced back to multiple anthropogenic sources including fertilizer application 51 animal waste 27 septic tank drainage 12 and natural atmospheric deposition 8 katz et al 2009 nitrate was thought to have little or no attenuation in the ufa because of rapid flow combined with aerobic and organic carbon poor conditions katz et al 2009 this view has changed with observations of excess n2 concentrations and stable isotope analyses of no3 that indicate denitrification is widespread table 2 albertin et al 2012 heffernan et al 2012 henson et al 2019 therefore our observations of n2o in springs discharging from the ufa may reflect incomplete denitrification of no3 to n2o incomplete reduction of no3 and accumulation of n2o rather than n2 has been documented in soils and groundwaters due to prevailing oxic conditions osaka et al 2006 laini et al 2011 jahangir et al 2013 mcaleer et al 2017 and high no3 concentrations that inhibit n2o reduction to n2 blackmer and bremner 1978 weymann et al 2008 however the variations in n2o concentrations observed in this study indicate that the extent of denitrification may differ across karst landscapes with variable surface water groundwater interactions groundwater residence times and availability of doc we evaluate these controls based on the spatial and temporal variations of water chemistry and n2o concentrations 5 1 n2o sources despite variations in geochemical and hydrologic conditions among the three spring groups all show a positive correlation between n2o and no3 concentrations implying that elevated no3 concentrations result in greater n2o production the no3 n2o relationships differ between locations however the reversing springs group had the highest no3 concentrations and the sink rise system had the highest n2o concentrations these differences suggest factors other than no3 concentrations contribute to the denitrification rate and specifically the reduction of no3 and n2o within the ichetucknee springs group up to 32 of available no3 is denitrified to n2 as reflected in excess n2 concentrations measured in spring waters heffernan et al 2012 table 2 these concentrations are about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the measured n2o concentrations and suggest that within the ichetucknee springs group much but not all no3 is completely reduced to n2 although excess n2 data are not available for the sink rise system the negative correlation between n2o and do and doc concentrations fig 5a c suggests denitrification may be the primary n2o producing pathway identifying timing and locations of denitrification could be complicated by mixing of the surface water and groundwater if the two sources have different n2o concentrations in addition to water recharging at river sink groundwater sources to river rise are water draining from the matrix porosity to conduits at depths 30 m below land surface and a second minor source from about 400 m below the land surface moore et al 2009 jin et al 2015 this deep source is likely anoxic with negligible no3 and n2o concentrations and thus unlikely to be a source of n2o we assume controls of n2o concentrations are a result of shallow groundwater mixing with river water entering at river sink coupled with production and consumption caused by varying redox conditions and rates of doc remineralization within the matrix porosity fig s2 distinguishing mixing from biogeochemical activity requires information on the mixing extent which can be derived from conservative parameters such as spc carbonate mineral dissolution increases groundwater spc values by up to an order of magnitude more than river water gulley et al 2011 the positive correlation between spc values and no3 and n2o concentrations at river rise fig 5e f suggests draining of groundwater enriched in n2o and no3 relative to river water is a primary control on the n2o concentrations at river rise occasionally during base flow conditions n2o concentrations are elevated at river sink compared to river rise these samples also contained the highest n2o concentrations measured in this study fig s2 were observed following long periods with no increases in river discharge and represent an unknown source of n2o production in the santa fe river headwaters the lack of correlation between n2o and doc in the ichetucknee springs group fig 3a opens the possibility that some of the n2o could be produced by denitrifying microbes using inorganic electron donors such as reduced fe mn and or sulfur species nitrate reduction by pyrite has been documented in laboratory based microbial incubations and flow through experiments according to 3 5 fes 2 14 no 3 4 h 5 fe 2 7 n 2 10 so 4 2 2 h 2 o torrentó et al 2010 2011 this denitrification pathway is thermodynamically favorable and is hypothesized to be active across a range of geological and hydrological settings schwientek et al 2008 juncher jørgensen et al 2009 zhang et al 2009 hayakawa et al 2013 pyrite is common in suwannee limestone of the ufa tihansky knochenmus 2001 particularly in high porosity zones price pichler 2006 and oxidation of pyrite coupled to no3 reduction is consistent with the inverse correlations between so4 2 and n2o and no3 concentrations within the ichetucknee system fig 3b e however dissolution of gypsum in the avon park formation located a few hundred meters below land surface may provide additional so4 2 to these waters miller 1986 without a corresponding reduction of no3 this source may be relevant to the sink rise system considering its deep groundwater source moore et al 2009 jin et al 2015 the so4 2 concentrations are greater in ichetucknee group 1b springs than group 1a springs because of their greater depth of flow martin and gordon 2000 indicating the possibility of a similar enrichment of so4 2 enrichment by gypsum dissolution in the avon park formation if the inverse correlation between n2o and so4 2 concentrations reflects gypsum dissolution then the poor correlation between n2o and doc may reflect doc remineralization through fermentation or the use of electron acceptors other than no3 during the long subsurface residence times 5 2 residence time controls on n2o dynamics the length of time that water and associated reactants involved in nitrogen cycling reactions reside in the subsurface may control n2o concentrations in spring waters these potential drivers can be evaluated based on correlations between reactant and product concentrations for example such correlations have been used in a forested headwater catchment in japan to show that shallow groundwater with high do concentrations presumably with short subsurface residence times had elevated n2o and no3 concentrations whereas deeper groundwater flow paths extending to anoxic portions of the aquifer allowed complete reduction to n2 osaka et al 2006 a similar relationship was found in a sandstone catchment mcaleer et al 2017 in the republic of ireland where n2o concentrations were elevated under oxic to sub oxic conditions do range 4 8 mg l and depleted under anoxic conditions do range 0 3 mg l where n2 concentrations were elevated for the north central florida springs sampled here the n2o concentrations vary inversely across the spectrum of residence times fig 2 with the lowest n2o concentrations in the ichetucknee springs with decades long apparent ages for the discharging groundwater martin et al 2016 and the highest and also most variable concentrations at the santa fe sink rise system where ground water has residence times of hours to days martin and dean 1999 at ichetucknee springs lower n2o concentrations in older spring waters of group 1b springs suggest more complete denitrification to n2 table 2 than group 1a springs which have higher n2o concentrations and younger apparent ages the apparent ages of all springs show inverse correlations with do no3 and n2o concentrations which support increased reduction of do no3 and n2o with longer residence times fig 6 a c although not statistically significant the apparent ages increase with increasing n2 concentrations reported in heffernan et al 2012 for the ichetucknee springs if denitrification is the active n2o producing mechanism then these results suggest that longer subsurface residence times facilitate complete reduction of no3 to n2 fig 6d although the average age of little river spring reversing springs group water has been estimated to be 21 years katz et al 2001 at times following reversals it should have shorter residences times on the order of weeks to months as river water intrudes and then discharges from the aquifer because the reversals also deliver elevated do and doc to the aquifer these solutes would be expected to enhance n2o production within the aquifer the only water sampled from little river springs for this study was collected immediately after a reversal fig s3 and showed an n2o concentration of 2 76 µg n n2o l this value is more than double the median value from the ichetucknee springs group of 1 27 µg n n2o l even though apparent ages of both springs are decades long this greater concentration at little river spring suggests n2o may have been produced during the reversal that occurred immediately prior to sampling or that cumulative effects of multiple reversals create geochemical conditions that are favorable for n2o accumulation none of the other springs within the reversing springs group was sampled immediately following a reversal but nonetheless their n2o concentrations are up to 7 times greater than the minimum n2o concentration observed within the ichetucknee springs group the elevated concentrations in the reversing springs group may thus reflect discharge of n2o produced during the weeks to months that reversal water remains in the aquifer the short residence times for water flowing from river sink to river rise is modulated by gain or loss of water to or from the conduits as recharge into river sink varies with river discharge river rise discharge ranged from 4 to 73 m3 s during sampling times and is commonly greater than discharge into river sink at residence times of approximately 17 h conduits switch from gaining to losing water fig 7 longer residence times up to 72 h occur during periods of low flow when river rise discharge exceeds river sink discharge reflecting a gain of groundwater that is enriched in spc no3 n2o and so4 2 and low in do and doc concentrations the estimated residence times show significant positive correlations with spc n2o no3 and so4 2 concentrations and significant negative correlations with do and doc concentrations fig 8 the correlation between spc and residence time fig 8a suggests that the primary control of variations in n2o concentrations at river rise stems from exchange of water between conduits and matrix porosity at intermediate residence times of 22 to 27 h that correspond to periods soon after conduits switch between gaining and losing water fig 7 n2o concentrations are anomalously high relative to the linear correlations with residence time at river rise fig 8d circled data points the correspondence of increased n2o concentrations at times when doc and do rich surface waters are delivered to the no3 rich groundwater within the matrix porosity suggests that n2o production is enhanced by the exchange of water between the conduits and the surrounding matrix porosity similar to production of n2o following spring reversals because of the limited amount of time hours to days that the recharged river water resides within the matrix porosity complete denitrification to n2 may not occur as supported by the linear increase in n2o concentrations with increasing residence time at river rise fig 8d 5 3 n2o emission factors n2o concentrations in discharging spring waters depend on the extent of nr reduction no3 and or oxidation nh4 to n2o within the aquifer and is commonly evaluated based on emission factor estimates e g ipcc hergoualc h et al 2019 emission factors for aquatic ecosystems are divided into three categories depending on the environment and include groundwater streams and rivers and estuaries the most relevant value of which for comparison to the north central florida springs is the groundwater emission factor ef5g estimates of global groundwater ef values have changed by nearly a factor of ten over the recent decades reflecting the difficulty associated with estimating this value the most recently reported mean ef5g value is 0 0060 tian et al 2019 based on 101 studies of agriculturally impacted groundwater and springs avg ef5g 0 0079 as well as upstream or surface water drainage avg ef5g 0 0040 uncertainties in groundwater emission factors arise from the complex subsurface dynamics in aquifers and heterogeneous production reduction and transport mechanisms of n2o these uncertainties contribute to poorly constrained values for the atmospheric evasion of n2o from aquatic systems yao et al 2020 atmospheric evasion from numerous locations around the world are influenced by spring discharge as reflected by decreasing concentrations of n2o downstream from springs sources ueda et al 1993 osaka et al 2006 furthermore n2o evasion from springs are 60 to 100 times greater than n2o evasion from surrounding soils osaka et al 2006 hedlund et al 2011 evaluation of karst groundwater ef values may thus help constrain the potential for atmospheric evasion of n2o from spring waters the average groundwater efno3 eq 1 values for the sampled north central florida springs is 0 0045 mg n n2o mg n no3 but they show a large range from lows of 0 0007 in the ichetucknee springs and reversing springs groups to as high as 0 0177 for the santa fe river rise the average ef value for north central florida springs is heavily weighted by elevated groundwater ef values estimated for river rise supporting n2o production caused by continuous delivery at river sink of reactants e g doc do and no3 to the subsurface involved in nitrogen cycling however the highest ef values occur at river sink with efno3 values of 0 0627 and eftdn eq 2 values of 0 0131 these high ef values for the river sink water suggest greater reduction and or oxidation of nr species to n2o in surface waters draining from landscapes in the santa fe river headwaters here the ufa is semi confined versus the other spring groups where n2o reduction may be more prominent as shown by low ef factors at the reversing springs and ichetucknee springs groups table 1 the semi confined nature of the region upstream of river sink suggests additional groundwater surface water exchange resulting in n2o production during certain flow conditions similar to the production between river sink and river rise because most of the ufa springs have ef values much lower than the global average the floridan aquifer appears to have a lower potential to contribute n2o to surface waters this low potential for n2o contribution may be common to other anthropogenically impacted eogenetic karst aquifers in addition to the ufa due to spring waters that typically have residence times on the order of years to decades florea and vacher 2006 while the presence of elevated no3 concentrations is inherently required for n2o production these results suggest that the turnover of no3 to n2o in anthropogenically impacted eogenetic karst aquifers with high no3 concentrations is ultimately controlled by the amount of doc and do delivered to the subsurface facilitated by surface groundwater interactions 6 conclusions all of the ufa springs sampled in this study had n2o concentrations that are supersaturated compared to equilibrium with atmospheric concentrations with saturations reaching up to 1250 n2o concentrations increase with increasing connectivity between surface water and groundwater that enhances the input of doc into the subsurface fueling denitrification n2o concentrations are lower where the discharging water has residence times on the order of decades as represented by the ichetucknee springs and reversing springs groups in comparison to spring water with residence times on the order of hours to days as represented by the sink rise system the low concentrations in older spring water likely reflect reduction of a larger portion of the n2o to n2 which is consistent with groundwater ef values for the ichetucknee and reversing springs groups that are about an order of magnitude lower than the newly refined global average for groundwater of 0 0060 tian et al 2019 in contrast median groundwater ef values are around 5 times greater where residence times are short as exemplified by the sink rise system at that location n2o concentrations increase as residence times increase from several hours to several days with decreasing discharge and is a result of continuous input of doc and do rich surface waters into the system these results imply that the initial input of redox sensitive solutes and subsequent subsurface processing times affect n2o fluxes from karst aquifers with longer residence times facilitating further reduction of n2o to n2 prior to discharging to the surface credit authorship contribution statement madison k flint conceptualization validation formal analysis investigation

4844,urban shrubs are one of the main components of urban vegetation and play a significant role in mitigating the urban heat island uhi through transpiration as there are no suitable methods to measure the transpiration rate of urban shrubs many issues related with urban transpiration rate and uhi are still not properly understood in this study the two dimensional 2d three temperature 3t model is extended to three dimensional 3d scale and applied to estimate the transpiration rate of typical urban shrubs from may to december in 2018 three common species of shrubs are observed in this study namely lagerstroemia indica cv bush podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius and ligustrum vicaryi estimated transpiration rates are proofed by isotope method results show that 1 the modified 3d 3t model is a reliable method for estimating urban shrub transpiration r2 0 61 mae 0 10 mm h 1 2 urban shrubs have a quite high transpiration rate ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 mm h 1 in the daytime 3 the rate of transpiration varies greatly in different directions of the shrub canopy top south north east and west 4 the 3d 3t model is able to better reflect transpiration characteristics under the heterogeneous condition in urban environments to the best of our knowledge the improved 3d 3t model is one of the very few methods that can measuring the transpiration rate of urban shrubs the results from this study provide meaningful information and a useful tool for measuring urban evapotranspiration and urban planning keywords evapotranspiration infrared remote sensing three dimensional three temperature model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important hydrological process in the water cycle and the largest water consumption item in the soil vegetation atmosphere system as a central link between water cycle and energy cycle xiong et al 2015 et from urban vegetation is believed to be an effective tool of cooling the environment significantly akbari et al 2001 takebayashi and moriyama 2009 xu and chen 2005 jiao et al 2017 manickathan et al 2018 yan et al 2019 many studies have demonstrated that transpiration of green spaces can effectively lower urban temperature bowler et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 2017 ng et al 2012 hamada et al 2013 coutts et al 2016 kong et al 2016 coccolo et al 2018 however transpiration is difficult to measure or model accurately due to the high heterogeneity of urban environment firstly micro meteorological conditions in urban area can be significantly different within a very short distance due to the heterogeneity of buildings and open spaces offerle et al 2007 giridharan et al 2008 imhoff et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 yan et al 2019 besides the man made urban underlying surface alters the surface energy balance he et al 2020 grimmond and oke 1999 roth 2007 such as larger energy stored by building surfaces montague et al 2000 and anthropogenic heat emissions from buildings transportation and human metabolism ando and ueyama 2017 park et al 2016 sailor 2011 iamarino et al 2012 in addition heat exchange is particularly varied in the complex geometry of cities street length width and buildings height erell and williamson 2006 emmanuel et al 2007 offerle et al 2007 up till now many studies have been undertaken on the crops and trees song et al 2016 hirano et al 2017 imukova et al 2016 liu et al 2017 while few have focused on urban shrub vegetation therefore it s necessary to measure shrub transpiration in urban areas and partition et on it lysimeter sap flow and li 6400 portable photosynthesis analyzer methods have been applied to measure the transpiration of urban vegetation qiu et al 2020 asawa et al 2017 jacobs et al 2015 pataki et al 2011 chen et al 2011 but these methods are merely suitable for individual or small group vegetation and hard to estimate the amount of transpiration on patch or landscape scales the bowen ratio eddy covariance and large aperture scintillometers methods require homogeneous surface balugani et al 2017 wang et al 2016b li et al 2016 buttar et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2013 which is difficult to adopt in urban as the vegetation is segmented by various artificial underlying surfaces considering the practical difficulties in field experimentation empirical models have been employed such as the penman monteith equation have been developed for modelling reference et gill et al 2013 jacobs et al 2015 but actual conditions at the urban area are different significantly from those observed at regional weather station sites digiovanni white et al 2018 therefore taking a small scale approach into account will lead to a better appreciation of urban greenspaces rahman et al 2017 among the urban shrubs studies the average ratio of shrubs cover was similar to that of trees covers cheung and jim 2019 in summary urban shrub et is difficult to measure and model consequently the three temperature 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 qiu et al 1999 for measuring the et with minimum input parameter requirements net radiation soil heat flux surface temperature of the drying surface and dry soil and air temperature without the input of aerodynamic resistance parameters qiu et al 1999 qiu et al 2020 qiu and ben asher 2010 this method has produced to estimate accurate et on various scale such as the river basin sorghum land green roof urban lawn urban arbor qiu et al 2017a 2017b 2020 wang et al 2016a 2016b qiu and ben asher 2010 xiong et al 2019 however the original 3t model thermal infrared remote sensing method two dimensional 2d 3t model hypothesizes that the vegetation is two dimensional and the energy for transpiration only comes from vertical solar radiation whereas shrub is usually trimmed into a regular block in urban areas solar radiation from different directions could also provide additional energy for transpiration which can result in spatial variability of urban shrub transpiration the isotope method has been widely used for et partitioning at the ecosystem dubbert et al 2013 dubbert et al 2014 wang and yakir 2000 williams et al 2004 regional lee et al 2009 jasechko et al 2013 and global scales good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 at the plot scale t et transpiration evapotranspiration can be quantified using isotopic measurements and a combination of traditional in situ measurements such as eddy covariance systems bowen ratio systems hu et al 2014 kool et al 2014 wei et al 2015 as there is no acknowledged accurate measurement method of shrubs et we used the results of the stable isotope method based et partitioning to proof the 3d 3t model therefore the objectives of this study are 1 applying the stable isotope method partitioning et to proof the 3t 3d model 2 to quantify transpiration rates and transpiration characteristics of urban shrubs by the 3d 3t model and thermal remote sensing method 3 to compare the transpiration rate estimated by 3d 3t model and 2d 3t model 2 development of theory modification of the 2d 3t to the 3d 3t model the primary 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 based on the surface energy balance equation by assuming a dry and transpiration free reference leaf to avoid the input of aerodynamic resistance parameters for details please refer to qiu et al 2000 qiu et al 2015 yan and qiu 2016 the 3t model for the estimation of vegetation transpiration can be expressed briefly as follows 1 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where lec is the latent heat flux of the vegetation w m 2 rn c and rn cp are the net radiation on the vegetation and the reference leaf surface w m 2 tc and tcp are the surface temperature of the vegetation and the reference leaf k and ta is the air temperature k a green paper leaf was made and its surface temperature was used to represent approximately the reference leaf fig 1 qiu 1996 all parameters were measured vertically the primary 3t model is based on the two dimension energy balance thus called 2d 3t model however for a large canopy such as the trimmed regular block shrub under urban conditions differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the canopy we hypothesized that the energy exchange occur from the whole canopy to different directions not just from the top therefore separate observations of transpiration and energy exchange on different sides are necessary as shown in fig 1 the transpiration rate of the whole shrub is obtained by area weighted average transpiration rate on each surface of the shrub as shown in eq 2 2 le i n l e c i s i i n s i i n l e c i l i where i represents the surfaces of the canopy top east south west and north n is the total number of observed surfaces for a shrub s i is the observed area of each surface m2 lei is the latent heat flux on each surface w m 2 and li is the ratio of each observed surface area to total observed areas combining eqs 1 and 2 the transpiration rate under 3d condition can be expressed as follows 3d 3t model 3 i

annual precipitation is 1935 8 mm 86 of which occurs during the rainy season april to september on an average vegetation covers almost 50 of the study area and typical vegetation includes trees ficus concinna albizia falcataria shrubs ligustrum vicaryi lagerstroemia indica cv bush and lawns zoysia matrella cynodon dactylon the height of buildings in the area is approximately 20 30 m ligustrum vicaryi is a commonly used green garden shrub owing to its golden color in the growing season it has an ornamental effect and is often used in the pattern of green squares or as decoration in personal yards it is a broad leaved species with a strong stem well developed roots and high absorption rate for water and does not require fertilizers in garden cultivation lagerstroemia indica cv bush is a shrub species of lagerstroemia that is tolerant to drought easy to breed and grows well on both calcareous and acidic soil the plant has no obvious main trunk and is clustered it is a broad leaved species with flexible stems and is usually short it is an important flowering tree species that is widely planted in the tropics during the summer and autumn seasons podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius is an evergreen shrub of the genus corydalis it is a coniferous species with strong stems and high adaptability to the soil as it can survive on saline alkaline soil it is widely planted in temples and yards 3 2 measurement and sampling 3 2 1 measurement of parameters in the 3d 3t model these three widely planted shrubs fig 3 were selected for the present study the l vicaryi were located in an open area between two buildings that was not affected by the shade of tall buildings or trees from 8 00 to 18 00 local time however l indica cv bush and p macrophyllus var angustifolius were located on the lawn beside the building and received direct sunlight after 8 00 but were shadowed by the building after approximately 15 00 in this study 5 observation locations points around the shrub were determined fig 2 the points were distributed with one at the top and four at the sides east west south and north measurements were carried out from these locations toward the block shaped shrub for example the net radiometer was horizontal and parallel to the ground for observing the top of the shrub and perpendicular to the ground for observing the four sides the net radiation air temperature shrub surface temperature and reference leaf temperature were measured every two hours from 5 location on cloudless days the net radiation was measured by cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which was fixed on a welded steel pipe with a u shaped fork by moving the steel pipe the position and direction of the net radiometer was adjusted correspondingly the net radiation and temperature of the reference leave which is made from dry green paper 210 mm 150 mm were measured in the meantime besides the color of the green paper was chosen as near as possible actual leaves with smooth surface the reference leaves were fixed on the corresponding location on each side 30 min before each measurement to blends with the surroundings the net radiation of the reference leave was measured by cnr4 net radiometer and the surface temperature of the reference leave was measured by an infrared thermal camera ir flexcam ti55 fluke corp usa each thermal infrared image contained 76 800 temperature data 320 240 and three replicates of thermal infrared images were taken once in each direction a bowen ratio system tower was erected near the shrub and a thermocouple was installed near the radiometer to measure the air temperature table 1 summarized all the instruments used for the 3d 3t model the instruments for air temperature and net radiation was fixed on a welded steel pipe with a u shaped fork for each measurement we need just one person to adjust the measurement locations and another person take thermal images at the same time for the inputs of the 3d 3t model during daytime measurements on 5 different points around the shrub were conducted every 2 h with three replicates from may 2 to december 31 in 2018 during 8 00 18 00 of which 26 days were valid measurements 3 2 2 sampling and measurements for isotope according to the isotope steady state assumption iss welp et al 2010 the difference between the isotopic composition of vegetation transpiration and that of the xylem of branches is negligible between 13 00 15 00 therefore shrub xylem samples and 0 5 cm soil samples on the surface of the evaporated soil were collected during this time period on october 3 10 and december 18 20 22 and 28 in 2018 for xylem samples the outer bark and phloem tissue were removed for the xylem samples immediately sealed in a glass vials with parafilm and kept frozen 20 c the xylem and soil samples were extracted by a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china after filtered with a 0 45 µm filter the δ2h and δ18o of the xylem water and soil water were measured by a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 912 0008 los gatos research mountain view usa the precision of the liquid water isotope analyzer was typical better than 0 3 for d and 0 1 for 18o the abnormal value was eliminated through the analytical software lwia post analysis v 3 1 0 9 to determine the isotopic values of hydrogen and oxygen organic materials in the extracted plant may cause spectral interference and lead to isotopic values errors schultz et al 2011 brian leen et al 2012 dai et al 2020 therefore the lwia post analysis software was used to identify and quantify the spectral contamination then correction process according to meng et al 2012 and luo et al 2019 3 3 partitioning et by isotopic method the water fluxes entering the atmosphere through soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t experience distinct isotopic fractionation processes the stable isotopic composition of water is expressed by δ r rvsmow 1 where r is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes and rvsmow refers to the same ratio in the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow according to the material balance and isotopic mass balance the fractional contributions of plant transpiration and soil evaporation to et can be calculated as follows yakir and sternberg 2000 4 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δet is the isotopic composition of the et flux δe is the isotopic composition of evaporated water and δt is the isotopic composition of transpired water δt is often replaced by the xylem isotope δx of the branch during midday according to the iss welp et al 2010 the isotopic composition of soil evaporation δe is estimated by the craig and gordon 1965 model 5 δ e α eq δ l h δ v ε eq 1 h ε k 1 h 1 h ε k 10 3 where αeq is the temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor at soil temperature δl represents the isotopic value of liquid water at the soil evaporating front δv is the isotopic value of the background atmospheric water vapor εeq is the equilibrium fractionation factor h is the relative humidity normalized to the soil temperature at the evaporating front and εk is the kinetic fractionation factor the keeling plot keeling 1958 approach is usually applied to estimate δet wherein it is assumed that the water vapor in the atmosphere is mainly derived from et and that which is already present in the atmosphere by plotting the isotopic ratios of δv against the inverse of water vapor concentration qv the intercept of the obtained straight line is an estimation of δet 6 q v q bg q et 7 δ v q v δ bg q bg δ et q et 8 δ v q bg δ bg δ et 1 q v δ et where qv is the concentration of water vapor of the boundary layer of the ecosystem qbg is the concentration of the background atmospheric water vapor and qet is the concentration of the evapotranspiration flux and δbg is the isotopic composition of the background atmospheric water vapor 4 results 4 1 comparison of the transpiration rate determined by 3d 3t model and stable isotope method the 3d 3t model was applied to estimate the transpiration of two urban shrubs and the results were compared with the results by isotope measurements fig 4 illustrates the transpiration and evaporation based on the isotope measurements of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi the proportion of transpiration in total et for p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi in october was 0 99 and 0 97 respectively which indicates that almost all the available water was released into the atmosphere through transpiration in december the average proportion of transpiration decreased to 0 87 and 0 84 respectively which could be caused by the weakening individual activities of plants and slowing metabolism overall transpiration is the main way of water consumption by shrubs during the study period the total et was obtained by the bowen ratio system in the study area plant transpiration were calculated by combining with the proportion in fig 4 the results of the 3d 3t and isotopic methods are compared in table 2 the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius based on the isotope method ranged from 0 11 to 0 42 mm h 1 and the rate based on the 3d 3t model was similar within the range of 0 04 0 48 mm h 1 the transpiration rate of l vicaryi based on the isotope method ranged from 0 11 to 0 41 mm h 1 whereas the rate based on the 3d 3t model was larger within the range of 0 08 0 63 mm h 1 the relationship between the transpiration rates of the 3d 3t and isotopic methods are presented in fig 5 most of the data points were fitted around the 1 1 line and the coefficient r2 was obtained as 0 61 the mean absolute error mae between the two methods was 0 10 mm h 1 indicating that the 3d 3t model is an accurate method to estimate transpiration for urban shrubs the slope of the equation was greater than one therefore the stable isotope method exhibits a result slightly larger than that of the 3d 3t method especially at a high transpiration rate overall the comparative results of the two methods indicate the suitability of the 3d 3t model for determination of the transpiration rate of shrubs 4 2 transpiration characteristics of typical urban shrubs the diurnal variation of the shrubs transpiration rate based on the 3d 3t model is shown in fig 6 the daily maximum temperature reached nearly 34 1 c on typically sunny days and the maximum net radiation of the l vicaryi was approximately 780 2 w m 2 without any shadows of buildings the maximum transpiration rate of the l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi were 0 34 mm h 1 0 41 mm h 1 and 0 51 mm h 1 respectively the transpiration rate of l indica cv bush showed a significant reduction around 12 00 where after increased continuously until 14 00 then declined gradually with the decrease of net radiation the diurnal variation in the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi both showed a single peak curve and peaked around 12 00 in the afternoon although higher than that of l vicaryi the transpiration rates of l indica cv bush and p macrophyllus var angustifolius rapidly decreased after 16 00 because of buildings shadowing the transpiration rates of l vicaryi decreased quickly and closed to zero at 18 00 based on the 3d 3t model the transpiration rate of each side was calculated separately i e all the sides of the shrubs in 3d space that were exposed to the atmosphere were taken into consideration several of the primary parameters of the 3d 3t model such as the leaf temperature net radiation and transpiration at different sides were strikingly different fig 7 compared the variation of transpiration rate net radiation and leaf temperature of different observation sides in the daytime the net radiation on the eastern and southern side of l indica cv bush reached highest at 8 00 which due to the eastern side received solar radiation once the sun rises then gradually weakened until sunset the net radiation on the western and northern sides reached higher relatively only at the 14 00 by contrast the net radiation on the top was significantly higher than that of other sides and its variation presented a single peak curve the variation of the net radiation of p macrophyllus var angustifolius was similar to the l indica cv bush except for the eastern and southern sides at 8 00 the reason for this discrepancy might be the shade of a building in the early morning hours in addition both the variation of the top and eastern sides showed a single peak curve the leaf temperatures of the different observation sides showed obvious intraday changes and were generally single peaks however the differences of each observation sides and intraday fluctuations were significantly smaller than that of the net radiation and transpiration rates the net radiation on the east south and top of the l indica cv bush was obviously stronger in the morning than that on the other sides which made the temperature of these sides higher the leaf temperature on the top side of the l indica cv bush was the highest resulting from highest radiation the changes in the leaf temperature on different sides of p macrophyllus var angustifolius were consistent and the temperature difference was small during the daytime especially the leaf temperature of each observation sides was similar in the morning 8o clock and evening 18o clock the leaf temperature of the two sides of l vicaryi fluctuated similarly and their differences were small the transpiration rate was generally consistent with changes in net radiation on the eastern side of the l indica cv bush it reached a maximum of 0 71 mm h 1 at 8 00 and then decreased gradually it was lower on the southern side while more evident after noon and was approximately 0 25 mm h 1 on the western side on the northern side it was weak but on the top side it was higher showing a single peak curve change of nearly 0 89 mm h 1 at noon approximately the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius was also consistent with the net radiation and the top side contributed most of it it was weak all day on the northern side while peaked in the morning on the eastern and southern sides it was the largest on the western side during afternoon the transpiration rates of both observation sides of l vicaryi showed single peak curves with a maximum of 1 mm h 1 on the top side and 0 37 mm h 1 on the eastern side 4 3 comparison of the performances of the 3d 3t and the 2d 3t models the 3d 3t model is a modification to the 2d 3t model wherein the observation surface number increases from one to at least two fig 8 and figure s1 s10 in the supplementary material shows a comparison between the observations of the 3d 3t and 2d 3t models it was shown that the variation trends of transpiration were similar for the two methods but the 2d 3t evidently overestimated the urban shrubs transpiration the general difference between the two methods was small during 8 00 and 16 00 18 00 as a consequence of low net radiation for all sides in contrast the difference increased gradually during 10 00 14 00 resulting from the increasing difference between the net radiation on the top and other sides the transpiration of l indica cv bush was the most intraday variable and peaked at 14 00 the transpiration of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi both peaked at 12 00 but the difference of p macrophyllus var angustifolius transpiration between the two methods was larger than it of the l vicaryi the smaller difference of the l vicaryi might be caused by its greater proportion of the top side resulting from its dwarf block shape and back against a big stone the relationship between the results of the 3d 3t and 2d 3t models is also presented in fig 8 the mae was 0 23 0 17 and 0 05 mm h 1 respectively for the three shrubs l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi the scatter points distributed below the 1 1 line and these results suggest that the 2d 3t model based on a single observation side leads to overestimation of urban shrub transpiration 5 discussion the spatial variability in micrometeorological conditions across heterogeneous urban environments needs better representation in et modelling lemonsu et al 2012 although some approaches include methods to account for the site scale variability in micrometeorological data chen et al 2011 järvi et al 2011 stewart and oke 2012 the role of the spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions around different canopy positions is rarely considered which can be crucial in the estimate of et under field conditions for example the transpiration rate of the urban lawns with an average height of 3 cm can be accurately estimated by the primary 2d 3t model qiu et al 2017a however the 2d 3t model clearly overestimated the transpiration rate of an individual tree 8 m in height besides large differences in transpiration rates at different locations and directions of the tree canopy were found which was attributed to the different micrometeorological conditions for each part of canopy qiu et al 2020 though the 2d 3t model was applied to urban shrubs 0 5 m in height and could give a reasonable diurnal variation it remained unverified zou et al 2019 these results emphasized the importance of taking the variability in micrometeorological data around the canopy into account for et modeling as shown in figs 5 and 8 the transpiration rates of these shrub were overestimated by the 2d 3t model while the results by the 3d 3t were in a better agreement with those by the isotope method compared to the 2d 3t model with a mean absolute error mae of 0 10 mm h 1 it indicated that the 3d 3t model is an appropriate method to account for the canopy scale variability in micrometeorological conditions theoretically the proposed 3d 3t model is a mechanism model which requires a minimum number of inputs they are net radiation reference net radiation leaf temperature reference leaf temperature and air temperature which are easy to parameterize therefore the proposed model provides a new applicable methodology to modelling et of urban vegetation with different heights from low lawns and shrubs to tall trees qiu et al 2017a 2020 zou et al 2019 the key to its application is the accurate measurement of the surface temperatures and the micrometeorological conditions around the canopy in this study the shrubs were trimmed into block shapes and thus only 5 locations points around the shrub were observed however the measurements would be difficult in tall trees for example these inputs at 10 locations of an 8 m height tree needed to be measured in a short time to minimum the errors for the time lagging therefore the parameter n in eq 3 needed to be parameterized according to the minimum representation requirement for vegetation with different shapes and heights and the observations for all locations around the canopy should be conducted in a short time one possible improvement is in situ measurements of micrometeorological conditions around the canopy and the three dimensional surface temperature measured by the unmanned aerial vehicle or modelled by the approach reported by yu et al 2020 although the 3d 3t model can provide reasonable transpiration rates of vegetation with two different heights and it is expected to be applicable for vegetation other heights and or shapes as it is a mechanistic model it needs to be further developed and validated 6 conclusions this study focused on modifying the 2d 3t thermal ir remote sensing model to a 3d scale and quantifying the transpiration rates and characteristics of urban shrubs three common shrub species namely lagerstroemia indica cv bush podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius and ligustrum vicaryi were observed and the isotope method was used for verification the results showed that 1 there was good agreement between the transpiration rate determined by the 3d 3t model and stable isotope method with r2 0 61 and mae 0 10 mm h 1 these results indicated that the 3d 3t model was accurate in estimating the transpiration of urban shrubs 2 the urban shrubs had a high transpiration rate the maximum transpiration rates of l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi were 0 34 mm h 1 0 41 mm h 1 and 0 51 mm h 1 on typical sunny days respectively besides the transpiration of the l vicaryi was similar to the adjacent lawn approximately 6 mm d 1 in summer and 3 mm d 1 in autumn and winter 3 the transpiration rate varied greatly in different directions of the shrub canopy top south north east and west the transpiration rate and net radiation of the eastern and southern sides peaked in the morning whereas they were larger in the afternoon on the western side the top side contributed most of the total shrub transpiration as it received the most intense net radiation 4 the scatter points were distributed below the 1 1 line indicating that the 2d 3t model may overestimate the transpiration of these shrubs the results of this study can provide meaningful information and a

4844,urban shrubs are one of the main components of urban vegetation and play a significant role in mitigating the urban heat island uhi through transpiration as there are no suitable methods to measure the transpiration rate of urban shrubs many issues related with urban transpiration rate and uhi are still not properly understood in this study the two dimensional 2d three temperature 3t model is extended to three dimensional 3d scale and applied to estimate the transpiration rate of typical urban shrubs from may to december in 2018 three common species of shrubs are observed in this study namely lagerstroemia indica cv bush podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius and ligustrum vicaryi estimated transpiration rates are proofed by isotope method results show that 1 the modified 3d 3t model is a reliable method for estimating urban shrub transpiration r2 0 61 mae 0 10 mm h 1 2 urban shrubs have a quite high transpiration rate ranging from 0 2 to 0 6 mm h 1 in the daytime 3 the rate of transpiration varies greatly in different directions of the shrub canopy top south north east and west 4 the 3d 3t model is able to better reflect transpiration characteristics under the heterogeneous condition in urban environments to the best of our knowledge the improved 3d 3t model is one of the very few methods that can measuring the transpiration rate of urban shrubs the results from this study provide meaningful information and a useful tool for measuring urban evapotranspiration and urban planning keywords evapotranspiration infrared remote sensing three dimensional three temperature model 1 introduction evapotranspiration et is an important hydrological process in the water cycle and the largest water consumption item in the soil vegetation atmosphere system as a central link between water cycle and energy cycle xiong et al 2015 et from urban vegetation is believed to be an effective tool of cooling the environment significantly akbari et al 2001 takebayashi and moriyama 2009 xu and chen 2005 jiao et al 2017 manickathan et al 2018 yan et al 2019 many studies have demonstrated that transpiration of green spaces can effectively lower urban temperature bowler et al 2010 zhou et al 2011 2017 ng et al 2012 hamada et al 2013 coutts et al 2016 kong et al 2016 coccolo et al 2018 however transpiration is difficult to measure or model accurately due to the high heterogeneity of urban environment firstly micro meteorological conditions in urban area can be significantly different within a very short distance due to the heterogeneity of buildings and open spaces offerle et al 2007 giridharan et al 2008 imhoff et al 2010 rahman et al 2017 yan et al 2019 besides the man made urban underlying surface alters the surface energy balance he et al 2020 grimmond and oke 1999 roth 2007 such as larger energy stored by building surfaces montague et al 2000 and anthropogenic heat emissions from buildings transportation and human metabolism ando and ueyama 2017 park et al 2016 sailor 2011 iamarino et al 2012 in addition heat exchange is particularly varied in the complex geometry of cities street length width and buildings height erell and williamson 2006 emmanuel et al 2007 offerle et al 2007 up till now many studies have been undertaken on the crops and trees song et al 2016 hirano et al 2017 imukova et al 2016 liu et al 2017 while few have focused on urban shrub vegetation therefore it s necessary to measure shrub transpiration in urban areas and partition et on it lysimeter sap flow and li 6400 portable photosynthesis analyzer methods have been applied to measure the transpiration of urban vegetation qiu et al 2020 asawa et al 2017 jacobs et al 2015 pataki et al 2011 chen et al 2011 but these methods are merely suitable for individual or small group vegetation and hard to estimate the amount of transpiration on patch or landscape scales the bowen ratio eddy covariance and large aperture scintillometers methods require homogeneous surface balugani et al 2017 wang et al 2016b li et al 2016 buttar et al 2018 zhang et al 2008 liu et al 2013 which is difficult to adopt in urban as the vegetation is segmented by various artificial underlying surfaces considering the practical difficulties in field experimentation empirical models have been employed such as the penman monteith equation have been developed for modelling reference et gill et al 2013 jacobs et al 2015 but actual conditions at the urban area are different significantly from those observed at regional weather station sites digiovanni white et al 2018 therefore taking a small scale approach into account will lead to a better appreciation of urban greenspaces rahman et al 2017 among the urban shrubs studies the average ratio of shrubs cover was similar to that of trees covers cheung and jim 2019 in summary urban shrub et is difficult to measure and model consequently the three temperature 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 qiu et al 1999 for measuring the et with minimum input parameter requirements net radiation soil heat flux surface temperature of the drying surface and dry soil and air temperature without the input of aerodynamic resistance parameters qiu et al 1999 qiu et al 2020 qiu and ben asher 2010 this method has produced to estimate accurate et on various scale such as the river basin sorghum land green roof urban lawn urban arbor qiu et al 2017a 2017b 2020 wang et al 2016a 2016b qiu and ben asher 2010 xiong et al 2019 however the original 3t model thermal infrared remote sensing method two dimensional 2d 3t model hypothesizes that the vegetation is two dimensional and the energy for transpiration only comes from vertical solar radiation whereas shrub is usually trimmed into a regular block in urban areas solar radiation from different directions could also provide additional energy for transpiration which can result in spatial variability of urban shrub transpiration the isotope method has been widely used for et partitioning at the ecosystem dubbert et al 2013 dubbert et al 2014 wang and yakir 2000 williams et al 2004 regional lee et al 2009 jasechko et al 2013 and global scales good et al 2015 jasechko et al 2013 at the plot scale t et transpiration evapotranspiration can be quantified using isotopic measurements and a combination of traditional in situ measurements such as eddy covariance systems bowen ratio systems hu et al 2014 kool et al 2014 wei et al 2015 as there is no acknowledged accurate measurement method of shrubs et we used the results of the stable isotope method based et partitioning to proof the 3d 3t model therefore the objectives of this study are 1 applying the stable isotope method partitioning et to proof the 3t 3d model 2 to quantify transpiration rates and transpiration characteristics of urban shrubs by the 3d 3t model and thermal remote sensing method 3 to compare the transpiration rate estimated by 3d 3t model and 2d 3t model 2 development of theory modification of the 2d 3t to the 3d 3t model the primary 3t model was proposed by qiu 1996 based on the surface energy balance equation by assuming a dry and transpiration free reference leaf to avoid the input of aerodynamic resistance parameters for details please refer to qiu et al 2000 qiu et al 2015 yan and qiu 2016 the 3t model for the estimation of vegetation transpiration can be expressed briefly as follows 1 l e c r n c r n c p t c t a t cp t a where lec is the latent heat flux of the vegetation w m 2 rn c and rn cp are the net radiation on the vegetation and the reference leaf surface w m 2 tc and tcp are the surface temperature of the vegetation and the reference leaf k and ta is the air temperature k a green paper leaf was made and its surface temperature was used to represent approximately the reference leaf fig 1 qiu 1996 all parameters were measured vertically the primary 3t model is based on the two dimension energy balance thus called 2d 3t model however for a large canopy such as the trimmed regular block shrub under urban conditions differences in the energy budget occurred among different parts of the canopy we hypothesized that the energy exchange occur from the whole canopy to different directions not just from the top therefore separate observations of transpiration and energy exchange on different sides are necessary as shown in fig 1 the transpiration rate of the whole shrub is obtained by area weighted average transpiration rate on each surface of the shrub as shown in eq 2 2 le i n l e c i s i i n s i i n l e c i l i where i represents the surfaces of the canopy top east south west and north n is the total number of observed surfaces for a shrub s i is the observed area of each surface m2 lei is the latent heat flux on each surface w m 2 and li is the ratio of each observed surface area to total observed areas combining eqs 1 and 2 the transpiration rate under 3d condition can be expressed as follows 3d 3t model 3 i

rainfall the annual average temperature is 23 0 c with the lowest average temperature in january 15 4 c and the highest in july 28 9 c the mean duration of annual sunshine is 1837 6 h and the mean annual precipitation is 1935 8 mm 86 of which occurs during the rainy season april to september on an average vegetation covers almost 50 of the study area and typical vegetation includes trees ficus concinna albizia falcataria shrubs ligustrum vicaryi lagerstroemia indica cv bush and lawns zoysia matrella cynodon dactylon the height of buildings in the area is approximately 20 30 m ligustrum vicaryi is a commonly used green garden shrub owing to its golden color in the growing season it has an ornamental effect and is often used in the pattern of green squares or as decoration in personal yards it is a broad leaved species with a strong stem well developed roots and high absorption rate for water and does not require fertilizers in garden cultivation lagerstroemia indica cv bush is a shrub species of lagerstroemia that is tolerant to drought easy to breed and grows well on both calcareous and acidic soil the plant has no obvious main trunk and is clustered it is a broad leaved species with flexible stems and is usually short it is an important flowering tree species that is widely planted in the tropics during the summer and autumn seasons podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius is an evergreen shrub of the genus corydalis it is a coniferous species with strong stems and high adaptability to the soil as it can survive on saline alkaline soil it is widely planted in temples and yards 3 2 measurement and sampling 3 2 1 measurement of parameters in the 3d 3t model these three widely planted shrubs fig 3 were selected for the present study the l vicaryi were located in an open area between two buildings that was not affected by the shade of tall buildings or trees from 8 00 to 18 00 local time however l indica cv bush and p macrophyllus var angustifolius were located on the lawn beside the building and received direct sunlight after 8 00 but were shadowed by the building after approximately 15 00 in this study 5 observation locations points around the shrub were determined fig 2 the points were distributed with one at the top and four at the sides east west south and north measurements were carried out from these locations toward the block shaped shrub for example the net radiometer was horizontal and parallel to the ground for observing the top of the shrub and perpendicular to the ground for observing the four sides the net radiation air temperature shrub surface temperature and reference leaf temperature were measured every two hours from 5 location on cloudless days the net radiation was measured by cnr4 net radiometer kipp zonen delft netherlands which was fixed on a welded steel pipe with a u shaped fork by moving the steel pipe the position and direction of the net radiometer was adjusted correspondingly the net radiation and temperature of the reference leave which is made from dry green paper 210 mm 150 mm were measured in the meantime besides the color of the green paper was chosen as near as possible actual leaves with smooth surface the reference leaves were fixed on the corresponding location on each side 30 min before each measurement to blends with the surroundings the net radiation of the reference leave was measured by cnr4 net radiometer and the surface temperature of the reference leave was measured by an infrared thermal camera ir flexcam ti55 fluke corp usa each thermal infrared image contained 76 800 temperature data 320 240 and three replicates of thermal infrared images were taken once in each direction a bowen ratio system tower was erected near the shrub and a thermocouple was installed near the radiometer to measure the air temperature table 1 summarized all the instruments used for the 3d 3t model the instruments for air temperature and net radiation was fixed on a welded steel pipe with a u shaped fork for each measurement we need just one person to adjust the measurement locations and another person take thermal images at the same time for the inputs of the 3d 3t model during daytime measurements on 5 different points around the shrub were conducted every 2 h with three replicates from may 2 to december 31 in 2018 during 8 00 18 00 of which 26 days were valid measurements 3 2 2 sampling and measurements for isotope according to the isotope steady state assumption iss welp et al 2010 the difference between the isotopic composition of vegetation transpiration and that of the xylem of branches is negligible between 13 00 15 00 therefore shrub xylem samples and 0 5 cm soil samples on the surface of the evaporated soil were collected during this time period on october 3 10 and december 18 20 22 and 28 in 2018 for xylem samples the outer bark and phloem tissue were removed for the xylem samples immediately sealed in a glass vials with parafilm and kept frozen 20 c the xylem and soil samples were extracted by a cryogenic vacuum distillation system li 2100 lica beijing china after filtered with a 0 45 µm filter the δ2h and δ18o of the xylem water and soil water were measured by a liquid water isotope analyzer lwia 912 0008 los gatos research mountain view usa the precision of the liquid water isotope analyzer was typical better than 0 3 for d and 0 1 for 18o the abnormal value was eliminated through the analytical software lwia post analysis v 3 1 0 9 to determine the isotopic values of hydrogen and oxygen organic materials in the extracted plant may cause spectral interference and lead to isotopic values errors schultz et al 2011 brian leen et al 2012 dai et al 2020 therefore the lwia post analysis software was used to identify and quantify the spectral contamination then correction process according to meng et al 2012 and luo et al 2019 3 3 partitioning et by isotopic method the water fluxes entering the atmosphere through soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t experience distinct isotopic fractionation processes the stable isotopic composition of water is expressed by δ r rvsmow 1 where r is the ratio of rare to abundant isotopes and rvsmow refers to the same ratio in the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow according to the material balance and isotopic mass balance the fractional contributions of plant transpiration and soil evaporation to et can be calculated as follows yakir and sternberg 2000 4 t et δ et δ e δ t δ e where δet is the isotopic composition of the et flux δe is the isotopic composition of evaporated water and δt is the isotopic composition of transpired water δt is often replaced by the xylem isotope δx of the branch during midday according to the iss welp et al 2010 the isotopic composition of soil evaporation δe is estimated by the craig and gordon 1965 model 5 δ e α eq δ l h δ v ε eq 1 h ε k 1 h 1 h ε k 10 3 where αeq is the temperature dependent equilibrium fractionation factor at soil temperature δl represents the isotopic value of liquid water at the soil evaporating front δv is the isotopic value of the background atmospheric water vapor εeq is the equilibrium fractionation factor h is the relative humidity normalized to the soil temperature at the evaporating front and εk is the kinetic fractionation factor the keeling plot keeling 1958 approach is usually applied to estimate δet wherein it is assumed that the water vapor in the atmosphere is mainly derived from et and that which is already present in the atmosphere by plotting the isotopic ratios of δv against the inverse of water vapor concentration qv the intercept of the obtained straight line is an estimation of δet 6 q v q bg q et 7 δ v q v δ bg q bg δ et q et 8 δ v q bg δ bg δ et 1 q v δ et where qv is the concentration of water vapor of the boundary layer of the ecosystem qbg is the concentration of the background atmospheric water vapor and qet is the concentration of the evapotranspiration flux and δbg is the isotopic composition of the background atmospheric water vapor 4 results 4 1 comparison of the transpiration rate determined by 3d 3t model and stable isotope method the 3d 3t model was applied to estimate the transpiration of two urban shrubs and the results were compared with the results by isotope measurements fig 4 illustrates the transpiration and evaporation based on the isotope measurements of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi the proportion of transpiration in total et for p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi in october was 0 99 and 0 97 respectively which indicates that almost all the available water was released into the atmosphere through transpiration in december the average proportion of transpiration decreased to 0 87 and 0 84 respectively which could be caused by the weakening individual activities of plants and slowing metabolism overall transpiration is the main way of water consumption by shrubs during the study period the total et was obtained by the bowen ratio system in the study area plant transpiration were calculated by combining with the proportion in fig 4 the results of the 3d 3t and isotopic methods are compared in table 2 the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius based on the isotope method ranged from 0 11 to 0 42 mm h 1 and the rate based on the 3d 3t model was similar within the range of 0 04 0 48 mm h 1 the transpiration rate of l vicaryi based on the isotope method ranged from 0 11 to 0 41 mm h 1 whereas the rate based on the 3d 3t model was larger within the range of 0 08 0 63 mm h 1 the relationship between the transpiration rates of the 3d 3t and isotopic methods are presented in fig 5 most of the data points were fitted around the 1 1 line and the coefficient r2 was obtained as 0 61 the mean absolute error mae between the two methods was 0 10 mm h 1 indicating that the 3d 3t model is an accurate method to estimate transpiration for urban shrubs the slope of the equation was greater than one therefore the stable isotope method exhibits a result slightly larger than that of the 3d 3t method especially at a high transpiration rate overall the comparative results of the two methods indicate the suitability of the 3d 3t model for determination of the transpiration rate of shrubs 4 2 transpiration characteristics of typical urban shrubs the diurnal variation of the shrubs transpiration rate based on the 3d 3t model is shown in fig 6 the daily maximum temperature reached nearly 34 1 c on typically sunny days and the maximum net radiation of the l vicaryi was approximately 780 2 w m 2 without any shadows of buildings the maximum transpiration rate of the l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi were 0 34 mm h 1 0 41 mm h 1 and 0 51 mm h 1 respectively the transpiration rate of l indica cv bush showed a significant reduction around 12 00 where after increased continuously until 14 00 then declined gradually with the decrease of net radiation the diurnal variation in the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi both showed a single peak curve and peaked around 12 00 in the afternoon although higher than that of l vicaryi the transpiration rates of l indica cv bush and p macrophyllus var angustifolius rapidly decreased after 16 00 because of buildings shadowing the transpiration rates of l vicaryi decreased quickly and closed to zero at 18 00 based on the 3d 3t model the transpiration rate of each side was calculated separately i e all the sides of the shrubs in 3d space that were exposed to the atmosphere were taken into consideration several of the primary parameters of the 3d 3t model such as the leaf temperature net radiation and transpiration at different sides were strikingly different fig 7 compared the variation of transpiration rate net radiation and leaf temperature of different observation sides in the daytime the net radiation on the eastern and southern side of l indica cv bush reached highest at 8 00 which due to the eastern side received solar radiation once the sun rises then gradually weakened until sunset the net radiation on the western and northern sides reached higher relatively only at the 14 00 by contrast the net radiation on the top was significantly higher than that of other sides and its variation presented a single peak curve the variation of the net radiation of p macrophyllus var angustifolius was similar to the l indica cv bush except for the eastern and southern sides at 8 00 the reason for this discrepancy might be the shade of a building in the early morning hours in addition both the variation of the top and eastern sides showed a single peak curve the leaf temperatures of the different observation sides showed obvious intraday changes and were generally single peaks however the differences of each observation sides and intraday fluctuations were significantly smaller than that of the net radiation and transpiration rates the net radiation on the east south and top of the l indica cv bush was obviously stronger in the morning than that on the other sides which made the temperature of these sides higher the leaf temperature on the top side of the l indica cv bush was the highest resulting from highest radiation the changes in the leaf temperature on different sides of p macrophyllus var angustifolius were consistent and the temperature difference was small during the daytime especially the leaf temperature of each observation sides was similar in the morning 8o clock and evening 18o clock the leaf temperature of the two sides of l vicaryi fluctuated similarly and their differences were small the transpiration rate was generally consistent with changes in net radiation on the eastern side of the l indica cv bush it reached a maximum of 0 71 mm h 1 at 8 00 and then decreased gradually it was lower on the southern side while more evident after noon and was approximately 0 25 mm h 1 on the western side on the northern side it was weak but on the top side it was higher showing a single peak curve change of nearly 0 89 mm h 1 at noon approximately the transpiration rate of p macrophyllus var angustifolius was also consistent with the net radiation and the top side contributed most of it it was weak all day on the northern side while peaked in the morning on the eastern and southern sides it was the largest on the western side during afternoon the transpiration rates of both observation sides of l vicaryi showed single peak curves with a maximum of 1 mm h 1 on the top side and 0 37 mm h 1 on the eastern side 4 3 comparison of the performances of the 3d 3t and the 2d 3t models the 3d 3t model is a modification to the 2d 3t model wherein the observation surface number increases from one to at least two fig 8 and figure s1 s10 in the supplementary material shows a comparison between the observations of the 3d 3t and 2d 3t models it was shown that the variation trends of transpiration were similar for the two methods but the 2d 3t evidently overestimated the urban shrubs transpiration the general difference between the two methods was small during 8 00 and 16 00 18 00 as a consequence of low net radiation for all sides in contrast the difference increased gradually during 10 00 14 00 resulting from the increasing difference between the net radiation on the top and other sides the transpiration of l indica cv bush was the most intraday variable and peaked at 14 00 the transpiration of p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi both peaked at 12 00 but the difference of p macrophyllus var angustifolius transpiration between the two methods was larger than it of the l vicaryi the smaller difference of the l vicaryi might be caused by its greater proportion of the top side resulting from its dwarf block shape and back against a big stone the relationship between the results of the 3d 3t and 2d 3t models is also presented in fig 8 the mae was 0 23 0 17 and 0 05 mm h 1 respectively for the three shrubs l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi the scatter points distributed below the 1 1 line and these results suggest that the 2d 3t model based on a single observation side leads to overestimation of urban shrub transpiration 5 discussion the spatial variability in micrometeorological conditions across heterogeneous urban environments needs better representation in et modelling lemonsu et al 2012 although some approaches include methods to account for the site scale variability in micrometeorological data chen et al 2011 järvi et al 2011 stewart and oke 2012 the role of the spatial differences in micrometeorological conditions around different canopy positions is rarely considered which can be crucial in the estimate of et under field conditions for example the transpiration rate of the urban lawns with an average height of 3 cm can be accurately estimated by the primary 2d 3t model qiu et al 2017a however the 2d 3t model clearly overestimated the transpiration rate of an individual tree 8 m in height besides large differences in transpiration rates at different locations and directions of the tree canopy were found which was attributed to the different micrometeorological conditions for each part of canopy qiu et al 2020 though the 2d 3t model was applied to urban shrubs 0 5 m in height and could give a reasonable diurnal variation it remained unverified zou et al 2019 these results emphasized the importance of taking the variability in micrometeorological data around the canopy into account for et modeling as shown in figs 5 and 8 the transpiration rates of these shrub were overestimated by the 2d 3t model while the results by the 3d 3t were in a better agreement with those by the isotope method compared to the 2d 3t model with a mean absolute error mae of 0 10 mm h 1 it indicated that the 3d 3t model is an appropriate method to account for the canopy scale variability in micrometeorological conditions theoretically the proposed 3d 3t model is a mechanism model which requires a minimum number of inputs they are net radiation reference net radiation leaf temperature reference leaf temperature and air temperature which are easy to parameterize therefore the proposed model provides a new applicable methodology to modelling et of urban vegetation with different heights from low lawns and shrubs to tall trees qiu et al 2017a 2020 zou et al 2019 the key to its application is the accurate measurement of the surface temperatures and the micrometeorological conditions around the canopy in this study the shrubs were trimmed into block shapes and thus only 5 locations points around the shrub were observed however the measurements would be difficult in tall trees for example these inputs at 10 locations of an 8 m height tree needed to be measured in a short time to minimum the errors for the time lagging therefore the parameter n in eq 3 needed to be parameterized according to the minimum representation requirement for vegetation with different shapes and heights and the observations for all locations around the canopy should be conducted in a short time one possible improvement is in situ measurements of micrometeorological conditions around the canopy and the three dimensional surface temperature measured by the unmanned aerial vehicle or modelled by the approach reported by yu et al 2020 although the 3d 3t model can provide reasonable transpiration rates of vegetation with two different heights and it is expected to be applicable for vegetation other heights and or shapes as it is a mechanistic model it needs to be further developed and validated 6 conclusions this study focused on modifying the 2d 3t thermal ir remote sensing model to a 3d scale and quantifying the transpiration rates and characteristics of urban shrubs three common shrub species namely lagerstroemia indica cv bush podocarpus macrophyllus var angustifolius and ligustrum vicaryi were observed and the isotope method was used for verification the results showed that 1 there was good agreement between the transpiration rate determined by the 3d 3t model and stable isotope method with r2 0 61 and mae 0 10 mm h 1 these results indicated that the 3d 3t model was accurate in estimating the transpiration of urban shrubs 2 the urban shrubs had a high transpiration rate the maximum transpiration rates of l indica cv bush p macrophyllus var angustifolius and l vicaryi were 0 34 mm h 1 0 41 mm h 1 and 0 51 mm h 1 on typical sunny days respectively besides the transpiration of the l vicaryi was similar to the adjacent lawn approximately 6 mm d 1 in summer and 3 mm d 1 in autumn and winter 3 the transpiration rate varied greatly in different directions of the shrub canopy top south north east and west the transpiration rate and net radiation of the eastern and southern sides peaked in the morning whereas they were larger in the afternoon on the western side the top side contributed most of the total shrub transpiration as it received the most intense net radiation 4 the scatter points were distributed below the 1 1 line indicating that the 2d 3t model may overestimate the transpiration of these shrubs the results of this study can provide meaningful information and a powerful tool for urban et and urban heat island mitigation credit authorship contribution statement guo yu qiu conceptualization methodology resources supervision funding acquisition bei wang
