14775,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are facing a great challenge to transition from energy intensive to carbon neutral and energy efficient systems biological nutrient removal bnr can be severely impacted by carbon limitation particularly for wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio which can significantly increase the operational costs waste activated sludge was is a valuable byproduct of wwtps as it contains high levels of organic matter that can be utilized to improve bnr management by recovering and reusing the fermentative volatile fatty acids vfas this review provides a comprehensive examination of the recovery and reuse of vfas in wastewater management with a particular focus on advancing the preferable biological short cut nitrogen removal process for carbon insufficient municipal wastewaters first the method of carbon redirection for recovering vfas was reviewed carbon could be captured through the two stage a b process or via sludge fermentation with different sludge pretreatment and process control strategies to accelerate sludge hydrolysis and inhibit methanogens to enhance vfa production second vfas can support the metabolism of autotrophic n cycling microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment such as aob nob anammox and comammox bacteria however vfas can also cause inhibition at high concentrations leading to the partition of aob and nob and can promote partial denitrification as an efficient carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers third the lab and pilot scale engineering practices with different configurations i e a2o sbr uasb were summarized that have shown the feasibility of utilizing the fermentate to achieve superior nitrogen removal performance without the need for external carbon addition lastly the future perspectives on leveraging the relationships between mainstream and sidestream nitrogen and phosphorus autotrophs and heterotrophs were given for sustainable and efficient bnr management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon redirection volatile fatty acids short cut nitrogen removal microbial metabolism engineering practice data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been applied in treating the municipal wastewater for over 100 years and still remain the workhorse in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowadays jenkins and wanner 2014 the successful operation of cas system heavily relies on the supply of external energy and chemicals to facilitate the biological removal of organics nitrogen phosphorus and other contaminants in addition the large amounts of sludge produced during the process also require costly disposal methods the goal of achieving a carbon neutral and energy self sufficient wastewater treatment represents a paradigm shift not only focusing on efficient contaminant removal but also on the recovery and reuse of valuable resources such as energy water chemicals and heat hao et al 2019 zhang and liu 2022 over the years the water industry has witnessed many innovations that aim to improve system management making it more economical and efficient extensive scientific research and engineering verification have led to great achievements focusing on both the microbial principles and process types of wastewater treatment however municipal wastewaters are often carbon insufficient requiring large amounts of external carbon sources to achieve satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance to address this issue the two stage a b process technology has been proposed as a promising and feasible engineering option for municipal wastewater treatment where the a stage is designed to capture chemical oxygen demand cod for energy recovery instead of biological oxidation while the b stage is dedicated to nutrient removal and recovery liu et al 2019 another widely applied strategy is the carbon capture from waste sludge through anaerobic digestion ad which is currently the easiest and most efficient way to convert organic energy into methane ch4 however recovering volatile fatty acids vfas an important intermediate produced during ad process may be preferred over methane recovery compared to methane vfas have higher commercial value and can be applied in various applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries agnihotri et al 2022 additionally vfa production requires a shorter retention time and is more robust than ch4 production amha et al 2018 narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 which can result in higher productivity and lower capital costs moreover methane is a potent greenhouse gas by recovering vfas instead of methane anaerobic digestion facilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation kumar et al 2022 hao et al 2022a proposed that methane production via anaerobic digestion could contribute to entropy production and sustainable wastewater treatment must focus on recovering recyclable high value added organic chemicals from the viewpoint of negentropy vfas are short chain fatty acids composed mainly of c2 c6 carboxylic acids e g acetic propionic and butyric acids produced in the ad process the application of vfas have a significantly commercial value not only can be the chemical precursors to produce industrial bioplastics and biofuels but also favorable for heterotrophs as the most efficient carbon source to facilitate nutrient removal agnihotri et al 2022 by incorporating a side stream anaerobic sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor to provide a source of vfas the sidestream enhanced biological phosphorus removal s2ebpr process has been shown to enrich fermentative polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos improve and stabilize phosphorus removal performance particularly in wastewater treatment plants that struggle with variable influent quality or high levels of soluble organic carbon srinivasan et al 2021 wang et al 2019b with the discovery of anammox in the last century the anammox based short cut nitrogen removal processes via partial nitritation pn a or partial denitrification pdn a are recommended to be applied in the b stage of a b process liu et al 2019 instead of the commonly separate treatment the sidestream centrate is also suggested to be integrated into municipal wastewater treatments to achieve stable nitritation and enhance the efficiency of mainstream anammox cao et al 2022 overall integrating the vfa production via waste sludge anaerobic digestion to improve the biological nutrient removal system is proposed as a sustainable and efficient option for upgrading wastewater treatment processes which could be independent on the insufficient carbon influent expensive external carbon source and also reduce the sludge production extensive reviews could be found on how to enhance the vfa production via cost efficient anaerobic fermentation by optimizing waste source selection sludge pretreatment and operating conditions and usually give a broad review of the vfa application in different fields e g pha biofuels chemicals pharmaceuticals agnihotri et al 2022 lee et al 2014 nguyen et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the paradigm for wastewater nitrogen removal has shifted from the traditional full nitrification denitrification process to a more efficient short cut pathway using the anammox based autotrophic nitrogen removal process li et al 2018b vfas as the fermentative products are mostly thought to induce the complete denitrification directly as the efficient carbon source of heterotrophs in wastewater treatment but their effects on the preferable autotrophic nitrogen microorganisms and the related short cut nitrogen removal process are less understood therefore a critical and comprehensive review is needed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the sludge anaerobic disposal to recycle vfa instead of methane and then further to facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment to address this problem this review was divided by three subsections first explain the carbon redirection strategy to recover vfa from both municipal wastewater and waste sludge then elucidate the vfa impacts on the metabolism of n cycling microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment and lastly summarize the state of the art engineering practice on reutilizing fermentative vfas to achieve the preferably advanced short cut nitrogen removal 2 carbon redirection to recover vfa in wastewater treatment the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are going through the paradigm shifts from energy intensive toward energy saving and carbon neutral processes ren and pagilla 2022 carbon redirection technologies have been proposed to capture and concentrate the particulate colloidal and soluble organics rapidly before entering the mainstream wastewater process to maximize energy and resource recovery lu et al 2018 carbon redirection could be achieved by physical chemical and biological processes and biological processes have been demonstrated as the most competitive sustainable and cost effective alternatives to the conventional activated sludge cas sancho et al 2019 one of the well known carbon redirection technologies is the a b process where a stage is designed for cod capture and b stage is for biological nutrients removal which has been recognized as a promising way to achieve energy neutral or even energy positive for municipal wastewater gu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 versprille et al 1985 instead of the complete anaerobic digestion to convert the waste to menthane vfa as the fermentative intermediates are higher value added products utilized in industry and also the most efficient biodegradable carbon source for heterotrophs metabolism herein the feasible biological processes to capture carbon from wastewater and then maximize the vfa recovery from sludge fermentation are discussed in detail 2 1 carbon capture from wastewaters 2 1 1 high rate activated sludge hras the high rate activated sludge hras process was developed in the 1970s boehnke 1977 but discarded in the past decades due to the need to preserve carbon for the downstream denitrification process smitshuijzen et al 2016 and nowadays is regaining important attention as a carbon efficient technology by up concentrating organic matters and promoting biogas production to maximize energy recovery the hras process consists of a high loaded activated sludge stage followed by a clarifying settler hras has a much lower hydraulic retention time hrt 0 5 h and sludge retention time srt 2 days than conventional systems 6 8 h 8 20 days it can retain the carbon by fast biosorption instead of being oxidized into co2 with a higher loading of 2 10 g cod g vss d jimenez et al 2015 liang et al 2022 compared to cas process fig 1 a the a b system integrated with hras and short cut nitrogen removal could capture 16 more cod to anaerobic digestion and enhance the potential acetic acid recovery by 42 fig 1b the literature survey based on lab and pilot scale studies demonstrated that around 60 80 of the incoming cod could be redirected for energy recovery sancho et al 2019 2 1 2 chemical enhanced primary treatment cept the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a process that uses coagulant metal salts and or flocculant synthetic polymers chemicals to fast remove mainly the particulate colloidal organics and phosphorus from wastewaters and concentrate it in the sludge cept is an efficient cost effective and easily implemented wastewater treatment technology that typically can remove between 43 1 and 95 6 of cod 70 0 99 5 suspended solids and 40 0 99 3 of phosphate shewa and dagnew 2020 according to fig 1c approximately 72 carbon could be captured and fermented to recovery 31 vfa which is comparable with hras however cept is very poor to remove the soluble carbon and the introduce of chemicals could largely increase the operation cost and sludge production by 1 5 2 0 times xu et al 2009 taboada santos et al 2020 comprehensively compared hras and cept and concluded that cept is less energy demanding than hras but it leads to higher operational costs hras is more efficient to removal organic micropollutant omp and virus and it is recommended to be a more effective novel configuration for wastewater treatment 2 1 3 anaerobic treatment anaerobic process has been well acknowledged as the most cost efficient bioprocesses with no aeration requirement less sludge production and potential energy recovery from the final product methane mccarty and smith 1986 anaerobic treatment has been widely applied in treating the high concentrated waste sludge in wwtps or the high strength wastewaters biodegradable cod concentrations 4000 mg l lettinga 1995 however the application of anaerobic treatment on low strength municipal wastewater still remains challenging the low temperature low organic strength stringent effluent quality and short hrt srt hinder its development and extensive efforts have been dedicated to explore the feasibility of different configurations including anaerobic filter af upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr on treating the domestic wastewaters and were well reviewed by smith et al 2012 and stazi and tomei 2018 zhang et al 2021a integrated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system for domestic wastewater and achieved a superior p and cod removal efficiencies of 94 5 and 96 3 respectively li et al 2017 successfully developed the mainstream nitritation anammox nitrogen removal efficiency 90 combined with hybrid anaerobic pretreatment where 75 of total cod removal achieved compared to hras and cept the anerobic pretreatment when integrated in a stage could achieve the relatively high vfa recovery 53 fig 1d but it still faces the technical issues such as long start up period strict environmental conditions and vulnerable process performance which need to be further evaluated in pilot and full scale demonstration 2 2 vfa recovery from sludge fermentation 2 2 1 vfa production pathway volatile fatty acids vfas as the short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids acetic propionic butyric etc are the key intermediate products during the anaerobic fermentation process which can be produced from various source sewage sludge food waste and industrial sludge the bio based vfa production pathway typically includes three stages hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis catalyzed by acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria respectively vfa could be derived from three metabolic pathways the biodegradation of simple organic molecules sugars amino acids fatty acids by acidogens the transformation of fermentative intermediates propionate butyrate lactate ethanol by heterotrophic acetogens and synthesis from h2 and co2 by autotrophic acetogens and then being converted to methane by methanogens to complete the anaerobic fermentation mccarty and smith 1986 fig 2 in summary acetate is mainly sourced from pyruvate through acetyl coa pathway and the syntrophic oxidation of relatively long chain fatty acids such as propionate and butyrate propionate as another predominant fermentation product is produced from the reduction of pyruvate via lactate and transcarboxylase cycle respectively zhou et al 2018 2 2 2 sludge pretreatment to accelerate the hydrolysis as mentioned above anaerobic digestion ad is one of the most efficient and sustainable techniques to stabilize and reduce sludge production and recovery energy or the high value added vfa product after collected from wastewater in a stage as discussed in section 2 1 the rich carbon contained mixture goes into the ad treatment unit for sludge fermentation the wastewater sludge is composed of complex biological and chemical structure including microbial aggregates extracellular polymeric substances eps organic polymers metal salts etc the first step to enhance the efficiency of ad and increase the production of vfas is to accelerate the sludge hydrolysis which has been assumed as the rate limiting step of the overall sludge fermentation process noike et al 1985 the physical chemical and biological pretreatment processes have been applied to disintegrate the complex structure and improve the biodegradability of sewage sludge which have been reviewed previously nguyen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 herein it is highlight that the various pretreatments can not only enhance the soluble carbon release but some can also redirect to acidogenic fermentation to enhance the vfa production physical pretreatments such as ultrasonic microwave and thermal treatments can directly decrease the structure size but needs to input high energy and can also possibly destroy the cell physical structure by freezing thawing f t pretreatment the vfa production could be enhanced by 35 and the related well known vfa producers were detected to be highly enriched she et al 2020 chemical pretreatments namely the addition of alkali acid ozone free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna could significantly improve the fermentation efficiency with relatively low cost and high flexibility compared to the physical methods by manipulating the isoelectric point the maximal vfa production could be significantly enhanced by 151 2 xu et al 2020 by adopting cation exchange resin assistant strategy the vfa production from waste activated sludge was significantly improved up to 4619 6 mg cod l pang et al 2021 although the acid and alkali conditions are helpful to break the sludge matrix yu et al 2008 extreme ph changes can not only lead to the inhibition of microbial activity but they also pose a risk of corroding reactor constructions the electrochemical pretreatment at high voltages 10v was reported to be able to selectively inhibit methanogenesis thereby facilitating the vfa accumulation and increasing the ratio of acetate and propionate of the total vfa zeng et al 2022 biological pretreatment is a gentler process when compared to physical and chemical methods furthermore the released carbon showed the best biodegradability after protease hydrolysis and combining protease and edta 2na hydrolysis was a recommended method to increase the production of vfas when compared to other pretreatments liu et al 2016 the cellulase enzyme pretreatments could increase the vfa yields increased by 36 24 and 86 31 for primary and rotating belt filter sludges respectively bahreini et al 2020b 2 2 3 fermentation optimization to enhance vfa accumulation anaerobic digestion is a sequential process in which the produced acetate could be utilized by methanogens to synthesize methane as the final product although promoting sludge hydrolysis through pretreatment is a simple and direct method to enhance vfa production it is also necessary to regulate the microbial communities to prevent vfa consumption microbiologically all known methanogens belong to the archaea domain which is a diverse group of organisms that currently includes 83 species yuan et al 2019 it is worth noting that nearly two thirds of methane is produced from the methyl group of acetic acid ferry 1992 as a result the competition between acetogens and methanogens is critical in inducing vfa accumulation overall methanogens are more sensitive compared to acetogens to changes in environmental conditions which makes the acidogenic fermentation more engineering practicable generally temperature ph and hrt have strong effects on the microbial activity where acetogens are more adaptive to a broad range than methanogens thermophilic fermentation 55 c led to 10 fold more accumulation of vfas compared to mesophilic fermentation 35 c of the municipal dewatered sludge hao and wang 2015 the alkaline conditions ph 9 0 are regarded as the optimum for vfa production yuan et al 2006 yuan et al 2011 found that lack of mixing drastically reduced the amount of vfa generated of waste activated sludge particularly at low temperatures of 4 c generally short hrt facilitate the vfa production but long hrt is needed for complete sludge hydrolysis lv et al 2022 vfa recovery and dewaterability of fermented primary sludges were reported to be both improved at relatively long srts 4 d bahreini et al 2020a overall the extreme environments could favor the survival and growth of acetogens over methanogens but the effects of different conditions on both hydrolysis and methanogenesis process should be comprehensively leveraged 3 impacts of vfa on metabolism of nitrogen microorganisms the most commonly used biological nitrogen removal for wastewater is the nitrification denitrification process which is energy intensive and needs the external carbon source supplement with the discovery of the anammox bacteria in late 1990s the new paradigm in wastewater treatment is shifting to shorten the nitrogen removal pathway to save the aeration energy and chemical agent the promising short cut nitrogen removal process mainly includes nitritation denitritation partial nitritation anammox pn a partial denitrification anammox pdn a fig 3 winkler and straka 2019 microbiologically the realization of short cut nitrogen removal requires the accurate control and synergistic interaction of nitrifiers denitrifiers and anammox bacteria moreover sludge fermentation products could be an alternating internal carbon for microbial growth which is promising to achieve the sludge reduction and resource recovery herein the impacts of fermentative vfas on the metabolism of nitrogen microorganisms are detailly reviewed to highlight the feasibility of utilizing sludge fermentation to improve the bnr system 3 1 nitrifying bacteria 3 1 1 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob catalyze the first step of nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite five genera of aob belonging to the phylum proteobacteria have been cultured including nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosospira nitrosovibrio and nitrosolobus among these nitrosomonas is the most commonly detected aob in wastewater treatment plants al ajeel et al 2022 purkhold et al 2000 aob are chemolithoautotrophs which utilize co2 as the carbon source and inorganic nitrogen compounds nh4 as the energy source however the chemoorganotrophic growth of nitrosomonas europaea was also observed under anoxic conditions in the presence of acetate pyruvate and lactate and had the genome encoding enzymes required for catabolism of these organic compounds schmidt 2009 pure culture study proved that acetate up to 0 1 m showed no inhibition on ammonia oxidation for n europaea hooper and terry 1973 3 1 2 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob perform the second step of nitrification by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate nob are taxonomically diverse and belong to seven genera in four different phyla proteobacteria nitrospirae nitrospinae and chloroflexi daims et al 2016 among all known nob the genus nitrospira appears to be most widespread in wastewater treatment plants with a higher nitrite affinity than nitrobacter blackburne et al 2007 daims et al 2001 nitrospira have a species level diversity and metabolic versatility in addition to catalyze aerobic nitrite oxidation nitrospira moscoviensis can also grew aerobically on formate and reduce nitrate anoxically koch et al 2015 but for formic acid at 30 mm can cause severe inhibition on nob activity wang et al 2020 however the fluorescence in situ hybridization microautoradiography fish mar analyses proved that the nitrospira like bacteria in activated sludge cannot take up acetate propionate and butyrate daims et al 2001 several studies have shown that high concentrations of vfa 1200 5000 mg l can inhibit the nob activity by 24 100 rather than aob which have a higher tolerance to vfa delgado et al 2004 eilersen et al 1994 oguz et al 2006 takai et al 1997 wang et al 2020 these findings suggest that vfa may facilitate the out selection of nob and potentially promote the partial nitrification process although further verification is needed in continuous bioreactor studies 3 1 3 complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox are capable of completing nitrification from ammonia to nitrate by single organisms daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 these organisms belong to the genus nitrospira and were found ubiquitously in activated sludge of wwtps contributing to the nitrification process annavajhala et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020a although the existence of comammox bacteria could be detected using high precision qpcr techniques combined with genome analyses the functional contribution to ammonia oxidation and niche differentiation with other nitrifying bacteria in wastewater engineering still remains unclear metagenome analyses indicated that comammox clade b carry an acetate permease gene actp palomo et al 2018 two recovered draft genomes of comammox bacteria from the bioreactors added with fermentation liquid possessed with the complete acetate and propionate utilization functional genes but not for butyrate adding 50 250 mg cod l can stimulate the ammonia oxidation rate and transcription of comammox amoa genes xu et al 2022 however the inhibitory effect of vfa on comammox bacteria has not been reported so far 3 2 denitrifying bacteria denitrification is a major step to complete the global nitrogen cycle via the reduction of nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide until the final product nitrogen gas denitrifying bacteria have a high degree of taxonomic diversity from different phyla over 50 genera and 125 species have been identified knowles 1982 zumft 1992 denitrifiers exhibited a variety of phenotypic traits which could be caused by functional genes deficiency or environmental stress zhang et al 2020 in wastewater engineering system a mix of distinct phenotypic denitrifying communities coexisted forming the complex microbial metabolic networks lu et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 denitrifiers could use a variety of organics among them acetate was considered to be the most efficient substrate than methanol and ethanol adav et al 2010 osaka et al 2008 peng et al 2007 moreover acetate was found to be an ideal carbon source to maximize the nitrite accumulation with low c n ratio to achieve the partial denitrification which can combine with the downstream anammox to facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment du et al 2016 le et al 2019 li et al 2018a oh and silverstein 1999 both the direct utilization of acetate and the indirect use of endogenous carbon storage have been shown to be effective in achieving partial denitrification process making it become a promising alternative to partial nitrification especially for the low strength municipal wastewaters cao et al 2022 du et al 2019 ji et al 2020a however higher concentrations of vfa e g propionic isobutyric n valeric isovaleric and caproic could cause inhibition with nitrate reduction being more inhibited than nitrite reduction eilersen et al 1995 which does not facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal via partial denitrification 3 3 anammox bacteria anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox are capable of oxidizing ammonium with nitrite as electron acceptor kuenen 2008 since its discovery anammox is assumed as the promising biological nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment that can efficiently save the carbon source and energy supply kartal et al 2010 anammox bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes including six candidatus genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium zhang and okabe 2020 although anammox bacteria are thought to be chemolithotrophs some anammox species were found to be able to oxidize vfa coupled with dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium kartal et al 2007 for example candidatus brocadia fulgida could oxidize acetate at a rate three times higher than candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis while candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus showed a much higher 2 5 times oxidation rates to propionate than other species kartal et al 2008 candidatus jettenia caeni j caeni were highly enriched 10 in the organotrophic reactor fed with acetate compared to the autotrophic reactor yin et al 2021 compared to j caeni candidatus brocadia sinica were more metabolically competitive with acetate addition based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analyses feng et al 2019 the uptake of acetate and propionate by jettenia asiatica was identified by a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometer nanosims tao et al 2019 the organotrophic anammox bacteria were reported to outcompete heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria treating the low c n 0 5 g cod g n from a sludge digester winkler et al 2012 however the presence of high concentration of simple organics may facilitate the rapid proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifiers which can compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite ultimately leading to a deterioration in anammox performance the short term batch tests showed that the higher concentration of acetate 240 mg l and propionate 400 mg l could decrease the ammonium removal rate by 30 huang et al 2014 long term continuous reactor tests demonstrated that low concentrations of acetic acid 30 mg l and propionic acid 21 mg l increased the nitrogen removal rate while the anammox collapsed when the dosing concentrations reached 270 mg l and 191 mg l respectively peng et al 2022 4 engineering practice on reutilizing waste activated sludge to achieve short cut nitrogen removal processes wastewater treatment plants wwtps produce large amounts of waste activated sludge was daily 0 60 0 80 kg ss kg cod in the activated sludge process and has a cost ranging from 20 to 60 of the total operation costs andreoli et al 2007 as previously described the organic fractions 0 75 0 80 of the activated sludge could be robustly converted into the short chain volatile fatty acids vfas by acidogenic and acetogenic organisms rather than further to the methane by methanogenic organisms yuan et al 2019 the fermentative vfas as a potential renewable and easily biodegradable carbon source can be reutilized to improve the biological nutrient removal performance and reduce sludge production to pursue the cost efficient short cut nitrogen removal process via partial nitrification anammox pn a or partial denitrification anammox pd a in wastewater treatment fig 3 zhang et al 2019 the lab and pilot scale engineering practices have been successfully made on integrating the addition of was fermentation products to achieve the efficient nitrogen removal and the different configurations applied are summarized in fig 4 overall utilizing the sludge fermentation could achieve the excellent and efficient short cut nitrogen removal tn effluent 10 mg n l nre 90 with no external chemical carbon dosing and the detailed performance parameters are listed in table 1 4 1 a2o type the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o and its modified type is the most common wastewater treatment method applied in biological nutrient removal systems upgrading the existing a2o like process by replacing the external carbon source with the fermentation products could both improve the nitrogen removal performance and achieve sludge reduction as shown in fig 3a four strategies have been applied to utilize the internal carbon of was to achieve the short cut nitrogen removal first by adding was to the anaerobic units to induce the in situ sludge fermentation to produce vfas that can flow into the downstream anoxic units to enhance the nitrogen removal wang et al 2019b performed a full scale testing by adjusting the anaerobic units of conventional a2o process as side stream reactors and diverting the return activated sludge in to promote fermentation the results showed that both denitrification and ebpr performance could be enhanced by 20 30 second by adding the ex situ sludge fermentation liquid directly to the anoxic unit to enhance the denitrification process yang et al 2020b and chen et al 2022 agreed that both the pn and pdn could be enhanced in the aerobic and anoxic units respectively by adding the sludge fermentation products into the lab scale continuous flow reactors pilot scale testing was also conducted using primary sludge fermentate as carbon source to achieve the mainstream partial denitrification anammox pd a and the extremely low tin effluent limits 5 mg n l could be reached ali et al 2021 ladipo obasa et al 2022 third by installing sidestream fermenter using part of the recycled ras to supplement the produced vfas to the anoxic units he et al 2022 applied the sidestream sludge fermentation to treat the real sewage and highly improved the anammox contribution via nitrite accumulation fourth by enlarging the anoxic volume or adding biocarrier to increase the sludge retention time to enhance the in situ sludge fermentation liu et al 2022 achieved the in situ fermentation to promote the pd a process in an integrated anoxic oxic a o reactors by adding carries and the enlarge ratio of anoxic zones fan et al 2022b achieved the excellent performance of partial nitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal using the prolonged anaerobic phase in the continuous flow system 4 2 sbr type the sequencing batch reactor sbr is a fill and draw activated sludge system for wastewater treatment which is flexible to adjust the number of cycles per day and the length of each phase in one cycle to optimize the process operation the sludge fermentation could be utilized either by adding the was directly to the reactor or by injecting the pre fermented liquid products into the anoxic phase of the reactor fig 3b by feeding the fresh was via in situ fermentation to supply the organic source the excellent nitrogen removal efficiency 90 could be achieved by pn and pdn in sbr with efficient sludge reduction 21 6 48 1 fan et al 2022a guo et al 2016 as for the external fermentation both the fermentative products and the separated liquid were applied to enhance the biological nutrient removal system the fermentation products were reported to be efficient for inhibiting nob over aob which can induce the partial nitrification to achieve the short cut removal for low strength municipal wastewater liu et al 2021a 2017 adding the sludge fermentation liquid instead of the external carbon is the most direct way to enhance the denitrification process especially triggered the partial denitrification process jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021b and also can select the pha storing biomass for pha recovery basset et al 2016 in addition to the municipal wastewater the sludge fermentation could also be integrated in treating the landfill leachate by a series of sbrs via supplying the external fermentation liquid to induce pd qiu et al 2022 or coupling in situ fermentation and denitrification with the superior nitrogen removal efficiency 98 zhang et al 2021b 2022 fig 3c 4 3 uasb type the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is a widely used anaerobic system for the industrial wastewaters with high organic loading rates the synergistic partial denitrification anammox and in situ fermentation process was achieved in an uasb reactor for the domestic and nitrate containing wastewater c n 1 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency reached 93 1 with dominated anammox contribution of 95 6 ji et al 2020b the uasb type reactor was also successfully demonstrated both at lab and pilot scale downstream the pn reactor to achieve the simultaneous anammox denitrification and sludge fermentation for municipal wastewaters with 80 nitrogen removal efficiency and 40 sludge reduction efficiency wang et al 2019a 2022 5 conclusions and future perspectives this review comprehensively discusses vfa recovery strategies from both wastewater and waste sludge fermentation and their potential to facilitate advanced short cut biological nitrogen removal it was suggested that instead of high entropy methane the influent carbon of municipal wastewater could be maximally captured at the a stage of the sustainable a b process and redirected to produce vfa via sludge fermentation to enhance vfa production various methods have been applied to accelerate sludge hydrolysis and regulate competition between acetogens and methanogens although functional nitrogen cycling bacteria aob nob anammox comammox are recognized as autotrophic microbes they can metabolize the organic vfas fermentative vfas can promote preferable partial nitrification or partial denitrification to facilitate mainstream short cut nitrogen removal both lab and pilot scale engineering practices have demonstrated the feasibility of integrating sludge fermentation into biological nitrogen removal for municipal wastewater based on these findings future perspectives are suggested as follows 1 mainstream vs sidestream mainstream wastewater and sidestream sludge are typically treated separately however by incorporating sludge hydrolysis and fermentation through a sidestream configuration it is possible to recover the internal carbon source such as vfas instead of relying on the external source to achieve this it is crucial to optimize the amount and composition of fermentative vfas carefully examine the impact of unwanted byproducts released during the sludge fermentation process and design the exchange route between mainstream and sidestream to minimize any loading shock on the wastewater treatment and to enhance the overall efficiency and sustainability 2 nitrogen vs phosphorus biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal have long been considered to be in conflict with each other due to the different working conditions required by the microorganisms involved however recent research has proposed sidestream fermentation configuration as a promising engineering solution for selecting fermentative paos and achieving more stable and efficient p removal additionally high concentrations of vfa could lead to selective inhibition of nob over aob thus promoting partial nitrification moreover acetate has been recognized as an effective carbon source for achieving partial denitrification sidestream configurations have also been suggested to maintain the mainstream anammox therefore further exploration is needed to determine the feasibility of integrating sidestream sludge fermentation for simultaneous biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 autotrophs vs heterotrophs heterotrophs typically have a competitive advantage over autotrophs but autotrophic nitrogen removal process is preferred in wastewater treatment due to lower carbon footprint introducing sludge fermentation to produce excess vfas could shift the balance in favor of heterotrophic bacteria however this may be mitigated by selecting specific microorganisms capable of storing internal carbon polymers to minimize the impact of bulk carbon on autotrophs more comprehensive microbiological studies using metagenomics techniques are needed to understand the interaction and competition between autotrophs and heterotrophs with exogenous or endogenous organic compounds declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

14775,wastewater treatment plants wwtps are facing a great challenge to transition from energy intensive to carbon neutral and energy efficient systems biological nutrient removal bnr can be severely impacted by carbon limitation particularly for wastewater with a low carbon to nitrogen c n ratio which can significantly increase the operational costs waste activated sludge was is a valuable byproduct of wwtps as it contains high levels of organic matter that can be utilized to improve bnr management by recovering and reusing the fermentative volatile fatty acids vfas this review provides a comprehensive examination of the recovery and reuse of vfas in wastewater management with a particular focus on advancing the preferable biological short cut nitrogen removal process for carbon insufficient municipal wastewaters first the method of carbon redirection for recovering vfas was reviewed carbon could be captured through the two stage a b process or via sludge fermentation with different sludge pretreatment and process control strategies to accelerate sludge hydrolysis and inhibit methanogens to enhance vfa production second vfas can support the metabolism of autotrophic n cycling microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment such as aob nob anammox and comammox bacteria however vfas can also cause inhibition at high concentrations leading to the partition of aob and nob and can promote partial denitrification as an efficient carbon source for heterotrophic denitrifiers third the lab and pilot scale engineering practices with different configurations i e a2o sbr uasb were summarized that have shown the feasibility of utilizing the fermentate to achieve superior nitrogen removal performance without the need for external carbon addition lastly the future perspectives on leveraging the relationships between mainstream and sidestream nitrogen and phosphorus autotrophs and heterotrophs were given for sustainable and efficient bnr management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon redirection volatile fatty acids short cut nitrogen removal microbial metabolism engineering practice data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the conventional activated sludge cas process has been applied in treating the municipal wastewater for over 100 years and still remain the workhorse in wastewater treatment plants wwtps nowadays jenkins and wanner 2014 the successful operation of cas system heavily relies on the supply of external energy and chemicals to facilitate the biological removal of organics nitrogen phosphorus and other contaminants in addition the large amounts of sludge produced during the process also require costly disposal methods the goal of achieving a carbon neutral and energy self sufficient wastewater treatment represents a paradigm shift not only focusing on efficient contaminant removal but also on the recovery and reuse of valuable resources such as energy water chemicals and heat hao et al 2019 zhang and liu 2022 over the years the water industry has witnessed many innovations that aim to improve system management making it more economical and efficient extensive scientific research and engineering verification have led to great achievements focusing on both the microbial principles and process types of wastewater treatment however municipal wastewaters are often carbon insufficient requiring large amounts of external carbon sources to achieve satisfactory nitrogen and phosphorus removal performance to address this issue the two stage a b process technology has been proposed as a promising and feasible engineering option for municipal wastewater treatment where the a stage is designed to capture chemical oxygen demand cod for energy recovery instead of biological oxidation while the b stage is dedicated to nutrient removal and recovery liu et al 2019 another widely applied strategy is the carbon capture from waste sludge through anaerobic digestion ad which is currently the easiest and most efficient way to convert organic energy into methane ch4 however recovering volatile fatty acids vfas an important intermediate produced during ad process may be preferred over methane recovery compared to methane vfas have higher commercial value and can be applied in various applications in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries agnihotri et al 2022 additionally vfa production requires a shorter retention time and is more robust than ch4 production amha et al 2018 narihiro and sekiguchi 2007 which can result in higher productivity and lower capital costs moreover methane is a potent greenhouse gas by recovering vfas instead of methane anaerobic digestion facilities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change mitigation kumar et al 2022 hao et al 2022a proposed that methane production via anaerobic digestion could contribute to entropy production and sustainable wastewater treatment must focus on recovering recyclable high value added organic chemicals from the viewpoint of negentropy vfas are short chain fatty acids composed mainly of c2 c6 carboxylic acids e g acetic propionic and butyric acids produced in the ad process the application of vfas have a significantly commercial value not only can be the chemical precursors to produce industrial bioplastics and biofuels but also favorable for heterotrophs as the most efficient carbon source to facilitate nutrient removal agnihotri et al 2022 by incorporating a side stream anaerobic sludge hydrolysis and fermentation reactor to provide a source of vfas the sidestream enhanced biological phosphorus removal s2ebpr process has been shown to enrich fermentative polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos improve and stabilize phosphorus removal performance particularly in wastewater treatment plants that struggle with variable influent quality or high levels of soluble organic carbon srinivasan et al 2021 wang et al 2019b with the discovery of anammox in the last century the anammox based short cut nitrogen removal processes via partial nitritation pn a or partial denitrification pdn a are recommended to be applied in the b stage of a b process liu et al 2019 instead of the commonly separate treatment the sidestream centrate is also suggested to be integrated into municipal wastewater treatments to achieve stable nitritation and enhance the efficiency of mainstream anammox cao et al 2022 overall integrating the vfa production via waste sludge anaerobic digestion to improve the biological nutrient removal system is proposed as a sustainable and efficient option for upgrading wastewater treatment processes which could be independent on the insufficient carbon influent expensive external carbon source and also reduce the sludge production extensive reviews could be found on how to enhance the vfa production via cost efficient anaerobic fermentation by optimizing waste source selection sludge pretreatment and operating conditions and usually give a broad review of the vfa application in different fields e g pha biofuels chemicals pharmaceuticals agnihotri et al 2022 lee et al 2014 nguyen et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 the paradigm for wastewater nitrogen removal has shifted from the traditional full nitrification denitrification process to a more efficient short cut pathway using the anammox based autotrophic nitrogen removal process li et al 2018b vfas as the fermentative products are mostly thought to induce the complete denitrification directly as the efficient carbon source of heterotrophs in wastewater treatment but their effects on the preferable autotrophic nitrogen microorganisms and the related short cut nitrogen removal process are less understood therefore a critical and comprehensive review is needed to evaluate the feasibility of integrating the sludge anaerobic disposal to recycle vfa instead of methane and then further to facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal in municipal wastewater treatment to address this problem this review was divided by three subsections first explain the carbon redirection strategy to recover vfa from both municipal wastewater and waste sludge then elucidate the vfa impacts on the metabolism of n cycling microorganisms involved in wastewater treatment and lastly summarize the state of the art engineering practice on reutilizing fermentative vfas to achieve the preferably advanced short cut nitrogen removal 2 carbon redirection to recover vfa in wastewater treatment the wastewater treatment plants wwtps are going through the paradigm shifts from energy intensive toward energy saving and carbon neutral processes ren and pagilla 2022 carbon redirection technologies have been proposed to capture and concentrate the particulate colloidal and soluble organics rapidly before entering the mainstream wastewater process to maximize energy and resource recovery lu et al 2018 carbon redirection could be achieved by physical chemical and biological processes and biological processes have been demonstrated as the most competitive sustainable and cost effective alternatives to the conventional activated sludge cas sancho et al 2019 one of the well known carbon redirection technologies is the a b process where a stage is designed for cod capture and b stage is for biological nutrients removal which has been recognized as a promising way to achieve energy neutral or even energy positive for municipal wastewater gu et al 2018 liu et al 2019 versprille et al 1985 instead of the complete anaerobic digestion to convert the waste to menthane vfa as the fermentative intermediates are higher value added products utilized in industry and also the most efficient biodegradable carbon source for heterotrophs metabolism herein the feasible biological processes to capture carbon from wastewater and then maximize the vfa recovery from sludge fermentation are discussed in detail 2 1 carbon capture from wastewaters 2 1 1 high rate activated sludge hras the high rate activated sludge hras process was developed in the 1970s boehnke 1977 but discarded in the past decades due to the need to preserve carbon for the downstream denitrification process smitshuijzen et al 2016 and nowadays is regaining important attention as a carbon efficient technology by up concentrating organic matters and promoting biogas production to maximize energy recovery the hras process consists of a high loaded activated sludge stage followed by a clarifying settler hras has a much lower hydraulic retention time hrt 0 5 h and sludge retention time srt 2 days than conventional systems 6 8 h 8 20 days it can retain the carbon by fast biosorption instead of being oxidized into co2 with a higher loading of 2 10 g cod g vss d jimenez et al 2015 liang et al 2022 compared to cas process fig 1 a the a b system integrated with hras and short cut nitrogen removal could capture 16 more cod to anaerobic digestion and enhance the potential acetic acid recovery by 42 fig 1b the literature survey based on lab and pilot scale studies demonstrated that around 60 80 of the incoming cod could be redirected for energy recovery sancho et al 2019 2 1 2 chemical enhanced primary treatment cept the chemically enhanced primary treatment cept is a process that uses coagulant metal salts and or flocculant synthetic polymers chemicals to fast remove mainly the particulate colloidal organics and phosphorus from wastewaters and concentrate it in the sludge cept is an efficient cost effective and easily implemented wastewater treatment technology that typically can remove between 43 1 and 95 6 of cod 70 0 99 5 suspended solids and 40 0 99 3 of phosphate shewa and dagnew 2020 according to fig 1c approximately 72 carbon could be captured and fermented to recovery 31 vfa which is comparable with hras however cept is very poor to remove the soluble carbon and the introduce of chemicals could largely increase the operation cost and sludge production by 1 5 2 0 times xu et al 2009 taboada santos et al 2020 comprehensively compared hras and cept and concluded that cept is less energy demanding than hras but it leads to higher operational costs hras is more efficient to removal organic micropollutant omp and virus and it is recommended to be a more effective novel configuration for wastewater treatment 2 1 3 anaerobic treatment anaerobic process has been well acknowledged as the most cost efficient bioprocesses with no aeration requirement less sludge production and potential energy recovery from the final product methane mccarty and smith 1986 anaerobic treatment has been widely applied in treating the high concentrated waste sludge in wwtps or the high strength wastewaters biodegradable cod concentrations 4000 mg l lettinga 1995 however the application of anaerobic treatment on low strength municipal wastewater still remains challenging the low temperature low organic strength stringent effluent quality and short hrt srt hinder its development and extensive efforts have been dedicated to explore the feasibility of different configurations including anaerobic filter af upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb expanded granular sludge bed egsb and anaerobic membrane bioreactors anmbr on treating the domestic wastewaters and were well reviewed by smith et al 2012 and stazi and tomei 2018 zhang et al 2021a integrated enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr in a continuous anaerobic aerobic a stage system for domestic wastewater and achieved a superior p and cod removal efficiencies of 94 5 and 96 3 respectively li et al 2017 successfully developed the mainstream nitritation anammox nitrogen removal efficiency 90 combined with hybrid anaerobic pretreatment where 75 of total cod removal achieved compared to hras and cept the anerobic pretreatment when integrated in a stage could achieve the relatively high vfa recovery 53 fig 1d but it still faces the technical issues such as long start up period strict environmental conditions and vulnerable process performance which need to be further evaluated in pilot and full scale demonstration 2 2 vfa recovery from sludge fermentation 2 2 1 vfa production pathway volatile fatty acids vfas as the short chain aliphatic monocarboxylic acids acetic propionic butyric etc are the key intermediate products during the anaerobic fermentation process which can be produced from various source sewage sludge food waste and industrial sludge the bio based vfa production pathway typically includes three stages hydrolysis acidogenesis and acetogenesis catalyzed by acidogenic and acetogenic bacteria respectively vfa could be derived from three metabolic pathways the biodegradation of simple organic molecules sugars amino acids fatty acids by acidogens the transformation of fermentative intermediates propionate butyrate lactate ethanol by heterotrophic acetogens and synthesis from h2 and co2 by autotrophic acetogens and then being converted to methane by methanogens to complete the anaerobic fermentation mccarty and smith 1986 fig 2 in summary acetate is mainly sourced from pyruvate through acetyl coa pathway and the syntrophic oxidation of relatively long chain fatty acids such as propionate and butyrate propionate as another predominant fermentation product is produced from the reduction of pyruvate via lactate and transcarboxylase cycle respectively zhou et al 2018 2 2 2 sludge pretreatment to accelerate the hydrolysis as mentioned above anaerobic digestion ad is one of the most efficient and sustainable techniques to stabilize and reduce sludge production and recovery energy or the high value added vfa product after collected from wastewater in a stage as discussed in section 2 1 the rich carbon contained mixture goes into the ad treatment unit for sludge fermentation the wastewater sludge is composed of complex biological and chemical structure including microbial aggregates extracellular polymeric substances eps organic polymers metal salts etc the first step to enhance the efficiency of ad and increase the production of vfas is to accelerate the sludge hydrolysis which has been assumed as the rate limiting step of the overall sludge fermentation process noike et al 1985 the physical chemical and biological pretreatment processes have been applied to disintegrate the complex structure and improve the biodegradability of sewage sludge which have been reviewed previously nguyen et al 2021 yuan et al 2019 herein it is highlight that the various pretreatments can not only enhance the soluble carbon release but some can also redirect to acidogenic fermentation to enhance the vfa production physical pretreatments such as ultrasonic microwave and thermal treatments can directly decrease the structure size but needs to input high energy and can also possibly destroy the cell physical structure by freezing thawing f t pretreatment the vfa production could be enhanced by 35 and the related well known vfa producers were detected to be highly enriched she et al 2020 chemical pretreatments namely the addition of alkali acid ozone free ammonia fa and free nitrous acid fna could significantly improve the fermentation efficiency with relatively low cost and high flexibility compared to the physical methods by manipulating the isoelectric point the maximal vfa production could be significantly enhanced by 151 2 xu et al 2020 by adopting cation exchange resin assistant strategy the vfa production from waste activated sludge was significantly improved up to 4619 6 mg cod l pang et al 2021 although the acid and alkali conditions are helpful to break the sludge matrix yu et al 2008 extreme ph changes can not only lead to the inhibition of microbial activity but they also pose a risk of corroding reactor constructions the electrochemical pretreatment at high voltages 10v was reported to be able to selectively inhibit methanogenesis thereby facilitating the vfa accumulation and increasing the ratio of acetate and propionate of the total vfa zeng et al 2022 biological pretreatment is a gentler process when compared to physical and chemical methods furthermore the released carbon showed the best biodegradability after protease hydrolysis and combining protease and edta 2na hydrolysis was a recommended method to increase the production of vfas when compared to other pretreatments liu et al 2016 the cellulase enzyme pretreatments could increase the vfa yields increased by 36 24 and 86 31 for primary and rotating belt filter sludges respectively bahreini et al 2020b 2 2 3 fermentation optimization to enhance vfa accumulation anaerobic digestion is a sequential process in which the produced acetate could be utilized by methanogens to synthesize methane as the final product although promoting sludge hydrolysis through pretreatment is a simple and direct method to enhance vfa production it is also necessary to regulate the microbial communities to prevent vfa consumption microbiologically all known methanogens belong to the archaea domain which is a diverse group of organisms that currently includes 83 species yuan et al 2019 it is worth noting that nearly two thirds of methane is produced from the methyl group of acetic acid ferry 1992 as a result the competition between acetogens and methanogens is critical in inducing vfa accumulation overall methanogens are more sensitive compared to acetogens to changes in environmental conditions which makes the acidogenic fermentation more engineering practicable generally temperature ph and hrt have strong effects on the microbial activity where acetogens are more adaptive to a broad range than methanogens thermophilic fermentation 55 c led to 10 fold more accumulation of vfas compared to mesophilic fermentation 35 c of the municipal dewatered sludge hao and wang 2015 the alkaline conditions ph 9 0 are regarded as the optimum for vfa production yuan et al 2006 yuan et al 2011 found that lack of mixing drastically reduced the amount of vfa generated of waste activated sludge particularly at low temperatures of 4 c generally short hrt facilitate the vfa production but long hrt is needed for complete sludge hydrolysis lv et al 2022 vfa recovery and dewaterability of fermented primary sludges were reported to be both improved at relatively long srts 4 d bahreini et al 2020a overall the extreme environments could favor the survival and growth of acetogens over methanogens but the effects of different conditions on both hydrolysis and methanogenesis process should be comprehensively leveraged 3 impacts of vfa on metabolism of nitrogen microorganisms the most commonly used biological nitrogen removal for wastewater is the nitrification denitrification process which is energy intensive and needs the external carbon source supplement with the discovery of the anammox bacteria in late 1990s the new paradigm in wastewater treatment is shifting to shorten the nitrogen removal pathway to save the aeration energy and chemical agent the promising short cut nitrogen removal process mainly includes nitritation denitritation partial nitritation anammox pn a partial denitrification anammox pdn a fig 3 winkler and straka 2019 microbiologically the realization of short cut nitrogen removal requires the accurate control and synergistic interaction of nitrifiers denitrifiers and anammox bacteria moreover sludge fermentation products could be an alternating internal carbon for microbial growth which is promising to achieve the sludge reduction and resource recovery herein the impacts of fermentative vfas on the metabolism of nitrogen microorganisms are detailly reviewed to highlight the feasibility of utilizing sludge fermentation to improve the bnr system 3 1 nitrifying bacteria 3 1 1 ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob catalyze the first step of nitrification by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite five genera of aob belonging to the phylum proteobacteria have been cultured including nitrosomonas nitrosococcus nitrosospira nitrosovibrio and nitrosolobus among these nitrosomonas is the most commonly detected aob in wastewater treatment plants al ajeel et al 2022 purkhold et al 2000 aob are chemolithoautotrophs which utilize co2 as the carbon source and inorganic nitrogen compounds nh4 as the energy source however the chemoorganotrophic growth of nitrosomonas europaea was also observed under anoxic conditions in the presence of acetate pyruvate and lactate and had the genome encoding enzymes required for catabolism of these organic compounds schmidt 2009 pure culture study proved that acetate up to 0 1 m showed no inhibition on ammonia oxidation for n europaea hooper and terry 1973 3 1 2 nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob perform the second step of nitrification by oxidizing nitrite to nitrate nob are taxonomically diverse and belong to seven genera in four different phyla proteobacteria nitrospirae nitrospinae and chloroflexi daims et al 2016 among all known nob the genus nitrospira appears to be most widespread in wastewater treatment plants with a higher nitrite affinity than nitrobacter blackburne et al 2007 daims et al 2001 nitrospira have a species level diversity and metabolic versatility in addition to catalyze aerobic nitrite oxidation nitrospira moscoviensis can also grew aerobically on formate and reduce nitrate anoxically koch et al 2015 but for formic acid at 30 mm can cause severe inhibition on nob activity wang et al 2020 however the fluorescence in situ hybridization microautoradiography fish mar analyses proved that the nitrospira like bacteria in activated sludge cannot take up acetate propionate and butyrate daims et al 2001 several studies have shown that high concentrations of vfa 1200 5000 mg l can inhibit the nob activity by 24 100 rather than aob which have a higher tolerance to vfa delgado et al 2004 eilersen et al 1994 oguz et al 2006 takai et al 1997 wang et al 2020 these findings suggest that vfa may facilitate the out selection of nob and potentially promote the partial nitrification process although further verification is needed in continuous bioreactor studies 3 1 3 complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox the recently discovered complete ammonia oxidizing bacteria comammox are capable of completing nitrification from ammonia to nitrate by single organisms daims et al 2015 van kessel et al 2015 these organisms belong to the genus nitrospira and were found ubiquitously in activated sludge of wwtps contributing to the nitrification process annavajhala et al 2018 wang et al 2018 yang et al 2020a although the existence of comammox bacteria could be detected using high precision qpcr techniques combined with genome analyses the functional contribution to ammonia oxidation and niche differentiation with other nitrifying bacteria in wastewater engineering still remains unclear metagenome analyses indicated that comammox clade b carry an acetate permease gene actp palomo et al 2018 two recovered draft genomes of comammox bacteria from the bioreactors added with fermentation liquid possessed with the complete acetate and propionate utilization functional genes but not for butyrate adding 50 250 mg cod l can stimulate the ammonia oxidation rate and transcription of comammox amoa genes xu et al 2022 however the inhibitory effect of vfa on comammox bacteria has not been reported so far 3 2 denitrifying bacteria denitrification is a major step to complete the global nitrogen cycle via the reduction of nitrate to nitrite nitric oxide nitrous oxide until the final product nitrogen gas denitrifying bacteria have a high degree of taxonomic diversity from different phyla over 50 genera and 125 species have been identified knowles 1982 zumft 1992 denitrifiers exhibited a variety of phenotypic traits which could be caused by functional genes deficiency or environmental stress zhang et al 2020 in wastewater engineering system a mix of distinct phenotypic denitrifying communities coexisted forming the complex microbial metabolic networks lu et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 denitrifiers could use a variety of organics among them acetate was considered to be the most efficient substrate than methanol and ethanol adav et al 2010 osaka et al 2008 peng et al 2007 moreover acetate was found to be an ideal carbon source to maximize the nitrite accumulation with low c n ratio to achieve the partial denitrification which can combine with the downstream anammox to facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment du et al 2016 le et al 2019 li et al 2018a oh and silverstein 1999 both the direct utilization of acetate and the indirect use of endogenous carbon storage have been shown to be effective in achieving partial denitrification process making it become a promising alternative to partial nitrification especially for the low strength municipal wastewaters cao et al 2022 du et al 2019 ji et al 2020a however higher concentrations of vfa e g propionic isobutyric n valeric isovaleric and caproic could cause inhibition with nitrate reduction being more inhibited than nitrite reduction eilersen et al 1995 which does not facilitate the short cut nitrogen removal via partial denitrification 3 3 anammox bacteria anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria anammox are capable of oxidizing ammonium with nitrite as electron acceptor kuenen 2008 since its discovery anammox is assumed as the promising biological nitrogen removal process in wastewater treatment that can efficiently save the carbon source and energy supply kartal et al 2010 anammox bacteria belong to the phylum planctomycetes including six candidatus genera brocadia kuenenia jettenia scalindua anammoxoglobus and anammoximicrobium zhang and okabe 2020 although anammox bacteria are thought to be chemolithotrophs some anammox species were found to be able to oxidize vfa coupled with dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium kartal et al 2007 for example candidatus brocadia fulgida could oxidize acetate at a rate three times higher than candidatus kuenenia stuttgartiensis while candidatus anammoxoglobus propionicus showed a much higher 2 5 times oxidation rates to propionate than other species kartal et al 2008 candidatus jettenia caeni j caeni were highly enriched 10 in the organotrophic reactor fed with acetate compared to the autotrophic reactor yin et al 2021 compared to j caeni candidatus brocadia sinica were more metabolically competitive with acetate addition based on metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analyses feng et al 2019 the uptake of acetate and propionate by jettenia asiatica was identified by a nanometer scale secondary ion mass spectrometer nanosims tao et al 2019 the organotrophic anammox bacteria were reported to outcompete heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria treating the low c n 0 5 g cod g n from a sludge digester winkler et al 2012 however the presence of high concentration of simple organics may facilitate the rapid proliferation of heterotrophic denitrifiers which can compete with anammox bacteria for nitrite ultimately leading to a deterioration in anammox performance the short term batch tests showed that the higher concentration of acetate 240 mg l and propionate 400 mg l could decrease the ammonium removal rate by 30 huang et al 2014 long term continuous reactor tests demonstrated that low concentrations of acetic acid 30 mg l and propionic acid 21 mg l increased the nitrogen removal rate while the anammox collapsed when the dosing concentrations reached 270 mg l and 191 mg l respectively peng et al 2022 4 engineering practice on reutilizing waste activated sludge to achieve short cut nitrogen removal processes wastewater treatment plants wwtps produce large amounts of waste activated sludge was daily 0 60 0 80 kg ss kg cod in the activated sludge process and has a cost ranging from 20 to 60 of the total operation costs andreoli et al 2007 as previously described the organic fractions 0 75 0 80 of the activated sludge could be robustly converted into the short chain volatile fatty acids vfas by acidogenic and acetogenic organisms rather than further to the methane by methanogenic organisms yuan et al 2019 the fermentative vfas as a potential renewable and easily biodegradable carbon source can be reutilized to improve the biological nutrient removal performance and reduce sludge production to pursue the cost efficient short cut nitrogen removal process via partial nitrification anammox pn a or partial denitrification anammox pd a in wastewater treatment fig 3 zhang et al 2019 the lab and pilot scale engineering practices have been successfully made on integrating the addition of was fermentation products to achieve the efficient nitrogen removal and the different configurations applied are summarized in fig 4 overall utilizing the sludge fermentation could achieve the excellent and efficient short cut nitrogen removal tn effluent 10 mg n l nre 90 with no external chemical carbon dosing and the detailed performance parameters are listed in table 1 4 1 a2o type the anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o and its modified type is the most common wastewater treatment method applied in biological nutrient removal systems upgrading the existing a2o like process by replacing the external carbon source with the fermentation products could both improve the nitrogen removal performance and achieve sludge reduction as shown in fig 3a four strategies have been applied to utilize the internal carbon of was to achieve the short cut nitrogen removal first by adding was to the anaerobic units to induce the in situ sludge fermentation to produce vfas that can flow into the downstream anoxic units to enhance the nitrogen removal wang et al 2019b performed a full scale testing by adjusting the anaerobic units of conventional a2o process as side stream reactors and diverting the return activated sludge in to promote fermentation the results showed that both denitrification and ebpr performance could be enhanced by 20 30 second by adding the ex situ sludge fermentation liquid directly to the anoxic unit to enhance the denitrification process yang et al 2020b and chen et al 2022 agreed that both the pn and pdn could be enhanced in the aerobic and anoxic units respectively by adding the sludge fermentation products into the lab scale continuous flow reactors pilot scale testing was also conducted using primary sludge fermentate as carbon source to achieve the mainstream partial denitrification anammox pd a and the extremely low tin effluent limits 5 mg n l could be reached ali et al 2021 ladipo obasa et al 2022 third by installing sidestream fermenter using part of the recycled ras to supplement the produced vfas to the anoxic units he et al 2022 applied the sidestream sludge fermentation to treat the real sewage and highly improved the anammox contribution via nitrite accumulation fourth by enlarging the anoxic volume or adding biocarrier to increase the sludge retention time to enhance the in situ sludge fermentation liu et al 2022 achieved the in situ fermentation to promote the pd a process in an integrated anoxic oxic a o reactors by adding carries and the enlarge ratio of anoxic zones fan et al 2022b achieved the excellent performance of partial nitrification and enhanced biological phosphorus removal using the prolonged anaerobic phase in the continuous flow system 4 2 sbr type the sequencing batch reactor sbr is a fill and draw activated sludge system for wastewater treatment which is flexible to adjust the number of cycles per day and the length of each phase in one cycle to optimize the process operation the sludge fermentation could be utilized either by adding the was directly to the reactor or by injecting the pre fermented liquid products into the anoxic phase of the reactor fig 3b by feeding the fresh was via in situ fermentation to supply the organic source the excellent nitrogen removal efficiency 90 could be achieved by pn and pdn in sbr with efficient sludge reduction 21 6 48 1 fan et al 2022a guo et al 2016 as for the external fermentation both the fermentative products and the separated liquid were applied to enhance the biological nutrient removal system the fermentation products were reported to be efficient for inhibiting nob over aob which can induce the partial nitrification to achieve the short cut removal for low strength municipal wastewater liu et al 2021a 2017 adding the sludge fermentation liquid instead of the external carbon is the most direct way to enhance the denitrification process especially triggered the partial denitrification process jiang et al 2021 liu et al 2021b and also can select the pha storing biomass for pha recovery basset et al 2016 in addition to the municipal wastewater the sludge fermentation could also be integrated in treating the landfill leachate by a series of sbrs via supplying the external fermentation liquid to induce pd qiu et al 2022 or coupling in situ fermentation and denitrification with the superior nitrogen removal efficiency 98 zhang et al 2021b 2022 fig 3c 4 3 uasb type the upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb is a widely used anaerobic system for the industrial wastewaters with high organic loading rates the synergistic partial denitrification anammox and in situ fermentation process was achieved in an uasb reactor for the domestic and nitrate containing wastewater c n 1 6 the nitrogen removal efficiency reached 93 1 with dominated anammox contribution of 95 6 ji et al 2020b the uasb type reactor was also successfully demonstrated both at lab and pilot scale downstream the pn reactor to achieve the simultaneous anammox denitrification and sludge fermentation for municipal wastewaters with 80 nitrogen removal efficiency and 40 sludge reduction efficiency wang et al 2019a 2022 5 conclusions and future perspectives this review comprehensively discusses vfa recovery strategies from both wastewater and waste sludge fermentation and their potential to facilitate advanced short cut biological nitrogen removal it was suggested that instead of high entropy methane the influent carbon of municipal wastewater could be maximally captured at the a stage of the sustainable a b process and redirected to produce vfa via sludge fermentation to enhance vfa production various methods have been applied to accelerate sludge hydrolysis and regulate competition between acetogens and methanogens although functional nitrogen cycling bacteria aob nob anammox comammox are recognized as autotrophic microbes they can metabolize the organic vfas fermentative vfas can promote preferable partial nitrification or partial denitrification to facilitate mainstream short cut nitrogen removal both lab and pilot scale engineering practices have demonstrated the feasibility of integrating sludge fermentation into biological nitrogen removal for municipal wastewater based on these findings future perspectives are suggested as follows 1 mainstream vs sidestream mainstream wastewater and sidestream sludge are typically treated separately however by incorporating sludge hydrolysis and fermentation through a sidestream configuration it is possible to recover the internal carbon source such as vfas instead of relying on the external source to achieve this it is crucial to optimize the amount and composition of fermentative vfas carefully examine the impact of unwanted byproducts released during the sludge fermentation process and design the exchange route between mainstream and sidestream to minimize any loading shock on the wastewater treatment and to enhance the overall efficiency and sustainability 2 nitrogen vs phosphorus biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal have long been considered to be in conflict with each other due to the different working conditions required by the microorganisms involved however recent research has proposed sidestream fermentation configuration as a promising engineering solution for selecting fermentative paos and achieving more stable and efficient p removal additionally high concentrations of vfa could lead to selective inhibition of nob over aob thus promoting partial nitrification moreover acetate has been recognized as an effective carbon source for achieving partial denitrification sidestream configurations have also been suggested to maintain the mainstream anammox therefore further exploration is needed to determine the feasibility of integrating sidestream sludge fermentation for simultaneous biological nitrogen and phosphorus removal 3 autotrophs vs heterotrophs heterotrophs typically have a competitive advantage over autotrophs but autotrophic nitrogen removal process is preferred in wastewater treatment due to lower carbon footprint introducing sludge fermentation to produce excess vfas could shift the balance in favor of heterotrophic bacteria however this may be mitigated by selecting specific microorganisms capable of storing internal carbon polymers to minimize the impact of bulk carbon on autotrophs more comprehensive microbiological studies using metagenomics techniques are needed to understand the interaction and competition between autotrophs and heterotrophs with

14776,polyethylene pe pipes have been widely used in drinking water distribution systems across the world in many cases chlorine dioxide clo2 is used to maintain a residual disinfectant concentration in potable water practical experiences have shown that the lifetime of pe pipes is significantly reduced due to exposure to drinking water with clo2 recently many companies have proposed new pe pipes with a modified formulation which are more resistant to chlorine dioxide however a standardized test method for evaluating the long term performances of pe pipes is still missing this literature review was performed to provide a description of chlorine dioxide uses and degradation mechanisms of polyethylene pipes in real water distribution systems current accelerated aging methods to evaluate long term performances of pe pipes exposed to clo2 are described and discussed along with the common technics used to characterize the specimens accelerate aging methods can be distinguished in immersion aging tests and pressurized pipe loop tests wide ranges of operational conditions chlorine dioxide concentration water pressure water temperature etc are applied resulting in a great variety of results it was concluded that pressurized looping tests applying semi realistic operational conditions could better replicate the aging mechanisms occurring in service despite this the acceleration and the evaluation of the long term performance are still difficult to determine precisely further experimentation is needed to correlate chemical mechanical characterization parameters of pe pipes

technical notes sdr standard dimension ratio dn diameter nominal bs base stabilization pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride 1 introduction in the last decade the use of chlorine dioxide for secondary disinfection to maintain a residual in the water distribution systems has been widespread in north america and in europe jana laboratories inc 2010a clo2 is preferred to other disinfectants such as free chlorine from sodium hypochlorite calcium hypochlorite or gaseous chlorine and chloramine since it has a strong oxidation potential and is able to remove viruses and pathogens that are resistant to chlorination moreover chlorine dioxide reacts with the organic matter without forming chlorinate organic compounds such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms which are usually generated by chlorination usepa 2011 although clo2 residual can persist in distribution systems the low boiling point 11 c and the high reactivity lead to the rapid dissipation of its residual chlorine dioxide reacts with organic and inorganic substances forming chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 anions despite the chemical speciation of clo2 depends on several factors such as dosage temperature ph and water quality chlorine dioxide is generally converted into clo2 and clo3 for 68 and 9 respectively sorlini et al 2016 moreover in the case clo2 is used together with other disinfectants such as ozone the formation of chlorate can be even more relevant usepa 2011 chlorite and chlorate are oxidizing substances and potentially harmful to human health and the world health organization has recommended for both ions a limit in water distribution systems of 0 7 mg l world health organization 2011 in europe typical residual concentration of chlorine dioxide may range from less than 0 05 mg l to around 0 25 0 30 mg l the desired residual concentration of chlorine dioxide in water distribution systems may depend on either the legislative limit for clo2 or legislative limits for by products clo2 and clo3 the maximum allowed concentration of clo2 in tap water is 0 8 mg l in the usa 0 25 mg l in belgium and 0 15 in switzerland jana laboratories inc 2010a in italy the recommended residual concentration of disinfectant in the water distribution systems is about 0 2 mg l decreto legislativo n 31 2001 2001 other countries do not have standard limits for chlorine dioxide concentration in water but generally only for the by products chlorite and or chlorate in december 2020 the european parliament and council approved the new framework directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 in annex i of the directive a concentration limit of 0 7 mg l was set in drinking water for both chlorite and chlorate ions clo2 is usually employed in medium and large size drinking water treatment plants due to the high costs of production and management earth tech canada inc 2005 chlorine dioxide is a gas that is highly soluble in water 70 g l at 20 c and 1 atm it cannot be stored or transported in a gaseous state due to the high risk of explosion but it must be generated in site the easier and safer method for the production of chlorine dioxide solution is through the reaction of sodium chlorite with hydrochloric acid usepa 2011 chlorine dioxide is more aggressive towards plastic pipes including polyethylene pe than other chlorine based disinfectants it has been observed in water distribution systems that pe pipes may prematurely undergo failure when they are exposed to chlorine dioxide the possible explanations could be that clo2 is a dissolved gas which diffuses more rapidly into the polymer in respect to other disinfectants accelerating the degradation reactions vertova et al 2019 to low down the reaction of clo2 with pe material hindered phenols antioxidants are usually added to pe during pipe manufacturing however some studies have hypothesized that reaction of chlorine dioxide with antioxidants can lead to the production of reactive chlorine species which may react even more rapidly than clo2 with pe nullifying the desired delay of polymer degradation yu et al 2011 although pe pipes with new formulations of resins and additives which are resistant to chlorine dioxide have been produced by several companies there is not a unique and standard method to test and evaluate the performances of these materials particularly several methods have been proposed by researchers to evaluate the aging of polyethylene pipes subjected to chlorine dioxide exposure however these methods involve very different test conditions including temperature pressure clo2 concentration etc hence outputs and results are difficult to compare and all these methods present advantages and limitations for an accurate evaluation of the clo2 effect on pe pipes degradation particularly the main issue with these tests is reproducing the aging phenomena occurring in drinking network pipes in experimental trials that are relatively short in time van der stok et al 2018 this literature review was carried out to critically describe assess and compare all the proposed accelerated aging methods that have been used to evaluate the performances of pe pipes exposed to clo2 first the chemistry of chlorine dioxide and the long term aging mechanisms of polyethylene pipes in drinking water distribution systems are discussed then all the existing aging methods and characterization techniques to evaluate the performance of pe pipes in contact with chlorine dioxide are critically discussed and compared 2 chemistry of chlorine dioxide in water distribution networks 2 1 dispropation of chlorine dioxide in drinking water the aging studies of pe exposed to chlorine dioxide can be affected by the chemical transformations of this oxidant during the experimental tests which also depend on the conditions used in the test and on the presence of other dissolved substances in water chlorine dioxide behaves as selective oxidant towards rich electron moieties such as amines anilines phenols and unsaturated hydrocarbons and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with elevated efficiency when chlorine dioxide reacts with reductant substrates it is mainly converted in chlorite anion as represented in reaction 1 xu et al 2022 lee et al 2004 1 clo2 e clo2 the reaction rate constants of clo2 with inorganic substances were reported by hoignè and bader 1994 it exhibits fast reaction rate with iodide cyanide nitrite sulphite iron ii and manganese ii ions while it reacts slowly with ammonia or bromide anion therefore reaction of clo2 with dissolved organic carbon doc can generate transient free available chlorine fac that can oxidize br to free bromine which in turn can generate toxic brominate organic substances li et al 2022 the complete reactivity of chlorine dioxide towards the substances dissolved in real water matrices is very complex and strongly depends on the kind of organic material on the eventual pre treatment of water with other oxidants such as chlorine ozone persulphate and on the exposure to uv and visible light an in depth analysis of the chemistry of clo2 in water disinfection and decontamination has been recently reviewed by xu et al 2022 another concern to be considered is that clo2 is not available as a pure gas but rather as a mixture of clo2 containing various contaminants gan et al 2020 clo2 can be produced by different methods for example through oxidation of chlorites qi et al 2020 reduction of chlorates monteiro et al 2021 or using electrolytic technologies bergmann and koparal 2005 generally chlorine dioxide is easily produced in situ by reaction of clo2 and clo3 in the presence of acids or other oxidants such as chlorine hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide ayyildiz et al 2009 despite the new production technologies have considerably reduced the presence of contaminants in the generated gas it is inevitable that the use of chlorine dioxide introduces little amounts of other chlorine based oxidants in water mainly chlorite which can influence the rate and the pathways of the occurring oxidation reactions in the tested water matrix xu et al 2022 the main way of degradation of chlorine dioxide in water takes place by disproportionation giving chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and chloride cl anions with yields that depends on many factors including chlorine dioxide dosage ph temperature and presence of reactive organic substrates lee et al 2004 in alkaline solution chlorine dioxide is disproportionated through a one step process 2 while at low ph conditions and in the presence of a reductant substrate the conversion involves two steps in which the former is the reduction of chlorine dioxide to chlorous acid hclo2 that spontaneously decompose into chlorine dioxide chlorate and chloride ions reactions 3 and 4 the global rection that gives chlorate and chloride from clo2 is described by eq 5 lee et al 2004 2 2clo2 2oh clo2 clo3 h2o 3 clo2 h e hclo2 4 4hclo2 2clo2 clo3 cl 2h h2o 5 2clo2 2h 4e clo3 cl h2o the formation of chlorite and chlorate anions during the treatment of water with chlorine dioxide is a crucial concern because both chlorite and chlorate have oxidant properties indeed chlorite generated from clo2 may be reduced to chloride ions in the presence of several organic or inorganic substrates reaction 6 gan et al 2020 6 clo2 4h 4e cl 2h2o as mentioned above the formation of clo2 and clo3 depends on chlorine dioxide dosage ph temperature water quality and other variables lee et al 2004 investigated the consumption of chlorine dioxide and its speciation in drinking water reporting data on disinfectant residual chlorite and chlorate concentration after 120 min of exposure under different environmental and operational conditions results of this research are summarized in table 1 in the study of lee et al 2004 it was observed that the presence of oxidable substrates such as organic compounds tends to increase the conversion of chlorine dioxide to chlorite while it does not influence significantly the formation of chlorate in addition when the initial concentration of clo2 is higher than 1 mg l the speciation of chlorate can raise up to 15 on the contrary with the increase of temperature is favoured the transformation of chlorine dioxide in chlorite and at 30 c the formation of chlorate is reported to be null finally acid ph favours the formation of clo3 and basic ph enhances the production of chlorite lee et al 2004 although chlorite and chlorate have lower oxidization potentials than chlorine dioxide and there are no findings in the literature about their effects on pe pipes these by products may in some way contribute to pipe aging therefore their concentrations in accelerated aging tests should be monitored and reported 2 2 diffusion of chlorine dioxide and its by product in drinking water distribution networks as mentioned in the previous paragraph the diffusion and the decay rate of chlorine dioxide which lead to the formation of chlorite and chlorate are directly related to the presence of natural organic matter ph and temperature of the drinking water ammar et al 2014 several studies have investigated the decay of chlorine dioxide during disinfection while only few articles have tackled the diffusion of chlorine dioxide in distribution networks sorlini et al 2016 carried out batch experiments at laboratory scale to determine reaction kinetics for modeling chlorine dioxide chlorite and chlorate propagation in a drinking water distribution system the decay rate of chlorine dioxide in drinking water bulk phase was described through a first order reaction in exponential form which includes the initial concentration of clo2 at the inlet of the network c0 contact time t and the bulk coefficient kb the kb was determined by batch tests and was assumed equal to 0 288 d 1 the first order decay equation for clo2 was described as follow 7 c c 0 e k b t reaction kinetics of zero order were used to describe the formation of chlorite and chlorate in the bulk phase taking into account the initial concentration of clo2 and clo3 c0 contact time t and the relative bulk coefficient which can be obtained from batch tests 0 576 mg l d and 0 101 mg l d for clo2 and clo3 respectively hence the zero order decay equation for clo2 and clo3 can be defined as follow 8 c c 0 k b t this study showed those kinetic reactions of clo2 clo2 and clo3 determined through batch experiments can be used to describe the diffusion of these oxidants in the distribution systems however authors pointed out that observed differences between some of the measured and modelled concentrations were probably related to the decay of these oxidants due to contact with the pipe wall this last phenomenon is called wall decay ammar et al 2014 carried out batch experiments with chlorine dioxide in desalinated water at different disinfectant concentrations 0 6 mg l 1 4 mg l and water temperatures 20 c 45 c the results showed that the diffusion of chlorine dioxide in the bulk phase follows a first order decay model for all the dosages with a kb that can be expressed as function of water temperature t 9 k b 0 8147 e 0 0415 t hence the bulk decay coefficient ranges from 1 8 d 1 for 20 c to 5 d 1 for 45 c these data can be considered and compared with ones resulted from the accelerated tests research is still required for an accurate determination of the wall decay of chlorine dioxide chlorite and chlorate in drinking water distribution systems as mentioned above the formation and diffusion of chlorite and chlorate is the main long term safety problem related to the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water networks world health organization 2011 indeed a population based case control study in northern italy showed higher risk to have new borns with renal defects abdominal wall defects and cleft palate from women exposed to chlorite concentrations in drinking water greater than 0 7 mg l on the other side women exposed to chlorate level 0 2 mg l have higher risk to generate new borns with obstructive urinary defects cleft palate and spina bifida righi et al 2012 the new european drinking water directive did set concentration limit of 0 7 mg l for chlorite and chlorate in water distribution systems using chlorine dioxide furthermore it requires to water managers the implementation of a water safety plans wsp to assure water safety for humans particularly a health risk assessment should be accomplished considering all the elements of the drinking water supply chain including catchment area abstraction treatment and storage systems and infrastructures for distribution to the point of compliance the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 overall the development of site specific kinetic models for chlorite and chlorate formation in drinking water distribution systems is highly recommended to identify and mitigate the human health risks associated with the use of chlorine dioxide as disinfectant although there is no evidence about the formation of by products closely related to the degradation of pe pipes exposed to clo2 some articles reported that disinfectants residues in drinking water and in contact with plastic pipes may lead to the formation of microplastics mps zhang et al 2022 nirmala et al 2023 zhang et al 2022 reported that ozone exposed pe pipes after 20 h of aging may release from 337 to 656 mp l surface crack and fragmentation are considered possible reasons for mps generation hence further research is required to study the possible release of mps from pe pipes due to the contact with clo2 or other disinfectants 3 polyethylene pipes aging in water distribution systems 3 1 long term aging mechanisms of polyethylene pipes the mechanisms involved in the aging of pe pipes are fundamental aspects to deepen for the assessment of long term performances of pipes in the water distribution system for plastic pipes polyethylene etc the performance envelope is usually defined in terms of the stress versus time plot as shown in fig 1 it is used to delimit the lifetime of the pipe under stressed conditions the performance envelope involves three stages of failure in function of the aging mechanisms astm international 2015 stage i ductile mechanical failure this regime involves a long term visco elastic creep where the pipe failure is characterized by a local deformation of the material that is visible with the unaided eye stage ii brittle mechanical failure the pipe failure is purely brittle and is the result of a single crack from the inside toward the outside of the pipe without any material deformations stage iii mechanical chemical failure in this regime the failure occurs at lower hoop stress due to the presence of oxidative condition and is defined by the embrittlement of the inner wall of the pipe the observed mechanisms for stage i and stage ii are strictly mechanical and affected mainly by the applied temperature and stress on the pipe however the ductile failure mode in stage i is not commonly observed in the field since the applied stress to pe pipes in water distribution systems are way below its yield stress jana laboratories inc 2010b the methodologies for the determination of performance of pipes in stage i and stage ii are well defined by standard tests as described below astm d2837 standard test method for obtaining hydrostatic design basis for thermoplastic pipe materials or pressure design basis for thermoplastic pipe products is used to assess the viscoelastic creep stage i jana laboratories inc 2010b this method can be used for determining either the hydrostatic design basis hdb or pressure design basis pdb the procedure involves the assessment of stress failure time plots of pe pipes under a selected temperature and environment i e liquid air or gaseous bath the hdb is determined using the long term hydrostatic strength lhts of the pipe that is the expected tensile stress on the pipe circumference leading to the pipe failure at 100 000 h when it is applied continuously while the pdb is obtained by measuring the long term hydrostatic pressure strength lthsp which is the expected internal pressure that led to the pipe failure at 100 000 h if it is applied continuously the test is accomplished using a device capable to keep a constant internal water pressure on the specimen at fixed temperature both lhts and lthsp are measured from the stress versus time to failure curve for a testing period of not less than 10 000 h moreover the hydrostatic strength of pe pipes at 50 years may be obtained by extrapolating the data from the stress versus time to failure curves astm international 2013 the performances of stage ii are determined according to the astm f1473 standard test method for notch tensile test to measure the resistance to slow crack growth of polyethylene pipes and resins jana laboratories inc 2010b astm f1473 method is used for the measurement of slow crack growth i e the slow extension of the crack with time resistance of pe pipes under accelerated conditions it involves the notching of the specimen before applying constant pressure and temperature conditions the specimens are made from a compression molded plaque with dimensions of 50 mm x 25 mm x 10 mm subsequently a main notch and two side notched are produced on the specimen with a razor blade the depth of the notches is function of the specimen thickness the test is usually performed at 80 c and 2 4 mpa as hoop stress the trials is carried out until the specimen undergoes failure resulting in the determination of the time to failure astm international 2001 on the other side the long term mechanisms associated with stage iii are not fully understood they are still subjects of studies and research and standardized tests for their determination are not available particularly the characterization of stage iii aging mechanism is considered a key area for continuing enhancement of the long term performance of pe piping materials in potable water applications briefly it is supposed that the mechanical chemical failure of pipes in stage iii involves the antioxidant depletion on the pipe surface oxidation of the polymer initiation of microcrack in the oxidated material and crack propagation through the pipe wall as occurs for the slow crack growth scg in stage ii until failure chung et al 2004 jana laboratories inc 2010b hence stage iii aging is not only dependent upon temperature stress and pipe material but also on the oxidative aggressiveness of the transport fluid jana laboratories inc 2010b to date two different theories have been proposed to explain the oxidation mechanisms of pe pipes by chlorine dioxide colin et al 2009 suggested that radical chain reactions that cause polymer degradation are directly initiated by chlorine dioxide which causes the hydrogen abstraction from the polyethylene after the depletion of the phenolic antioxidants the pe is directly attacked by clo2 indeed this latter process is considered to be 1500 times slower than the reaction between chlorine dioxide and hindered phenols oxidants on the contrary yu et al 2011 reported that clo2 may not be able to abstract a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon hence another oxidation mechanism was proposed where the reaction between chlorine dioxide and hindered phenolic antioxidants leads to the formation of the hydrogen abstracting radical clo and the subsequent polymer degradation is an immediate surface reaction according to this theory the reaction of chlorine dioxide with phenolic antioxidants is the reason of polymer degradation both suggested theories have not been confirmed and the chemistry that lead to polymer degradation is not fully understood however authors in literature tend to prefer the theory proposed by colin et al 2009 to explain their experimental results jana laboratories inc 2010b kim et al 2018 in accordance with the theory of colin et al 2009 the pe pipe failure in water distribution systems generally involves an initial antioxidant depletion with the following formation and propagation of cracks stage iii therefore the time to failure tf for polyethylene pipes can be defined as jana laboratories inc 2010b 10 t f t s d t i t p where tsd is the time for antioxidant depletion ti is the time needed for polymer oxidation until crack initiation and tp is the time for crack propagation until the pipe failure the three phases are inversely proportional to the temperature which accelerate the aging mechanisms the time for antioxidant depletion depends mainly on the kind of antioxidant mixed with the polymer and on the type of disinfectant used which induces the oxidative state the time for crack initiation is function of the strength of the oxidizing agent and of the applied stress to the pipe as the oxidation of the polymeric material occurs the toughness of the inner wall decreases leading to the crack initiation at a given stress then such stress continuously applied to the pipe affects directly the time needed for crack propagation tp the time to failure decreases as the hoop stress rises jana laboratories inc 2010b 3 2 factors causing pipe failure in water distribution networks the principal aging parameters of pe pipes in water distribution systems using chlorine dioxide are described and assessed in this paragraph for a better understanding of their influences on the degradation mechanisms that can be observed under realistic pipe service conditions among these parameters chlorine dioxide concentration water pressure and temperature are directly related to the mechanical chemical failure described previously as stage iii however other features such as water ph pipe size and pipe installation can also influence the time to failure of pe pipes the chlorine dioxide concentration in water directly affects the aging mechanisms of pe pipes the oxidative aggressiveness of water expressed in terms of oxidative reduction potential orp is directly proportional to the concentration of clo2 in water higher orp tends to decrease the lifetime of pe pipes plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 colin et al 2009 stated that the lifetime of pe pipes where water is subjected to clo2 disinfection under real operative conditions clo2 0 15 ppm t 15 c hoop stress of few mpa may be reduced to 10 years instead of the 50 years expected no studies are available in literature regarding the oxidation effects of the by products of clo2 i e clo2 and clo3 on pe pipes degradation however as previously mentioned during disinfection chlorine dioxide is generally converted into clo2 and clo3 for 68 and 9 respectively sorlini et al 2016 in addition the oxidation potential of chlorite and chlorate are typically lower than the oxidation potential of chlorine dioxide this evidence suggests that oxidation strengths of clo2 and clo3 in drinking water distribution system are significantly lower than the oxidation strength of chlorine dioxide oxidation is a thermally activated process as well as the crack initiation and propagation hence the chemical mechanical aging is a thermally activated process with the rate of aging increasing with the increasing of the temperature particularly it was reported that at a given water quality and stress the relative aging rate at an average water temperature of 4 c is approximately 5 to 20 times slower than that at 20 c jana laboratories inc 2010b overall annual ground and surface water temperatures range from 3 c to 29 c with an average around 15 c awwa 1996 under typical water temperatures 20 c the aging mechanism occurs at relatively slow rates on the contrary when the water temperature in the water distribution system is greater than 20 c the chlorine dioxide is much more aggressive towards pe pipes and the aging mechanism can be significantly accelerated plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 particularly high temperature boosts the degradation of polymeric material resulting in an increase of the crystallinity and the embrittlement of the pe pipe plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 the operating pressure in water distribution systems applies hoop stress on the circumference of the pipe which directly aids the crack propagation particularly systems with high operating pressure 6 bar have a higher risk of failure than those at low operating pressure 2 5 3 bar it has been reported that if the internal pressure of the pipe increases from 2 5 bar to 5 5 bar the aging mechanism increases approximately from 5 to 10 times jana laboratories inc 2010b the concentration of chlorine dioxide and operating pressure are the main parameters found in literature which affect the chemical mechanical aging stage iii of pe pipes in service the ph of water may also have an impact on the chemical oxidation of pipe by clo2 however little research has focused on this effect until now van der stok et al 2018 it is important to note that the specific orp ph clo2 relationship is dependent on specific water quality and its constituents which may all contribute to determine the overall oxidative strength of the water the usepa guidelines for potable water entering the distribution system are for a ph range of 6 5 to 8 5 awwa 1996 jana laboratories inc 2010b and the average values for drinking water in distribution systems are ph of 7 7 hence expected variations of ph in real application are unlikely to significantly impact on disinfected water oxidative strength the pipe size and thickness affect the hoop stress applied to the pipe considering the same pipe size and identical operating pressure conditions thin pipes are subjected to higher hoop stress than thick pipes jana laboratories inc 2010b moreover the size of the pipe i e diameter of the pipe is usually proportional to the pipe thickness and when the crack is initiated it will take more time for propagation in thick pipes compared to thin pipes plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 hence small and thin pipes are more susceptible to damage than big and thick pipes since they can offer lower resistance to the applied operating pressure plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 furthermore the installation conditions affect the lifetime of the pe pipes particularly shallow installation and or a lack of a proper underlying layer significantly increase the hop stress state of the pipe resulting in one of the most observed causes of pipe failure in distribution networks generally pipes with greater diameters are installed with more accuracy than those with smaller diameters plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 a further factor that may influence pipes failure during clo2 disinfection is the water age which is the time that a particle of water spends in the water distribution system however there is no evidence reported in the literature about the relationship between the water age in the distribution system and the aging of the pe pipe nevertheless the water age influences the hydrodynamics of the fluid within the pipe and hence the contact between the pipe surface and the chlorine dioxide solution in a realistic situation lower water velocities inside the distribution systems lead to pipes with higher water ages which may result in an increased contact of pipe surface with clo2 in are reassumed the effects on the aging mechanisms of pe pipes with the relative degree of influence of the different parameters that characterize the operation conditions of pipes in drinking water distribution systems 4 accelerated aging tests and methods many companies and research centers have developed their own accelerated aging methods of pe pipes in presence of chlorine dioxide studies have applied very different experimental conditions during testing by using very different chlorine dioxide concentration in water oxidant exposure time pressure within the pipes temperature of the water in order to accelerate the aging of a pe specimen costa et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 the following techno scientific literature analysis assesses and describes the existing aging tests for pe pipes exposed to clo2 which have been developed until now particularly the accelerated aging tests of polyethylene pipes by chlorine dioxide exposure can be distinguished in two groups immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests the first group of methods implies the soaking of entire samples which are usually small polyethylene pieces of pipes into a chlorine dioxide solution on the contrary the second group of tests is based on the use of loops of pe pipes where a chlorine dioxide solution is continuously recirculated under fixed temperature and pressure conditions in any case after accomplishing an accelerated aging test pe pipes are subjected to a chemical mechanical characterization to evaluate the performance of the pipe material under the applied stress conditions 4 1 characterization of polyethylene pipes the objective of the characterization is to provide a clear and scientific description of the condition of tested specimens after the application of defined stress conditions the most used parameters for the characterization of pe samples after a chemical mechanical aging test include the carbonyl index ci which can be determined through fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy the oxidative induction time oit which can be determined by a differential scanning calorimetry dsc the degree of crystallinity which can be also determined by a differential scanning calorimetry dsc a qualitative analysis of the surface by a scanning electron microscopy sem an elongation at break by tensile test fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy acts on the principle that when infrared radiation ir passes through a sample some of the radiation is absorbed the radiation that passes through the sample is recorded the molecules with a covalent bond will selectively absorb radiation at specific wavelengths and it will change the vibrational energy in the bond the type of vibration stretching or bending induced by the infrared radiation depends on the atoms in the bond because different bonds and functional groups absorb at different frequencies the transmittance pattern is different for different molecules the spectrum is recorded on a graph with wavenumber cm 1 recorded on the x axis and transmittance or absorbance recorded on the y axis wavenumber is 1 wavelength and corresponds to the energy of the vibration of the molecular bonds the spectral region interested by the molecular bond vibration is comprised between 2500 and 25 000 nm corresponding to a range of wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 ftir is carried out to determine the spectra of the polymer where variation in functional group has occurred due to aging phenomena on the other side the ci is calculated as follow according to the din 53 383 2 din 53383 2 1983 11 c i e q σ 1650 σ 1850 σ 1330 σ 1500 where σ 1650 σ 1850 is the area under the absorbance peaks attributed to the carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups between the wavelengths of 1650 and 1850 cm 1 whereas σ 1330 σ 1500 represents the peak area between the wavelengths 1330 nm and 1500 nm which are the scissoring bending signals of the methylene groups constituting the polymer chains almond et al 2020 determination of ftir spectra and of the ci can highlight the formation of carbonylic and carboxylic oxidation products which can be related to the degradation of the polyethylene as well as to the consumption of the antioxidant hence higher values of ci are indicative of a higher oxidation state of the material bredács et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 the oit measurement is a fundamental parameter for the studies of polyethylene aging and it is defined as the time to the onset of oxidation of a test specimen exposed to an oxidizing gas at an elevated temperature the oit can be calculated through dsc measurement which is one of the main thermal analysis techniques that can be used to characterize many types of materials including polymers metals and ceramic materials particularly to estimate the oit parameter by dsc the specimen and a reference material are heated at a constant rate in an inert gas environment created by flowing nitrogen when a target temperature is reached generally in the range 190 210 c the atmosphere of the testing environment is changed by supplying oxygen or air at the same flow rate the specimen is then held at constant temperature until the oxidative reaction is displayed on the recorded thermal curve hence the isothermal oit is determined by measuring the time interval between the initiation of oxygen or air supply and the onset of the oxidative reaction iso 2018 there is a linear correlation between the oit value and the concentration of phenolic antioxidants in the polymer bredács et al 2016 however the oit cannot quantify the performance of stabilization packages if any components do not have at least one phenolic group costa et al 2016 oit value equal to zero indicates that the stabilizer package in the polyethylene is completely depleted by the oxidant kim et al 2018 since the oxidative degradation of a pe pipe occurs only between the part of the material in contact with the chlorine dioxide solution profiling the determination of oit at various depths of a specimen can be useful to understand the differences between occurred surface degradation and bulk degradation boerakker et al 2018 vertova et al 2019 the degree of crystallinity of the material is determined through dsc measurement and calculated by the ratio between the enthalpy of fusion of the sample and the enthalpy of fusion of 100 crystalline polyethylene yu et al 2011 it is considered to be an index of polyethylene degradation and as the crystallinity fraction increases the material becomes more stiffer and brittle resulting in cracks formations vertova et al 2019 particularly studies that investigated the degradation of pipe material in contact with chlorine dioxide solutions showed that the crystallinity of the exposed surface increases as a function of the time of exposure on the other side along the depth of the wall the crystallinity is generally less affected by the oxidant due to the limited contact highlighting a lower degradation of this part of the pipe vertova et al 2019 yu et al 2011 sem is used to analyze the surface morphology of the degraded specimen with a visual evaluation of the cracks formation and propagation which occur during the chemical mechanical aging of the pe and then lead to the pipe failure in stage iii bredács et al 2016 generally the obtained information is exclusively related to the surface of the specimen which is the part of the sample that encounters the oxidant solution however a more interesting approach sees the possibility to analyze the transversal section of the pipe which allows to obtain more information on the depth of the cracks and its propagation surface cracks detected by sem images have been reported by many researchers and have been also utilized to support hypotheses on crack propagation mechanisms bredàcs et al 2016 yu et al 2011 vertova et al 2019 finally elongation at break is measured by tensile test to evaluate the mechanical properties of the polyethylene before and after the exposure to chlorine dioxide this test is conducted according to the iso 6259 and it is a common industrial practice to evaluate the quality of the products the elongation at break tends to decrease with increasing the exposure time with the disinfectant terwyen et al 2016 other minor tests are also used for a further understanding of the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes yu et al 2001 measured molar mass distributions and crystal thickness of the polyethylene by size exclusion chromatography which indicated degradation near the crystal amorphous interface due to the chemical aging vertova et al 2019 carried out sem analysis with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds on the pe pipes to investigate which type of elements are more abundant on the polymer s surface at the end of the aging tests small quantities of chlorine were detected on the surface likely as a result of clo2 interaction with the pipes themselves also in this case accurate sampling protocols might be adopted to highlight the diffusion of chlorine in the bulk and the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which can be observed not only on the surface but also along the thickness of the material analysing the cross section of the pipe another interesting surface characterization technique is reported by khan et al 2022 which is the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps that is used to analyze the change in chemical properties before and after the interaction of the chloride dioxide with the polymeric materials the changes in binding energy of the samples under the disinfectant conditions were evaluated over the range of 280 290 ev which reflects a change in the atomic composition of the aged and unaged samples from a saturated carbon chain to the formation of ketone aldehyde and carboxylate groups acids and esters according with the increasing of ci values khan et al 2022 therefore a sample that has undergone strong oxidation by chlorine dioxide should have a high value of the ci a lower value of the oit with a high grade of crystallinity visible cracks at the sem analysis and low elongation at break all these parameters have to be compared to the blank which did not come in contact with the oxidant solution table 3 summarises the main characterization tests of pe found in literature with their relative parameters measured and their scopes 4 2 immersion aging tests the immersion aging methods involve the dipping of entire samples inside a chlorine dioxide solution at fixed concentration temperature and ph the specimens are usually small polyethylene sheets dog bones and or pipes the chlorine dioxide solution is continuously refreshed in order to keep constant the exposure concentration here below different immersion aging tests are detailed they have been proposed by different research institutes organizations and researchers the laboratoire national de métrologie et d essais lne in france has developed a standardized accelerated aging test called nol ring creep test the method involves the soaking of a ring specimen extracted from the pipe inside a clo2 solution the ring is obtained from a 32 mm hdpe pipe and has a length of 20 mm the test solution has a chlorine dioxide concentration of 2 0 mg l and a temperature of 40 c during the aging hoop stress of 7 mpa is applied to the ring specimens fig 2 briefly shows the scheme of the nol ring creep test the equipment is able to apply a stress on the circumference of the ring taken from pipes while exposing the polyethylene to the clo2 after the exposure for 250 h 500 h 1000 h the elongation at break of the aged samples is measured through a specific tensile test and compared to the samples without aging terwyen et al 2016 terwyen et al 2016 tested four commercial pipes three pe100 one pe80 and one experimental through the nol ring creep test the elongations at break of the samples without aging were about 1400 1600 after 1000 h of aging two pe100 and one pe80 had about 0 of elongation at break better results were obtained for the other two pipes the pe100 and the experimental pipe had about 100 and 800 of elongation at break respectively the laboratory of ireti italy has designed an aging unit an autoclave of 200 l where tensile test samples without hooping stress are exposed to a clo2 bath the solution has a temperature of 40 c with a ph value of 7 2 the chlorine dioxide concentration is kept constant at a defined value usually 1 5 mg l and monitored by means of probes the solution in the autoclave is renewed through a circulation flow rate of 2 7 m3 h in order to maintain constant the clo2 concentration the scheme of the aging equipment is illustrated in fig 3 test specimens are prepared from extruded pipes or from compression molded sheets according to en iso 6259 3 the exposure time varies between 30 and 90 days the aging effects are evaluated through tensile tests which are carried out according to iso 527 with a test speed of 10 mm min terwyen et al 2016 terwyen et al 2016 reported two aging tests that were carried out on three commercial pipes two pe100 and one pe80 and two experimental one test was performed at 2 mg l of clo2 for 60 days the other one was performed at 1 mg l of clo2 for 90 days at 40 c in the first test the commercial pipes recorded a reduction in the elongation at break from 600 to 50 100 after 60 days of exposure while the experimental ones had an elongation at failure around 300 350 at the end of the trial the second test was performed at lower chlorine dioxide concentration and resulted for the experimental pipes in unchanged elongation at break throughout the whole aging test around 600 after 60 days of aging the elongation at failure for commercial pipes reduced from 600 to 250 350 while after 90 days of exposure it dropped around 50 150 in an aging test developed by lyondellbasell the tensile test samples are placed inside an autoclave with a solution that has a clo2 concentration of 20 mg l temperature of 60 c and ph value of 6 5 no stress is applied to the test specimens and the solution is refreshed with a circulating velocity of 1 m s the aging apparatus is similar to the equipment shown in fig 3 the maximum exposure time is about 500 h viscosity number melt flow index degree of oxidation with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and residual levels of antioxidants with differential scanning calorimeter dsc of the samples are determined for the aging evaluation vogt et al 2010 vogt et al 2010 reported that the values of oit at 210 c of pe specimens are influenced by the presence of different antioxidants in the polymer in one case the oit of a pe specimens dropped below 10 min after 100 h of exposure to 20 mg l of clo2 and a temperature of 60 c on the other side testing pe specimens with a different stabilizer resulted in an oit around 30 min after 100 h of exposure under the same experimental conditions in this case the oit dropped below 10 min after 500 h of aging subsequently to the immersion aging the pipes were tested through pipe pressure test according to the astm f2023 for the determination of time to failure the astm f2023 may be labelled as pressurized pipe loop aging test it is specific for pex pipes and it is similar to the astm f2263 van der stok et al 2018 this test is specific for pe pipes and will be described in the following paragraph as results of the immersion test a shorter failure time of the pipes was demonstrated to be linked to a faster consumption of the antioxidants in the polymer polymer competence center leoben pccl in cooperation with mechatronik moharitsch developed an exposure device of 50 l where the unstressed blocks of pe pipes are placed for 900 h the maximum clo2 concentration is 10 mg l the test temperature is about 60 c with a ph of 6 8 resulting in an orp of 650 mv the recirculation flow rate is about 500 l h the device is analogues to the device in fig 3 after the exposure time compression molded sheets and dog bone shaped specimens are punched out from the pe pipes according to the iso 18 488 thereby the samples are subject to tensile test load speed of 50 mm min scanning electron microscopy sem ftir for carbonyl index ci calculation and dsc for oxidation onset temperature oot determination bredács et al 2016 bredács et al 2016 tested two commercial pipes with standard antioxidants the elongation at break of the first commercial pipe was reduced from 500 to 310 220 and 50 respectively for 1 week 2 weeks and 3 weeks of aging while in the case of the second pipe the elongation dropped from 600 to about 50 only after 340 h of exposure through the sem analyses a surface roughness was observed after only 1 week of exposure whereas surface micro cracks appeared after 3 weeks of aging both samples showed an increase in the ci from zero to about 25 30 after 900 h of aging showing an inverse proportional relationship with the elongation at break moreover after 900 h of aging the oot decreased from 270 c to 240 c indicating the consumption of the antioxidant in the polymer kth royal institute of technology reported their accelerated aging test in which the unstressed film tape specimens 0 3 mm thick made with the polyethylene containing additives are exposed to a continuous supply of chlorine dioxide solution at 10 mg l ph of 6 8 and temperature of 70 c the kth test method is carried out at the laboratory scale with a compact set up subsequently oxygen induction time oit at different exposure times is measured to evaluate the chemical resistance of antioxidants costa et al 2016 costa et al 2016 tested pe specimens and their antioxidants by the kth method in order to quickly assess their resistance to the chlorine dioxide exposure for instance the oits at 210 c of three pe80 and one pe100 specimens with different stabilizer were compared in one pe80 the oit decreases from 30 min to almost zero after only 16 h of aging while the other samples reached oit values of zero after 80 120 h of exposure subsequently to the kth test the suez aging method which will be described in the following section was carried out in order to deeply understand the performance of the same pe pipes in terms of failure time the limitation of the oit test is that it may not show the real performance of the oxidants against the chlorine dioxide if the stabilizer package contains any component without a phenolic group for instance costa et al 2016 described one pe80 pipe containing a non phenolic group in the stabilizer package with a lower oit than one pe80 with phenolic groups however in the suez test a higher lifetime was recorded for the first pe 80 pipe table 4 reports a summary of the immersion aging methods found in literature with indication of the main operating parameters main findings and the parameters used for studying the aging of polyethylene pipes due to clo2 exposure although operating conditions are different between the proposed tests different techniques can be used to characterize the material and stabilizer packages of the pe pipes is usually not specified leading to a lot of variability in the obtained results it is still possible to compare some of the described aging tests water temperature greater than or equal to 70 c contribute to the sudden oit depletion in few hours comparing nol ring test and ireti test which are carried out applying the same concentration of clo2 and water temperature the effect of the pressure on the mechanical properties of the pe material may be noticed the initial elongation at break of the pe specimen in the nol ring test is about 1400 and it is reduced to 100 after 41 days of testing while in the case of ireti method the elongation at break of the initial specimen is about 600 and drops to 100 after 60 days of aging 4 3 pressurized pipe loop pressurized pipe loop tests are the accelerated aging methods which are more suitable to simulate real conditions in service fig 4 shows the schematic representation of a pressurized pipe loop which includes a loop of pe pipes where a chlorine dioxide solution is continuously recirculated at fixed concentration temperature and ph for a certain exposure time the pe pipes are subject to an internal pressure hoop stress and they are studied by means of the previous described characterization tests afterwards the aging and or by obtaining the time to failure parameters probes and heaters are generally used to maintain constant clo2 concentration temperature and ph as for immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests were proposed by different research institutes organizations and researchers although the apparatus used are analogous to the one in fig 4 test conditions vary considerable and here below different pressurized pipe loop tests are detailed american society for testing and materials astm international proposes the astm f2263 method in which polyethylene pipes undergo pressure testing with water containing chlorine dioxide until failure the goal of the test is the determination of the lifetime of pe pipes which are subject to chemical mechanical aging astm f2263 was initially developed to test pipes under pressure with disinfectant subsequently it was revised for application with chlorine in order to evaluate pipes failure in stage iii van der stok et al 2018 afterwards it was affirmed that they are also valid for clo2 and chloramine aging tests astm f2263 involves a minimum of twelve trials the pe pipes are exposed to the same concentration of chlorine dioxide with three different temperatures until failure for each trial at different temperature two distinct hoop stresses are applied the chlorine dioxide solution should have a concentration between 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l and a ph between 6 5 and 8 in such that the orp is greater than 825 mv the trial temperatures are usually 90 c 80 c and 70 c while the hoop stress varies between 2 48 mpa and 3 31 mpa considering a pe tube with a standard dimensional ratio 9 sdr9 the internal pressure ranges from 6 2 bar to 8 3 bar slightly lower pressures are recommended to develop a failure mode in stage iii astm international 2015 the suggested nominal size for test piping is between 1 2 inch and 4 inches and the pipe length should be ranging from 300 mm to 460 mm the flow velocity must be sufficient to maintain an orp greater than 825 mv previous tests with a pe sdr9 tube have used a minimum velocity around 0 04 m s hence the time to failure of the pipes at different trial temperatures and hoop stresses was determined the pipe lifetime is calculated through a linear regression multi parametric analysis according to ppi tn 196 method or iso 9080 the time to failure prediction according to the multiple linear regression of the iso 9080 may be defined as 12 l o g t c 1 c 2 1 t c 3 l o g σ c 4 l o g σ t e where c1 to c4 are parameters used in the model t is the time failure t is the temperature σ is the hoop stress and e is the error variable from laplace gaussian distribution it has been reported time to failure of 44 57 days for pe pipes with a trial temperature of 90 c and about 4 bars of internal pressure astm international 2015 hassinen and svedberg 2010 pointed out that extreme conditions of the astm f2263 with high stress and high temperatures may result in stage ii rather than stage iii failure moreover a small change in the extrapolation data will have big impact on the predictions due to the flat behavior of the regression lines resulting in performance estimations which may be overly pessimistic or optimistic hassinen and svedberg 2010 suez research center has developed a pressure testing with a chlorine dioxide solution until pe pipe failure different test parameters are changed compared to the astm f2263 the trail temperature is about 40 c with a clo2 concentration of 1 mg l and internal pressure of 6 bars for pe pipes the loop has a flow rate of 0 2 m3 h considering a nominal size of 25 mm as reported in literature the velocity in the pipes is about 0 14 m s boerakker et al 2018 although the suez method is qualified to compare different pe pipes resin and provide the pipe lifetime reported time to failure in literature for a pe pipe dn 25 thickness of 3 mm is about 18 months costa et al 2016 costa et al 2016 discussed that although the suez test method is reliable in evaluating the material performance it may not be used as accelerated test method for fast qualification of new pe pipes comparing the astm f2263 and the suez test method it can be observed that the astm f2263 reaches the pipe failure in 1 2 months though the extreme trial conditions may not reflect a pipe failure in stage iii on the other side the suez test is considered to be more representative of real conditions and reliable to monitor mechanical and chemical aging but the elevated time to reach the pipe failure more than 2 months may hindered its application yu et al 2011 proposed a pressure testing of 66 days to investigate the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes due to chlorine dioxide exposure the test conditions are water temperature of 90 c chlorine dioxide concentration of 4 mg l with a ph equal to 6 8 since the hoop stress is 1 65 mpa and the pe pipes have a nominal size of 12 mm and thickness of 2 2 mm the internal pressure is around 7 bar the velocity of the fluid in the loop is about 7 m s such test conditions do not allow to reach pipe failure within the exposure time the effects of clo2 on the pe pipes are assessed through the determination of oit at 210 c mass crystallinity melting peak temperature molar mass distribution as well as sem and ftir analysis of the samples yu et al 2011 reported oit profiles along the thickness of the pe pipe showing a rapid consumption of the antioxidant near the inner wall after 2 h of aging the oit on the inner surface reaches zero while the oit value for the outer surface goes to 10 min after 121 h the mass crystallinity profiles through the wall showed small variations between the pipes aged for different periods of time at the same depth whereas in the inner wall the crystallinity fraction increases from 50 to 55 after 130 h of aging the sem image showed a region with a crack formed during the aging test on each side there are zones with small cracks which may be highly degraded polymer therefore yu et al 2011 proposes that the crack growth mechanism may be defined as a degradation assisted crack growth where the major crack grows until a fresh zone then the chlorine dioxide attacks the material adjacent to the crack wall leading to the propagation of the major crack vertova et al 2019 used a test loop where the pipes are placed in parallel inside a thermostat chamber at 70 c for the investigation of the aging of metal and plastic water pipes due to clo2 the recirculated water has a temperature of 70 c a pressure of 5 bar with a velocity of 0 5 m s ph equal to 7 and chlorine dioxide concentration of 1 mg l a purge of the test fluid is advised to prevent the accumulation of disinfection by products the exposure time is about 8 weeks after which the pipes are characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis ftir sem with eds and dsc for determining the change in the crystallinity of the materials the sem images reported show several cracks in the inner wall of pe pipe after 8 weeks of aging in addition traces of chlorine are present on the surface probably from the chlorine dioxide after 4 and 8 weeks of aging the ftir shows an increase in intensity in the 1750 1735 cm 1 region indicating the formation of carboxylic and carbonyl compounds in addition adsorption band between 1550 and 1620 1640 3200 3500 appeared the degradation of the polymer occurred only on the surface of pipes while at 0 3 mm of depth within the wall only the depletion of the antioxidant occurred with the disappearance of the week absorption around 1745 cm 1 finally the dsc showed that as the aging time increased the crystalline fraction of the polymer raised from 46 5 to 55 4 at the end of the test after 4 week or 8 weeks of aging the crystalline percentage at 0 3 mm of depth within the wall was higher than the surface values kim et al 2018 have studied the effect of chlorine dioxide on different pe resin through a pressure test at 5 bar with water containing 1 mg l of chlorine dioxide the aging tests are carried out in cold and hot water and further details about the trial temperature are not reported the pe pipes have a nominal size of 16 mm with a thickness of 2 mm the exposure time varied from a few hours to 1000 h for evaluating the accelerated aging effect during the time the pe pipes were mainly characterized through dsc for oit calculation providing information about the antioxidant consumption during the time exposure one pe pipe containing a base stabilization bs one containing the bs plus experimental antioxidant and another one with bs and a noted formulation xp 2090 were tested by kim et al 2018 on one hand the oit of the standard stabilizer dropped dramatically and reached zero after 1000 h of aging at lower temperature and after 500 h at higher temperature on the other hand a slower decrease in oit was obtained for the xp 2090 and the experimental one at lower temperature and after 1000 h of aging the relative oits of the xp 2090 and the experimental one were around the 60 of the oit value for unaged samples castagnetti et al 2011 have investigated the aging of 100 m pipe coil in polyethylene due to chlorine dioxide effects freshwater with a clo2 concentration of 5 mg l temperature of 40 c pressure of 2 5 bars and a velocity of 1 8 m s is recirculated inside the pipe coil for 1 year at regular intervals time 30 cm of sample is cut from the pipe coil for the chemical mechanical characterization which involves oit tests at 210 c on the inner wall and on the mid layer and tensile tests with a speed of 50 mm min as a further mechanical characterization pressure tests on 1 meter of pipe were carried out according to the uni en 921 the pipes were tested for 165 1000 and 2000 h at a circumferential stress of 5 mpa and at constant temperature of 80 c furthermore samples exposed to neutral water at the same test conditions and samples exposed to ambient air were characterized in order to provide reference characteristics of naturally aged pipes in the case of exposure to chlorine dioxide the pipes have shown an abrupt decrease of the oit at the inner of the wall from the second week of test the oit values at inner surface became stable at around 90 less than its initial value almost equal to zero minutes after two months of aging the decrease in the oit on the mid layer of the pipe wall was quite low from 50 to 30 min after 365 days of aging all the pipe samples survived the pressure tests at a constant temperature for up to 2000 h indicating that a high degree of antioxidant consumption does not necessarily imply a decrease in the mechanical performance castagnetti et al 2011 aliaxis corporate r d center has developed a method to assess in accelerated mode the resistance of pe pipe to chlorine dioxide the test involves a trial loop with pe pipes dn 32 where a clo2 solution with a concentration of 70 mg l temperature of 40 c 1 bar of pressure is recirculated inside up to 4000 h after the exposure time the polyethylene is characterized by ftir and dsc for oit determination carmier et al 2012 carmier et al 2012 tested and compared pe100 pipes with a protective inner layer in pvdf and plain pe pipes by means of the aliaxis aging method in the case of the plain pe the ftir showed some oxidation peak at 1720 cm 1 while in the pe100 protected by the pvdf there was absence of oxidation peaks moreover the plain pe showed a very fast reduction of oit which reached zero in 254 h of aging on the contrary the pe100 protected by the pvdf remained well above the usual required minimum oit of 20 min at 200 c finally the peel strength of the pvdf layers from the pe structural layer was determined where the peeled 10 mm strip was pulled at 50 mm min only after 1500 h of aging the peel strength dropped below the recommended minimum value of 15 n cm table 5 reports a summary of the pressurized pipe loop methods found in literature with indication of the main operating parameters main findings and the parameters measured for studying the chemical mechanical aging of polyethylene pipes due to the clo2 exposure as in the case of immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests present a lot of variability in terms of operating conditions and characterization results both astm f2263 and suez method involves the aging of the pe until the pipe failure without application of any characterization method the astm f2263 may reach the failure in a short time two months thanks to the high chlorine dioxide concentration and water pressure the suez method which involves the application of middle aging parameters may need more than one year to achieve the failure of the pe pipes the aging time needed to reach oit equal to zero for the inner surface of the pipe and to affect the percentage of crystallinity of the tested material are dependent on the utilized water temperature and chlorine dioxide concentration as in the case of immersion aging tests extreme temperature conditions t 70 c may lead to the oit depletion of the inner surface and in abrupt increasing of the crystallinity in few hours the formation of cracks generally occurs after 40 60 days of aging and no clear correlations with other operating parameters may be noticed 5 comparison of the accelerated aging tests and methods as mentioned above the aging of the pe pipes in water distribution system due to chlorine dioxide exposure is a chemical mechanical process on one side the concentration of clo2 and its by products affects the depletion of the antioxidant as well as the degradation of the polymer on the other side the applied pressure hoop stress on the pe pipe determines the crack propagation time other operating parameters such as temperature pipe thickness water ph and contact time contribute to accelerating the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes accelerated aging tests should aim to accurately replicate the normal aging of pe pipes to preserve the degradation mechanisms occurring in water distribution networks the main sources of error found in accelerated aging tests a are due to the either exaggeration or lack of those operational parameters mostly contributing to the pe pipes aging under real condition service such as clo2 concentration water pressure and temperature there are not experimental studies reported in the literature that quantify the errors of the acceleration experiment from the normal aging of pe pipes in service however a qualitative assessment of these errors is discussed below in this work typical chlorine dioxide concentration in pressurized pipe loops varies between 1 and 5 mg l with a maximum pressure of 5 8 bars and trial temperature ranging from 40 c to 90 c the applied pressure in the pipe is well known as one of the main factors contributing to the crack propagation after the formation due to the chemical oxidation of the surface until the pipe failure jana laboratories inc 2010b aging tests without applied stresses as in the case of many immersions aging trials may be not considered representative of the chemical mechanical aging the range of applied temperature in loop tests is quite wide affecting the exposure time and the linked effects on the pe pipes van der stok et al 2018 pointed out the trial temperature should remain within certain limits which are comparable to the practice in water distribution systems the physical antioxidant loss is affected by the temperature and should not be confused with the antioxidation depletion due to chlorine dioxide exposure moreover an elevated applied temperature likely induces a pipe failure in stage ii rather than in stage iii van der stok et al 2018 the maximum advised temperature for commercial pe pipes is generally around 60 c din 8074 2011 although there are no findings about the relation between velocity and aging moderate loop velocities are found in the literature 0 04 0 5 m s likely resulting in longer contact time between chlorine dioxide chlorite chlorate and pe pipes astm f2263 and suez methods imply the aging of the pe pipes until failure with the aim to estimate the lifetime of the pipes these tests do not provide information about the degradation mechanisms which lead to the aging of the pe pipes van der stok et al 2018 hence both mechanical and chemical characterization are needed to evaluate the pe pipe aging and verify that the simulated degradation mechanisms are the same of those occurring in real service conditions costa et al 2016 as mentioned before subsequently to the aging test the most used parameters for pe characterization are the carbonyl index oxygen induction time degree of crystallinity qualitative analysis of the surface with sem and elongation at break from the analysis of the literature no evidence of aging tests with extreme test conditions leading to pipe failure in short time e g astm f2263 may replicate the chemical mechanical aging that occurs in real service conditions stage iii on one side elevated temperature and pressure may result in a mechanical brittle failure of the pipe in pe stage ii on the other side aging tests with too high concentrations of chlorine dioxide compared to those in real service conditions may alter the degradation mechanisms neglecting the synergy between the chemical and the mechanical aging in contrast more realistic test conditions replicate better the chemical mechanical aging which occurs in the water distribution system van der stok et al 2018 although the pipe failure does not occur during the trial time of these tests the depletion of the antioxidant on the pipe surface increases of the crystallinity degree and the carbonyl index are detected by pe characterization methods bredács et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 yu et al 2011 these results and findings may allow the comparison between pe pipes with different resins and additives and the determination of degradation kinetics in addition the described aging methods did not assess the consumption of chlorine dioxide and the formation of its by products which occurs during the tests the comparison of the bulk and wall kinetics of chlorine dioxide and its by products during aging tests with the kinetics obtained in full scale drinking water distribution systems may be useful to compare the accelerated and the normal aging of pe pipes in service therefore the determination of clo2 clo2 and clo3 kinetics for accelerated aging tests is recommended to critically assess and evaluate the characterization results of the pe pipes and the exposure time to the chlorine dioxide 6 conclusions in this review paper aging mechanisms of pe pipes exposed to chlorine dioxide are introduced and discussed the macroscopic degradation mechanism between pe pipes and clo2 is the same of that occurring with other disinfectants it generally involves i depletion of antioxidants at pipe surface in contact with chlorine dioxide ii degradation of the polymer with then micro cracks initiation and ii cracks propagation until pipe failure the aging mechanism occurring in service is a chemical mechanical process that leads to pipe failure in stage iii high reactivity between clo2 and antioxidants of polyethylene i e phenols is generally reported however it is not clear if the chlorine dioxide may directly initiate radical chain reactions after antioxidant depletion or it reacts with hindered phenols in the polymer to produce radicals which may lead to chain reactions further investigation is needed to understand the roles of antioxidants in the degradation of the pe pipes operating parameters influencing chemical mechanical aging in real drinking water distribution systems were discussed the main factors affecting the degradation mechanisms of pe pipes are the chlorine dioxide concentrations water pressure and water temperature however other environmental factors such as pipe size pipe installation and water ph may aid the premature failure of pipes subsequently accelerated aging methods and characterization tests of pe pipes after exposure to chlorine dioxide are described and critically discussed several aging tests are proposed by standards and developed by research centres they may be subdivided into immersion aging and pressurized pipe loop the main scope of these tests is the assessment of performances of pe pipes in contact with chlorine dioxide in a short time while preserving the degradation mechanisms occurring in service the application of unreasonable clo2 concentration water pressure and temperature in accelerated aging tests is found to be the main cause of errors in the replication of the normal aging of pe pipes further research is needed for the quantification of these aging replication errors which is currently missing in the literature and may certainly lead to the improvement of the pe pipes lifetime prediction in addition no accelerated aging methods reported the concentrations of clo2 by products such as clo2 and clo3 and their possible oxidation effects on pe degradation although chlorite and chlorate have lower oxidation strength than chlorine dioxide their concentrations should be monitored and annotated in accelerated aging reports to strengthen transparency and comparability of methods pressurized pipe loop methods are the most reliable tests to simulate real aging conditions in water distribution systems within this category aging tests with extreme operating conditions compared to realistic ones i e high clo2 concentration high pressure high temperature may lead to pipe failure in stage ii rather than stage iii therefore semi realistic operating parameters are recommended to simulate the realistic degradation of pe pipes chlorine dioxide concentration ranging between 1 and 5 mg l water pressure from 4 to 7 bars and water temperature below 60 c are proposed as operating conditions although these aging methods do not reach the pipe failure in a short time less than one month the chemical mechanical characterization of aged pe pipes provides a real insight into the degradation mechanisms and allows performances comparison none of semi realistic aging methods attempted to predict the lifetime of pe pipes under real operating conditions considering the results of material characterization after clo2 exposure this fact limits their possible application for commercial purposes it is recommended to validate the characterization results of pe pipes after accelerated aging experiments by comparing them with results of the characterization of pe pipes operated under real condition service future research should explore the existence of possible correlations between chemical mechanical parameters of pe pipes and their real lifetime in water distribution systems table 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14776,polyethylene pe pipes have been widely used in drinking water distribution systems across the world in many cases chlorine dioxide clo2 is used to maintain a residual disinfectant concentration in potable water practical experiences have shown that the lifetime of pe pipes is significantly reduced due to exposure to drinking water with clo2 recently many companies have proposed new pe pipes with a modified formulation which are more resistant to chlorine dioxide however a standardized test method for evaluating the long term performances of pe pipes is still missing this literature review was performed to provide a description of chlorine dioxide uses and degradation mechanisms of polyethylene pipes in real water distribution systems current accelerated aging methods to evaluate long term performances of pe pipes exposed to clo2 are described and discussed along with the common technics used to characterize the specimens accelerate aging methods can be distinguished in immersion aging tests and pressurized pipe loop tests wide ranges of operational conditions chlorine dioxide concentration water pressure water temperature etc are applied resulting in a great variety of results it was concluded that pressurized looping tests applying semi realistic operational conditions could better replicate the aging mechanisms occurring in service despite this the acceleration and the evaluation of the long term performance are still difficult to determine precisely further experimentation is needed to correlate chemical mechanical characterization parameters of pe pipes

technical notes sdr standard dimension ratio dn diameter nominal bs base stabilization pvdf polyvinylidene fluoride 1 introduction in the last decade the use of chlorine dioxide for secondary disinfection to maintain a residual in the water distribution systems has been widespread in north america and in europe jana laboratories inc 2010a clo2 is preferred to other disinfectants such as free chlorine from sodium hypochlorite calcium hypochlorite or gaseous chlorine and chloramine since it has a strong oxidation potential and is able to remove viruses and pathogens that are resistant to chlorination moreover chlorine dioxide reacts with the organic matter without forming chlorinate organic compounds such as haloacetic acids haas and trihalomethanes thms which are usually generated by chlorination usepa 2011 although clo2 residual can persist in distribution systems the low boiling point 11 c and the high reactivity lead to the rapid dissipation of its residual chlorine dioxide reacts with organic and inorganic substances forming chlorite clo2 and chlorate clo3 anions despite the chemical speciation of clo2 depends on several factors such as dosage temperature ph and water quality chlorine dioxide is generally converted into clo2 and clo3 for 68 and 9 respectively sorlini et al 2016 moreover in the case clo2 is used together with other disinfectants such as ozone the formation of chlorate can be even more relevant usepa 2011 chlorite and chlorate are oxidizing substances and potentially harmful to human health and the world health organization has recommended for both ions a limit in water distribution systems of 0 7 mg l world health organization 2011 in europe typical residual concentration of chlorine dioxide may range from less than 0 05 mg l to around 0 25 0 30 mg l the desired residual concentration of chlorine dioxide in water distribution systems may depend on either the legislative limit for clo2 or legislative limits for by products clo2 and clo3 the maximum allowed concentration of clo2 in tap water is 0 8 mg l in the usa 0 25 mg l in belgium and 0 15 in switzerland jana laboratories inc 2010a in italy the recommended residual concentration of disinfectant in the water distribution systems is about 0 2 mg l decreto legislativo n 31 2001 2001 other countries do not have standard limits for chlorine dioxide concentration in water but generally only for the by products chlorite and or chlorate in december 2020 the european parliament and council approved the new framework directive on the quality of water intended for human consumption the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 in annex i of the directive a concentration limit of 0 7 mg l was set in drinking water for both chlorite and chlorate ions clo2 is usually employed in medium and large size drinking water treatment plants due to the high costs of production and management earth tech canada inc 2005 chlorine dioxide is a gas that is highly soluble in water 70 g l at 20 c and 1 atm it cannot be stored or transported in a gaseous state due to the high risk of explosion but it must be generated in site the easier and safer method for the production of chlorine dioxide solution is through the reaction of sodium chlorite with hydrochloric acid usepa 2011 chlorine dioxide is more aggressive towards plastic pipes including polyethylene pe than other chlorine based disinfectants it has been observed in water distribution systems that pe pipes may prematurely undergo failure when they are exposed to chlorine dioxide the possible explanations could be that clo2 is a dissolved gas which diffuses more rapidly into the polymer in respect to other disinfectants accelerating the degradation reactions vertova et al 2019 to low down the reaction of clo2 with pe material hindered phenols antioxidants are usually added to pe during pipe manufacturing however some studies have hypothesized that reaction of chlorine dioxide with antioxidants can lead to the production of reactive chlorine species which may react even more rapidly than clo2 with pe nullifying the desired delay of polymer degradation yu et al 2011 although pe pipes with new formulations of resins and additives which are resistant to chlorine dioxide have been produced by several companies there is not a unique and standard method to test and evaluate the performances of these materials particularly several methods have been proposed by researchers to evaluate the aging of polyethylene pipes subjected to chlorine dioxide exposure however these methods involve very different test conditions including temperature pressure clo2 concentration etc hence outputs and results are difficult to compare and all these methods present advantages and limitations for an accurate evaluation of the clo2 effect on pe pipes degradation particularly the main issue with these tests is reproducing the aging phenomena occurring in drinking network pipes in experimental trials that are relatively short in time van der stok et al 2018 this literature review was carried out to critically describe assess and compare all the proposed accelerated aging methods that have been used to evaluate the performances of pe pipes exposed to clo2 first the chemistry of chlorine dioxide and the long term aging mechanisms of polyethylene pipes in drinking water distribution systems are discussed then all the existing aging methods and characterization techniques to evaluate the performance of pe pipes in contact with chlorine dioxide are critically discussed and compared 2 chemistry of chlorine dioxide in water distribution networks 2 1 dispropation of chlorine dioxide in drinking water the aging studies of pe exposed to chlorine dioxide can be affected by the chemical transformations of this oxidant during the experimental tests which also depend on the conditions used in the test and on the presence of other dissolved substances in water chlorine dioxide behaves as selective oxidant towards rich electron moieties such as amines anilines phenols and unsaturated hydrocarbons and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with elevated efficiency when chlorine dioxide reacts with reductant substrates it is mainly converted in chlorite anion as represented in reaction 1 xu et al 2022 lee et al 2004 1 clo2 e clo2 the reaction rate constants of clo2 with inorganic substances were reported by hoignè and bader 1994 it exhibits fast reaction rate with iodide cyanide nitrite sulphite iron ii and manganese ii ions while it reacts slowly with ammonia or bromide anion therefore reaction of clo2 with dissolved organic carbon doc can generate transient free available chlorine fac that can oxidize br to free bromine which in turn can generate toxic brominate organic substances li et al 2022 the complete reactivity of chlorine dioxide towards the substances dissolved in real water matrices is very complex and strongly depends on the kind of organic material on the eventual pre treatment of water with other oxidants such as chlorine ozone persulphate and on the exposure to uv and visible light an in depth analysis of the chemistry of clo2 in water disinfection and decontamination has been recently reviewed by xu et al 2022 another concern to be considered is that clo2 is not available as a pure gas but rather as a mixture of clo2 containing various contaminants gan et al 2020 clo2 can be produced by different methods for example through oxidation of chlorites qi et al 2020 reduction of chlorates monteiro et al 2021 or using electrolytic technologies bergmann and koparal 2005 generally chlorine dioxide is easily produced in situ by reaction of clo2 and clo3 in the presence of acids or other oxidants such as chlorine hypochlorite or hydrogen peroxide ayyildiz et al 2009 despite the new production technologies have considerably reduced the presence of contaminants in the generated gas it is inevitable that the use of chlorine dioxide introduces little amounts of other chlorine based oxidants in water mainly chlorite which can influence the rate and the pathways of the occurring oxidation reactions in the tested water matrix xu et al 2022 the main way of degradation of chlorine dioxide in water takes place by disproportionation giving chlorite clo2 chlorate clo3 and chloride cl anions with yields that depends on many factors including chlorine dioxide dosage ph temperature and presence of reactive organic substrates lee et al 2004 in alkaline solution chlorine dioxide is disproportionated through a one step process 2 while at low ph conditions and in the presence of a reductant substrate the conversion involves two steps in which the former is the reduction of chlorine dioxide to chlorous acid hclo2 that spontaneously decompose into chlorine dioxide chlorate and chloride ions reactions 3 and 4 the global rection that gives chlorate and chloride from clo2 is described by eq 5 lee et al 2004 2 2clo2 2oh clo2 clo3 h2o 3 clo2 h e hclo2 4 4hclo2 2clo2 clo3 cl 2h h2o 5 2clo2 2h 4e clo3 cl h2o the formation of chlorite and chlorate anions during the treatment of water with chlorine dioxide is a crucial concern because both chlorite and chlorate have oxidant properties indeed chlorite generated from clo2 may be reduced to chloride ions in the presence of several organic or inorganic substrates reaction 6 gan et al 2020 6 clo2 4h 4e cl 2h2o as mentioned above the formation of clo2 and clo3 depends on chlorine dioxide dosage ph temperature water quality and other variables lee et al 2004 investigated the consumption of chlorine dioxide and its speciation in drinking water reporting data on disinfectant residual chlorite and chlorate concentration after 120 min of exposure under different environmental and operational conditions results of this research are summarized in table 1 in the study of lee et al 2004 it was observed that the presence of oxidable substrates such as organic compounds tends to increase the conversion of chlorine dioxide to chlorite while it does not influence significantly the formation of chlorate in addition when the initial concentration of clo2 is higher than 1 mg l the speciation of chlorate can raise up to 15 on the contrary with the increase of temperature is favoured the transformation of chlorine dioxide in chlorite and at 30 c the formation of chlorate is reported to be null finally acid ph favours the formation of clo3 and basic ph enhances the production of chlorite lee et al 2004 although chlorite and chlorate have lower oxidization potentials than chlorine dioxide and there are no findings in the literature about their effects on pe pipes these by products may in some way contribute to pipe aging therefore their concentrations in accelerated aging tests should be monitored and reported 2 2 diffusion of chlorine dioxide and its by product in drinking water distribution networks as mentioned in the previous paragraph the diffusion and the decay rate of chlorine dioxide which lead to the formation of chlorite and chlorate are directly related to the presence of natural organic matter ph and temperature of the drinking water ammar et al 2014 several studies have investigated the decay of chlorine dioxide during disinfection while only few articles have tackled the diffusion of chlorine dioxide in distribution networks sorlini et al 2016 carried out batch experiments at laboratory scale to determine reaction kinetics for modeling chlorine dioxide chlorite and chlorate propagation in a drinking water distribution system the decay rate of chlorine dioxide in drinking water bulk phase was described through a first order reaction in exponential form which includes the initial concentration of clo2 at the inlet of the network c0 contact time t and the bulk coefficient kb the kb was determined by batch tests and was assumed equal to 0 288 d 1 the first order decay equation for clo2 was described as follow 7 c c 0 e k b t reaction kinetics of zero order were used to describe the formation of chlorite and chlorate in the bulk phase taking into account the initial concentration of clo2 and clo3 c0 contact time t and the relative bulk coefficient which can be obtained from batch tests 0 576 mg l d and 0 101 mg l d for clo2 and clo3 respectively hence the zero order decay equation for clo2 and clo3 can be defined as follow 8 c c 0 k b t this study showed those kinetic reactions of clo2 clo2 and clo3 determined through batch experiments can be used to describe the diffusion of these oxidants in the distribution systems however authors pointed out that observed differences between some of the measured and modelled concentrations were probably related to the decay of these oxidants due to contact with the pipe wall this last phenomenon is called wall decay ammar et al 2014 carried out batch experiments with chlorine dioxide in desalinated water at different disinfectant concentrations 0 6 mg l 1 4 mg l and water temperatures 20 c 45 c the results showed that the diffusion of chlorine dioxide in the bulk phase follows a first order decay model for all the dosages with a kb that can be expressed as function of water temperature t 9 k b 0 8147 e 0 0415 t hence the bulk decay coefficient ranges from 1 8 d 1 for 20 c to 5 d 1 for 45 c these data can be considered and compared with ones resulted from the accelerated tests research is still required for an accurate determination of the wall decay of chlorine dioxide chlorite and chlorate in drinking water distribution systems as mentioned above the formation and diffusion of chlorite and chlorate is the main long term safety problem related to the use of chlorine dioxide in drinking water networks world health organization 2011 indeed a population based case control study in northern italy showed higher risk to have new borns with renal defects abdominal wall defects and cleft palate from women exposed to chlorite concentrations in drinking water greater than 0 7 mg l on the other side women exposed to chlorate level 0 2 mg l have higher risk to generate new borns with obstructive urinary defects cleft palate and spina bifida righi et al 2012 the new european drinking water directive did set concentration limit of 0 7 mg l for chlorite and chlorate in water distribution systems using chlorine dioxide furthermore it requires to water managers the implementation of a water safety plans wsp to assure water safety for humans particularly a health risk assessment should be accomplished considering all the elements of the drinking water supply chain including catchment area abstraction treatment and storage systems and infrastructures for distribution to the point of compliance the european parliament and the council of the european union 2020 overall the development of site specific kinetic models for chlorite and chlorate formation in drinking water distribution systems is highly recommended to identify and mitigate the human health risks associated with the use of chlorine dioxide as disinfectant although there is no evidence about the formation of by products closely related to the degradation of pe pipes exposed to clo2 some articles reported that disinfectants residues in drinking water and in contact with plastic pipes may lead to the formation of microplastics mps zhang et al 2022 nirmala et al 2023 zhang et al 2022 reported that ozone exposed pe pipes after 20 h of aging may release from 337 to 656 mp l surface crack and fragmentation are considered possible reasons for mps generation hence further research is required to study the possible release of mps from pe pipes due to the contact with clo2 or other disinfectants 3 polyethylene pipes aging in water distribution systems 3 1 long term aging mechanisms of polyethylene pipes the mechanisms involved in the aging of pe pipes are fundamental aspects to deepen for the assessment of long term performances of pipes in the water distribution system for plastic pipes polyethylene etc the performance envelope is usually defined in terms of the stress versus time plot as shown in fig 1 it is used to delimit the lifetime of the pipe under stressed conditions the performance envelope involves three stages of failure in function of the aging mechanisms astm international 2015 stage i ductile mechanical failure this regime involves a long term visco elastic creep where the pipe failure is characterized by a local deformation of the material that is visible with the unaided eye stage ii brittle mechanical failure the pipe failure is purely brittle and is the result of a single crack from the inside toward the outside of the pipe without any material deformations stage iii mechanical chemical failure in this regime the failure occurs at lower hoop stress due to the presence of oxidative condition and is defined by the embrittlement of the inner wall of the pipe the observed mechanisms for stage i and stage ii are strictly mechanical and affected mainly by the applied temperature and stress on the pipe however the ductile failure mode in stage i is not commonly observed in the field since the applied stress to pe pipes in water distribution systems are way below its yield stress jana laboratories inc 2010b the methodologies for the determination of performance of pipes in stage i and stage ii are well defined by standard tests as described below astm d2837 standard test method for obtaining hydrostatic design basis for thermoplastic pipe materials or pressure design basis for thermoplastic pipe products is used to assess the viscoelastic creep stage i jana laboratories inc 2010b this method can be used for determining either the hydrostatic design basis hdb or pressure design basis pdb the procedure involves the assessment of stress failure time plots of pe pipes under a selected temperature and environment i e liquid air or gaseous bath the hdb is determined using the long term hydrostatic strength lhts of the pipe that is the expected tensile stress on the pipe circumference leading to the pipe failure at 100 000 h when it is applied continuously while the pdb is obtained by measuring the long term hydrostatic pressure strength lthsp which is the expected internal pressure that led to the pipe failure at 100 000 h if it is applied continuously the test is accomplished using a device capable to keep a constant internal water pressure on the specimen at fixed temperature both lhts and lthsp are measured from the stress versus time to failure curve for a testing period of not less than 10 000 h moreover the hydrostatic strength of pe pipes at 50 years may be obtained by extrapolating the data from the stress versus time to failure curves astm international 2013 the performances of stage ii are determined according to the astm f1473 standard test method for notch tensile test to measure the resistance to slow crack growth of polyethylene pipes and resins jana laboratories inc 2010b astm f1473 method is used for the measurement of slow crack growth i e the slow extension of the crack with time resistance of pe pipes under accelerated conditions it involves the notching of the specimen before applying constant pressure and temperature conditions the specimens are made from a compression molded plaque with dimensions of 50 mm x 25 mm x 10 mm subsequently a main notch and two side notched are produced on the specimen with a razor blade the depth of the notches is function of the specimen thickness the test is usually performed at 80 c and 2 4 mpa as hoop stress the trials is carried out until the specimen undergoes failure resulting in the determination of the time to failure astm international 2001 on the other side the long term mechanisms associated with stage iii are not fully understood they are still subjects of studies and research and standardized tests for their determination are not available particularly the characterization of stage iii aging mechanism is considered a key area for continuing enhancement of the long term performance of pe piping materials in potable water applications briefly it is supposed that the mechanical chemical failure of pipes in stage iii involves the antioxidant depletion on the pipe surface oxidation of the polymer initiation of microcrack in the oxidated material and crack propagation through the pipe wall as occurs for the slow crack growth scg in stage ii until failure chung et al 2004 jana laboratories inc 2010b hence stage iii aging is not only dependent upon temperature stress and pipe material but also on the oxidative aggressiveness of the transport fluid jana laboratories inc 2010b to date two different theories have been proposed to explain the oxidation mechanisms of pe pipes by chlorine dioxide colin et al 2009 suggested that radical chain reactions that cause polymer degradation are directly initiated by chlorine dioxide which causes the hydrogen abstraction from the polyethylene after the depletion of the phenolic antioxidants the pe is directly attacked by clo2 indeed this latter process is considered to be 1500 times slower than the reaction between chlorine dioxide and hindered phenols oxidants on the contrary yu et al 2011 reported that clo2 may not be able to abstract a hydrogen atom from a hydrocarbon hence another oxidation mechanism was proposed where the reaction between chlorine dioxide and hindered phenolic antioxidants leads to the formation of the hydrogen abstracting radical clo and the subsequent polymer degradation is an immediate surface reaction according to this theory the reaction of chlorine dioxide with phenolic antioxidants is the reason of polymer degradation both suggested theories have not been confirmed and the chemistry that lead to polymer degradation is not fully understood however authors in literature tend to prefer the theory proposed by colin et al 2009 to explain their experimental results jana laboratories inc 2010b kim et al 2018 in accordance with the theory of colin et al 2009 the pe pipe failure in water distribution systems generally involves an initial antioxidant depletion with the following formation and propagation of cracks stage iii therefore the time to failure tf for polyethylene pipes can be defined as jana laboratories inc 2010b 10 t f t s d t i t p where tsd is the time for antioxidant depletion ti is the time needed for polymer oxidation until crack initiation and tp is the time for crack propagation until the pipe failure the three phases are inversely proportional to the temperature which accelerate the aging mechanisms the time for antioxidant depletion depends mainly on the kind of antioxidant mixed with the polymer and on the type of disinfectant used which induces the oxidative state the time for crack initiation is function of the strength of the oxidizing agent and of the applied stress to the pipe as the oxidation of the polymeric material occurs the toughness of the inner wall decreases leading to the crack initiation at a given stress then such stress continuously applied to the pipe affects directly the time needed for crack propagation tp the time to failure decreases as the hoop stress rises jana laboratories inc 2010b 3 2 factors causing pipe failure in water distribution networks the principal aging parameters of pe pipes in water distribution systems using chlorine dioxide are described and assessed in this paragraph for a better understanding of their influences on the degradation mechanisms that can be observed under realistic pipe service conditions among these parameters chlorine dioxide concentration water pressure and temperature are directly related to the mechanical chemical failure described previously as stage iii however other features such as water ph pipe size and pipe installation can also influence the time to failure of pe pipes the chlorine dioxide concentration in water directly affects the aging mechanisms of pe pipes the oxidative aggressiveness of water expressed in terms of oxidative reduction potential orp is directly proportional to the concentration of clo2 in water higher orp tends to decrease the lifetime of pe pipes plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 colin et al 2009 stated that the lifetime of pe pipes where water is subjected to clo2 disinfection under real operative conditions clo2 0 15 ppm t 15 c hoop stress of few mpa may be reduced to 10 years instead of the 50 years expected no studies are available in literature regarding the oxidation effects of the by products of clo2 i e clo2 and clo3 on pe pipes degradation however as previously mentioned during disinfection chlorine dioxide is generally converted into clo2 and clo3 for 68 and 9 respectively sorlini et al 2016 in addition the oxidation potential of chlorite and chlorate are typically lower than the oxidation potential of chlorine dioxide this evidence suggests that oxidation strengths of clo2 and clo3 in drinking water distribution system are significantly lower than the oxidation strength of chlorine dioxide oxidation is a thermally activated process as well as the crack initiation and propagation hence the chemical mechanical aging is a thermally activated process with the rate of aging increasing with the increasing of the temperature particularly it was reported that at a given water quality and stress the relative aging rate at an average water temperature of 4 c is approximately 5 to 20 times slower than that at 20 c jana laboratories inc 2010b overall annual ground and surface water temperatures range from 3 c to 29 c with an average around 15 c awwa 1996 under typical water temperatures 20 c the aging mechanism occurs at relatively slow rates on the contrary when the water temperature in the water distribution system is greater than 20 c the chlorine dioxide is much more aggressive towards pe pipes and the aging mechanism can be significantly accelerated plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 particularly high temperature boosts the degradation of polymeric material resulting in an increase of the crystallinity and the embrittlement of the pe pipe plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 the operating pressure in water distribution systems applies hoop stress on the circumference of the pipe which directly aids the crack propagation particularly systems with high operating pressure 6 bar have a higher risk of failure than those at low operating pressure 2 5 3 bar it has been reported that if the internal pressure of the pipe increases from 2 5 bar to 5 5 bar the aging mechanism increases approximately from 5 to 10 times jana laboratories inc 2010b the concentration of chlorine dioxide and operating pressure are the main parameters found in literature which affect the chemical mechanical aging stage iii of pe pipes in service the ph of water may also have an impact on the chemical oxidation of pipe by clo2 however little research has focused on this effect until now van der stok et al 2018 it is important to note that the specific orp ph clo2 relationship is dependent on specific water quality and its constituents which may all contribute to determine the overall oxidative strength of the water the usepa guidelines for potable water entering the distribution system are for a ph range of 6 5 to 8 5 awwa 1996 jana laboratories inc 2010b and the average values for drinking water in distribution systems are ph of 7 7 hence expected variations of ph in real application are unlikely to significantly impact on disinfected water oxidative strength the pipe size and thickness affect the hoop stress applied to the pipe considering the same pipe size and identical operating pressure conditions thin pipes are subjected to higher hoop stress than thick pipes jana laboratories inc 2010b moreover the size of the pipe i e diameter of the pipe is usually proportional to the pipe thickness and when the crack is initiated it will take more time for propagation in thick pipes compared to thin pipes plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 hence small and thin pipes are more susceptible to damage than big and thick pipes since they can offer lower resistance to the applied operating pressure plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 furthermore the installation conditions affect the lifetime of the pe pipes particularly shallow installation and or a lack of a proper underlying layer significantly increase the hop stress state of the pipe resulting in one of the most observed causes of pipe failure in distribution networks generally pipes with greater diameters are installed with more accuracy than those with smaller diameters plastics industry pipe association of australia 2019 a further factor that may influence pipes failure during clo2 disinfection is the water age which is the time that a particle of water spends in the water distribution system however there is no evidence reported in the literature about the relationship between the water age in the distribution system and the aging of the pe pipe nevertheless the water age influences the hydrodynamics of the fluid within the pipe and hence the contact between the pipe surface and the chlorine dioxide solution in a realistic situation lower water velocities inside the distribution systems lead to pipes with higher water ages which may result in an increased contact of pipe surface with clo2 in are reassumed the effects on the aging mechanisms of pe pipes with the relative degree of influence of the different parameters that characterize the operation conditions of pipes in drinking water distribution systems 4 accelerated aging tests and methods many companies and research centers have developed their own accelerated aging methods of pe pipes in presence of chlorine dioxide studies have applied very different experimental conditions during testing by using very different chlorine dioxide concentration in water oxidant exposure time pressure within the pipes temperature of the water in order to accelerate the aging of a pe specimen costa et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 the following techno scientific literature analysis assesses and describes the existing aging tests for pe pipes exposed to clo2 which have been developed until now particularly the accelerated aging tests of polyethylene pipes by chlorine dioxide exposure can be distinguished in two groups immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests the first group of methods implies the soaking of entire samples which are usually small polyethylene pieces of pipes into a chlorine dioxide solution on the contrary the second group of tests is based on the use of loops of pe pipes where a chlorine dioxide solution is continuously recirculated under fixed temperature and pressure conditions in any case after accomplishing an accelerated aging test pe pipes are subjected to a chemical mechanical characterization to evaluate the performance of the pipe material under the applied stress conditions 4 1 characterization of polyethylene pipes the objective of the characterization is to provide a clear and scientific description of the condition of tested specimens after the application of defined stress conditions the most used parameters for the characterization of pe samples after a chemical mechanical aging test include the carbonyl index ci which can be determined through fourier transform infra red ftir spectroscopy the oxidative induction time oit which can be determined by a differential scanning calorimetry dsc the degree of crystallinity which can be also determined by a differential scanning calorimetry dsc a qualitative analysis of the surface by a scanning electron microscopy sem an elongation at break by tensile test fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy acts on the principle that when infrared radiation ir passes through a sample some of the radiation is absorbed the radiation that passes through the sample is recorded the molecules with a covalent bond will selectively absorb radiation at specific wavelengths and it will change the vibrational energy in the bond the type of vibration stretching or bending induced by the infrared radiation depends on the atoms in the bond because different bonds and functional groups absorb at different frequencies the transmittance pattern is different for different molecules the spectrum is recorded on a graph with wavenumber cm 1 recorded on the x axis and transmittance or absorbance recorded on the y axis wavenumber is 1 wavelength and corresponds to the energy of the vibration of the molecular bonds the spectral region interested by the molecular bond vibration is comprised between 2500 and 25 000 nm corresponding to a range of wavenumber of 4000 400 cm 1 ftir is carried out to determine the spectra of the polymer where variation in functional group has occurred due to aging phenomena on the other side the ci is calculated as follow according to the din 53 383 2 din 53383 2 1983 11 c i e q σ 1650 σ 1850 σ 1330 σ 1500 where σ 1650 σ 1850 is the area under the absorbance peaks attributed to the carbonyl and carboxyl functional groups between the wavelengths of 1650 and 1850 cm 1 whereas σ 1330 σ 1500 represents the peak area between the wavelengths 1330 nm and 1500 nm which are the scissoring bending signals of the methylene groups constituting the polymer chains almond et al 2020 determination of ftir spectra and of the ci can highlight the formation of carbonylic and carboxylic oxidation products which can be related to the degradation of the polyethylene as well as to the consumption of the antioxidant hence higher values of ci are indicative of a higher oxidation state of the material bredács et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 the oit measurement is a fundamental parameter for the studies of polyethylene aging and it is defined as the time to the onset of oxidation of a test specimen exposed to an oxidizing gas at an elevated temperature the oit can be calculated through dsc measurement which is one of the main thermal analysis techniques that can be used to characterize many types of materials including polymers metals and ceramic materials particularly to estimate the oit parameter by dsc the specimen and a reference material are heated at a constant rate in an inert gas environment created by flowing nitrogen when a target temperature is reached generally in the range 190 210 c the atmosphere of the testing environment is changed by supplying oxygen or air at the same flow rate the specimen is then held at constant temperature until the oxidative reaction is displayed on the recorded thermal curve hence the isothermal oit is determined by measuring the time interval between the initiation of oxygen or air supply and the onset of the oxidative reaction iso 2018 there is a linear correlation between the oit value and the concentration of phenolic antioxidants in the polymer bredács et al 2016 however the oit cannot quantify the performance of stabilization packages if any components do not have at least one phenolic group costa et al 2016 oit value equal to zero indicates that the stabilizer package in the polyethylene is completely depleted by the oxidant kim et al 2018 since the oxidative degradation of a pe pipe occurs only between the part of the material in contact with the chlorine dioxide solution profiling the determination of oit at various depths of a specimen can be useful to understand the differences between occurred surface degradation and bulk degradation boerakker et al 2018 vertova et al 2019 the degree of crystallinity of the material is determined through dsc measurement and calculated by the ratio between the enthalpy of fusion of the sample and the enthalpy of fusion of 100 crystalline polyethylene yu et al 2011 it is considered to be an index of polyethylene degradation and as the crystallinity fraction increases the material becomes more stiffer and brittle resulting in cracks formations vertova et al 2019 particularly studies that investigated the degradation of pipe material in contact with chlorine dioxide solutions showed that the crystallinity of the exposed surface increases as a function of the time of exposure on the other side along the depth of the wall the crystallinity is generally less affected by the oxidant due to the limited contact highlighting a lower degradation of this part of the pipe vertova et al 2019 yu et al 2011 sem is used to analyze the surface morphology of the degraded specimen with a visual evaluation of the cracks formation and propagation which occur during the chemical mechanical aging of the pe and then lead to the pipe failure in stage iii bredács et al 2016 generally the obtained information is exclusively related to the surface of the specimen which is the part of the sample that encounters the oxidant solution however a more interesting approach sees the possibility to analyze the transversal section of the pipe which allows to obtain more information on the depth of the cracks and its propagation surface cracks detected by sem images have been reported by many researchers and have been also utilized to support hypotheses on crack propagation mechanisms bredàcs et al 2016 yu et al 2011 vertova et al 2019 finally elongation at break is measured by tensile test to evaluate the mechanical properties of the polyethylene before and after the exposure to chlorine dioxide this test is conducted according to the iso 6259 and it is a common industrial practice to evaluate the quality of the products the elongation at break tends to decrease with increasing the exposure time with the disinfectant terwyen et al 2016 other minor tests are also used for a further understanding of the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes yu et al 2001 measured molar mass distributions and crystal thickness of the polyethylene by size exclusion chromatography which indicated degradation near the crystal amorphous interface due to the chemical aging vertova et al 2019 carried out sem analysis with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds on the pe pipes to investigate which type of elements are more abundant on the polymer s surface at the end of the aging tests small quantities of chlorine were detected on the surface likely as a result of clo2 interaction with the pipes themselves also in this case accurate sampling protocols might be adopted to highlight the diffusion of chlorine in the bulk and the formation of chlorinated organic compounds which can be observed not only on the surface but also along the thickness of the material analysing the cross section of the pipe another interesting surface characterization technique is reported by khan et al 2022 which is the x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps that is used to analyze the change in chemical properties before and after the interaction of the chloride dioxide with the polymeric materials the changes in binding energy of the samples under the disinfectant conditions were evaluated over the range of 280 290 ev which reflects a change in the atomic composition of the aged and unaged samples from a saturated carbon chain to the formation of ketone aldehyde and carboxylate groups acids and esters according with the increasing of ci values khan et al 2022 therefore a sample that has undergone strong oxidation by chlorine dioxide should have a high value of the ci a lower value of the oit with a high grade of crystallinity visible cracks at the sem analysis and low elongation at break all these parameters have to be compared to the blank which did not come in contact with the oxidant solution table 3 summarises the main characterization tests of pe found in literature with their relative parameters measured and their scopes 4 2 immersion aging tests the immersion aging methods involve the dipping of entire samples inside a chlorine dioxide solution at fixed concentration temperature and ph the specimens are usually small polyethylene sheets dog bones and or pipes the chlorine dioxide solution is continuously refreshed in order to keep constant the exposure concentration here below different immersion aging tests are detailed they have been proposed by different research institutes organizations and researchers the laboratoire national de métrologie et d essais lne in france has developed a standardized accelerated aging test called nol ring creep test the method involves the soaking of a ring specimen extracted from the pipe inside a clo2 solution the ring is obtained from a 32 mm hdpe pipe and has a length of 20 mm the test solution has a chlorine dioxide concentration of 2 0 mg l and a temperature of 40 c during the aging hoop stress of 7 mpa is applied to the ring specimens fig 2 briefly shows the scheme of the nol ring creep test the equipment is able to apply a stress on the circumference of the ring taken from pipes while exposing the polyethylene to the clo2 after the exposure for 250 h 500 h 1000 h the elongation at break of the aged samples is measured through a specific tensile test and compared to the samples without aging terwyen et al 2016 terwyen et al 2016 tested four commercial pipes three pe100 one pe80 and one experimental through the nol ring creep test the elongations at break of the samples without aging were about 1400 1600 after 1000 h of aging two pe100 and one pe80 had about 0 of elongation at break better results were obtained for the other two pipes the pe100 and the experimental pipe had about 100 and 800 of elongation at break respectively the laboratory of ireti italy has designed an aging unit an autoclave of 200 l where tensile test samples without hooping stress are exposed to a clo2 bath the solution has a temperature of 40 c with a ph value of 7 2 the chlorine dioxide concentration is kept constant at a defined value usually 1 5 mg l and monitored by means of probes the solution in the autoclave is renewed through a circulation flow rate of 2 7 m3 h in order to maintain constant the clo2 concentration the scheme of the aging equipment is illustrated in fig 3 test specimens are prepared from extruded pipes or from compression molded sheets according to en iso 6259 3 the exposure time varies between 30 and 90 days the aging effects are evaluated through tensile tests which are carried out according to iso 527 with a test speed of 10 mm min terwyen et al 2016 terwyen et al 2016 reported two aging tests that were carried out on three commercial pipes two pe100 and one pe80 and two experimental one test was performed at 2 mg l of clo2 for 60 days the other one was performed at 1 mg l of clo2 for 90 days at 40 c in the first test the commercial pipes recorded a reduction in the elongation at break from 600 to 50 100 after 60 days of exposure while the experimental ones had an elongation at failure around 300 350 at the end of the trial the second test was performed at lower chlorine dioxide concentration and resulted for the experimental pipes in unchanged elongation at break throughout the whole aging test around 600 after 60 days of aging the elongation at failure for commercial pipes reduced from 600 to 250 350 while after 90 days of exposure it dropped around 50 150 in an aging test developed by lyondellbasell the tensile test samples are placed inside an autoclave with a solution that has a clo2 concentration of 20 mg l temperature of 60 c and ph value of 6 5 no stress is applied to the test specimens and the solution is refreshed with a circulating velocity of 1 m s the aging apparatus is similar to the equipment shown in fig 3 the maximum exposure time is about 500 h viscosity number melt flow index degree of oxidation with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and residual levels of antioxidants with differential scanning calorimeter dsc of the samples are determined for the aging evaluation vogt et al 2010 vogt et al 2010 reported that the values of oit at 210 c of pe specimens are influenced by the presence of different antioxidants in the polymer in one case the oit of a pe specimens dropped below 10 min after 100 h of exposure to 20 mg l of clo2 and a temperature of 60 c on the other side testing pe specimens with a different stabilizer resulted in an oit around 30 min after 100 h of exposure under the same experimental conditions in this case the oit dropped below 10 min after 500 h of aging subsequently to the immersion aging the pipes were tested through pipe pressure test according to the astm f2023 for the determination of time to failure the astm f2023 may be labelled as pressurized pipe loop aging test it is specific for pex pipes and it is similar to the astm f2263 van der stok et al 2018 this test is specific for pe pipes and will be described in the following paragraph as results of the immersion test a shorter failure time of the pipes was demonstrated to be linked to a faster consumption of the antioxidants in the polymer polymer competence center leoben pccl in cooperation with mechatronik moharitsch developed an exposure device of 50 l where the unstressed blocks of pe pipes are placed for 900 h the maximum clo2 concentration is 10 mg l the test temperature is about 60 c with a ph of 6 8 resulting in an orp of 650 mv the recirculation flow rate is about 500 l h the device is analogues to the device in fig 3 after the exposure time compression molded sheets and dog bone shaped specimens are punched out from the pe pipes according to the iso 18 488 thereby the samples are subject to tensile test load speed of 50 mm min scanning electron microscopy sem ftir for carbonyl index ci calculation and dsc for oxidation onset temperature oot determination bredács et al 2016 bredács et al 2016 tested two commercial pipes with standard antioxidants the elongation at break of the first commercial pipe was reduced from 500 to 310 220 and 50 respectively for 1 week 2 weeks and 3 weeks of aging while in the case of the second pipe the elongation dropped from 600 to about 50 only after 340 h of exposure through the sem analyses a surface roughness was observed after only 1 week of exposure whereas surface micro cracks appeared after 3 weeks of aging both samples showed an increase in the ci from zero to about 25 30 after 900 h of aging showing an inverse proportional relationship with the elongation at break moreover after 900 h of aging the oot decreased from 270 c to 240 c indicating the consumption of the antioxidant in the polymer kth royal institute of technology reported their accelerated aging test in which the unstressed film tape specimens 0 3 mm thick made with the polyethylene containing additives are exposed to a continuous supply of chlorine dioxide solution at 10 mg l ph of 6 8 and temperature of 70 c the kth test method is carried out at the laboratory scale with a compact set up subsequently oxygen induction time oit at different exposure times is measured to evaluate the chemical resistance of antioxidants costa et al 2016 costa et al 2016 tested pe specimens and their antioxidants by the kth method in order to quickly assess their resistance to the chlorine dioxide exposure for instance the oits at 210 c of three pe80 and one pe100 specimens with different stabilizer were compared in one pe80 the oit decreases from 30 min to almost zero after only 16 h of aging while the other samples reached oit values of zero after 80 120 h of exposure subsequently to the kth test the suez aging method which will be described in the following section was carried out in order to deeply understand the performance of the same pe pipes in terms of failure time the limitation of the oit test is that it may not show the real performance of the oxidants against the chlorine dioxide if the stabilizer package contains any component without a phenolic group for instance costa et al 2016 described one pe80 pipe containing a non phenolic group in the stabilizer package with a lower oit than one pe80 with phenolic groups however in the suez test a higher lifetime was recorded for the first pe 80 pipe table 4 reports a summary of the immersion aging methods found in literature with indication of the main operating parameters main findings and the parameters used for studying the aging of polyethylene pipes due to clo2 exposure although operating conditions are different between the proposed tests different techniques can be used to characterize the material and stabilizer packages of the pe pipes is usually not specified leading to a lot of variability in the obtained results it is still possible to compare some of the described aging tests water temperature greater than or equal to 70 c contribute to the sudden oit depletion in few hours comparing nol ring test and ireti test which are carried out applying the same concentration of clo2 and water temperature the effect of the pressure on the mechanical properties of the pe material may be noticed the initial elongation at break of the pe specimen in the nol ring test is about 1400 and it is reduced to 100 after 41 days of testing while in the case of ireti method the elongation at break of the initial specimen is about 600 and drops to 100 after 60 days of aging 4 3 pressurized pipe loop pressurized pipe loop tests are the accelerated aging methods which are more suitable to simulate real conditions in service fig 4 shows the schematic representation of a pressurized pipe loop which includes a loop of pe pipes where a chlorine dioxide solution is continuously recirculated at fixed concentration temperature and ph for a certain exposure time the pe pipes are subject to an internal pressure hoop stress and they are studied by means of the previous described characterization tests afterwards the aging and or by obtaining the time to failure parameters probes and heaters are generally used to maintain constant clo2 concentration temperature and ph as for immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests were proposed by different research institutes organizations and researchers although the apparatus used are analogous to the one in fig 4 test conditions vary considerable and here below different pressurized pipe loop tests are detailed american society for testing and materials astm international proposes the astm f2263 method in which polyethylene pipes undergo pressure testing with water containing chlorine dioxide until failure the goal of the test is the determination of the lifetime of pe pipes which are subject to chemical mechanical aging astm f2263 was initially developed to test pipes under pressure with disinfectant subsequently it was revised for application with chlorine in order to evaluate pipes failure in stage iii van der stok et al 2018 afterwards it was affirmed that they are also valid for clo2 and chloramine aging tests astm f2263 involves a minimum of twelve trials the pe pipes are exposed to the same concentration of chlorine dioxide with three different temperatures until failure for each trial at different temperature two distinct hoop stresses are applied the chlorine dioxide solution should have a concentration between 2 5 mg l and 5 mg l and a ph between 6 5 and 8 in such that the orp is greater than 825 mv the trial temperatures are usually 90 c 80 c and 70 c while the hoop stress varies between 2 48 mpa and 3 31 mpa considering a pe tube with a standard dimensional ratio 9 sdr9 the internal pressure ranges from 6 2 bar to 8 3 bar slightly lower pressures are recommended to develop a failure mode in stage iii astm international 2015 the suggested nominal size for test piping is between 1 2 inch and 4 inches and the pipe length should be ranging from 300 mm to 460 mm the flow velocity must be sufficient to maintain an orp greater than 825 mv previous tests with a pe sdr9 tube have used a minimum velocity around 0 04 m s hence the time to failure of the pipes at different trial temperatures and hoop stresses was determined the pipe lifetime is calculated through a linear regression multi parametric analysis according to ppi tn 196 method or iso 9080 the time to failure prediction according to the multiple linear regression of the iso 9080 may be defined as 12 l o g t c 1 c 2 1 t c 3 l o g σ c 4 l o g σ t e where c1 to c4 are parameters used in the model t is the time failure t is the temperature σ is the hoop stress and e is the error variable from laplace gaussian distribution it has been reported time to failure of 44 57 days for pe pipes with a trial temperature of 90 c and about 4 bars of internal pressure astm international 2015 hassinen and svedberg 2010 pointed out that extreme conditions of the astm f2263 with high stress and high temperatures may result in stage ii rather than stage iii failure moreover a small change in the extrapolation data will have big impact on the predictions due to the flat behavior of the regression lines resulting in performance estimations which may be overly pessimistic or optimistic hassinen and svedberg 2010 suez research center has developed a pressure testing with a chlorine dioxide solution until pe pipe failure different test parameters are changed compared to the astm f2263 the trail temperature is about 40 c with a clo2 concentration of 1 mg l and internal pressure of 6 bars for pe pipes the loop has a flow rate of 0 2 m3 h considering a nominal size of 25 mm as reported in literature the velocity in the pipes is about 0 14 m s boerakker et al 2018 although the suez method is qualified to compare different pe pipes resin and provide the pipe lifetime reported time to failure in literature for a pe pipe dn 25 thickness of 3 mm is about 18 months costa et al 2016 costa et al 2016 discussed that although the suez test method is reliable in evaluating the material performance it may not be used as accelerated test method for fast qualification of new pe pipes comparing the astm f2263 and the suez test method it can be observed that the astm f2263 reaches the pipe failure in 1 2 months though the extreme trial conditions may not reflect a pipe failure in stage iii on the other side the suez test is considered to be more representative of real conditions and reliable to monitor mechanical and chemical aging but the elevated time to reach the pipe failure more than 2 months may hindered its application yu et al 2011 proposed a pressure testing of 66 days to investigate the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes due to chlorine dioxide exposure the test conditions are water temperature of 90 c chlorine dioxide concentration of 4 mg l with a ph equal to 6 8 since the hoop stress is 1 65 mpa and the pe pipes have a nominal size of 12 mm and thickness of 2 2 mm the internal pressure is around 7 bar the velocity of the fluid in the loop is about 7 m s such test conditions do not allow to reach pipe failure within the exposure time the effects of clo2 on the pe pipes are assessed through the determination of oit at 210 c mass crystallinity melting peak temperature molar mass distribution as well as sem and ftir analysis of the samples yu et al 2011 reported oit profiles along the thickness of the pe pipe showing a rapid consumption of the antioxidant near the inner wall after 2 h of aging the oit on the inner surface reaches zero while the oit value for the outer surface goes to 10 min after 121 h the mass crystallinity profiles through the wall showed small variations between the pipes aged for different periods of time at the same depth whereas in the inner wall the crystallinity fraction increases from 50 to 55 after 130 h of aging the sem image showed a region with a crack formed during the aging test on each side there are zones with small cracks which may be highly degraded polymer therefore yu et al 2011 proposes that the crack growth mechanism may be defined as a degradation assisted crack growth where the major crack grows until a fresh zone then the chlorine dioxide attacks the material adjacent to the crack wall leading to the propagation of the major crack vertova et al 2019 used a test loop where the pipes are placed in parallel inside a thermostat chamber at 70 c for the investigation of the aging of metal and plastic water pipes due to clo2 the recirculated water has a temperature of 70 c a pressure of 5 bar with a velocity of 0 5 m s ph equal to 7 and chlorine dioxide concentration of 1 mg l a purge of the test fluid is advised to prevent the accumulation of disinfection by products the exposure time is about 8 weeks after which the pipes are characterized through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis ftir sem with eds and dsc for determining the change in the crystallinity of the materials the sem images reported show several cracks in the inner wall of pe pipe after 8 weeks of aging in addition traces of chlorine are present on the surface probably from the chlorine dioxide after 4 and 8 weeks of aging the ftir shows an increase in intensity in the 1750 1735 cm 1 region indicating the formation of carboxylic and carbonyl compounds in addition adsorption band between 1550 and 1620 1640 3200 3500 appeared the degradation of the polymer occurred only on the surface of pipes while at 0 3 mm of depth within the wall only the depletion of the antioxidant occurred with the disappearance of the week absorption around 1745 cm 1 finally the dsc showed that as the aging time increased the crystalline fraction of the polymer raised from 46 5 to 55 4 at the end of the test after 4 week or 8 weeks of aging the crystalline percentage at 0 3 mm of depth within the wall was higher than the surface values kim et al 2018 have studied the effect of chlorine dioxide on different pe resin through a pressure test at 5 bar with water containing 1 mg l of chlorine dioxide the aging tests are carried out in cold and hot water and further details about the trial temperature are not reported the pe pipes have a nominal size of 16 mm with a thickness of 2 mm the exposure time varied from a few hours to 1000 h for evaluating the accelerated aging effect during the time the pe pipes were mainly characterized through dsc for oit calculation providing information about the antioxidant consumption during the time exposure one pe pipe containing a base stabilization bs one containing the bs plus experimental antioxidant and another one with bs and a noted formulation xp 2090 were tested by kim et al 2018 on one hand the oit of the standard stabilizer dropped dramatically and reached zero after 1000 h of aging at lower temperature and after 500 h at higher temperature on the other hand a slower decrease in oit was obtained for the xp 2090 and the experimental one at lower temperature and after 1000 h of aging the relative oits of the xp 2090 and the experimental one were around the 60 of the oit value for unaged samples castagnetti et al 2011 have investigated the aging of 100 m pipe coil in polyethylene due to chlorine dioxide effects freshwater with a clo2 concentration of 5 mg l temperature of 40 c pressure of 2 5 bars and a velocity of 1 8 m s is recirculated inside the pipe coil for 1 year at regular intervals time 30 cm of sample is cut from the pipe coil for the chemical mechanical characterization which involves oit tests at 210 c on the inner wall and on the mid layer and tensile tests with a speed of 50 mm min as a further mechanical characterization pressure tests on 1 meter of pipe were carried out according to the uni en 921 the pipes were tested for 165 1000 and 2000 h at a circumferential stress of 5 mpa and at constant temperature of 80 c furthermore samples exposed to neutral water at the same test conditions and samples exposed to ambient air were characterized in order to provide reference characteristics of naturally aged pipes in the case of exposure to chlorine dioxide the pipes have shown an abrupt decrease of the oit at the inner of the wall from the second week of test the oit values at inner surface became stable at around 90 less than its initial value almost equal to zero minutes after two months of aging the decrease in the oit on the mid layer of the pipe wall was quite low from 50 to 30 min after 365 days of aging all the pipe samples survived the pressure tests at a constant temperature for up to 2000 h indicating that a high degree of antioxidant consumption does not necessarily imply a decrease in the mechanical performance castagnetti et al 2011 aliaxis corporate r d center has developed a method to assess in accelerated mode the resistance of pe pipe to chlorine dioxide the test involves a trial loop with pe pipes dn 32 where a clo2 solution with a concentration of 70 mg l temperature of 40 c 1 bar of pressure is recirculated inside up to 4000 h after the exposure time the polyethylene is characterized by ftir and dsc for oit determination carmier et al 2012 carmier et al 2012 tested and compared pe100 pipes with a protective inner layer in pvdf and plain pe pipes by means of the aliaxis aging method in the case of the plain pe the ftir showed some oxidation peak at 1720 cm 1 while in the pe100 protected by the pvdf there was absence of oxidation peaks moreover the plain pe showed a very fast reduction of oit which reached zero in 254 h of aging on the contrary the pe100 protected by the pvdf remained well above the usual required minimum oit of 20 min at 200 c finally the peel strength of the pvdf layers from the pe structural layer was determined where the peeled 10 mm strip was pulled at 50 mm min only after 1500 h of aging the peel strength dropped below the recommended minimum value of 15 n cm table 5 reports a summary of the pressurized pipe loop methods found in literature with indication of the main operating parameters main findings and the parameters measured for studying the chemical mechanical aging of polyethylene pipes due to the clo2 exposure as in the case of immersion aging tests pressurized pipe loop tests present a lot of variability in terms of operating conditions and characterization results both astm f2263 and suez method involves the aging of the pe until the pipe failure without application of any characterization method the astm f2263 may reach the failure in a short time two months thanks to the high chlorine dioxide concentration and water pressure the suez method which involves the application of middle aging parameters may need more than one year to achieve the failure of the pe pipes the aging time needed to reach oit equal to zero for the inner surface of the pipe and to affect the percentage of crystallinity of the tested material are dependent on the utilized water temperature and chlorine dioxide concentration as in the case of immersion aging tests extreme temperature conditions t 70 c may lead to the oit depletion of the inner surface and in abrupt increasing of the crystallinity in few hours the formation of cracks generally occurs after 40 60 days of aging and no clear correlations with other operating parameters may be noticed 5 comparison of the accelerated aging tests and methods as mentioned above the aging of the pe pipes in water distribution system due to chlorine dioxide exposure is a chemical mechanical process on one side the concentration of clo2 and its by products affects the depletion of the antioxidant as well as the degradation of the polymer on the other side the applied pressure hoop stress on the pe pipe determines the crack propagation time other operating parameters such as temperature pipe thickness water ph and contact time contribute to accelerating the chemical mechanical aging of pe pipes accelerated aging tests should aim to accurately replicate the normal aging of pe pipes to preserve the degradation mechanisms occurring in water distribution networks the main sources of error found in accelerated aging tests a are due to the either exaggeration or lack of those operational parameters mostly contributing to the pe pipes aging under real condition service such as clo2 concentration water pressure and temperature there are not experimental studies reported in the literature that quantify the errors of the acceleration experiment from the normal aging of pe pipes in service however a qualitative assessment of these errors is discussed below in this work typical chlorine dioxide concentration in pressurized pipe loops varies between 1 and 5 mg l with a maximum pressure of 5 8 bars and trial temperature ranging from 40 c to 90 c the applied pressure in the pipe is well known as one of the main factors contributing to the crack propagation after the formation due to the chemical oxidation of the surface until the pipe failure jana laboratories inc 2010b aging tests without applied stresses as in the case of many immersions aging trials may be not considered representative of the chemical mechanical aging the range of applied temperature in loop tests is quite wide affecting the exposure time and the linked effects on the pe pipes van der stok et al 2018 pointed out the trial temperature should remain within certain limits which are comparable to the practice in water distribution systems the physical antioxidant loss is affected by the temperature and should not be confused with the antioxidation depletion due to chlorine dioxide exposure moreover an elevated applied temperature likely induces a pipe failure in stage ii rather than in stage iii van der stok et al 2018 the maximum advised temperature for commercial pe pipes is generally around 60 c din 8074 2011 although there are no findings about the relation between velocity and aging moderate loop velocities are found in the literature 0 04 0 5 m s likely resulting in longer contact time between chlorine dioxide chlorite chlorate and pe pipes astm f2263 and suez methods imply the aging of the pe pipes until failure with the aim to estimate the lifetime of the pipes these tests do not provide information about the degradation mechanisms which lead to the aging of the pe pipes van der stok et al 2018 hence both mechanical and chemical characterization are needed to evaluate the pe pipe aging and verify that the simulated degradation mechanisms are the same of those occurring in real service conditions costa et al 2016 as mentioned before subsequently to the aging test the most used parameters for pe characterization are the carbonyl index oxygen induction time degree of crystallinity qualitative analysis of the surface with sem and elongation at break from the analysis of the literature no evidence of aging tests with extreme test conditions leading to pipe failure in short time e g astm f2263 may replicate the chemical mechanical aging that occurs in real service conditions stage iii on one side elevated temperature and pressure may result in a mechanical brittle failure of the pipe in pe stage ii on the other side aging tests with too high concentrations of chlorine dioxide compared to those in real service conditions may alter the degradation mechanisms neglecting the synergy between the chemical and the mechanical aging in contrast more realistic test conditions replicate better the chemical mechanical aging which occurs in the water distribution system van der stok et al 2018 although the pipe failure does not occur during the trial time of these tests the depletion of the antioxidant on the pipe surface increases of the crystallinity degree and the carbonyl index are detected by pe characterization methods bredács et al 2016 vertova et al 2019 yu et al 2011 these results and findings may allow the comparison between pe pipes with different resins and additives and the determination of degradation kinetics in addition the described aging methods did not assess the consumption of chlorine dioxide and the formation of its by products which occurs during the tests the comparison of the bulk and wall kinetics of chlorine dioxide and its by products during aging tests with the kinetics obtained in full scale drinking water distribution systems may be useful to compare the accelerated and the normal aging of pe pipes in service therefore the determination of clo2 clo2 and clo3 kinetics for accelerated aging tests is recommended to critically assess and evaluate the characterization results of the pe pipes and the exposure time to the chlorine dioxide 6 conclusions in this review paper aging mechanisms of pe pipes exposed to chlorine dioxide are introduced and discussed the macroscopic degradation mechanism between pe pipes and clo2 is the same of that occurring with other disinfectants it generally involves i depletion of antioxidants at pipe surface in contact with chlorine dioxide ii degradation of the polymer with then micro cracks initiation and ii cracks propagation until pipe failure the aging mechanism occurring in service is a chemical mechanical process that leads to pipe failure in stage iii high reactivity between clo2 and antioxidants of polyethylene i e phenols is generally reported however it is not clear if the chlorine dioxide may directly initiate radical chain reactions after antioxidant depletion or it reacts with hindered phenols in the polymer to produce radicals which may lead to chain reactions further investigation is needed to understand the roles of antioxidants in the degradation of the pe pipes operating parameters influencing chemical mechanical aging in real drinking water distribution systems were discussed the main factors affecting the degradation mechanisms of pe pipes are the chlorine dioxide concentrations water pressure and water temperature however other environmental factors such as pipe size pipe installation and water ph may aid the premature failure of pipes subsequently accelerated aging methods and characterization tests of pe pipes after exposure to chlorine dioxide are described and critically discussed several aging tests are proposed by standards and developed by research centres they may be subdivided into immersion aging and pressurized pipe loop the main scope of these tests is the assessment of performances of pe pipes in contact with chlorine dioxide in a short time while preserving the degradation mechanisms occurring in service the application of unreasonable clo2 concentration water pressure and temperature in accelerated aging tests is found to be the main cause of errors in the replication of the normal aging of pe pipes further research is needed for the quantification of these aging replication errors which is currently missing in the literature and may certainly lead to the improvement of the pe pipes lifetime prediction in addition no accelerated aging methods reported the concentrations of clo2 by products such as clo2 and clo3 and their possible oxidation effects on pe degradation although chlorite and chlorate have lower oxidation strength than chlorine dioxide their concentrations should be monitored and annotated in accelerated aging reports to strengthen transparency and comparability of methods pressurized pipe loop methods are the most reliable tests to simulate real aging conditions in water distribution systems within this category aging tests with extreme operating conditions compared to realistic ones i e high clo2 concentration high pressure high temperature may lead to pipe failure in stage ii rather than stage iii therefore semi realistic operating parameters are recommended to simulate the realistic degradation of pe pipes chlorine dioxide concentration ranging between 1 and 5 mg l water pressure from 4 to 7 bars and water temperature below 60 c are proposed as operating conditions although these aging methods do not reach the pipe failure in a short time less than one month the chemical mechanical characterization of aged pe pipes provides a real insight into the degradation mechanisms and allows performances comparison none of semi realistic aging methods attempted to predict the lifetime of pe pipes under real operating conditions considering the results of material characterization after clo2 exposure this fact limits their possible application for commercial purposes it is recommended to validate the characterization results of pe pipes after accelerated aging experiments by comparing them with results of the characterization of pe pipes operated under real condition service future research should explore the existence of possible correlations between chemical mechanical parameters of pe pipes and their real lifetime in water distribution systems table 2 declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

14777,wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation is a widespread beneficial practice in line with the sustainable development goals however contaminants of emerging concern cecs present in wastewater such as pharmaceuticals pose an environmental risk the tula valley in mexico is one of the world s largest agricultural areas reusing wastewater for agriculture however no untargeted cec monitoring has been undertaken there limiting the information available to prioritise local environmental risk assessment furthermore cec environmental presence in the global south remains understudied compared to the global north there is a risk that current research efforts focus on cecs predominantly found in the global north leading to strategies that may not be appropriate for the global south where the pollution profile may be different to address these knowledge gaps a sampling campaign at five key sites in the tula valley was undertaken and samples analysed using multi residue targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods using the targeted data ten cecs were found to be of environmental risk for at least one sampling site 4 tert

six of these have not been previously quantified in the tula valley over one hundred pollutants never previously measured in the area were identified through untargeted analysis supported by library

the global north south discrepancy remains it is a complex issue to address due to differences in economic resources available for scientific research in the global north and south as well as differing scientific priorities reidpath and allotey 2019 for instance should analysing cecs to inform on risk for wastewater reuse take priority over delivering equitable sanitation are these two examples which each contribute to several sdgs in conflict or complementary to one other the occurrence of cecs vary geographically in pollutant type and concentration depending on factors such as usage environmental conditions and wastewater treatment practices tran et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand the presence and environmental fate of cec in each area to develop practices and technologies that work locally the tula valley in mexico is one of the world s largest areas where untreated wastewater has been used for irrigation for over 100 years chávez mejía et al 2019 in the past 10 years the construction and commissioning of the atotonilco wastewater treatment plant wwtp has taken place with the aim of reducing some of the risks associated with wastewater reuse while maintaining its benefits e g high nutrient content this has been achieved by only using biological treatment on half of the influent flowrate which the farmers of the area value mexican ministry of the environment and natural resources 2007 some areas of the tula valley are now irrigated using treated water from the atotonilco wwtp however other areas are irrigated using untreated wastewater chávez mejía et al 2019 a recent review highlighted the need for further environmental cec monitoring in areas where wastewater enters the environment in mexico vázquez tapia et al 2022 to date only targeted analysis cec monitoring has been undertaken in the tula valley gibson et al 2010 félix cañedo duran alvarez and jiménez cisneros 2013 lesser et al 2018 chávez mejía et al 2019 duran alvarez et al 2021 rodríguez varela et al 2021 vázquez tapia et al 2022 targeted studies permit accurate quantification of specific and known cecs allowing for environmental risk quotient calculations gadd et al 2010 ma and yates 2017 phonsiri et al 2019 some previous studies have reported risk quotients based on a reduced number of sampling events as an exercise for prioritising contaminants in the aquatic environment aznar alemany et al 2018 aminot et al 2019 however targeted studies often do not include metabolites and transformation products unless these have already been identified and thus subsequently included in the targeted analysis di carro et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 wielens becker et al 2020 pharmaceuticals and natural hormones are often excreted as conjugated metabolites such as glucuronides or sulphates which can be deconjugated in wastewater treatment plants or in the environment gomes et al 2009 similarly parent pollutants may be transformed to other compounds in the wastewater treatment process come of them more bioactive than the parent compound rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 furthermore data on toxicity from transformation products and metabolites is scarce and these pollutants may be found at higher concentrations than the parent pollutant carter et al 2019 targeted analysis especially in areas with limited knowledge on presence and transformation is likely to miss transformation products metabolites illegal drugs and other unknown pollutants either because they are not yet known or due to a lack of analytical reference standards di carro et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 alygizakis et al 2019 untargeted analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lchrms ms allows the identification of a wide range of chemicals for which standards may not be available richardson and ternes 2018 there is a need for an untargeted study in the tula valley to identify for the first time what unknown cecs are present this will better align the global south to the north and make possible the utilisation of site specific knowledge to more appropriately inform environmental policy develop wastewater treatment technologies and implement practices to minimise chemical pollution risk while still reaping the benefits of wastewater reuse therefore the objectives of this study were to analyse tula valley water samples using a multi residue targeted and an untargeted method for initial prioritization based on risk quotients obtained from a single time point and identification of unknown pollutants which may be of concern in the area 2 experimental 2 1 site description and sampling campaign the tula valley 85 000 ha lies between latitudes 19 54 and 20 30 north and longitudes 99 22 and 98 56 west the mean annual temperature is 16 7 c rainfall ranges from 435 to 618 mm and falls between may and october the 1663 million m3 mm3 per year of wastewater generated in the metropolitan zone of mexico city is transported 80 km to the tula valley through the subterranean central emitter carrying an average of 1255 8 mm3 yr 1 and the open air gran canal transporting an average of 407 2 mm3 yr 1 chamizo checa et al 2020 in 2015 the atotonilco wwtp was commissioned to remove pathogens but to leave most of the nutrients as well as maintain the flowrates used for irrigation conagua 2007 this plant aims to treat 60 of the central emitter flow as shown in fig 1 untreated wastewater joins the tula river in the west part of tula valey while the influent of the wwtp is divided into two streams one stream is treated by coagulation flocculation sedimentation followed by chlorination the other is biologically treated using conventional activated sludge then disinfection the combined effluent enters the tula river mixing with untreated wastewater the effluents mixture and untreated wastewater is conducted to the irrigation area by gravity chávez mejía et al 2019 on the other hand the wastewater from the grand canal to the east of tula valley remains untreated and is directly re utilised in croplands rodríguez varela et al 2021 sampling was undertaken during the dry season therefore cec presence is presumably at its highest due to minimal dilution lesser et al 2018 the five sampling locations are marked in fig 1 untreated and treated mixed effluent from both treatment streams wastewater from atotonilco wwtp the tlamaco canal which transports untreated wastewater to croplands a mixture of treated and untreated wastewater from the endho dam and the cerro colorado spring which is water that over decades has percolated through the soil and recharged the local aquifer chávez mejía et al 2019 grab samples were collected in amber glass bottles on the 30th of march 2019 the sampling depth was 20 cm below surface with sampling from as all points mid way between the edges taken via either bridges or from a boat throughout the sampling day samples were kept at 4 0 0 5 c then preserved in the fridge at 4 0 0 5 c vanderford et al 2011 shimko et al 2023 as an additional precaution 1 ml of methanol was added to each 1 l bottle on arrival to the laboratory samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until they were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges 48 h after sampling 2 2 solid phase extraction all samples were centrifuged at 10 500 rpm for 8 min except the cerro colorado spring water endho dam water was additionally filtered using 8 µm particle retention ashless filters whatman uk the solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography methods have been validated for a multi residue hplc ms ms targeted analysis and are reported elsewhere garduno jimenez et al in review briefly hlb solid phase extraction cartridges 500 mg 6 cc from waters elstree uk were conditioned using 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of tri distilled water 250 ml of the aqueous sample were loaded at 5 ml min 1 cartridges were dried under vacuum methanol 8 ml was used for elution with no vacuum and when dripping stopped vacuum was applied for a few seconds to collect all the eluate analytical duplicates from each sampling location were passed through separate spe cartridges and analysed in both targeted and untargeted modes using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 2 3 chromatographic separation chromatographic separation was similar for both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry analysis samples were analysed first in acidic and then in basic chromatography using a c18 gemini phenomenex 100 3 mm particle diameter 2 µm column the column was kept at 50 c for the acidic chromatography mobile phase a was aqueous 0 1 formic acid and b was acetonitrile with a starting composition of 95 a the gradient ran from 95 to 5 a over 6 min and was maintained for 1 6 min initial composition was re established over 0 8 min and kept for 1 8 min for re equilibration with a total duration of 10 min for the basic chromatography mobile phase a was aqueous 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate in water and b was acetonitrile the starting composition was 85 a and it was ramped to 5 a over 6 min then it was kept at 5 a for 1 4 min and ramped back to initial conditions over 1 6 min lastly it was kept at initial 85 a composition for 1 4 min with a total run time of 10 min the injection volume was 10 µl and the flow rate 0 3 ml min 1 for both chromatographic modes 2 4 targeted analysis for targeted analysis 32 chemicals were selected table s2 based on previously measured concentrations which have been reported to be environmentally toxic their inclusion in priority lists such as the second eu s watch list loos et al 2018 or the top 10 of most commonly reported pharmaceuticals in wastewaters wilkinson et al 2017 however this data is mainly from the global north which is why the complementary untargeted analysis is so important the analysis was carried out using a triple quadrupole agilent scientific 1290 series uplc ms ms for samples analysed using the acidic chromatography positive ionisation mode was used with a capillary voltage of 5000 v while for the basic chromatography ionisation was done in negative mode with a capillary voltage of 3000 v the source temperature was 350 and 200 c and the nebuliser pressure was 50 and 45 psi for the positive and negative ionisation modes respectively the drying gas flow was 7 and 13 l min 1 for the positive and negative ionisation modes respectively sheath gas flow was 12 l min 1 for both modes all analytes were analysed in mrm mode with a quantifier and qualifier product ion details in table s1 all runs were carried out with twelve point calibration curves 0 5 300 ng ml 1 at the start and end and quality controls qcs consisting of the seventh and ninth calibration levels every five samples to ensure instrumental stability spe recoveries are reported in garduno jimenez et al in review method limits of detection and linearity can be found in table s2 2 5 untargeted analysis untargeted analysis was carried out using a q exactive plus mass spectrometer ms equipped with dionex u3000 uhplc system thermo fisher scientific hemel hempstead uk the untargeted mass spectrometry method as well as the computation workflow development and validation are reported elsewhere garduno jimenez et al in review briefly the mass spectrometry method was the same for both chromatographic methods and was operated in simultaneous esi and esi acquisition modes the spray voltage was 3 5 kv esi and 3 5 kv esi and the s lens rf level was 50 for both modes the sheath auxiliary and sweep gas flow rates were 45 10 and 2 25 arbitrary units respectively for both modes capillary and heater temperatures were maintained at 375 and 350 c respectively data was acquired for the lchrms profiling with a resolution of 70 000 from m z 70 to 1050 in addition top 10 data dependant ms ms ddms ms was performed at a resolution of 17 500 and a stepped normalised collision energy nce of 20 30 and 40 a thirteen point calibration curve 50 1000 ng ml 1 was run at the start and end of samples along with quality controls consisting of the seventh and ninth calibration levels every five samples to ensure signal stability compound discoverer 3 1sp1 thermofisher scientific hemel hempstead uk was used for cec identification with a workflow developed and validated previously garduno jimenez et al in review briefly spectra were selected in the range of 100 da 5000 retention times were aligned across the sample sequence with 2 min tolerance compounds were identified allowing for methanol potassium and sodium adducts with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm a signal to noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak intensity of 10 000 arbitrary units compounds identified were searched in the mzcloud based on the mass spectrum obtained if it was not found in this database the mass list search and chem spider were then searched the unknown pollutants identified were screened with the following criteria based on the method validated in garduno jimenez et al in review i present in both analytical duplicates and not in blanks ii retention time 20 s across the sample sequence and iii minimum 80 mzcloud match score with matching parent ion and at least one matching product ion 5 ppm mass accuracy to the database pollutants were identified with level 2 confidence meaning their presence was confirmed by comparison of the mass spectrum obtained to that of the mzcloud database which is considered the maximum confidence possible without a chemical reference standard sumner et al 2007 2 6 risk quotient calculations risk quotients rqs indicate whether a pollutant concentration is above the minimum found to harm a representative species from a specific trophic level peake et al 2016a rqs were calculated as the ratio between the concentrations measured at each sampling point and the predicted no effect concentration pnec phonsiri et al 2019 pnecs were obtained from literature table s3 with the lowest being used for the antibiotics the minimum inhibitory concentration mic the lowest concentration of an antibiotic preventing a specific organism growth under in vitro conditions was also evaluated amr industry alliance 2018 table s3 oestrogenic activity risks to aquatic organisms were calculated using the total oestrogenic equivalent eeqtotal gadd et al 2010 ma et al 2016 according to eq 1 1 e e q t o t a l e e q i c i e e f i where eeqi oestrogenic equivalent quotient of compound i these are reported in the supporting information and are valued from the literature ci concentration measured eefi oestrogenic equivalent factor which is defined as the ratio of the observed half maximal ec50 oestrogenic activity of oestradiol for each pollutant gadd et al 2010 ma et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 prioritising pollutants based on environmental risk or estrogenicity acetaminophen was found at the highest concentration in a range of 2 1 to 3 0 μg l 1 table 1 within previously reported ranges in the tula valley and latin america lesser et al 2018 peña guzmán et al 2019 the high acetaminophen concentrations translated to rqs 1 similar to previous reports in mexico rivera jaimes et al 2018 other latin american countries valdez carrillo et al 2020 and african countries fekadu et al 2019 therefore existing data such as disposal and consumption data may be used as a starting point for pollutant prioritisation however a high concentration does not necessarily translate to environmental risk as this depends on pollutant bioactivity and local species sensitivity identifying pollutants with an rq 1 facilitates prioritisation for further environmental attention from the vast number of pollutants present in natural waters however it is not possible to find pnecs for mexican species so rqs were calculated using those mostly focusing on european species one recommendation would be to develop pnecs for mexican and other global south aquatic species for the most toxic and prevalent pollutants estrogenicity of endocrine disruptive pollutants was also calculated where oestrogenic pollutants have been shown to affect fish reproductive health arlos et al 2018 estrogenicity is a key pollution parameter which has driven environmental policy in europe alina dinu 2019 though has yet to be translated to the global south after acetaminophen pollutants with the highest concentrations in the range of thousands of ng l 1 were erythromycin naproxen sulfamethoxazole acetyl sulfamethoxazole bezafibrate diclofenac 4 tert ocylphenol and carbamazepine all these pollutants except for carbamazepine were found to have an rq 1 or to contribute to local estrogenicity in total ten pollutants presented rqs above 1 for at least one sampling site 4 tert octylphenol acetaminophen bezafibrate diclofenac erythromycin levonorgestrel simvastatin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tramadol as well as total estrogenicity combination of estrone 3 sulfate estriol and estriol 3 sulfate fig 2 sulfamethoxazole concentrations 74 8 4954 2 ng l 1 were within previous measurements in tula valley lesser et al 2018 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been found to have an rq 1 in surface water in central mexico rivera jaimes et al 2018 latin america valdez carrillo et al 2020 africa fekadu et al 2019 and south asia khan et al 2020 making sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen and trimethoprim pollutants of concern in global south tramadol is an opioid not been previously detected in surface waters from latin american peña guzmán et al 2019 valdez carrillo et al 2020 or african countries fekadu et al 2019 and was only reported in the global south to date in sri lanka surface waters at levels 5 ng l 1 fekadu et al 2019 resulting in an rq 1 for that case conversely in this study a rq 1 was observed for all sampling sites highlighting the importance of local assessments diclofenac also identified with rq 1 for all sampling points fig 2 has been measured at concentrations above pnecs in surface waters of pakistan and india khan et al 2020 but not identified as of risk in african countries fekadu et al 2019 levonorgestrel is very toxic even at concentrations below 1 ng l 1 besse and garric 2009 concentrations measured in this study table 1 were on the lower end of the range reported in latin american surface waters peña guzmán et al 2019 levonorgestrel has been found at concentrations above pnec in surface waters in other latin american countries peña guzmán et al 2019 but was not identified as of risk in africa fekadu et al 2019 or measured in south asian countries khan et al 2020 estrogenicity is of concern for all sampling points except for the cerro colorado spring fig 2 it would likely be higher if it has been possible to measure ethinyl oestradiol and estrone but their concentrations were below the limit of detection ethinyl oestradiol and estrone have been previously quantified in tula valley waters from 32 3 to 166 ng l 1 lesser et al 2018 estriol and its sulfate conjugate have not been previously measured in the tula valley and given their presence contributes to local estrogenicity these pollutants merit further study furthermore untargeted analysis results demonstrated that other pollutants may be adding to local estrogenicity such as 6 methylquinoline and 4 4 dihydroxydiphenylsulfone table 2 and table 3 table 2 presents pollutants widely detected in the global aquatic environment and also detected in global south regions but never detected in the tula valley table 3 presents pollutants not widely or never detected in global south regions the steroid hormones estrone oestradiol and estriol have all been identified of concern in african countries fekadu et al 2019 but not in south asian countries khan et al 2020 and the sulfate conjugates have not been measured in these regions meaning the risk from steroid hormones may be higher than previously estimated in the global south contaminants of emerging concern in the environment are drivers of antibiotic resistance development a current global health emergency martin et al 2018 erythromycin mic rqs were above one for all except treated wastewater effluent from the atotonilco wwtp fig 2 erythromycin has not been found as a pollutant of concern in terms of environmental toxicity in other latin american countries valdez carrillo et al 2020 or in african countries fekadu et al 2019 pollutants which are not of immediate concern for the tula valley are the opioids codeine and morphine these were not detected in any of the samples and neither have been monitored in the tula valley previously this is likely because these opioids are not produced in mexico and it is difficult to obtain them as medicines knaul 2021 naproxen carbamazepine ibuprofen ciprofloxacin and triclosan were identified to have rqs 1 in africa fekadu et al 2019 whereas they were not in the present study carbamazepine has also been reported to present rqs 1 in latin america valdez carrillo et al 2020 the fact it was not found to be of concern in the present study may be due to a single time point sampling and emphasize the need for regular sampling campaigns similarities across the global south highlight potential areas for collaboration to remediate the presence of pollutants such as acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and steroid hormones however it also highlights the importance of local environmental studies because even across regions in mexico there are differences in the pollutants with rqs 1 which should form the basis of immediate research for each area 3 2 prioritising pollutants based on those found in cerro colorado spring water analysis of the cerro colorado spring water indicated persistent and widespread pollution presence in the tula valley this is due to the water cycle where for the pollutant to be present in the groundwater feeding the spring it would be present in irrigation canals surface runoff and or groundwater percolation five pollutants were quantified in cerro colorado spring water namely levonorgestrel oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole bezafibrate and carbamazepine table 1 the physical chemical properties of cecs can be used to predict and understand their environmental distribution and prevalence for example levonorgestrel has demonstrated a weak adsorption onto soil particles and thus can be transport to the aquifer under rainfall or irrigation events yang et al 2020 which is likely why it can be found in cerro colorado spring after entering the groundwater on the other hand highly polar molecules like benzafibrate and oxytetracycline can readily be transported dissolved in water toward the aquifer while less polar but persistent molecule carbamazepine can slowly migrate through the soil layers to achieve aquifer after several irrigation or rain events conventional untargeted analysis provides no quantification only detection however recent efforts have made it possible to obtain semi quantified results from this analysis aalizadeh et al 2022 when semi quantification is not used it is possible to compare detection signals across sampling sites therefore for the untargeted data prioritising based on cecs found in cerro colorado spring water is particularly useful as it is not possible to calculate rqs twenty nine pollutants were detected using untargeted analysis in cerro colorado spring tables 2 and 3 several of which are persistent and toxic therefore further work is necessary to quantify environmental and human health risk such pollutants are the carbamazepine metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide table 2 which has been shown to be more toxic than carbamazepine under a standard oecd 233 test heye et al 2016 on the other hand the other carbamazepine metabolite detected 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine is of lower priority as it has lower predicted toxicity than carbamazepine and has been shown to have lower concentrations in groundwater due to bio transformations of sorption brezina et al 2017 cocaine has been demonstrated toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations parolini et al 2017 deserving further attention in future targeted studies in the tula valley desethylatrazine is a transformation product of the widely used pesticide atrazine the parent compound and transformation products have been found to present toxicity to zebra fish blahova et al 2020 and other species singh et al 2018 and should therefore be included in further evaluations of chemical pollution in the tula valley 2 hydroxybenzothiazole is a by product of industrial activities and has been shown to be very persistent in the environment and accumulate in human fat tissue zhang et al 2021 posing a potential long term human health risk that should be further addressed similarly 4 nitrophenol is an industrial pollutant used to manufacture dyes pesticides drugs amongst others serrà et al 2020 this pollutant is known to be prevalent in the environment serrà et al 2020 but its environmental risk has not been assessed in the tula valley and given it possesses toxic and mutagenic potential in humans and other living organisms serrà et al 2020 this pollutant should be considered in future studies in the area galaxolidone is a transformation product of galaxolide ding et al 2022 which has been reported to be prevalent in the environment and has predicted environmental toxicity wang et al 2021 therefore both galaxolidone and galaxolide should be considered for future environmental toxicity assessments in the tula valley untargeted analysis also highlights the potential toxicity from substances that do not go through any regulatory process such as adbica which is a designer drug with intended biological effects on humans uchiyama et al 2013 banister et al 2015a and has unknown environmental toxicity nicotine has reported aquatic environmental toxicity oropesa et al 2017 venugopal et al 2021 and as such should be considered in further assessments in the tula valley these pollutants are not identified in recent global cec prioritisation efforts wang et al 2022 yang et al 2022 highlighting the need for local assessments furthermore environmentally toxic caprolactam had the same order of magnitude peak in the cerro colorado spring as in the other sampling points table 2 indicating prevalence in the tula valley laurolactam a macrocyclic lactam was detected for the first time in the global south not having been included in other studies and with the highest peak area in the cerro colorado spring out of all the sampling points indicating persistence and potential accumulation making it a priority pollutant in further targeted studies in this region and the global south table 2 similarly nefopam methyl salicylate and methocarbamol were all detected in cerro colorado spring water and have not been previously detected in the global south table 2 other pollutants that are likely of particular concern for the tula valley and meriting further study are two agriculturally related pollutants the pesticide 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol and the herbicide fomesafen table 3 3 3 influence of atotonilco wwtp on cec occurrence in the tula valley the atotonilco wwtp influent flowrate is split between two treatment streams one biological and one physico chemical fig 1 whilst this process maintains the nutrient levels that farmers rely on a consequence is the likely lower cec removal compared to wwtps using only biological treatment as primary treatment is not as effective at reducing cec concentration rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate had inadequate removal in the wwtp due to relatively high 25 000 ng l 1 wastewater effluent concentrations compared to concentrations measured at other sampling points further investigation would be required to determine whether this is due to inadequate removal in the wwtp or due to very high influent concentrations either way these pollutants remain of concern in the literature these pollutants have been reported to present high 80 removal in biological treatment systems peake et al 2016a rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 wang et al 2019 acetaminophen has been reported to have very low 3 removal using coagulation alone teh et al 2016 similarly sulfamethoxazole removal is higher in advanced biological nutrient removal unit technologies versus conventional activated sludge where there is 100 aeration due to the denitrification stage wang et al 2019 atotonilco wwtp comprises conventional activated sludge biological treatment to keep the level of nutrients the farmers value conagua 2007 this highlights the complexity of maintaining water with the nutrient levels that farmers rely on against protecting the environment for those cecs that pose environmental risk 3 4 influence of natural attenuation in cec degradation for a site of the magnitude and sun irradiation of the tula valley it is important to consider that natural attenuation and dilution will play an important role in the environmental fate of cecs vázquez tapia et al 2022 the concentration of the target pollutants was the lowest in cerro colorado spring water which is the product of wastewater infiltration and further upwelling table 1 previous studies in the area have demonstrated that the agricultural soil acts as a highly effective filter of cecs the organic pollutants are first adsorbed on the organic domain of soil and then readily biodegraded by a soil biome that is highly specialized in using cecs as a carbon source or through co metabolism chávez mejía et al 2019 other abiotic processes in soil like oxidation reduction processes and hydrolysis can also take place though to a lower extent once in surface water direct and indirect photolysis can further reduce the concentration of cecs considering the high sunlight irradiation in the area along with the high concentration of dissolved salts in surface water photodegradation can play an important role in the environmental fate of organic pollutants in the cerro colorado spring on the other hand wastewater irrigation canals are open and thus gas exchange occurs to some extent which promotes aerobic biodegradation processes also important the sewage from the towns nearby is discharged in the main irrigation canals including the tlamaco and tula river biodegradation dilution and photolysis to a lower extent result in the lowering of the cec concentration in locations further from mexico city table 1 in what could be classified as an unplanned natural attenuation system that includes wastewater canals and dam along with agricultural soil table 1 examples of natural attenuation are erythromycin acetaminophen and naproxen with concentrations decreasing from untreated wastewater to points further from mexico city which can be explained by biodegradation and dilution processes on the other hand trimethoprim concentration in the dam was lower than the rest of the sampling points table 1 this could be due to the long hydraulic retention time which favours the occurrence of nitrifying processes and or adsorption on suspended solids to further precipitate radjenović et al 2009 considering the potential importance of natural attenuation processes in the removal of cecs in wastewater assessing whether natural processes may degrade pollutants to an acceptable level and thus avoid over engineering reducing resource use and carbon footprint is a priority matter of study 3 5 untargeted analysis to support equitable delivery of sdgs over one hundred pollutants not previously identified in the tula valley were identified using untargeted analysis approximately half of these pollutants have been widely studied in the global north although some like carbamazepine and diclofenac metabolites have also been measured in african and south asian countries table 2 the remaining half of the pollutants identified have not been previously measured in surface or groundwater table 3 six pollutants identified have been previously quantified using targeted analysis in the tula valley namely benzoic acid bisphenol a caffeine cotinine paraxanthine and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa table s4 two herbicides fomesafen and diuron one pesticide desethyl atrazine and one pesticide ingredient 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol were identified for the first time in the tula valley tables 2 and 3 which is expected given that it is an agricultural zone fomesafen desethyl atrazine and 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol were detected in cerro colorado spring water fomesafen diuron and 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol presented higher signals in the tlamaco canal than in the untreated wastewater this indicates these pollutants are likely being used in the area for agriculture rather than being brought in through mexico city wastewater this is another example of the importance of local practices to prioritise pollutants of concern 4 acetamidoantipyrine metabolite of metamizole was detected in this study table 2 metamizole is prohibited in the usa but used in mexico and other countries bonkowsky et al 2002 demonstrating that untargeted cec studies in the global south are urgently needed to ensure pollutant prioritisation is adequate in the region wastewater based epidemiology allows us to obtain information on the health of a population in near real time compared to other techniques such as questionaries or surveys mortality and morbidity rates prescription rates amongst others it presents several advantages it is unbiased and it can focus on a broad range of diseases and biomarkers sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 compared to prescription data it reveals what the population has actually consumed including over the counter drugs and illicit drugs archer et al 2018 however some challenges remain such as uncertainties related to the contribution population and wastewater flows sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 these challenges can be addressed with the use of biomarkers that are constantly excreted and total excretion should correlate to census population chen et al 2014 biomarkers can be used by allowing for the determination of an illegal drug consumption per capita without the need of an accurate estimate of the population as follows chen et al 2014 d r u g c o n s u m p t i o n p e r c a p i t a d r u g c o n c e n t r a t i o n b i o m a r k e r c o n c e n t r a t i o n b i o m a r k e r e x c r e t i o n r a t e d r u g e x c r e t i o n r a t e some of the pollutants identified in this study such as caffeine paraxanthine nicotine and cotinine are of interest because even though the analysis was not designed specifically for them they were detected and they have been previously identified as suitable biomarkers for wastewater based epidemiology sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 metabolites and transformation products are often missed during targeted monitoring campaigns and this can underestimate the environmental risk present from these pollutants in the environment for example 10 11 epoxy carbamazepine is the main carbamazepine metabolite and is therapeutically active paz et al 2016 carbamazepine had an rq 1 however the identification of its metabolites reveals unaccounted for toxicity related to this pollutant identification of 4 hydroxy diclofenac a diclofenac human phase i metabolite is of concern as diclofenac and its metabolites have been found to accumulate in aquatic organisms peake et al 2016a another example is 4 acetamido antipyrine a metabolite of the painkiller metamizole kim et al 2019 not previously detected in global south table 2 similarly dextrorphan a dextromethorphan metabolite has not been previously detected in the global south aquatic environment table 2 the sulfamethoxazole metabolite acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations presented an rq 1 fig 2 however this pollutant can undergo deacetylation in the environment reforming sulfamethoxazole by the action of enzymes able to deconjugate an acetylated compound and turn it back to the parent compound gomes et al 2009 assuming 100 deacetylation in the environment 86 of the acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentration would be added to the sulfamethoxazole concentration this means that at its maximum in the tula river approximately 1863 ng l 1 would be added to the 3345 ng l 1 of sulfamethoxazole present in the river most risk assessment do not consider the production of pharmaceuticals from the hydrolysis of conjugates therefore knowing the proportion of these metabolites can contribute to more accurate risk assessment it is crucially important to know the occurrence of metabolites as they can not only transform into the parent pharmaceutical compound but elicit some harmful effects to aquatic organisms 4 conclusion as the first untargeted study of contaminants of emerging concern cec in the mexican aquatic environment this work puts forward pollutants which have not been previously considered in the region and more broadly in the global south to ensure equitable sdg delivery the benefits of wastewater reuse for agriculture in the global south must be considered alongside the risks presented by cecs over 100 pollutants were detected for the first time using untargeted analysis in the tula valley for example 4 acetamidoantipyrine a drug prohibited in several countries but used in mexico other pollutants meriting further study given they were detected for the first time in the global south and due to their persistence are androsterone adbica 4 nitrophenol galaxolidone fumaric acid cocaine desethylatrazine nicotine caprolactam laurolactam nefopam and methyl salicylate methocarbamol pollutants that are likely of particular concern for the tula valley as they are agriculturally related pesticide herbicide are 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol and fomesafen untargeted analysis also unveils potential toxicity of parent drugs by identification of their metabolites and transformation products in this study carbamazepine diclofenac and metamizole metabolites were detected the targeted study carried out allowed for the prioritisation of 10 pollutants due to their environmental toxicity namely 4 tert octylphenol acetaminophen bezafibrate diclofenac erythromycin levonorgestrel simvastatin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tramadol as well as oxytetracycline and carbamazepine due to their persistence comparison with other global south studies highlighted the risk from acetaminophen carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim across the region which could be a potential opportunity for collaborative work to address this issue next steps should include carrying out toxicological studies on global south aquatic species as environmental risk assessment is based on european species local estrogenicity was found to be of higher concern than previous estimates due to the measurement of two steroid sulfate conjugates never measured in the tula valley as well as oestrogenic pollutants 6 methylquinoline and 4 4 dihydroxydiphenylsulfone identified for the first time in the region using untargeted analysis this study also highlights the delicate balance between maintaining the nutrient levels farmers depend on from wastewater reuse and improving wwtp cec removal on the other hand local climate and soil conditions can also aid in cec removal for example the photodegradation of salicylic acid further monitoring using targeted and untargeted studies for quantification and further identification as well as studying pollutants of concern in soils and crops should also be carried out to gain a comprehensive understating of the risk of cecs present in wastewater irrigation funding this work was supported by the engineering and

14777,wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation is a widespread beneficial practice in line with the sustainable development goals however contaminants of emerging concern cecs present in wastewater such as pharmaceuticals pose an environmental risk the tula valley in mexico is one of the world s largest agricultural areas reusing wastewater for agriculture however no untargeted cec monitoring has been undertaken there limiting the information available to prioritise local environmental risk assessment furthermore cec environmental presence in the global south remains understudied compared to the global north there is a risk that current research efforts focus on cecs predominantly found in the global north leading to strategies that may not be appropriate for the global south where the pollution profile may be different to address these knowledge gaps a sampling campaign at five key sites in the tula valley was undertaken and samples analysed using multi residue targeted and untargeted liquid chromatography mass spectrometry methods using the targeted data ten cecs were found to be of environmental risk for at least one sampling site 4 tert octylphenol acetaminophen bezafibrate diclofenac erythromycin levonorgestrel simvastatin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tramadol as well as total estrogenicity combination of three steroid hormones six of these have not been previously quantified in the tula valley over one hundred pollutants never previously measured in the area were identified through untargeted analysis supported by library spectrum match examples include diclofenac and carbamazepine metabolites and area specific pollutants such as the herbicide fomesafen this research contributes to characterising the presence of cecs in the global south as well as providing site specific data for the tula valley graphical abstract image graphical abstract data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater reuse for agricultural irrigation has multiple benefits drechsel et al 2022 especially in the face of changing weather patterns holt giménez et al 2012 increasing food demand un wwap 2015 and water scarcity world economic forum 2017 wastewater is available all year round jovanovic 2008 and contains valuable nutrients jimenez cisneros 2006 helmecke et al 2020 adequate wastewater reuse closely aligns with several united nations sustainable development goals sdgs in particular zero hunger clean water and sanitation sustainable cities and communities responsible consumption and production life below water and life on land despite the benefits and prominence of the practice thebo et al 2017 environmental and health risks are posed by pathogens heavy metals and contaminants of emerging concern cecs drechsel et al 2022 these latter include pharmaceuticals illegal drugs pesticides etc and are known to possess environmental toxicity carter et al 2019 as well as promote antimicrobial resistance feng et al 2021 recent global studies show that 80 of wastewater is not treated adequately and is used to irrigate 11 of croplands with higher proportions used for irrigation in the global south particularly in china india pakistan mexico and iran thebo et al 2017 kookana et al 2020 jones et al 2021 despite higher wastewater reuse for irrigation in the global south than north research regarding chemical pollution from this practice remains more prominent in the global north madikizela et al 2017 carter et al 2019 to align to the united nations sdg 17 partnerships for the goals and to reflect the fact that pollution does not respect boarders it is pivotal that the chemical pollution knowledge gap of the global south is addressed this geographical knowledge gap has been recognised for more than a decade boxall et al 2012 and to this date global chemical pollution prioritizing efforts are carried out with datasets lacking crucial information from regions like mexico central america and sub saharan africa wang et al 2022 yang et al 2022 despite efforts to bridge the knowledge gap madikizela et al 2017 fekadu et al 2019 peña guzmán et al 2019 khan et al 2020 the global north south discrepancy remains it is a complex issue to address due to differences in economic resources available for scientific research in the global north and south as well as differing scientific priorities reidpath and allotey 2019 for instance should analysing cecs to inform on risk for wastewater reuse take priority over delivering equitable sanitation are these two examples which each contribute to several sdgs in conflict or complementary to one other the occurrence of cecs vary geographically in pollutant type and concentration depending on factors such as usage environmental conditions and wastewater treatment practices tran et al 2018 therefore it is important to understand the presence and environmental fate of cec in each area to develop practices and technologies that work locally the tula valley in mexico is one of the world s largest areas where untreated wastewater has been used for irrigation for over 100 years chávez mejía et al 2019 in the past 10 years the construction and commissioning of the atotonilco wastewater treatment plant wwtp has taken place with the aim of reducing some of the risks associated with wastewater reuse while maintaining its benefits e g high nutrient content this has been achieved by only using biological treatment on half of the influent flowrate which the farmers of the area value mexican ministry of the environment and natural resources 2007 some areas of the tula valley are now irrigated using treated water from the atotonilco wwtp however other areas are irrigated using untreated wastewater chávez mejía et al 2019 a recent review highlighted the need for further environmental cec monitoring in areas where wastewater enters the environment in mexico vázquez tapia et al 2022 to date only targeted analysis cec monitoring has been undertaken in the tula valley gibson et al 2010 félix cañedo duran alvarez and jiménez cisneros 2013 lesser et al 2018 chávez mejía et al 2019 duran alvarez et al 2021 rodríguez varela et al 2021 vázquez tapia et al 2022 targeted studies permit accurate quantification of specific and known cecs allowing for environmental risk quotient calculations gadd et al 2010 ma and yates 2017 phonsiri et al 2019 some previous studies have reported risk quotients based on a reduced number of sampling events as an exercise for prioritising contaminants in the aquatic environment aznar alemany et al 2018 aminot et al 2019 however targeted studies often do not include metabolites and transformation products unless these have already been identified and thus subsequently included in the targeted analysis di carro et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 wielens becker et al 2020 pharmaceuticals and natural hormones are often excreted as conjugated metabolites such as glucuronides or sulphates which can be deconjugated in wastewater treatment plants or in the environment gomes et al 2009 similarly parent pollutants may be transformed to other compounds in the wastewater treatment process come of them more bioactive than the parent compound rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 furthermore data on toxicity from transformation products and metabolites is scarce and these pollutants may be found at higher concentrations than the parent pollutant carter et al 2019 targeted analysis especially in areas with limited knowledge on presence and transformation is likely to miss transformation products metabolites illegal drugs and other unknown pollutants either because they are not yet known or due to a lack of analytical reference standards di carro et al 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 alygizakis et al 2019 untargeted analysis using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem mass spectrometry lchrms ms allows the identification of a wide range of chemicals for which standards may not be available richardson and ternes 2018 there is a need for an untargeted study in the tula valley to identify for the first time what unknown cecs are present this will better align the global south to the north and make possible the utilisation of site specific knowledge to more appropriately inform environmental policy develop wastewater treatment technologies and implement practices to minimise chemical pollution risk while still reaping the benefits of wastewater reuse therefore the objectives of this study were to analyse tula valley water samples using a multi residue targeted and an untargeted method for initial prioritization based on risk quotients obtained from a single time point and identification of unknown pollutants which may be of concern in the area 2 experimental 2 1 site description and sampling campaign the tula valley 85 000 ha lies between latitudes 19 54 and 20 30 north and longitudes 99 22 and 98 56 west the mean annual temperature is 16 7 c rainfall ranges from 435 to 618 mm and falls between may and october the 1663 million m3 mm3 per year of wastewater generated in the metropolitan zone of mexico city is transported 80 km to the tula valley through the subterranean central emitter carrying an average of 1255 8 mm3 yr 1 and the open air gran canal transporting an average of 407 2 mm3 yr 1 chamizo checa et al 2020 in 2015 the atotonilco wwtp was commissioned to remove pathogens but to leave most of the nutrients as well as maintain the flowrates used for irrigation conagua 2007 this plant aims to treat 60 of the central emitter flow as shown in fig 1 untreated wastewater joins the tula river in the west part of tula valey while the influent of the wwtp is divided into two streams one stream is treated by coagulation flocculation sedimentation followed by chlorination the other is biologically treated using conventional activated sludge then disinfection the combined effluent enters the tula river mixing with untreated wastewater the effluents mixture and untreated wastewater is conducted to the irrigation area by gravity chávez mejía et al 2019 on the other hand the wastewater from the grand canal to the east of tula valley remains untreated and is directly re utilised in croplands rodríguez varela et al 2021 sampling was undertaken during the dry season therefore cec presence is presumably at its highest due to minimal dilution lesser et al 2018 the five sampling locations are marked in fig 1 untreated and treated mixed effluent from both treatment streams wastewater from atotonilco wwtp the tlamaco canal which transports untreated wastewater to croplands a mixture of treated and untreated wastewater from the endho dam and the cerro colorado spring which is water that over decades has percolated through the soil and recharged the local aquifer chávez mejía et al 2019 grab samples were collected in amber glass bottles on the 30th of march 2019 the sampling depth was 20 cm below surface with sampling from as all points mid way between the edges taken via either bridges or from a boat throughout the sampling day samples were kept at 4 0 0 5 c then preserved in the fridge at 4 0 0 5 c vanderford et al 2011 shimko et al 2023 as an additional precaution 1 ml of methanol was added to each 1 l bottle on arrival to the laboratory samples were kept refrigerated at 4 c until they were passed through solid phase extraction cartridges 48 h after sampling 2 2 solid phase extraction all samples were centrifuged at 10 500 rpm for 8 min except the cerro colorado spring water endho dam water was additionally filtered using 8 µm particle retention ashless filters whatman uk the solid phase extraction and liquid chromatography methods have been validated for a multi residue hplc ms ms targeted analysis and are reported elsewhere garduno jimenez et al in review briefly hlb solid phase extraction cartridges 500 mg 6 cc from waters elstree uk were conditioned using 5 ml of methanol followed by 5 ml of tri distilled water 250 ml of the aqueous sample were loaded at 5 ml min 1 cartridges were dried under vacuum methanol 8 ml was used for elution with no vacuum and when dripping stopped vacuum was applied for a few seconds to collect all the eluate analytical duplicates from each sampling location were passed through separate spe cartridges and analysed in both targeted and untargeted modes using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry 2 3 chromatographic separation chromatographic separation was similar for both targeted and untargeted mass spectrometry analysis samples were analysed first in acidic and then in basic chromatography using a c18 gemini phenomenex 100 3 mm particle diameter 2 µm column the column was kept at 50 c for the acidic chromatography mobile phase a was aqueous 0 1 formic acid and b was acetonitrile with a starting composition of 95 a the gradient ran from 95 to 5 a over 6 min and was maintained for 1 6 min initial composition was re established over 0 8 min and kept for 1 8 min for re equilibration with a total duration of 10 min for the basic chromatography mobile phase a was aqueous 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate in water and b was acetonitrile the starting composition was 85 a and it was ramped to 5 a over 6 min then it was kept at 5 a for 1 4 min and ramped back to initial conditions over 1 6 min lastly it was kept at initial 85 a composition for 1 4 min with a total run time of 10 min the injection volume was 10 µl and the flow rate 0 3 ml min 1 for both chromatographic modes 2 4 targeted analysis for targeted analysis 32 chemicals were selected table s2 based on previously measured concentrations which have been reported to be environmentally toxic their inclusion in priority lists such as the second eu s watch list loos et al 2018 or the top 10 of most commonly reported pharmaceuticals in wastewaters wilkinson et al 2017 however this data is mainly from the global north which is why the complementary untargeted analysis is so important the analysis was carried out using a triple quadrupole agilent scientific 1290 series uplc ms ms for samples analysed using the acidic chromatography positive ionisation mode was used with a capillary voltage of 5000 v while for the basic chromatography ionisation was done in negative mode with a capillary voltage of 3000 v the source temperature was 350 and 200 c and the nebuliser pressure was 50 and 45 psi for the positive and negative ionisation modes respectively the drying gas flow was 7 and 13 l min 1 for the positive and negative ionisation modes respectively sheath gas flow was 12 l min 1 for both modes all analytes were analysed in mrm mode with a quantifier and qualifier product ion details in table s1 all runs were carried out with twelve point calibration curves 0 5 300 ng ml 1 at the start and end and quality controls qcs consisting of the seventh and ninth calibration levels every five samples to ensure instrumental stability spe recoveries are reported in garduno jimenez et al in review method limits of detection and linearity can be found in table s2 2 5 untargeted analysis untargeted analysis was carried out using a q exactive plus mass spectrometer ms equipped with dionex u3000 uhplc system thermo fisher scientific hemel hempstead uk the untargeted mass spectrometry method as well as the computation workflow development and validation are reported elsewhere garduno jimenez et al in review briefly the mass spectrometry method was the same for both chromatographic methods and was operated in simultaneous esi and esi acquisition modes the spray voltage was 3 5 kv esi and 3 5 kv esi and the s lens rf level was 50 for both modes the sheath auxiliary and sweep gas flow rates were 45 10 and 2 25 arbitrary units respectively for both modes capillary and heater temperatures were maintained at 375 and 350 c respectively data was acquired for the lchrms profiling with a resolution of 70 000 from m z 70 to 1050 in addition top 10 data dependant ms ms ddms ms was performed at a resolution of 17 500 and a stepped normalised collision energy nce of 20 30 and 40 a thirteen point calibration curve 50 1000 ng ml 1 was run at the start and end of samples along with quality controls consisting of the seventh and ninth calibration levels every five samples to ensure signal stability compound discoverer 3 1sp1 thermofisher scientific hemel hempstead uk was used for cec identification with a workflow developed and validated previously garduno jimenez et al in review briefly spectra were selected in the range of 100 da 5000 retention times were aligned across the sample sequence with 2 min tolerance compounds were identified allowing for methanol potassium and sodium adducts with a mass tolerance of 5 ppm a signal to noise ratio of 3 and a minimum peak intensity of 10 000 arbitrary units compounds identified were searched in the mzcloud based on the mass spectrum obtained if it was not found in this database the mass list search and chem spider were then searched the unknown pollutants identified were screened with the following criteria based on the method validated in garduno jimenez et al in review i present in both analytical duplicates and not in blanks ii retention time 20 s across the sample sequence and iii minimum 80 mzcloud match score with matching parent ion and at least one matching product ion 5 ppm mass accuracy to the database pollutants were identified with level 2 confidence meaning their presence was confirmed by comparison of the mass spectrum obtained to that of the mzcloud database which is considered the maximum confidence possible without a chemical reference standard sumner et al 2007 2 6 risk quotient calculations risk quotients rqs indicate whether a pollutant concentration is above the minimum found to harm a representative species from a specific trophic level peake et al 2016a rqs were calculated as the ratio between the concentrations measured at each sampling point and the predicted no effect concentration pnec phonsiri et al 2019 pnecs were obtained from literature table s3 with the lowest being used for the antibiotics the minimum inhibitory concentration mic the lowest concentration of an antibiotic preventing a specific organism growth under in vitro conditions was also evaluated amr industry alliance 2018 table s3 oestrogenic activity risks to aquatic organisms were calculated using the total oestrogenic equivalent eeqtotal gadd et al 2010 ma et al 2016 according to eq 1 1 e e q t o t a l e e q i c i e e f i where eeqi oestrogenic equivalent quotient of compound i these are reported in the supporting information and are valued from the literature ci concentration measured eefi oestrogenic equivalent factor which is defined as the ratio of the observed half maximal ec50 oestrogenic activity of oestradiol for each pollutant gadd et al 2010 ma et al 2016 3 results and discussion 3 1 prioritising pollutants based on environmental risk or estrogenicity acetaminophen was found at the highest concentration in a range of 2 1 to 3 0 μg l 1 table 1 within previously reported ranges in the tula valley and latin america lesser et al 2018 peña guzmán et al 2019 the high acetaminophen concentrations translated to rqs 1 similar to previous reports in mexico rivera jaimes et al 2018 other latin american countries valdez carrillo et al 2020 and african countries fekadu et al 2019 therefore existing data such as disposal and consumption data may be used as a starting point for pollutant prioritisation however a high concentration does not necessarily translate to environmental risk as this depends on pollutant bioactivity and local species sensitivity identifying pollutants with an rq 1 facilitates prioritisation for further environmental attention from the vast number of pollutants present in natural waters however it is not possible to find pnecs for mexican species so rqs were calculated using those mostly focusing on european species one recommendation would be to develop pnecs for mexican and other global south aquatic species for the most toxic and prevalent pollutants estrogenicity of endocrine disruptive pollutants was also calculated where oestrogenic pollutants have been shown to affect fish reproductive health arlos et al 2018 estrogenicity is a key pollution parameter which has driven environmental policy in europe alina dinu 2019 though has yet to be translated to the global south after acetaminophen pollutants with the highest concentrations in the range of thousands of ng l 1 were erythromycin naproxen sulfamethoxazole acetyl sulfamethoxazole bezafibrate diclofenac 4 tert ocylphenol and carbamazepine all these pollutants except for carbamazepine were found to have an rq 1 or to contribute to local estrogenicity in total ten pollutants presented rqs above 1 for at least one sampling site 4 tert octylphenol acetaminophen bezafibrate diclofenac erythromycin levonorgestrel simvastatin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tramadol as well as total estrogenicity combination of estrone 3 sulfate estriol and estriol 3 sulfate fig 2 sulfamethoxazole concentrations 74 8 4954 2 ng l 1 were within previous measurements in tula valley lesser et al 2018 sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim have been found to have an rq 1 in surface water in central mexico rivera jaimes et al 2018 latin america valdez carrillo et al 2020 africa fekadu et al 2019 and south asia khan et al 2020 making sulfamethoxazole acetaminophen and trimethoprim pollutants of concern in global south tramadol is an opioid not been previously detected in surface waters from latin american peña guzmán et al 2019 valdez carrillo et al 2020 or african countries fekadu et al 2019 and was only reported in the global south to date in sri lanka surface waters at levels 5 ng l 1 fekadu et al 2019 resulting in an rq 1 for that case conversely in this study a rq 1 was observed for all sampling sites highlighting the importance of local assessments diclofenac also identified with rq 1 for all sampling points fig 2 has been measured at concentrations above pnecs in surface waters of pakistan and india khan et al 2020 but not identified as of risk in african countries fekadu et al 2019 levonorgestrel is very toxic even at concentrations below 1 ng l 1 besse and garric 2009 concentrations measured in this study table 1 were on the lower end of the range reported in latin american surface waters peña guzmán et al 2019 levonorgestrel has been found at concentrations above pnec in surface waters in other latin american countries peña guzmán et al 2019 but was not identified as of risk in africa fekadu et al 2019 or measured in south asian countries khan et al 2020 estrogenicity is of concern for all sampling points except for the cerro colorado spring fig 2 it would likely be higher if it has been possible to measure ethinyl oestradiol and estrone but their concentrations were below the limit of detection ethinyl oestradiol and estrone have been previously quantified in tula valley waters from 32 3 to 166 ng l 1 lesser et al 2018 estriol and its sulfate conjugate have not been previously measured in the tula valley and given their presence contributes to local estrogenicity these pollutants merit further study furthermore untargeted analysis results demonstrated that other pollutants may be adding to local estrogenicity such as 6 methylquinoline and 4 4 dihydroxydiphenylsulfone table 2 and table 3 table 2 presents pollutants widely detected in the global aquatic environment and also detected in global south regions but never detected in the tula valley table 3 presents pollutants not widely or never detected in global south regions the steroid hormones estrone oestradiol and estriol have all been identified of concern in african countries fekadu et al 2019 but not in south asian countries khan et al 2020 and the sulfate conjugates have not been measured in these regions meaning the risk from steroid hormones may be higher than previously estimated in the global south contaminants of emerging concern in the environment are drivers of antibiotic resistance development a current global health emergency martin et al 2018 erythromycin mic rqs were above one for all except treated wastewater effluent from the atotonilco wwtp fig 2 erythromycin has not been found as a pollutant of concern in terms of environmental toxicity in other latin american countries valdez carrillo et al 2020 or in african countries fekadu et al 2019 pollutants which are not of immediate concern for the tula valley are the opioids codeine and morphine these were not detected in any of the samples and neither have been monitored in the tula valley previously this is likely because these opioids are not produced in mexico and it is difficult to obtain them as medicines knaul 2021 naproxen carbamazepine ibuprofen ciprofloxacin and triclosan were identified to have rqs 1 in africa fekadu et al 2019 whereas they were not in the present study carbamazepine has also been reported to present rqs 1 in latin america valdez carrillo et al 2020 the fact it was not found to be of concern in the present study may be due to a single time point sampling and emphasize the need for regular sampling campaigns similarities across the global south highlight potential areas for collaboration to remediate the presence of pollutants such as acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and steroid hormones however it also highlights the importance of local environmental studies because even across regions in mexico there are differences in the pollutants with rqs 1 which should form the basis of immediate research for each area 3 2 prioritising pollutants based on those found in cerro colorado spring water analysis of the cerro colorado spring water indicated persistent and widespread pollution presence in the tula valley this is due to the water cycle where for the pollutant to be present in the groundwater feeding the spring it would be present in irrigation canals surface runoff and or groundwater percolation five pollutants were quantified in cerro colorado spring water namely levonorgestrel oxytetracycline sulfamethoxazole bezafibrate and carbamazepine table 1 the physical chemical properties of cecs can be used to predict and understand their environmental distribution and prevalence for example levonorgestrel has demonstrated a weak adsorption onto soil particles and thus can be transport to the aquifer under rainfall or irrigation events yang et al 2020 which is likely why it can be found in cerro colorado spring after entering the groundwater on the other hand highly polar molecules like benzafibrate and oxytetracycline can readily be transported dissolved in water toward the aquifer while less polar but persistent molecule carbamazepine can slowly migrate through the soil layers to achieve aquifer after several irrigation or rain events conventional untargeted analysis provides no quantification only detection however recent efforts have made it possible to obtain semi quantified results from this analysis aalizadeh et al 2022 when semi quantification is not used it is possible to compare detection signals across sampling sites therefore for the untargeted data prioritising based on cecs found in cerro colorado spring water is particularly useful as it is not possible to calculate rqs twenty nine pollutants were detected using untargeted analysis in cerro colorado spring tables 2 and 3 several of which are persistent and toxic therefore further work is necessary to quantify environmental and human health risk such pollutants are the carbamazepine metabolite carbamazepine 10 11 epoxide table 2 which has been shown to be more toxic than carbamazepine under a standard oecd 233 test heye et al 2016 on the other hand the other carbamazepine metabolite detected 10 11 dihydro 10 11 dihydroxycarbamazepine is of lower priority as it has lower predicted toxicity than carbamazepine and has been shown to have lower concentrations in groundwater due to bio transformations of sorption brezina et al 2017 cocaine has been demonstrated toxicity at environmentally relevant concentrations parolini et al 2017 deserving further attention in future targeted studies in the tula valley desethylatrazine is a transformation product of the widely used pesticide atrazine the parent compound and transformation products have been found to present toxicity to zebra fish blahova et al 2020 and other species singh et al 2018 and should therefore be included in further evaluations of chemical pollution in the tula valley 2 hydroxybenzothiazole is a by product of industrial activities and has been shown to be very persistent in the environment and accumulate in human fat tissue zhang et al 2021 posing a potential long term human health risk that should be further addressed similarly 4 nitrophenol is an industrial pollutant used to manufacture dyes pesticides drugs amongst others serrà et al 2020 this pollutant is known to be prevalent in the environment serrà et al 2020 but its environmental risk has not been assessed in the tula valley and given it possesses toxic and mutagenic potential in humans and other living organisms serrà et al 2020 this pollutant should be considered in future studies in the area galaxolidone is a transformation product of galaxolide ding et al 2022 which has been reported to be prevalent in the environment and has predicted environmental toxicity wang et al 2021 therefore both galaxolidone and galaxolide should be considered for future environmental toxicity assessments in the tula valley untargeted analysis also highlights the potential toxicity from substances that do not go through any regulatory process such as adbica which is a designer drug with intended biological effects on humans uchiyama et al 2013 banister et al 2015a and has unknown environmental toxicity nicotine has reported aquatic environmental toxicity oropesa et al 2017 venugopal et al 2021 and as such should be considered in further assessments in the tula valley these pollutants are not identified in recent global cec prioritisation efforts wang et al 2022 yang et al 2022 highlighting the need for local assessments furthermore environmentally toxic caprolactam had the same order of magnitude peak in the cerro colorado spring as in the other sampling points table 2 indicating prevalence in the tula valley laurolactam a macrocyclic lactam was detected for the first time in the global south not having been included in other studies and with the highest peak area in the cerro colorado spring out of all the sampling points indicating persistence and potential accumulation making it a priority pollutant in further targeted studies in this region and the global south table 2 similarly nefopam methyl salicylate and methocarbamol were all detected in cerro colorado spring water and have not been previously detected in the global south table 2 other pollutants that are likely of particular concern for the tula valley and meriting further study are two agriculturally related pollutants the pesticide 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol and the herbicide fomesafen table 3 3 3 influence of atotonilco wwtp on cec occurrence in the tula valley the atotonilco wwtp influent flowrate is split between two treatment streams one biological and one physico chemical fig 1 whilst this process maintains the nutrient levels that farmers rely on a consequence is the likely lower cec removal compared to wwtps using only biological treatment as primary treatment is not as effective at reducing cec concentration rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 acetaminophen sulfamethoxazole and bezafibrate had inadequate removal in the wwtp due to relatively high 25 000 ng l 1 wastewater effluent concentrations compared to concentrations measured at other sampling points further investigation would be required to determine whether this is due to inadequate removal in the wwtp or due to very high influent concentrations either way these pollutants remain of concern in the literature these pollutants have been reported to present high 80 removal in biological treatment systems peake et al 2016a rodriguez narvaez et al 2017 wang et al 2019 acetaminophen has been reported to have very low 3 removal using coagulation alone teh et al 2016 similarly sulfamethoxazole removal is higher in advanced biological nutrient removal unit technologies versus conventional activated sludge where there is 100 aeration due to the denitrification stage wang et al 2019 atotonilco wwtp comprises conventional activated sludge biological treatment to keep the level of nutrients the farmers value conagua 2007 this highlights the complexity of maintaining water with the nutrient levels that farmers rely on against protecting the environment for those cecs that pose environmental risk 3 4 influence of natural attenuation in cec degradation for a site of the magnitude and sun irradiation of the tula valley it is important to consider that natural attenuation and dilution will play an important role in the environmental fate of cecs vázquez tapia et al 2022 the concentration of the target pollutants was the lowest in cerro colorado spring water which is the product of wastewater infiltration and further upwelling table 1 previous studies in the area have demonstrated that the agricultural soil acts as a highly effective filter of cecs the organic pollutants are first adsorbed on the organic domain of soil and then readily biodegraded by a soil biome that is highly specialized in using cecs as a carbon source or through co metabolism chávez mejía et al 2019 other abiotic processes in soil like oxidation reduction processes and hydrolysis can also take place though to a lower extent once in surface water direct and indirect photolysis can further reduce the concentration of cecs considering the high sunlight irradiation in the area along with the high concentration of dissolved salts in surface water photodegradation can play an important role in the environmental fate of organic pollutants in the cerro colorado spring on the other hand wastewater irrigation canals are open and thus gas exchange occurs to some extent which promotes aerobic biodegradation processes also important the sewage from the towns nearby is discharged in the main irrigation canals including the tlamaco and tula river biodegradation dilution and photolysis to a lower extent result in the lowering of the cec concentration in locations further from mexico city table 1 in what could be classified as an unplanned natural attenuation system that includes wastewater canals and dam along with agricultural soil table 1 examples of natural attenuation are erythromycin acetaminophen and naproxen with concentrations decreasing from untreated wastewater to points further from mexico city which can be explained by biodegradation and dilution processes on the other hand trimethoprim concentration in the dam was lower than the rest of the sampling points table 1 this could be due to the long hydraulic retention time which favours the occurrence of nitrifying processes and or adsorption on suspended solids to further precipitate radjenović et al 2009 considering the potential importance of natural attenuation processes in the removal of cecs in wastewater assessing whether natural processes may degrade pollutants to an acceptable level and thus avoid over engineering reducing resource use and carbon footprint is a priority matter of study 3 5 untargeted analysis to support equitable delivery of sdgs over one hundred pollutants not previously identified in the tula valley were identified using untargeted analysis approximately half of these pollutants have been widely studied in the global north although some like carbamazepine and diclofenac metabolites have also been measured in african and south asian countries table 2 the remaining half of the pollutants identified have not been previously measured in surface or groundwater table 3 six pollutants identified have been previously quantified using targeted analysis in the tula valley namely benzoic acid bisphenol a caffeine cotinine paraxanthine and perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa table s4 two herbicides fomesafen and diuron one pesticide desethyl atrazine and one pesticide ingredient 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol were identified for the first time in the tula valley tables 2 and 3 which is expected given that it is an agricultural zone fomesafen desethyl atrazine and 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol were detected in cerro colorado spring water fomesafen diuron and 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol presented higher signals in the tlamaco canal than in the untreated wastewater this indicates these pollutants are likely being used in the area for agriculture rather than being brought in through mexico city wastewater this is another example of the importance of local practices to prioritise pollutants of concern 4 acetamidoantipyrine metabolite of metamizole was detected in this study table 2 metamizole is prohibited in the usa but used in mexico and other countries bonkowsky et al 2002 demonstrating that untargeted cec studies in the global south are urgently needed to ensure pollutant prioritisation is adequate in the region wastewater based epidemiology allows us to obtain information on the health of a population in near real time compared to other techniques such as questionaries or surveys mortality and morbidity rates prescription rates amongst others it presents several advantages it is unbiased and it can focus on a broad range of diseases and biomarkers sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 compared to prescription data it reveals what the population has actually consumed including over the counter drugs and illicit drugs archer et al 2018 however some challenges remain such as uncertainties related to the contribution population and wastewater flows sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 these challenges can be addressed with the use of biomarkers that are constantly excreted and total excretion should correlate to census population chen et al 2014 biomarkers can be used by allowing for the determination of an illegal drug consumption per capita without the need of an accurate estimate of the population as follows chen et al 2014 d r u g c o n s u m p t i o n p e r c a p i t a d r u g c o n c e n t r a t i o n b i o m a r k e r c o n c e n t r a t i o n b i o m a r k e r e x c r e t i o n r a t e d r u g e x c r e t i o n r a t e some of the pollutants identified in this study such as caffeine paraxanthine nicotine and cotinine are of interest because even though the analysis was not designed specifically for them they were detected and they have been previously identified as suitable biomarkers for wastewater based epidemiology sims and kasprzyk hordern 2020 metabolites and transformation products are often missed during targeted monitoring campaigns and this can underestimate the environmental risk present from these pollutants in the environment for example 10 11 epoxy carbamazepine is the main carbamazepine metabolite and is therapeutically active paz et al 2016 carbamazepine had an rq 1 however the identification of its metabolites reveals unaccounted for toxicity related to this pollutant identification of 4 hydroxy diclofenac a diclofenac human phase i metabolite is of concern as diclofenac and its metabolites have been found to accumulate in aquatic organisms peake et al 2016a another example is 4 acetamido antipyrine a metabolite of the painkiller metamizole kim et al 2019 not previously detected in global south table 2 similarly dextrorphan a dextromethorphan metabolite has not been previously detected in the global south aquatic environment table 2 the sulfamethoxazole metabolite acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentrations presented an rq 1 fig 2 however this pollutant can undergo deacetylation in the environment reforming sulfamethoxazole by the action of enzymes able to deconjugate an acetylated compound and turn it back to the parent compound gomes et al 2009 assuming 100 deacetylation in the environment 86 of the acetyl sulfamethoxazole concentration would be added to the sulfamethoxazole concentration this means that at its maximum in the tula river approximately 1863 ng l 1 would be added to the 3345 ng l 1 of sulfamethoxazole present in the river most risk assessment do not consider the production of pharmaceuticals from the hydrolysis of conjugates therefore knowing the proportion of these metabolites can contribute to more accurate risk assessment it is crucially important to know the occurrence of metabolites as they can not only transform into the parent pharmaceutical compound but elicit some harmful effects to aquatic organisms 4 conclusion as the first untargeted study of contaminants of emerging concern cec in the mexican aquatic environment this work puts forward pollutants which have not been previously considered in the region and more broadly in the global south to ensure equitable sdg delivery the benefits of wastewater reuse for agriculture in the global south must be considered alongside the risks presented by cecs over 100 pollutants were detected for the first time using untargeted analysis in the tula valley for example 4 acetamidoantipyrine a drug prohibited in several countries but used in mexico other pollutants meriting further study given they were detected for the first time in the global south and due to their persistence are androsterone adbica 4 nitrophenol galaxolidone fumaric acid cocaine desethylatrazine nicotine caprolactam laurolactam nefopam and methyl salicylate methocarbamol pollutants that are likely of particular concern for the tula valley as they are agriculturally related pesticide herbicide are 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methoxyphenol and fomesafen untargeted analysis also unveils potential toxicity of parent drugs by identification of their metabolites and transformation products in this study carbamazepine diclofenac and metamizole metabolites were detected the targeted study carried out allowed for the prioritisation of 10 pollutants due to their environmental toxicity namely 4 tert octylphenol acetaminophen bezafibrate diclofenac erythromycin levonorgestrel simvastatin sulfamethoxazole trimethoprim and tramadol as well as oxytetracycline and carbamazepine due to their persistence comparison with other global south studies highlighted the risk from acetaminophen carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim across the region which could be a potential opportunity for collaborative work to address this issue next steps should include carrying out toxicological studies on global south aquatic species as environmental risk assessment is based on european species local estrogenicity was found to be of higher concern than previous estimates due to the measurement of two steroid sulfate conjugates never measured in the tula valley as well as oestrogenic pollutants 6 methylquinoline and 4 4 dihydroxydiphenylsulfone identified for the first time in the region using untargeted analysis this study also highlights the delicate balance between maintaining the nutrient levels farmers depend on from wastewater reuse and improving wwtp cec removal on the other hand local climate and soil conditions can also aid in cec removal for example the photodegradation of salicylic acid further monitoring using targeted and untargeted studies for quantification and further identification as well as studying pollutants of concern in soils and crops should also be carried out to gain a comprehensive understating of the risk of cecs present in wastewater irrigation funding this work was supported by the engineering and

14778,as climate change adaptation strategies both managed aquifer mar and surface water recharge mswr are not only highly suitable tools to mitigate negative effects on water resources but also bear large potential for concomitant exploitation of thermal energy they should thus form an integral part of any sustainable water resources management strategy however while at global scale general water resource adaptation and mitigation measures are discussed widely measures that build on thermal exploitation of mar and mswr and which are readily adaptable to various different local and regional scale conditions have yet to be developed here based on systematic numerical analyses of the sensitivity of groundwater and surface water recharge as well as water temperatures to climate change we present adaptable implementation strategies of mar and mswr with concomitant exploitation of their thermal energy potential strategies and feasibility benchmarks for the exploitation of hydrologic and energetic potentials of mar and mswr were developed based on three hydrologically and hydrogeologically contrasting urban study sites near the city of basel switzerland our studies show projected trends in the number of days when surface water temperatures exceed 25 c examined for various streamflow and climate scenarios we illustrate that local hydrogeologic settings and hydrological boundary conditions as well as legal aspects affect to which degree mar and mswr are suitable solutions as climate change adaptation measures optimal situations for exploiting the potential of seasonal heat storage in mar and mswr exist where subsurface travel times between the injection and the withdrawal or exfiltration point are between 4 and 8 months and legal limits allow a sufficiently large temperature spread in such settings the exploitable water flux and temperature spread of mar and mswr reaches a heat potential of 14 to 20 mw i e corresponding to 3 to 7 wind power plants and energetic exploitation becomes a suitable tool either for local low temperature heat applications such as heating and hot water or for ecological use as a heat and water buffer in rivers affected by seasonal droughts as a positive side effect climate induced warming of groundwater resources and temperature increases in drinking water withdrawals would be mitigated simultaneously graphical

economic losses due to limited water availability for households industry agriculture hydropower and river transportation floriancic et al 2020 munichre 2009 stahl et al 2016 anthropogenic sw and gw withdrawals can further exacerbate low water levels in rivers most importantly agricultural water extractions from streams and groundwater are expected to skyrocket until 2100 due to a dramatic increase in the demand of water for irrigation purposes bierkens and wada 2019 wada and bierkens 2014 as seasonally reduced runoff and increased water abstraction will strongly reduce sw infiltration and gw exfiltration during certain periods it is crucial for a robust cc adaptation strategy to also assess the resulting changes in the heat budgets of and thermal dynamics between sw and gw bodies keery et al 2007 rising gw temperatures can be associated with negative effects on water quality sprenger et al 2011 problems with drinking water production and possible clogging of drinking water wells by precipitated manganese and iron hunt et al 2002 gw temperatures are moreover an important factor for river water temperatures close to gw exfiltration zones caissie 2006 and can serve as an indicator for depletion of soil moisture storage reducing aquifer recharge and streamflow jaeger and seneviratne 2011 vidal et al 2010 at global scale climate projections show a significant and continued increase of air temperature with the alpine country of switzerland being most strongly affected and having witnessed an increase in air temperature since 1894 of 2 c which is more than twice the global average of 0 9 c ch2018 2018 there are clear indications that climate warming is also impacting sw and gw temperatures ipcc 2014 beside consequences for sw and gw quality aquatic ecosystems and ecological aspects in general heat discharges from industry into rivers are increasingly at risk of exceeding biologically relevant and legally binding temperature thresholds in summer a phenomenon that could already be observed in switzerland and throughout central europe during the extremely dry summer of 2022 mar and mswr provide opportunities to adapt to cc meet quantitative and qualitative water resources requirements and to operationally protect sites that produce drinking water bouwer 2002 mar therefore offers an alternative to surface storage by storing excess water underground during periods of low demand or high availability händel et al 2014 knowledge about the residence times of artificially infiltrated water and its flow paths is essential to developing adequate gw management and protection schemes bekele et al 2014 however artificial gw recharge with river water not including bank filtration currently accounts for only 3 8 of drinking water in switzerland svgw 2020 and is not considered in water management and adaptation planning for cc impacts while on the european level mar is an important water resources management tool due the strict gw quality regulations artificial recharge with river water is also only marginally contributing to the total mar hannappel et al 2014 sprenger et al 2017 to quantify the sensitivity of mar and mswr to cc in epting et al 2022 we investigated the role of artificial gw recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers under consideration of selected climate and water supply operation projections high resolution 3d numerical gw flow and heat transport modeling allowed quantifying and differentiating between different recharge components seasonal shifts in natural gw recharge and operation strategies related to artificial gw recharge were revealed as important factors affecting the long term quantity and quality of gw resources importantly increased artificial gw recharge in summer and natural infiltration of sw during high flow periods which will occur more often in winter were moreover shown to strongly impact both gw recharge and temperatures the estimated future increase of groundwater demand during droughts will likely be tackled by increasing artificial groundwater recharge with surface water which is predicted to become warmer and therefore will likely increase groundwater temperatures and the temperature of the extracted drinking water even further epting et al 2022 in epting et al 2021 we demonstrated that under selected cc scenarios at the end of the century a shift in precipitation and river flood events from summer to winter months likely results in an increase in groundwater recharge in comparatively cool seasons which in turn will tend to naturally cool groundwater possibilities to limit the temperature increase of sw and of gw by artificial recharge with sw must thus be considered in order to guarantee sustainable water management strategies involving mar and mswr to bridge this gap we present adaptable implementation strategies of mar and mswr with concomitant exploitation of their thermal energy potential under various geologic and hydrogeologic conditions from present day into the future 2100 under the consideration of different cc projections strategies and feasibility benchmarks for the exploitation of hydrologic and energetic potentials of mar and mswr were developed based on three hydrologically and hydrogeologically contrasting urban study sites near the city of basel switzerland 2 material methods 2 1 study areas in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland there are three areas where river water is used for artificial gw recharge fig 1 in the lange erlen and in the hardwald study areas a b water of the river rhine is used the drinking water wells located in these study areas each produce about half of the drinking water for the city of basel at the site of the aesch recharge plant in the lower birsvalley study area c water from the river birs is used for artificial gw recharge supplying the drinking water for the municipalities of aesch and reinach in the three study areas different methods of artificial recharge are implemented hannappel et al 2014 1 infiltration fields lange erlen average recharge 44 023 m3 d 1 extraction 49 680 m3 d 1 2 infiltration trenches

extraction 27 648 m3 d 1 2 2 climate projections river discharge and water temperature modeling to evaluate future climate related changes to the rivers and the different groundwater recharge components three climate projections developed within ch2018 have been selected ch2018 project team 2018 ch2018 2018 feigenwinter et al 2018 the three selected projections cover the full range of expected precipitation air and river temperature variations table 1 and table a1 in the appendix for each of the projections the emission scenarios rcp 2 6 4 scenarios limitation of warming to 2 k compared to the pre industrial state rcp 4 5 6 scenarios and rcp 8 5 7 scenarios were studied table 1 three groundwater flow and heat transport models were setup using the numerical model feflow dhi to study gw recharge via naturally infiltrating sw and via artificial gw recharge and to investigate associated temperature effects fig 1 the model setup and calibration procedures are described in detail in epting et al 2022 to summarize for the groundwater models future river flow boundary conditions were assigned from the preva wsl models brunner et al 2019 while future river temperature boundary conditions were based on simulations with the air2stream river temperature models piccolroaz et al 2016 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 specifically air2stream was run from 1980 to 2099 for up to 18 regional to global coupled climate models using river flow projections from the preva wsl models brunner et al 2019 with emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ultimately to obtain a robust range of predictive uncertainty the boundary conditions for the groundwater models were based on both the lower and upper bounds of the projected river flows and temperatures i e by selecting the projections of the two climate models that resulted in the maximum and minimum river flows and temperatures see table 1 the river temperature projections were also used to define the thermal boundary condition of the artificially recharged river water further boundary conditions were defined based on continuous hydraulic and temperature measurements in groundwater observation wells as well data on groundwater recharge and exactions of the water suppliers the groundwater models were subsequently calibrated using the pilot point methodology doherty 2003 doherty 2015 schilling et al 2022 as implemented in fepest doherty 2003 doherty 2015 using records of water temperature and hydraulic head measurements for more details on the modeling see epting et al 2022 2 3 mar mswr 2 3 1 thermal use of recharge and extraction water the thermal potential of gw depends mainly on flow velocities gw thickness thermal properties of the subsurface and the possible use of a temperature spread to calculate the theoretical thermal potential in the artificial recharge and extraction water from the drinking water wells in the study areas a potential heat extraction was calculated based on equation 1 and assuming that both the recharged water and the extracted drinking water should remain 10 c corresponding to the natural state of gw temperature in the study areas eq 1 e i c f q i ρ w δ t with the available energy e i j d 1 heat capacity of water c f j k g 1 k 1 flow rate q i m 3 d 1 density of water ρ w kg m 3 and the possible use of a temperature spread δ t k in addition the extent to which the temperatures of the extracted water at the drinking water wells are reduced by the infiltration of the colder recharge water was assessed for a thermal use of the extracted water of the drinking water supply the phase shift of the temperature and the flow time between the locations of gw recharge and gw extraction are relevant since heat extraction is attractive especially in the winter months heating hot water a phase shift of about half a year is ideal therefore in a first step the arrangement of individual extraction wells and recharge locations was evaluated with respect to the induced phase shifts and in a second step the theoretical heat recovery of the recharge and extraction water was quantified 2 3 2 regeneration of warmed sw two conceptual approaches were considered in the evaluation of the regeneration of warmed sw a direct heat extraction from the rivers rhine wiese and birs and b targeted exfiltration of comparatively cold gw for selected river sections to have the effect of cooling river temperatures 2 3 2 1 thermal use of sw the thermal use of gw resources in switzerland is subject to important regulations the temperature may not be changed by more than 3 k through the introduction or extraction of heat compared to the natural state of gw 100 m down gradient of the impact gschv 1998 in addition no heated water may be discharged or water for cooling withdrawn if the temperature of the sw body in question exceeds 25 c therefore in scope of our investigations in a first step the projected development of the number of days on which sw temperatures exceed 25 c was evaluated for the various watercourses and climate scenarios studied in a second step for the climate projections with the lowest scenario s1 and the largest scenario s6 impacts of cc table 1 the amount of energy that would have to be extracted from the different rivers to keep the sw temperatures below 25 c was evaluated according to equation 1 2 3 2 2 groundwater exfiltration in order to be able to estimate how much water for example via mswr would have to be added at a defined temperature in order to cool temperatures of a receiving sw body below 25 c a simple mixing analysis richmann s law which is here used as a form of end member mixing analysis emma e g bertrand et al 2014 christophersen and hooper 1992 cook and herczeg 2000 cook et al 2018 schilling et al 2019 schilling et al 2021 was performed which allows a separation by a mass balance of a n component system with n tracers assuming water temperatures to be conserved and unaffected by external sources and the instantaneous mixing of the exfiltrating groundwater with the river water n 1 water components can be separated a prerequisite is that all tracers in our case the temperatures of the different water components are distinct the following equations apply eq 2 q q 1 q 2 and eq 3 q c q 1 c 1 q 2 c 2 with q m 3 d 1 the total discharge the discharge of the respective river including the mixed water or the exfiltrating groundwater c the concentration of the tracer in the total discharge the desired final temperature of 25 c after mixing the water components q1 2 m 3 d 1 the discharge from storage elements 1 and 2 the river discharge and the amount of added groundwater and c1 2 the concentrations of the tracer in storage elements 1 the temperature of the river water and 2 the temperature of gw given as 10 c see above resolved for q2 the amount of mixed water with a defined temperature of 10 c which would have to be added to keep the sw temperatures below 25 c gives eq 4 q 2 q c c 1 c 2 c 1 3 results 3 1 thermal use of recharge and extraction water fig 2 shows the calculated theoretical thermal potential based on eq 1 in the artificial recharge and extraction water of the drinking water wells in the study areas under the assumption that both the recharge water and the extracted drinking water should always be 10 c accordingly in the lange erlen study area up to 59 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 14 mw as an annual average theoretically up to 18 mw and on average 7 mw could be extracted from the extraction water especially in the late summer and autumn months the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would result in reduced temperatures of the extracted water of the drinking water wells by an average of 2 2 and a maximum of 4 5 k table 2 in the hardwald study area up to 69 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 20 mw as an annual average the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would result in a decrease of the temperatures of the extracted water of the drinking water wells by an average of 1 7 and a maximum of 2 8 k table 2 in the lower birsvalley up to 14 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 2 4 mw as an annual average the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would lead to a reduction of the temperatures of the extracted water at the two drinking water wells in the municipality of aesch by 0 3 and 1 2 k those of the eight wells of the municipality of reinach are partly not influenced at all or are reduced by an average of 0 7 and a maximum of 2 3 k table 2 3 1 1 thermal use of sw the climate sensitivity of rivers can be illustrated using threshold values in switzerland the legal threshold water temperature is 25 c above which critical effects on local fish species are to be expected and anthropogenic use is restricted 3 2 regeneration of warmed sw fig 3 shows the projected development of the number of days on which sw temperatures exceed 25 c for the various watercourses under the rcp8 5 scenarios table 1 for rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 results see fig a1 to fig a4 in the appendix evaluations show that under rcp8 5 water temperatures after 2040 risk to be above 25 c during 10 to 40 days per year fig 3 while under rcp2 6 the situation will remain comparable to the current conditions fig a1 to fig a4 the expected impacts depend strongly on the climate model used and inter year variability most affected is the rhine stations 2289 and 2091 which already today exceeds the 25 c threshold most frequently table 3 summarizes minimum mean and maximum values of 1 energy extracted from the different sw and 2 amounts of water with a temperature of 10 c that would have to be added to the rivers to keep the water temperatures locally below 25 c both for the projections with the lowest scenario s1 table 1 and the largest scenario s6 table 1 impacts of cc on sw depending on the climate scenario considered between 20 to 48 916 kw and on average 3 631 s1 and 6 228 kw s6 of heat would have to be extracted from the river wiese in order to keep the river water below 25 c accordingly depending on the climate scenario considered the amounts of water that would have to be added to the wiese at 10 c to keep it below 25 c are between a minimum of 28 and a maximum of 56 468 m3 d 1 and on average 4 555 s1 and 7 226 m3 d 1 s6 for the birs depending on the climate scenario considered 341 to 53 343 kw and on average 2 092 s1 and 10 901 kw s6 of heat would have to be extracted from the river to keep it below 25 c accordingly the amounts of water that would have to be added to the birs at 10 c to keep it below 25 c would have to be between a minimum of 467 and a maximum of 58 432 m3 d 1 and on average 2 837 s1 and 13 736 m3 d 1 s6 due to its size the river rhine was not considered 4 summary discussion in the context of the different hydrogeological settings in the following we discuss the potentials of the i thermal use of mar prior to infiltration and during drinking water extraction as well as the regeneration of warmed water resources by ii mswr and iii natural groundwater river interactions although the presented quantities are based to a large extent on preliminary theoretical considerations the determined values provide an initial estimate of the magnitude of the potential thermal heat energy which will help further evaluations and future planning 4 1 thermal use of mar prior to infiltration and during drinking water extraction the potential for thermal use of recharge water prior to its infiltration is much larger compared to the potential of extracted gw from an mar system as the temperature spread in the river water to be infiltrated is larger compared to that of already recharged gw fig 2 owing to the large recharge volumes at lange erlen and hardwald a comparatively large heat extraction of 14 and 20 mw on average is theoretically possible corresponding to the energy produced by 3 to 7 wind power plants while the heat extraction potential at lower birsvalley is too small for thermal use due to the comparably low temperatures of the injection water the largest potential heat extractions from the artificial recharge water are available in the summer months when unfortunately the heat demand of potential users is lowest consequently the use of this low enthalpy heat is not very attractive at first sight however extracting that heat prior to recharge would supply the aquifers with water at temperatures that correspond to natural state groundwater temperatures which would result in lower temperatures of the extracted drinking water of several c and therefore be beneficial at least in this regard for thermal use of the extraction water the phase shift of the temperature and the travel time of water between injection and extraction point are relevant since heat extraction is attractive mainly in winter i e indoor heating hot water supply a phase shift of 4 to 8 months is optimal at lange erlen the distance between individual extraction wells and infiltration ponds is heterogeneous a fig 1 which also makes the resulting phase shifts very variable the spatial arrangement of wells and infiltration ponds at hardwald b fig 1 on the other hand is more uniform and produces ideal phase shifts between 100 and 150 days epting et al 2022 moeck et al 2017 moreover compared to the recharge systems at lange erlen and lower birsvalley where river water infiltrates directly into the saturated aquifer at hardwald river water first passes through a several meters thick unsaturated zone prior to reaching the water table this retardation for the hardwald case study area has a positive effect on the timing of the thermal potential at lower birsvalley temperature data were not available from the extraction wells in the municipality of aesch while those in reinach are too far away from the injection point to show a thermal signal from recharge as was shown by affolter et al 2010 compared to lange erlen and hardwald where water from the river rhine is recharged at lower birsvalley water from the much cooler river birs is recharged which strongly reduces the potential for thermal use table 3 4 2 regeneration of warmed sw by mswr and natural river groundwater interaction in general especially in urban areas the use of water resources for cooling purposes has higher significance than the removal of heat for warming epting et al 2013 however the more water resources warm in the future the more difficult it will be to add additional waste heat to them without risking ecological consequences lanz and al 2021 that was also the reason why we focused the evaluations of mswr on cooling sw reasonable heat extraction from sw to gw could thus have a positive effect on sw by keeping the water temperature of the receiving sw body below 25 c during heatwaves our analysis does not consider complex in stream mixing processes and instead is based on the assumption of instantaneous mixing between gw and sw in the real world where in stream mixing is of course more complex and spread out gw exfiltration has the strongest local effect in riparian and hyporheic zones and much less so in the center of large streams such as the rhein such local exfiltration zones play a crucial role as refugia for aquatic organisms during summer droughts and heat waves while certainly not fully realistic by using richmann s law of thermal mixing of two fluids and the assumption of instantaneous mixing a physically robust approximation for estimating the maximum potential thermal effects of exfiltrating gw on receiving sw is nevertheless achieved however by considering the total river discharge in the mixing analysis as opposed to only considering the riparian and hyporheic fraction of it that under real world conditions comes into contact with exfiltrating gw first a very conservative outlook for sw regeneration as a climate change adaptation measure is obtained thereby likely reducing the overestimation of the thermal effect that results from the assumption of instantaneous mixing the rivers in the study areas are characterized by different types of interaction with the aquifers at lange erlen the infiltration of river water is a dominant component in the gw balance accordingly the effects of cc on gw will be strongly influenced by this component but also by artificial recharge of sw since there is only one river section in the northern area of the study area where relatively little gw exfiltrates mar mswr concepts for the regeneration of the warmed river water are not suitable for lange erlen on the other hand except during major flood events the river rhine at hardwald acts as a receiving water body i e gw primarily exfiltrates into the river due to the high discharge of the

aligned such that artificial recharge of the river birs by comparatively cold groundwater in summer via strategically located exfiltration zones could be a feasible tool for cc mitigation 5 conclusions sustainable management of water resources requires a differentiated assessment and new strategies for adaptation to climate and anthropogenically induced changes suitable strategies should also consider qualitative aspects of sw and gw bodies and are bound by the legal requirements for resource protection the insights on the impact of the variability of hydraulic and thermal regimes for gw and sw resources as gained from the study of the three largest artificial mar sites in switzerland offers a highly transferrable basis to formulate adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce climate change impacts on water resources for these and other mar sites importantly we showed how waste heat related to elevated sw and gw temperatures in mar contexts could be used in a targeted and efficient manner either for thermal energy exploitation or mswr as such artificial gw recharge in winter would result in the exfiltration of comparatively cool water to rivers in summer as demonstrated on our systematic study of three different mar systems the use of the heat potential of sw used for artificial gw recharge in summer and of the artificial gw recharge in winter via its natural exfiltration in rivers during hot summer months has tremendous potential for the mitigation of negative cc effects on gw resources and can moreover reduce the temperature of extracted drinking

14778,as climate change adaptation strategies both managed aquifer mar and surface water recharge mswr are not only highly suitable tools to mitigate negative effects on water resources but also bear large potential for concomitant exploitation of thermal energy they should thus form an integral part of any sustainable water resources management strategy however while at global scale general water resource adaptation and mitigation measures are discussed widely measures that build on thermal exploitation of mar and mswr and which are readily adaptable to various different local and regional scale conditions have yet to be developed here based on systematic numerical analyses of the sensitivity of groundwater and surface water recharge as well as water temperatures to climate change we present adaptable implementation strategies of mar and mswr with concomitant exploitation of their thermal energy potential strategies and feasibility benchmarks for the exploitation of hydrologic and energetic potentials of mar and mswr were developed based on three hydrologically and hydrogeologically contrasting urban study sites near the city of basel switzerland our studies show projected trends in the number of days when surface water temperatures exceed 25 c examined for various streamflow and climate scenarios we illustrate that local hydrogeologic settings and hydrological boundary conditions as well as legal aspects affect to which degree mar and mswr are suitable solutions as climate change adaptation measures optimal situations for exploiting the potential of seasonal heat storage in mar and mswr exist where subsurface travel times between the injection and the withdrawal or exfiltration point are between 4 and 8 months and legal limits allow a sufficiently large temperature spread in such settings the exploitable water flux and temperature spread of mar and mswr reaches a heat potential of 14 to 20 mw i e corresponding to 3 to 7 wind power plants and energetic exploitation becomes a suitable tool either for local low temperature heat applications such as heating and hot water or for ecological use as a heat and water buffer in rivers affected by seasonal droughts as a positive side effect climate induced warming of groundwater resources and temperature increases in drinking water withdrawals would be mitigated simultaneously graphical

economic losses due to limited water availability for households industry agriculture hydropower and river transportation floriancic et al 2020 munichre 2009 stahl et al 2016 anthropogenic sw and gw withdrawals can further exacerbate low water levels in rivers most importantly agricultural water extractions from streams and groundwater are expected to skyrocket until 2100 due to a dramatic increase in the demand of water for irrigation purposes bierkens and wada 2019 wada and bierkens 2014 as seasonally reduced runoff and increased water abstraction will strongly reduce sw infiltration and gw exfiltration during certain periods it is crucial for a robust cc adaptation strategy to also assess the resulting changes in the heat budgets of and thermal dynamics between sw and gw bodies keery et al 2007 rising gw temperatures can be associated with negative effects on water quality sprenger et al 2011 problems with drinking water production and possible clogging of drinking water wells by precipitated manganese and iron hunt et al 2002 gw temperatures are moreover an important factor for river water temperatures close to gw exfiltration zones caissie 2006 and can serve as an indicator for depletion of soil moisture storage reducing aquifer recharge and streamflow jaeger and seneviratne 2011 vidal et al 2010 at global scale climate projections show a significant and continued increase of air temperature with the alpine country of switzerland being most strongly affected and having witnessed an increase in air temperature since 1894 of 2 c which is more than twice the global average of 0 9 c ch2018 2018 there are clear indications that climate warming is also impacting sw and gw temperatures ipcc 2014 beside consequences for sw and gw quality aquatic ecosystems and ecological aspects in general heat discharges from industry into rivers are increasingly at risk of exceeding biologically relevant and legally binding temperature thresholds in summer a phenomenon that could already be observed in switzerland and throughout central europe during the extremely dry summer of 2022 mar and mswr provide opportunities to adapt to cc meet quantitative and qualitative water resources requirements and to operationally protect sites that produce drinking water bouwer 2002 mar therefore offers an alternative to surface storage by storing excess water underground during periods of low demand or high availability händel et al 2014 knowledge about the residence times of artificially infiltrated water and its flow paths is essential to developing adequate gw management and protection schemes bekele et al 2014 however artificial gw recharge with river water not including bank filtration currently accounts for only 3 8 of drinking water in switzerland svgw 2020 and is not considered in water management and adaptation planning for cc impacts while on the european level mar is an important water resources management tool due the strict gw quality regulations artificial recharge with river water is also only marginally contributing to the total mar hannappel et al 2014 sprenger et al 2017 to quantify the sensitivity of mar and mswr to cc in epting et al 2022 we investigated the role of artificial gw recharge and the associated temperature imprinting of aquifers under consideration of selected climate and water supply operation projections high resolution 3d numerical gw flow and heat transport modeling allowed quantifying and differentiating between different recharge components seasonal shifts in natural gw recharge and operation strategies related to artificial gw recharge were revealed as important factors affecting the long term quantity and quality of gw resources importantly increased artificial gw recharge in summer and natural infiltration of sw during high flow periods which will occur more often in winter were moreover shown to strongly impact both gw recharge and temperatures the estimated future increase of groundwater demand during droughts will likely be tackled by increasing artificial groundwater recharge with surface water which is predicted to become warmer and therefore will likely increase groundwater temperatures and the temperature of the extracted drinking water even further epting et al 2022 in epting et al 2021 we demonstrated that under selected cc scenarios at the end of the century a shift in precipitation and river flood events from summer to winter months likely results in an increase in groundwater recharge in comparatively cool seasons which in turn will tend to naturally cool groundwater possibilities to limit the temperature increase of sw and of gw by artificial recharge with sw must thus be considered in order to guarantee sustainable water management strategies involving mar and mswr to bridge this gap we present adaptable implementation strategies of mar and mswr with concomitant exploitation of their thermal energy potential under various geologic and hydrogeologic conditions from present day into the future 2100 under the consideration of different cc projections strategies and feasibility benchmarks for the exploitation of hydrologic and energetic potentials of mar and mswr were developed based on three hydrologically and hydrogeologically contrasting urban study sites near the city of basel switzerland 2 material methods 2 1 study areas in the urban agglomeration of the city of basel switzerland there are three areas where river water is used for artificial gw recharge fig 1 in the lange erlen and in the hardwald study areas a b water of the river rhine is used the drinking water wells located in these study areas each produce about half of the drinking water for the city of basel at the site of the aesch recharge plant in the lower birsvalley study area c water from the river birs is used for artificial gw recharge supplying the drinking water for the municipalities of aesch and reinach in the three study areas different methods of artificial recharge are implemented hannappel et al 2014 1 infiltration fields lange erlen average recharge 44 023 m3 d 1 extraction 49 680 m3 d 1 2 infiltration trenches

extraction 27 648 m3 d 1 2 2 climate projections river discharge and water temperature modeling to evaluate future climate related changes to the rivers and the different groundwater recharge components three climate projections developed within ch2018 have been selected ch2018 project team 2018 ch2018 2018 feigenwinter et al 2018 the three selected projections cover the full range of expected precipitation air and river temperature variations table 1 and table a1 in the appendix for each of the projections the emission scenarios rcp 2 6 4 scenarios limitation of warming to 2 k compared to the pre industrial state rcp 4 5 6 scenarios and rcp 8 5 7 scenarios were studied table 1 three groundwater flow and heat transport models were setup using the numerical model feflow dhi to study gw recharge via naturally infiltrating sw and via artificial gw recharge and to investigate associated temperature effects fig 1 the model setup and calibration procedures are described in detail in epting et al 2022 to summarize for the groundwater models future river flow boundary conditions were assigned from the preva wsl models brunner et al 2019 while future river temperature boundary conditions were based on simulations with the air2stream river temperature models piccolroaz et al 2016 toffolon and piccolroaz 2015 specifically air2stream was run from 1980 to 2099 for up to 18 regional to global coupled climate models using river flow projections from the preva wsl models brunner et al 2019 with emission scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 ultimately to obtain a robust range of predictive uncertainty the boundary conditions for the groundwater models were based on both the lower and upper bounds of the projected river flows and temperatures i e by selecting the projections of the two climate models that resulted in the maximum and minimum river flows and temperatures see table 1 the river temperature projections were also used to define the thermal boundary condition of the artificially recharged river water further boundary conditions were defined based on continuous hydraulic and temperature measurements in groundwater observation wells as well data on groundwater recharge and exactions of the water suppliers the groundwater models were subsequently calibrated using the pilot point methodology doherty 2003 doherty 2015 schilling et al 2022 as implemented in fepest doherty 2003 doherty 2015 using records of water temperature and hydraulic head measurements for more details on the modeling see epting et al 2022 2 3 mar mswr 2 3 1 thermal use of recharge and extraction water the thermal potential of gw depends mainly on flow velocities gw thickness thermal properties of the subsurface and the possible use of a temperature spread to calculate the theoretical thermal potential in the artificial recharge and extraction water from the drinking water wells in the study areas a potential heat extraction was calculated based on equation 1 and assuming that both the recharged water and the extracted drinking water should remain 10 c corresponding to the natural state of gw temperature in the study areas eq 1 e i c f q i ρ w δ t with the available energy e i j d 1 heat capacity of water c f j k g 1 k 1 flow rate q i m 3 d 1 density of water ρ w kg m 3 and the possible use of a temperature spread δ t k in addition the extent to which the temperatures of the extracted water at the drinking water wells are reduced by the infiltration of the colder recharge water was assessed for a thermal use of the extracted water of the drinking water supply the phase shift of the temperature and the flow time between the locations of gw recharge and gw extraction are relevant since heat extraction is attractive especially in the winter months heating hot water a phase shift of about half a year is ideal therefore in a first step the arrangement of individual extraction wells and recharge locations was evaluated with respect to the induced phase shifts and in a second step the theoretical heat recovery of the recharge and extraction water was quantified 2 3 2 regeneration of warmed sw two conceptual approaches were considered in the evaluation of the regeneration of warmed sw a direct heat extraction from the rivers rhine wiese and birs and b targeted exfiltration of comparatively cold gw for selected river sections to have the effect of cooling river temperatures 2 3 2 1 thermal use of sw the thermal use of gw resources in switzerland is subject to important regulations the temperature may not be changed by more than 3 k through the introduction or extraction of heat compared to the natural state of gw 100 m down gradient of the impact gschv 1998 in addition no heated water may be discharged or water for cooling withdrawn if the temperature of the sw body in question exceeds 25 c therefore in scope of our investigations in a first step the projected development of the number of days on which sw temperatures exceed 25 c was evaluated for the various watercourses and climate scenarios studied in a second step for the climate projections with the lowest scenario s1 and the largest scenario s6 impacts of cc table 1 the amount of energy that would have to be extracted from the different rivers to keep the sw temperatures below 25 c was evaluated according to equation 1 2 3 2 2 groundwater exfiltration in order to be able to estimate how much water for example via mswr would have to be added at a defined temperature in order to cool temperatures of a receiving sw body below 25 c a simple mixing analysis richmann s law which is here used as a form of end member mixing analysis emma e g bertrand et al 2014 christophersen and hooper 1992 cook and herczeg 2000 cook et al 2018 schilling et al 2019 schilling et al 2021 was performed which allows a separation by a mass balance of a n component system with n tracers assuming water temperatures to be conserved and unaffected by external sources and the instantaneous mixing of the exfiltrating groundwater with the river water n 1 water components can be separated a prerequisite is that all tracers in our case the temperatures of the different water components are distinct the following equations apply eq 2 q q 1 q 2 and eq 3 q c q 1 c 1 q 2 c 2 with q m 3 d 1 the total discharge the discharge of the respective river including the mixed water or the exfiltrating groundwater c the concentration of the tracer in the total discharge the desired final temperature of 25 c after mixing the water components q1 2 m 3 d 1 the discharge from storage elements 1 and 2 the river discharge and the amount of added groundwater and c1 2 the concentrations of the tracer in storage elements 1 the temperature of the river water and 2 the temperature of gw given as 10 c see above resolved for q2 the amount of mixed water with a defined temperature of 10 c which would have to be added to keep the sw temperatures below 25 c gives eq 4 q 2 q c c 1 c 2 c 1 3 results 3 1 thermal use of recharge and extraction water fig 2 shows the calculated theoretical thermal potential based on eq 1 in the artificial recharge and extraction water of the drinking water wells in the study areas under the assumption that both the recharge water and the extracted drinking water should always be 10 c accordingly in the lange erlen study area up to 59 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 14 mw as an annual average theoretically up to 18 mw and on average 7 mw could be extracted from the extraction water especially in the late summer and autumn months the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would result in reduced temperatures of the extracted water of the drinking water wells by an average of 2 2 and a maximum of 4 5 k table 2 in the hardwald study area up to 69 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 20 mw as an annual average the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would result in a decrease of the temperatures of the extracted water of the drinking water wells by an average of 1 7 and a maximum of 2 8 k table 2 in the lower birsvalley up to 14 mw could be extracted from the artificial recharge water in the summer half year and 2 4 mw as an annual average the infiltration of the cooled recharge water would lead to a reduction of the temperatures of the extracted water at the two drinking water wells in the municipality of aesch by 0 3 and 1 2 k those of the eight wells of the municipality of reinach are partly not influenced at all or are reduced by an average of 0 7 and a maximum of 2 3 k table 2 3 1 1 thermal use of sw the climate sensitivity of rivers can be illustrated using threshold values in switzerland the legal threshold water temperature is 25 c above which critical effects on local fish species are to be expected and anthropogenic use is restricted 3 2 regeneration of warmed sw fig 3 shows the projected development of the number of days on which sw temperatures exceed 25 c for the various watercourses under the rcp8 5 scenarios table 1 for rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 results see fig a1 to fig a4 in the appendix evaluations show that under rcp8 5 water temperatures after 2040 risk to be above 25 c during 10 to 40 days per year fig 3 while under rcp2 6 the situation will remain comparable to the current conditions fig a1 to fig a4 the expected impacts depend strongly on the climate model used and inter year variability most affected is the rhine stations 2289 and 2091 which already today exceeds the 25 c threshold most frequently table 3 summarizes minimum mean and maximum values of 1 energy extracted from the different sw and 2 amounts of water with a temperature of 10 c that would have to be added to the rivers to keep the water temperatures locally below 25 c both for the projections with the lowest scenario s1 table 1 and the largest scenario s6 table 1 impacts of cc on sw depending on the climate scenario considered between 20 to 48 916 kw and on average 3 631 s1 and 6 228 kw s6 of heat would have to be extracted from the river wiese in order to keep the river water below 25 c accordingly depending on the climate scenario considered the amounts of water that would have to be added to the wiese at 10 c to keep it below 25 c are between a minimum of 28 and a maximum of 56 468 m3 d 1 and on average 4 555 s1 and 7 226 m3 d 1 s6 for the birs depending on the climate scenario considered 341 to 53 343 kw and on average 2 092 s1 and 10 901 kw s6 of heat would have to be extracted from the river to keep it below 25 c accordingly the amounts of water that would have to be added to the birs at 10 c to keep it below 25 c would have to be between a minimum of 467 and a maximum of 58 432 m3 d 1 and on average 2 837 s1 and 13 736 m3 d 1 s6 due to its size the river rhine was not considered 4 summary discussion in the context of the different hydrogeological settings in the following we discuss the potentials of the i thermal use of mar prior to infiltration and during drinking water extraction as well as the regeneration of warmed water resources by ii mswr and iii natural groundwater river interactions although the presented quantities are based to a large extent on preliminary theoretical considerations the determined values provide an initial estimate of the magnitude of the potential thermal heat energy which will help further evaluations and future planning 4 1 thermal use of mar prior to infiltration and during drinking water extraction the potential for thermal use of recharge water prior to its infiltration is much larger compared to the potential of extracted gw from an mar system as the temperature spread in the river water to be infiltrated is larger compared to that of already recharged gw fig 2 owing to the large recharge volumes at lange erlen and hardwald a comparatively large heat extraction of 14 and 20 mw on average is theoretically possible corresponding to the energy produced by 3 to 7 wind power plants while the heat extraction potential at lower birsvalley is too small for thermal use due to the comparably low temperatures of the injection water the largest potential heat extractions from the artificial recharge water are available in the summer months when unfortunately the heat demand of potential users is lowest consequently the use of this low enthalpy heat is not very attractive at first sight however extracting that heat prior to recharge would supply the aquifers with water at temperatures that correspond to natural state groundwater temperatures which would result in lower temperatures of the extracted drinking water of several c and therefore be beneficial at least in this regard for thermal use of the extraction water the phase shift of the temperature and the travel time of water between injection and extraction point are relevant since heat extraction is attractive mainly in winter i e indoor heating hot water supply a phase shift of 4 to 8 months is optimal at lange erlen the distance between individual extraction wells and infiltration ponds is heterogeneous a fig 1 which also makes the resulting phase shifts very variable the spatial arrangement of wells and infiltration ponds at hardwald b fig 1 on the other hand is more uniform and produces ideal phase shifts between 100 and 150 days epting et al 2022 moeck et al 2017 moreover compared to the recharge systems at lange erlen and lower birsvalley where river water infiltrates directly into the saturated aquifer at hardwald river water first passes through a several meters thick unsaturated zone prior to reaching the water table this retardation for the hardwald case study area has a positive effect on the timing of the thermal potential at lower birsvalley temperature data were not available from the extraction wells in the municipality of aesch while those in reinach are too far away from the injection point to show a thermal signal from recharge as was shown by affolter et al 2010 compared to lange erlen and hardwald where water from the river rhine is recharged at lower birsvalley water from the much cooler river birs is recharged which strongly reduces the potential for thermal use table 3 4 2 regeneration of warmed sw by mswr and natural river groundwater interaction in general especially in urban areas the use of water resources for cooling purposes has higher significance than the removal of heat for warming epting et al 2013 however the more water resources warm in the future the more difficult it will be to add additional waste heat to them without risking ecological consequences lanz and al 2021 that was also the reason why we focused the evaluations of mswr on cooling sw reasonable heat extraction from sw to gw could thus have a positive effect on sw by keeping the water temperature of the receiving sw body below 25 c during heatwaves our analysis does not consider complex in stream mixing processes and instead is based on the assumption of instantaneous mixing between gw and sw in the real world where in stream mixing is of course more complex and spread out gw exfiltration has the strongest local effect in riparian and hyporheic zones and much less so in the center of large streams such as the rhein such local exfiltration zones play a crucial role as refugia for aquatic organisms during summer droughts and heat waves while certainly not fully realistic by using richmann s law of thermal mixing of two fluids and the assumption of instantaneous mixing a physically robust approximation for estimating the maximum potential thermal effects of exfiltrating gw on receiving sw is nevertheless achieved however by considering the total river discharge in the mixing analysis as opposed to only considering the riparian and hyporheic fraction of it that under real world conditions comes into contact with exfiltrating gw first a very conservative outlook for sw regeneration as a climate change adaptation measure is obtained thereby likely reducing the overestimation of the thermal effect that results from the assumption of instantaneous mixing the rivers in the study areas are characterized by different types of interaction with the aquifers at lange erlen the infiltration of river water is a dominant component in the gw balance accordingly the effects of cc on gw will be strongly influenced by this component but also by artificial recharge of sw since there is only one river section in the northern area of the study area where relatively little gw exfiltrates mar mswr concepts for the regeneration of the warmed river water are not suitable for lange erlen on the other hand except during major flood events the river rhine at hardwald acts as a receiving water body i e gw primarily exfiltrates into the river due to the high discharge of the river rhine however mar mswr for the regeneration of the warmed river water are not appropriate here only at lower birsvalley moderate river discharge and extended sections of gw exfiltration are aligned such that artificial recharge of the river birs by comparatively cold groundwater in summer via strategically located exfiltration zones could be a feasible tool for cc mitigation 5 conclusions sustainable management of water resources requires a differentiated assessment and new strategies for adaptation to climate and anthropogenically induced changes suitable strategies should also consider qualitative aspects of sw and gw bodies and are bound by the legal requirements for resource protection the insights on the impact of the variability of hydraulic and thermal regimes for gw and sw resources as gained from the study of the three largest artificial mar sites in switzerland offers a highly transferrable basis to formulate adaptation and mitigation strategies to reduce climate change impacts on water resources for these and other mar sites importantly we showed how waste heat related to elevated sw and gw temperatures in mar contexts could be used in a targeted and efficient manner either for thermal energy exploitation or mswr as such artificial gw recharge in winter would result in the exfiltration of comparatively cool water to rivers in summer as demonstrated on our systematic study of three different mar systems the use of the heat potential of sw used for artificial gw recharge in summer and of the artificial gw recharge in winter via its natural exfiltration in rivers during hot summer months has tremendous potential for the mitigation of negative cc effects on gw resources and can moreover reduce the temperature of extracted drinking water the concepts and methodological approaches developed thus allow public authorities to compare characteristic hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions of their systems and to assess whether their systems are suited for thermal exploitation of sw and gw for mar and mswr declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

14779,microplastics and biochar as particulate matter that is prevalent in the water environment will inevitably encounter and interact with each other during environmental aging the potential interaction of microplastics and biochar and the associated impact on their environmental behavior remains largely unknown in this study we exposed microplastics and biochar concurrently to ultraviolet light to mimic the aging process investigated the release and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom in water and analyzed the effects of co existing microplastics and biochar on their sorption of organic contaminants we demonstrate that early stage interactions of microplastics and biochar could entangle to promote the release of dom from biochar while their long term interactions after light irradiation resulted in the sorption of hydrophobic and small molecules of microbial byproduct like dom simultaneously early stage interactions of microplastics and biochar showed a promotion for sorption of organic contaminants with an increase of 5 3 17 7 after aging however long term interactions between microplastics and biochar made it no longer promote the sorption of organic contaminants due to the influence of heterogeneous aggregation our results provide new insights into the time dependent interactions between microplastics and biochar and highlight the need to incorporate their interactions into future environmental risk assessments for microplastics in the water environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics biochar fluorescence dissolved organic matter contaminant sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics exemplify the human exploration of emerging chemical reactions and their activities at various scales lewis and maslin 2015 stubbins et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 approximately 6 3 billion tons of plastic waste are produced each year however of which only 9 is recycled and 79 is landfilled or released directly into the environment especially pooled in water environments borrelle et al 2020 feng et al 2020 geyer et al 2017 microplastics fragmented from plastics products by physical and or biological processes represent a highly diverse class of emerging contaminants with different morphological features complex compositions of polymers and chemical additives li et al 2022 mitrano and wohlleben 2020 vethaak and legler 2021 during the natural fragmentation process microplastics could release dissolved organic matter dom into the external environment such as water gardette et al 2013 lee et al 2020 potthoff et al 2017 influencing native microbial activities and carbon cycling emissions romera castillo et al 2018 simultaneously microplastics could sorb natural organic matter nom e g particulate organic matter and dom from the water environment junaid and wang 2021 oney and nason 2021 the nom loading on the surface of microplastics would affect the biotoxicity biofilm formation and vector effect on contaminants of microplastics in an environment fadare et al 2020 nasser and lynch 2016 rummel et al 2017 sooriyakumar et al 2022 particulate organic matter e g black carbon is an important component of nom in the environment cotrufo et al 2019 derrien et al 2019 heal 2014 the black carbon derived from forest fires and fossil fuel combustion ubiquitously exists in soil water and atmospheric environments coppola et al 2018 foster et al 2017 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b santin et al 2016 therefore microplastics inevitably encounter black carbon in various kinds of environmental media han et al 2022 ye et al 2020 the swellable low density and flexible structure of plastic polymers make them possible to readily and easily interact with black carbon guo et al 2012 biochar as a sort of black carbon has a well known reputation in environmental remediation for its economical production sorption and immobilization effect for organic contaminants kah et al 2017 mohan et al 2014 wang et al 2020a biochar could interact with microplastics in water via stuck trapped and entangled effects enabling the microplastics get immobilized by biochar particles and even retained in biochar s pore structures for water purification wang et al 2020b moreover the dissolved organic carbon doc released from microplastics and biochar can also interact through their entanglement li et al 2021 however whether the dom plays the essential role during the interaction between microplastics and biochar remains unclear microplastics and biochar in the water environment are inevitably exposed to light physical effects such as ultraviolet uv irradiation in the sunlight could exacerbate the weathering process and structural damage to the microplastic surface promoting the release of dom and harmful additives into the surrounding environment duan et al 2021 gardette et al 2013 lee et al 2020 potthoff et al 2017 meanwhile uv aging could also change the concentration and molecular composition of the dom released from biochar yang et al 2022 as microplastics and biochar would interact with each other their interactions and the dom release may be simultaneously influenced by the uv aging process therefore the potential interactions between microplastics and biochar exposed to light may result in a differential release of dom into the external environment which however has not been investigated so far microplastics can act as a vector in spreading organic contaminants in the environment by making convoluted complexes mao et al 2022 wang et al 2021a biochar like microplastics can also be used as a vector for organic contaminants wang et al 2020a it can be identified that the vector effect of microplastics and biochar will be greatly influenced by the aging process mao et al 2022 wang et al 2021a surface structural damage from uv aging poses significant impacts on the physicochemical property and functionality of both microplastics and biochar luo et al 2022 wang et al 2020a for instance aged polystyrene microplastics had significantly lower sorption capacity for bisphenol a than fresh microplastics and natural aging resulted in a significant increase in the sorption capacity of herbicide paraquat on biochar liu et al 2021 shi et al 2015 meanwhile the vector effect of biochar and microplastics in water is necessarily affected by their interactions such as heterogeneous aggregation and co existence through immobilization heterogeneous aggregation of microplastics may alter their particle size and surface area which are key determinants of facilitated transport of sorbed contaminants wang et al 2021b in addition to heterogeneous aggregation it has been recently reported that co existing microplastics and biochar could promote ammonium sorption through the deprotonation of functional groups and the decrease in small molecules of doc li et al 2021 therefore the interaction of microplastics and biochar can affect their environmental risk as vectors for organic contaminants but the mediating mechanism is a knowledge gap that needs to be filled potential interactions between microplastics and biochar can affect the fate and behavior of microplastics in the water environment here we investigated the characteristics of dom released from concurrently aged microplastics and biochar along with the impacts of their co existence on the organic contaminant sorption we testified the following two hypotheses i the interactions of microplastics and biochar change the molecular compositions of the released dom and ii concurrently aging of microplastics and biochar alters the contribution to the sorption of organic contaminants

completely protected from light all the samples were placed in quartz glass petri dishes covered with quartz glass lids and incubated at 25 c under moist condition for one month 2 3 characterization of microplastics and biochar the microplastics and biochar samples incubated individually or concurrently together were characterized the co existing microplastics and biochar were separated by centrifugation and flotation the co existing microplastics and biochar were placed in a 20 ml brown glass vial and 20 ml of ultrapure water was added and vortexed for 2 min then the samples were centrifuged at 3000 revolution min 1 for 10 min the microplastic particles floating in the supernatant and the biochar at the bottom of the vial were collected the pore structure of microplastics and biochar before and after aging was examined by micromeritics asap 2020 sorption instrument and the surface morphology was observed by scanning electron microscopy sem zeiss evo18 raman spectrum in via reflex apparatus and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir nexus 870 ftir was used to study the changes in the surface functional groups of biochar microplastics and a mixture of both x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi was conducted to identify the surface element composition and combined form the crystallinity of the microplastics was determined by differential scanning calorimetry dsc netzsch dsc 200f3 240 20 0687 l 2 4 characteristics of dom released from microplastics and biochar the dom in the samples of microplastics and biochar 15 mg was extracted with ultrapure water 20 ml the extracts were filtered through 0 45 µm syringe filters and doc concentration was determined using a total organic carbon analyzer shimadzu toc vcpn the composition of dom was analyzed by fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy eem fluoromax 4p tcspc hiroba with emission wavelengths running in 2 nm steps from 210 to 620 nm and excitation wavelengths varying in

to obtain the final eem data eem parafac modeling was performed using matlab 7 0 mathworks natick ma and domfluor toolbox the number of independent fluorescent dom components was determined using split half validation and random initialization analysis 2 5 sorption of dbp on microplastics and biochar the sorption experiments were set up with 11 treatments fig 1 and table s1 fresh microplastics

aged microplastics and light aged biochar lp lb briefly 15 mg of solid samples after each treatment were added into 20 ml brown bottles cacl2 0 01 mol l 1 was used to support the ionic strength and nan3 200 mg l 1 was added to the background solution as a microbial inhibitor with a final solution volume of 20 ml in the sorption kinetic experiments dbp solution was added to brown bottles with a final concentration of 2 mg l 1 the solid liquid mixture was placed in a rotary incubator wh 962 and shaken at 50 revolution min 1 at 25 c and protected from light samples were taken at 0 1 2 4 8 12 24 48 72 and 96 h for dbp sorption analysis in the sorption isotherm experiment dbp solution with different concentrations was added to make the organic contaminant concentrations of 0 5 1 1 5 2 5 10 and 20 mg l 1 respectively and shaken under the same conditions for 96 h the samples were centrifuged at 10 000 revolution min 1 for 3 min and the supernatant was collected and analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography text s1 2 6 data analysis the kinetic experimental results of dbp sorption on microplastics were fitted with the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models linear and freundlich sorption isotherm models were used to describe the sorption processes of dbp on microplastics and biochar table s2 assuming that there was no interaction between biochar and microplastics concerning the sorption of dbp the theoretical sorption capacities were calculated for the co existing microplastics and biochar under different environmental conditions p b t lp lb t dp

addition were set as blank controls the pre experiment indicated that pe did not release dbp and other paes during the experiment the average sample recovery of dbp in background solution was 96 8 6 6 origin pro version 8 5 was used for data analysis and processing one way anova with spss v20 0 was used to indicate significant differences using duncan s comparison at the p 0 05 test level 3 results and discussion 3 1 surface properties of concurrent aged microplastics and biochar light induced aging increased the surface roughness of microplastics compared to the dark environment fig 2 a while the surface morphology of microplastics was comparatively smoother than that of biochar the aged biochar db and lb surfaces were rich in porous structures which may be attributed to the surface oxidation of biochar during light induced aging tan et al 2020 the aging process increased the specific surface area of microplastics and biochar with the order of lb db b lp dp p fig s1 when microplastics and biochar were concurrently aged under light or dark conditions it can be found that some of the particle fragments were attached to the surface of each other which may be the occurrence of heterogeneous aggregation a common phenomenon between two different types of particles wang et al 2021b fig 2a the ftir spectroscopy fig 2b c showed that the functional groups on the microplastic surface were relatively homogeneous mainly comprising ch3 and ch2 c h and c c functional groups the functional group peaks of the microplastics and biochar did not shift after aging while a decrease in the peak intensity of c h at 1470 cm 1 was observed for lp and dp the xps results showed that the aging process increased the oxygen content of microplastics which was consistent with the oxidation due to aging that led to an increase in the intensity of oxygen containing functional groups and a decrease in the intensity of the c h peak huffer et al 2018 fig s2 the functional groups on the biochar surface were mainly oh aliphatic or alkane ch3 and ch2 c o or c c c o c of aliphatic groups and aromatic ring c h kloss et al 2012 mayakaduwa et al 2016 interestingly the c o or c c peak appeared on the microplastics co aged with biochar pd p b and pl p b and the intensity of the absorption peaks of ch3 and ch2 was significantly enhanced in the biochar co aged with microplastics bd p b and bl p b fig 2b c this indicates that heterogeneous aggregation between microplastics and biochar indeed occurs during their co aging which could be further confirmed by the xps and raman spectra the intensity of c1s increased on the surface of bd p b and bl p b relative to those in db and lb fig s2 and the g peaks newly appeared on the pd p b and pl p b fig s3 the mutuality of these results verifies that heterogeneous aggregation occurs during the co aging of microplastics and biochar which is also signified by the collected microplastic and biochar samples fig s4 polymers can be classified into crystalline semi crystalline and amorphous phases depending on the degree of molecular chain alignment joshi et al 2017 in this study the crystallinity of microplastics increased under light and dark aging conditions fig s5 s6 the increase in crystallinity of microplastics could be ascribed to the annihilation of highly elastic amorphous regions by reactive oxygen radicals and secondary crystallization of localized regions caused by chain rearrangement during oxidation sun et al 2021 the increasing crystallinity may result in the decreased flexibility and increased brittleness of the microplastics making them more prone to fragmentation into smaller particles through weathering processes ter halle et al 2017 when microplastics and biochar concurrently aged the crystallinity of microplastics was significantly decreased and remained in a semi crystalline state 17 30 after aging for one month this may be because the biochar black color was more light absorbing than the microplastics bergin et al 2015 which mediated the effects of light on the structure of the microplastics due to photooxidation weathering process 3 2 concentration of doc released from microplastics and biochar the concentration of doc released from microplastics was significantly lower than that of biochar fig 3 light exposure promoted the release of doc from microplastics but reduced the release of doc from biochar the uv light can trigger chain breaks in the carbon carbon backbone of microplastics to stimulate the release of doc including additives such as oxidants and stabilizers lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 romera castillo et al 2018 whereas in the case of biochar the reduction of doc after aging may be attributed to the photodegradation or mineralization of organic carbon mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 zimmerman 2010 in this study the doc concentrations of co existing microplastics and biochar were in the order of b p b p dp db db dp and lb lp lb lp it is important to note that the residual weights of microplastics and biochar addition in the co existing treatments of p b dp db and lp lb were half of their mass in individual treatment of p b dp db lp and lb however there was no evidence for an equivalent reduction of doc concentration in the co existing treatments in contrast there was an increase of doc released from biochar when extracted with co existing microplastics from which doc had been pre removed text s2 fig s7 this implies that the microplastics could enhance the particle attrition with biochar once they encountered thus enhancing the release of doc from biochar this should be an early stage interaction between microplastics and biochar as expressed by the treatments of microplastics and biochar without concurrently aging stages e g p b dp db and lp lb meanwhile the treatments of concurrently aged microplastics and biochar e g d p b and l p b give insights into the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar the order of doc concentration at different interaction stages was dp db lp lb p b l p b d p b fig 3 showing that the doc released from the long term interactions of microplastics and biochar was the lowest these results confirm a transition in the interactions between microplastics and biochar i e time dependent interaction as indicated by the change in doc concentration for early stage and long term interactions based on the fact that the reduction of doc in l p b and d p b was significantly more than the total quantity of doc in aged microplastics it could be inferred that the reduction of doc concentration was driven by both microplastics and biochar this may be probably because i the released doc was sorbed to the microplastic and or biochar and ii the interactions between the microplastics and biochar promoted the carbon loss from the biochar i e weakened carbon stability microplastics can release free radicals such as alkyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals under light which promote partial photodegradation of the released doc duan et al 2021 varanasi et al 2018 however the doc concentration of d p b was significantly lower than that of dp db in dark conditions therefore the production of light induced free radicals should not be the dominant reason for the reduction of doc in l p b and d p b in this study the vector effect acting as carriers of matter migration of microplastics and biochar allows them to sorb doc released fadare et al 2020 heitkotter and marschner 2015 qiu et al 2009 the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar are likely to result in the sorption of released doc li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b 3 3 fluorescence characteristics of dom fluorescence eem can effectively characterize the compositions of dom released from a variety of materials lee et al 2020 liu et al 2022 shutova et al 2014 the dom molecules released from microplastics and biochar were distributed in peak a peak b peak c and peak d based on the operational definition of chen et al 2003 fig 4 table s3 which represents microbial byproduct like humic acid like aromatic protein like and fulvic acid like substances respectively overall the fluorescence intensity of dom released from light aged microplastics and biochar was significantly reduced fig s8 for pe microplastics light induced aging increased the fluorescence intensity of peak c for biochar light induced aging increased the fluorescence intensity of peaks c and d yet decreased the fluorescence intensity of peak b correspondingly light induced aging promoted the release of aromatic protein like substances from microplastics and biochar but decreased the humic acid like substances from biochar the intensities of fluorescence characteristic peaks of protein like substances released from polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics were also enhanced after exposure to light lee et al 2020 the fluorescence characteristics of dom released from microplastics and biochar in different interaction stages were distinctive especially for peak a fig 4 the fluorescence intensity of peak a in d p b and l p b was weaker than those in dp db and lp lb indicating that the long term interaction between microplastics and biochar led to the reduction of microbial byproduct like dom moreover the reduced microbial byproduct like dom originated from both microplastics and biochar light significantly altered the fluorescence characteristics of dom released from the coexisting microplastics and biochar however the overall fluorescence characteristic distribution changed in line with the mode of biochar aging this could be due to the higher concentration of dom released from biochar than microplastic fig s8 thereby resulting in partial masking of the fluorescence of dom released from microplastics parafac analysis was conducted to mathematically deconvolute the overlapping eem spectra into chemically independent fluorescent components yu et al 2015 the dom released from microplastics and biochar can be described by the parafac model and deconvoluted into 3 components fig 5 table s4 component 1 c1 generally indicates the primary precursors for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms of small molecular size in the hydrophobic region component 2 c2 represents a composition of hydrophobic compounds of the large molecular size that are biodegradable and a potential secondary source for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms and component 3 c3 represents a marine humic like substance ishii and boyer 2012 lee et al 2020 the fluorescence intensities of c1 c2 and c3 released from microplastics were significantly lower than those from biochar fig 5c d light significantly decreased the release of c1 and c2 in microplastics and biochar but no significant reduction in c3 indicating that c1 and c2 components were susceptible to photodegradation while c3 was relatively more photostable lee et al 2020 phong and hur 2016 the change in the components of dom released from microplastics and biochar in different interaction stages was mainly reflected in c1 component the c1 released from dp db and lp lb was significantly higher than that from d p b and l p b but c2 and c3 changed insignificantly this suggests that the primary precursors for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms of small molecular size in the hydrophobic region were mainly affected during the long term interactions of microplastics and biochar the results of fluorescence eem showed that the interaction of microplastics and biochar resulted in the reduction of microbial byproduct like fractions which was consistent with the change in the c1 3 4 sorption of dbp on concurrent microplastics and biochar the kinetic and isotherm model fitting results showed that the sorption of dbp on microplastic and biochar could reach equilibrium within 24 h and the hydrophobic partitioning mechanism plays an essential role in the sorption process table s5 s6 and fig s9 meanwhile the peak positions of surface functional groups of microplastics and biochar did not shift after the sorption of dbp fig s10 the sorption rate k2 of dbp on microplastics was significantly higher than that of biochar fig 6 a the dominant mechanism of dbp sorption on pe microplastics was the hydrophobic effect but dbp sorption on biochar included more complex and slow sorption processes such as physical pore filling in addition to hydrophobic partitioning chen et al 2012 the partition coefficients k d of dbp on microplastics and biochar followed lp dp p lb db b fig 6b aging increased the porous structures and specific surface area of microplastics and biochar thus promoting the sorption of dbp compared with the fresh microplastics the lp had a rougher surface and formed more pit like structures which was favorable for sorption it is noted that the crystal structure in the polymer was not favorable for sorption because high energy was required to destabilize the highly ordered polymer chains fred ahmadu et al 2020 however in this study lp showed higher crystallinity and greater sorption capacity of dbp than fresh microplastics this indicates that the effect of changes in microplastics surface structure on sorption was greater than that of increasing crystallinity the interaction between microplastics and biochar is inevitable to affect the sorption of dbp on microplastics and biochar the order of k2 for dbp sorption on the co existing microplastics and biochar was p b d p b dp db l p b lp lb fig 6a compared with the fresh state of p b the dbp sorption reaction rates of d p b and l p b decreased but they were still higher than those of dp db and lp lb respectively by calculating the theoretical sorption parameters of co existing microplastics and biochar it was found that the k d fitted by linear model values of p b dp db and lp lb were significantly higher than p b t dp db t and lp lb t respectively fig 6b this confirms that the interactions between microplastic and biochar occurred from the initial encounter i e early stage interactions thereby promoting the sorption of dbp by 5 3 17 7 however the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar no longer have a promoting effect in the sorption of dbp as indicated by the sorption order which followed lp lb lp lb t l p b dp db dp db t d p b fig 6b therefore the interactions between microplastic and biochar changed with the increase of interactions time and then the promotion effect on dbp sorption did not persist the co solubilization effects of dom on hydrophobic organic chemicals play an important role in their environment fate kopinke et al 2011 it has been noted that the presence of dom often decreases the affinity of microplastics as well as biochar for paes gao et al 2013 liu et al 2019 in this study the doc concentrations released by dp db and lp lb were significantly higher than those of d p b and l p b but the k d values of dp db and lp lb were also higher than those of d p b and l p b this indicates that there was limited solubilization of dbp by the dom released from microplastics and biochar the occupation of sorption sites on the surface of microplastics by dom was not negligible at the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar the friction between microplastics and biochar caused the biochar to release more dom thus providing more sorption sites for organic contaminants the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar led to the sorption of released small molecules of dom which could occupy the sorption sites and decrease the sorption capacity of dbp on the co existing microplastics and biochar fadare et al 2020 heitkotter and marschner 2015 meanwhile after the long term concurrently aging of microplastics and biochar the heterogeneous aggregation occurs between microplastics and biochar and the surface sorption sites were again reduced leading to the disappearance of the promotion effect of dbp sorption on d p b and l p b fig s11 the aging time and conditions would determine the changes in surface properties and internal structure of microplastics and biochar thus affecting their sorption of organic contaminants therefore in the studied range of interactions time between microplastics and biochar the promotion of dbp sorption on early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar is unlikely to persist after long term interactions 4 conclusions combined with the eem parafac analysis and sorption models our results support the hypothesis that the time dependent interaction of co existing microplastics and biochar would modify the molecular compositions of dom released by them which influence the vector effect for organic contaminants the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar promote the release of dom from biochar however the released dom would be re sorbed by biochar and microplastics during the long term interactions especially for the hydrophobic small molecules of microbial byproduct like fractions the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar manifest a promotion effect on their sorption of dbp which is unlikely to persist with long term interaction due to their heterogeneous aggregation meanwhile light can significantly change the distribution characteristics of dom released from microplastic and biochar and accordingly promote the sorption of dbp on microplastic and or biochar it is noteworthy that dom plays a crucial role in the transport and transformation of contaminants microbial activity and carbon and nitrogen cycling the results in this study demonstrate that recognizing the changes in the molecular composition of dom released from the co existing interactions of microplastics and biochar can provide new insights into the risks and behavior of microplastics in the environment as well as the sorption of organic contaminants in summary it is necessary to

14779,microplastics and biochar as particulate matter that is prevalent in the water environment will inevitably encounter and interact with each other during environmental aging the potential interaction of microplastics and biochar and the associated impact on their environmental behavior remains largely unknown in this study we exposed microplastics and biochar concurrently to ultraviolet light to mimic the aging process investigated the release and fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom in water and analyzed the effects of co existing microplastics and biochar on their sorption of organic contaminants we demonstrate that early stage interactions of microplastics and biochar could entangle to promote the release of dom from biochar while their long term interactions after light irradiation resulted in the sorption of hydrophobic and small molecules of microbial byproduct like dom simultaneously early stage interactions of microplastics and biochar showed a promotion for sorption of organic contaminants with an increase of 5 3 17 7 after aging however long term interactions between microplastics and biochar made it no longer promote the sorption of organic contaminants due to the influence of heterogeneous aggregation our results provide new insights into the time dependent interactions between microplastics and biochar and highlight the need to incorporate their interactions into future environmental risk assessments for microplastics in the water environment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics biochar fluorescence dissolved organic matter contaminant sorption data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastics exemplify the human exploration of emerging chemical reactions and their activities at various scales lewis and maslin 2015 stubbins et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 approximately 6 3 billion tons of plastic waste are produced each year however of which only 9 is recycled and 79 is landfilled or released directly into the environment especially pooled in water environments borrelle et al 2020 feng et al 2020 geyer et al 2017 microplastics fragmented from plastics products by physical and or biological processes represent a highly diverse class of emerging contaminants with different morphological features complex compositions of polymers and chemical additives li et al 2022 mitrano and wohlleben 2020 vethaak and legler 2021 during the natural fragmentation process microplastics could release dissolved organic matter dom into the external environment such as water gardette et al 2013 lee et al 2020 potthoff et al 2017 influencing native microbial activities and carbon cycling emissions romera castillo et al 2018 simultaneously microplastics could sorb natural organic matter nom e g particulate organic matter and dom from the water environment junaid and wang 2021 oney and nason 2021 the nom loading on the surface of microplastics would affect the biotoxicity biofilm formation and vector effect on contaminants of microplastics in an environment fadare et al 2020 nasser and lynch 2016 rummel et al 2017 sooriyakumar et al 2022 particulate organic matter e g black carbon is an important component of nom in the environment cotrufo et al 2019 derrien et al 2019 heal 2014 the black carbon derived from forest fires and fossil fuel combustion ubiquitously exists in soil water and atmospheric environments coppola et al 2018 foster et al 2017 qi et al 2017a qi et al 2017b santin et al 2016 therefore microplastics inevitably encounter black carbon in various kinds of environmental media han et al 2022 ye et al 2020 the swellable low density and flexible structure of plastic polymers make them possible to readily and easily interact with black carbon guo et al 2012 biochar as a sort of black carbon has a well known reputation in environmental remediation for its economical production sorption and immobilization effect for organic contaminants kah et al 2017 mohan et al 2014 wang et al 2020a biochar could interact with microplastics in water via stuck trapped and entangled effects enabling the microplastics get immobilized by biochar particles and even retained in biochar s pore structures for water purification wang et al 2020b moreover the dissolved organic carbon doc released from microplastics and biochar can also interact through their entanglement li et al 2021 however whether the dom plays the essential role during the interaction between microplastics and biochar remains unclear microplastics and biochar in the water environment are inevitably exposed to light physical effects such as ultraviolet uv irradiation in the sunlight could exacerbate the weathering process and structural damage to the microplastic surface promoting the release of dom and harmful additives into the surrounding environment duan et al 2021 gardette et al 2013 lee et al 2020 potthoff et al 2017 meanwhile uv aging could also change the concentration and molecular composition of the dom released from biochar yang et al 2022 as microplastics and biochar would interact with each other their interactions and the dom release may be simultaneously influenced by the uv aging process therefore the potential interactions between microplastics and biochar exposed to light may result in a differential release of dom into the external environment which however has not been investigated so far microplastics can act as a vector in spreading organic contaminants in the environment by making convoluted complexes mao et al 2022 wang et al 2021a biochar like microplastics can also be used as a vector for organic contaminants wang et al 2020a it can be identified that the vector effect of microplastics and biochar will be greatly influenced by the aging process mao et al 2022 wang et al 2021a surface structural damage from uv aging poses significant impacts on the physicochemical property and functionality of both microplastics and biochar luo et al 2022 wang et al 2020a for instance aged polystyrene microplastics had significantly lower sorption capacity for bisphenol a than fresh microplastics and natural aging resulted in a significant increase in the sorption capacity of herbicide paraquat on biochar liu et al 2021 shi et al 2015 meanwhile the vector effect of biochar and microplastics in water is necessarily affected by their interactions such as heterogeneous aggregation and co existence through immobilization heterogeneous aggregation of microplastics may alter their particle size and surface area which are key determinants of facilitated transport of sorbed contaminants wang et al 2021b in addition to heterogeneous aggregation it has been recently reported that co existing microplastics and biochar could promote ammonium sorption through the deprotonation of functional groups and the decrease in small molecules of doc li et al 2021 therefore the interaction of microplastics and biochar can affect their environmental risk as vectors for organic contaminants but the mediating mechanism is a knowledge gap that needs to be filled potential interactions between microplastics and biochar can affect the fate and behavior of microplastics in the water environment here we investigated the characteristics of dom released from concurrently aged microplastics and biochar along with the impacts of their co existence on the organic contaminant sorption we testified the following two hypotheses i the interactions of microplastics and biochar change the molecular compositions of the released dom and ii concurrently aging of microplastics and biochar alters the contribution to the sorption of organic contaminants by sorbing dom via occupying and or changing their surface properties to this end polyethylene microplastics pe plastic polymers frequently observed in water and straw biochar were incubated concurrently under uv light and dark conditions fluorescence excitation emission matrix spectroscopy combined with parallel factor analysis eem parafac was used to elucidate the characteristics of dom dibutyl phthalate dbp a priority pollutant among phthalic acid esters paes and the major contributor to the contamination of paes in surface water was used as the model plasticizer additive

performance liquid chromatography text s1 2 6 data analysis the kinetic experimental results of dbp sorption on microplastics were fitted with the pseudo first order and pseudo second order models linear and freundlich sorption isotherm models were used to describe the sorption processes of dbp on microplastics and biochar table s2 assuming that there was no interaction between biochar and microplastics concerning the sorption of dbp the theoretical sorption capacities were calculated for the co existing microplastics and biochar under different environmental conditions p b t lp lb t dp

and discussion 3 1 surface properties of concurrent aged microplastics and biochar light induced aging increased the surface roughness of microplastics compared to the dark environment fig 2 a while the surface morphology of microplastics was comparatively smoother than that of biochar the aged biochar db and lb surfaces were rich in porous structures which may be attributed to the surface oxidation of biochar during light induced aging tan et al 2020 the aging process increased the specific surface area of microplastics and biochar with the order of lb db b lp dp p fig s1 when microplastics and biochar were concurrently aged under light or dark conditions it can be found that some of the particle fragments were attached to the surface of each other which may be the occurrence of heterogeneous aggregation a common phenomenon between two different types of particles wang et al 2021b fig 2a the ftir spectroscopy fig 2b c showed that the functional groups on the microplastic surface were relatively homogeneous mainly comprising ch3 and ch2 c h and c c functional groups the functional group peaks of the microplastics and biochar did not shift after aging while a decrease in the peak intensity of c h at 1470 cm 1 was observed for lp and dp the xps results showed that the aging process increased the oxygen content of microplastics which was consistent with the oxidation due to aging that led to an increase in the intensity of oxygen containing functional groups and a decrease in the intensity of the c h peak huffer et al 2018 fig s2 the functional groups on the biochar surface were mainly oh aliphatic or alkane ch3 and ch2 c o or c c c o c of aliphatic groups and aromatic ring c h kloss et al 2012 mayakaduwa et al 2016 interestingly the c o or c c peak appeared on the microplastics co aged with biochar pd p b and pl p b and the intensity of the absorption peaks of ch3 and ch2 was significantly enhanced in the biochar co aged with microplastics bd p b and bl p b fig 2b c this indicates that heterogeneous aggregation between microplastics and biochar indeed occurs during their co aging which could be further confirmed by the xps and raman spectra the intensity of c1s increased on the surface of bd p b and bl p b relative to those in db and lb fig s2 and the g peaks newly appeared on the pd p b and pl p b fig s3 the mutuality of these results verifies that heterogeneous aggregation occurs during the co aging of microplastics and biochar which is also signified by the collected microplastic and biochar samples fig s4 polymers can be classified into crystalline semi crystalline and amorphous phases depending on the degree of molecular chain alignment joshi et al 2017 in this study the crystallinity of microplastics increased under light and dark aging conditions fig s5 s6 the increase in crystallinity of microplastics could be ascribed to the annihilation of highly elastic amorphous regions by reactive oxygen radicals and secondary crystallization of localized regions caused by chain rearrangement during oxidation sun et al 2021 the increasing crystallinity may result in the decreased flexibility and increased brittleness of the microplastics making them more prone to fragmentation into smaller particles through weathering processes ter halle et al 2017 when microplastics and biochar concurrently aged the crystallinity of microplastics was significantly decreased and remained in a semi crystalline state 17 30 after aging for one month this may be because the biochar black color was more light absorbing than the microplastics bergin et al 2015 which mediated the effects of light on the structure of the microplastics due to photooxidation weathering process 3 2 concentration of doc released from microplastics and biochar the concentration of doc released from microplastics was significantly lower than that of biochar fig 3 light exposure promoted the release of doc from microplastics but reduced the release of doc from biochar the uv light can trigger chain breaks in the carbon carbon backbone of microplastics to stimulate the release of doc including additives such as oxidants and stabilizers lee et al 2020 luo et al 2019 romera castillo et al 2018 whereas in the case of biochar the reduction of doc after aging may be attributed to the photodegradation or mineralization of organic carbon mukherjee and zimmerman 2013 zimmerman 2010 in this study the doc concentrations of co existing microplastics and biochar were in the order of b p b p dp db db dp and lb lp lb lp it is important to note that the residual weights of microplastics and biochar addition in the co existing treatments of p b dp db and lp lb were half of their mass in individual treatment of p b dp db lp and lb however there was no evidence for an equivalent reduction of doc concentration in the co existing treatments in contrast there was an increase of doc released from biochar when extracted with co existing microplastics from which doc had been pre removed text s2 fig s7 this implies that the microplastics could enhance the particle attrition with biochar once they encountered thus enhancing the release of doc from biochar this should be an early stage interaction between microplastics and biochar as expressed by the treatments of microplastics and biochar without concurrently aging stages e g p b dp db and lp lb meanwhile the treatments of concurrently aged microplastics and biochar e g d p b and l p b give insights into the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar the order of doc concentration at different interaction stages was dp db lp lb p b l p b d p b fig 3 showing that the doc released from the long term interactions of microplastics and biochar was the lowest these results confirm a transition in the interactions between microplastics and biochar i e time dependent interaction as indicated by the change in doc concentration for early stage and long term interactions based on the fact that the reduction of doc in l p b and d p b was significantly more than the total quantity of doc in aged microplastics it could be inferred that the reduction of doc concentration was driven by both microplastics and biochar this may be probably because i the released doc was sorbed to the microplastic and or biochar and ii the interactions between the microplastics and biochar promoted the carbon loss from the biochar i e weakened carbon stability microplastics can release free radicals such as alkyl radicals and hydroxyl radicals under light which promote partial photodegradation of the released doc duan et al 2021 varanasi et al 2018 however the doc concentration of d p b was significantly lower than that of dp db in dark conditions therefore the production of light induced free radicals should not be the dominant reason for the reduction of doc in l p b and d p b in this study the vector effect acting as carriers of matter migration of microplastics and biochar allows them to sorb doc released fadare et al 2020 heitkotter and marschner 2015 qiu et al 2009 the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar are likely to result in the sorption of released doc li et al 2021 wang et al 2020b 3 3 fluorescence characteristics of dom fluorescence eem can effectively characterize the compositions of dom released from a variety of materials lee et al 2020 liu et al 2022 shutova et al 2014 the dom molecules released from microplastics and biochar were distributed in peak a peak b peak c and peak d based on the operational definition of chen et al 2003 fig 4 table s3 which represents microbial byproduct like humic acid like aromatic protein like and fulvic acid like substances respectively overall the fluorescence intensity of dom released from light aged microplastics and biochar was significantly reduced fig s8 for pe microplastics light induced aging increased the fluorescence intensity of peak c for biochar light induced aging increased the fluorescence intensity of peaks c and d yet decreased the fluorescence intensity of peak b correspondingly light induced aging promoted the release of aromatic protein like substances from microplastics and biochar but decreased the humic acid like substances from biochar the intensities of fluorescence characteristic peaks of protein like substances released from polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride microplastics were also enhanced after exposure to light lee et al 2020 the fluorescence characteristics of dom released from microplastics and biochar in different interaction stages were distinctive especially for peak a fig 4 the fluorescence intensity of peak a in d p b and l p b was weaker than those in dp db and lp lb indicating that the long term interaction between microplastics and biochar led to the reduction of microbial byproduct like dom moreover the reduced microbial byproduct like dom originated from both microplastics and biochar light significantly altered the fluorescence characteristics of dom released from the coexisting microplastics and biochar however the overall fluorescence characteristic distribution changed in line with the mode of biochar aging this could be due to the higher concentration of dom released from biochar than microplastic fig s8 thereby resulting in partial masking of the fluorescence of dom released from microplastics parafac analysis was conducted to mathematically deconvolute the overlapping eem spectra into chemically independent fluorescent components yu et al 2015 the dom released from microplastics and biochar can be described by the parafac model and deconvoluted into 3 components fig 5 table s4 component 1 c1 generally indicates the primary precursors for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms of small molecular size in the hydrophobic region component 2 c2 represents a composition of hydrophobic compounds of the large molecular size that are biodegradable and a potential secondary source for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms and component 3 c3 represents a marine humic like substance ishii and boyer 2012 lee et al 2020 the fluorescence intensities of c1 c2 and c3 released from microplastics were significantly lower than those from biochar fig 5c d light significantly decreased the release of c1 and c2 in microplastics and biochar but no significant reduction in c3 indicating that c1 and c2 components were susceptible to photodegradation while c3 was relatively more photostable lee et al 2020 phong and hur 2016 the change in the components of dom released from microplastics and biochar in different interaction stages was mainly reflected in c1 component the c1 released from dp db and lp lb was significantly higher than that from d p b and l p b but c2 and c3 changed insignificantly this suggests that the primary precursors for terrestrial and aquatic microorganisms of small molecular size in the hydrophobic region were mainly affected during the long term interactions of microplastics and biochar the results of fluorescence eem showed that the interaction of microplastics and biochar resulted in the reduction of microbial byproduct like fractions which was consistent with the change in the c1 3 4 sorption of dbp on concurrent microplastics and biochar the kinetic and isotherm model fitting results showed that the sorption of dbp on microplastic and biochar could reach equilibrium within 24 h and the hydrophobic partitioning mechanism plays an essential role in the sorption process table s5 s6 and fig s9 meanwhile the peak positions of surface functional groups of microplastics and biochar did not shift after the sorption of dbp fig s10 the sorption rate k2 of dbp on microplastics was significantly higher than that of biochar fig 6 a the dominant mechanism of dbp sorption on pe microplastics was the hydrophobic effect but dbp sorption on biochar included more complex and slow sorption processes such as physical pore filling in addition to hydrophobic partitioning chen et al 2012 the partition coefficients k d of dbp on microplastics and biochar followed lp dp p lb db b fig 6b aging increased the porous structures and specific surface area of microplastics and biochar thus promoting the sorption of dbp compared with the fresh microplastics the lp had a rougher surface and formed more pit like structures which was favorable for sorption it is noted that the crystal structure in the polymer was not favorable for sorption because high energy was required to destabilize the highly ordered polymer chains fred ahmadu et al 2020 however in this study lp showed higher crystallinity and greater sorption capacity of dbp than fresh microplastics this indicates that the effect of changes in microplastics surface structure on sorption was greater than that of increasing crystallinity the interaction between microplastics and biochar is inevitable to affect the sorption of dbp on microplastics and biochar the order of k2 for dbp sorption on the co existing microplastics and biochar was p b d p b dp db l p b lp lb fig 6a compared with the fresh state of p b the dbp sorption reaction rates of d p b and l p b decreased but they were still higher than those of dp db and lp lb respectively by calculating the theoretical sorption parameters of co existing microplastics and biochar it was found that the k d fitted by linear model values of p b dp db and lp lb were significantly higher than p b t dp db t and lp lb t respectively fig 6b this confirms that the interactions between microplastic and biochar occurred from the initial encounter i e early stage interactions thereby promoting the sorption of dbp by 5 3 17 7 however the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar no longer have a promoting effect in the sorption of dbp as indicated by the sorption order which followed lp lb lp lb t l p b dp db dp db t d p b fig 6b therefore the interactions between microplastic and biochar changed with the increase of interactions time and then the promotion effect on dbp sorption did not persist the co solubilization effects of dom on hydrophobic organic chemicals play an important role in their environment fate kopinke et al 2011 it has been noted that the presence of dom often decreases the affinity of microplastics as well as biochar for paes gao et al 2013 liu et al 2019 in this study the doc concentrations released by dp db and lp lb were significantly higher than those of d p b and l p b but the k d values of dp db and lp lb were also higher than those of d p b and l p b this indicates that there was limited solubilization of dbp by the dom released from microplastics and biochar the occupation of sorption sites on the surface of microplastics by dom was not negligible at the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar the friction between microplastics and biochar caused the biochar to release more dom thus providing more sorption sites for organic contaminants the long term interactions between microplastics and biochar led to the sorption of released small molecules of dom which could occupy the sorption sites and decrease the sorption capacity of dbp on the co existing microplastics and biochar fadare et al 2020 heitkotter and marschner 2015 meanwhile after the long term concurrently aging of microplastics and biochar the heterogeneous aggregation occurs between microplastics and biochar and the surface sorption sites were again reduced leading to the disappearance of the promotion effect of dbp sorption on d p b and l p b fig s11 the aging time and conditions would determine the changes in surface properties and internal structure of microplastics and biochar thus affecting their sorption of organic contaminants therefore in the studied range of interactions time between microplastics and biochar the promotion of dbp sorption on early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar is unlikely to persist after long term interactions 4 conclusions combined with the eem parafac analysis and sorption models our results support the hypothesis that the time dependent interaction of co existing microplastics and biochar would modify the molecular compositions of dom released by them which influence the vector effect for organic contaminants the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar promote the release of dom from biochar however the released dom would be re sorbed by biochar and microplastics during the long term interactions especially for the hydrophobic small molecules of microbial byproduct like fractions the early stage interactions between microplastics and biochar manifest a promotion effect on their sorption of dbp which is unlikely to persist with long term interaction due to their heterogeneous aggregation meanwhile light can significantly change the distribution characteristics of dom released from microplastic and biochar and accordingly promote the sorption of dbp on microplastic and or biochar it is noteworthy that dom plays a crucial role in the transport and transformation of contaminants microbial activity and carbon and nitrogen cycling the results in this study demonstrate that recognizing the changes in the molecular composition of dom released from the co existing interactions of microplastics and biochar can provide new insights into the risks and behavior of microplastics in the environment as well as the sorption of organic contaminants in summary it is necessary to investigate the time dependent interactions between microplastics and dom and their impact in the environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing
