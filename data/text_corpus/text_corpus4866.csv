24330,the current paper presents a methodology which can simulate the net carbon fluxes of semi natural grasslands based on the combination of a parametric and a bio geochemical model the first model modified c fix estimates grassland gross primary production gpp by driving the light use efficiency approach with remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the latter model biome bgc simulates all main ecosystem processes based on meteorological and ancillary data the outputs of the two models are finally combined and corrected for the effects of human induced biomass changes i e mowing grazing etc the modelling strategy fed with ancillary and modis ndvi data is tested in two semi natural grasslands the first amplero on the apennines and the second monte bondone on the alps central and northern italy respectively the two sites which show diversified eco climatic conditions and are managed differently i e amplero by spring mowing plus cattle grazing and monte bondone by summer mowing were selected for the availability of eddy covariance observations of gpp and net ecosystem production nep collected during several years from 2003 to 2012 these observations were used to assess the estimates of the modelling strategy obtaining promising results for both study sites the greatest estimation errors are found in the alpine site and are mostly induced by the inaccurate detection of local grassland ndvi values which is due to the insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the used modis ndvi imagery the results of the study highlight the importance of information on the local management practices applied which is decisive for quantifying medium term changes in net carbon fluxes keywords c fix biome bgc gpp nep ndvi modis pasture data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction grasslands occupy a large portion of the earth ice free lands and are capable of storing great carbon c quantity especially in the soil conant et al 2017 from an eco physiological viewpoint the c cycle of grasslands includes various components photosynthesis i e gross primary production gpp by which carbon dioxide is removed from the air and autotrophic i e maintenance and growth plant respirations ra and heterotrophic soil microbial decomposition rh respirations by which carbon dioxide is released in the air the difference between gpp and ra gives the grassland net primary production npp and when also rh is removed net ecosystem production nep is obtained keenan and williams 2018 both net production variables are therefore important but while npp indicates the grassland growing potential in terms of new biomass accumulation nep indicates if the grassland is acting as c source or sink hence the latter variable is particularly relevant to characterize grassland role within the global c cycle bengtsson et al 2019 the net c fluxes of grasslands and specifically nep are determined by different factors such as climate vegetation and soil composition and status wang et al 2019 in managed ecosystems the practices applied represent relevant disturbances that affect the greenhouse gas exchange soussana et al 2007 the most common practices can imply both biomass losses i e by cattle grazing mowing etc and inputs e g by deployment of manure wohlfahrt et al 2008 the high spatio temporal variability which often characterizes the distribution and impact of such disturbances complicates the investigation on grassland role as c source or sink koncz et al 2020 particularly when using the eddy covariance technique that assumes a spatial homogeneity over the footprint area de la motte et al 2019 hence modelling approaches have been widely applied to quantify such balance but they require both a deep knowledge of ecosystem functioning and detailed information on the disturbances occurred which are rarely available gang et al 2011 this situation has promoted the increasing use of remote sensing techniques which allow to assess grassland characteristics and functions over different spatial and temporal scales argenti et al 2011 wachendorf et al 2018 reinermann et al 2020 this is particularly the case for optical sensors mounted onboard satellite systems some of which have large spatial coverage and frequent revisiting time mcroberts and tomppo 2007 white et al 2016 optical remotely sensed imagery for example can help detecting phenology or leaf area index to be then incorporated within models you et al 2019 myrgiotis et al 2021 the same imagery can provide effective estimates of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation fapar which are combined with ancillary data to obtain the ecosystem gpp through the so called light use efficiency lue approach veroustraete et al 2002 yu 2020 this approach provides the theoretical foundation for the most widespread gpp prediction methods such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis gpp algorithm which has been assessed in a number of cases heinsch et al 2006 yuan et al 2014 in the specific research context the lue approach is capable of predicting the impact of green biomass changes on gpp but can yield only approximate estimates of net c fluxes npp and nep since actual ra and rh cannot be observed directly through remote sensing techniques waring and running 2007 this issue has been efficiently addressed by the integrated use of ecosystem process and remote sensing models wang et al 2011 maselli et al 2017 this strategy was successfully followed by maselli et al 2013 who combined the outputs of a lue model c fix and of a bio geochemical model biome bgc to predict the npp of mediterranean grasslands the objective of the current research is to verify the applicability of a similar modelling strategy to predict the nep of mountain managed pastures this operation requires the additional simulation of heterotrophic respiration which must take into account the impacts of the disturbances affecting each ecosystem in order to address this issue a correction of biome bgc rh estimates is proposed which can be driven by commonly available information regarding the management practices applied the modified modelling strategy is thus capable of integrating ancillary and remotely sensed data to yield estimates of actual nep over wide areas which have been validated versus the flux tower observations of two study sites the manuscript is organised as follows first the nep simulation strategy is described including the two models applied modified c fix and biome bgc and the combination of their outputs taking into account the effects of human induced disturbances i e grazing and or mowing this is followed by the introduction of two study sites in italy one on the apennines amplero and the other on the alps monte bondone where gpp and nep observations were collected for several years through the eddy covariance technique baldocchi 2003 these observations are then described together with the ground and remotely sensed datasets used in the investigation the following two sections report on the data processing performed and the results achieved in the two study areas the final sections summarize and discuss the main implications and conclusions which can be drawn from the experiment 2 modelling strategy 2 1 c fix c fix is a lue model which was originally developed to simulate the c fluxes of forest ecosystems through the combination of ground temperature and radiation measurements with remotely sensed fapar observations derived from ndvi veroustraete et al 2002 the model was then modified by including an additional meteorological water stress factor cws which can improve its applicability in semi arid mediterranean areas maselli et al 2009a cws in fact is derived from the ratio between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and limits photosynthesis in case of short term water stress maselli et al 2009a in a subsequent study maselli et al 2013 modified c fix was applied to predict the daily gpp of grasslands gppc g c m 2 day 1 by means of 1 gp p c ε max t cor cws fapar par where εm ax is the maximum radiation use efficiency ε t cor is a factor accounting for the dependence of photosynthesis on air temperature and fapar is the fraction of par absorbed by the vegetation all referred to the day examined as more fully described in maselli et al 2013 ε max is set to 1 65 g mj 1 apar t cor is that proposed for grassland by running et al 2004 while the water stress index is computed by cumulating actual and potential evapotranspiration over a period of one month 2 2 biome bgc the bio geochemical model biome bgc was developed at the university of montana to estimate the storage and fluxes of water c and nitrogen within terrestrial ecosystems running and hunt 1993 golinkoff 2010 among the inputs required to the model there are i daily climate data i e minimum and maximum air temperature precipitation solar radiation etc ii descriptors of the main characteristics of the environment i e soil type and depth vegetation type and site conditions and iii parameters describing the ecophysiological features of vegetation biome bgc is capable of finding a quasi equilibrium with local eco climatic conditions through the spin up phase which aims at quantifying the initial amount of all c and nitrogen pools the model then proceeds with a normal simulation to estimate all respiration and allocation processes of the examined years white et al 2000 churkina et al 2003 the modelling of quasi equilibrium condition implies that the sum of all simulated respirations becomes nearly equivalent to gpp consequently annual npp approaches heterotrophic respiration and annual nep tends to zero golinkoff 2010 the version of the model currently used 4 2 includes complete parameter settings for several biome types amongst which that for grasslands was originally proposed by white et al 2000 and calibrated for italian areas by maselli et al 2013 2 3 combination and correction of model outputs following the modelling strategy described in maselli et al 2013 the daily npp and nep estimates of grasslands can be obtained by simply combining the outputs of the two models as 2 npp gp p c g r b m r b gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 3 nep gp p c g r b m r b h r b gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 where gppb grb mrb and hrb represent the biome bgc estimates of photosynthesis growth maintenance and heterotrophic respirations respectively and the subfixes 1 12 indicate the annual totals which are used to normalize the biome bgc estimates with respect to those of c fix a similar theoretical background can be used to correct the nep estimates for the effects of artificial biomass changes occurring in managed grasslands i e off site losses or inputs which can reduce or increase rh chirici et al 2022 hence still considering a condition close to equilibrium and a mean annual c change equal to δc an additional correction factor for rh ch can be computed as 4 ch np p 1 12 δ c np p 1 12 where npp1 12 is the annual npp predicted by eq 2 finally the daily nep of managed grasslands nep can be estimated as 5 nep gp p c g r b m r b h r b c h gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 as can be easily understood ch becomes smaller than 1 following an off site loss and the opposite is true for an off site input in the former case the long term nep tends to be negative i e the ecosystem behaves as a c source while in the latter case it tends to be positive i e the ecosystem behaves as a c sink 3 study sites 3 1 apennine site amplero 41 904 n 13 605 e fig 1 is situated in central italy on a gently sloped area at an altitude of about 880 m above sea level the climate of the area is alpine mediterranean with mean annual precipitation of 1365 mm and mean annual temperature of about 10 c rainfall has two maxima one in spring and one in autumn while the minimum is in june the soil is a haplic phaeozem its depth is about 1 m and the percentage of clay is more than 55 this joint to the reduced slope sometimes leads to poorly drained conditions maselli et al 2013 the area is characterized by the presence of a mixed homogenous grassland fig 2 mainly composed by few dominant graminoids mainly represented by genus poa legumes genera trifolium and medicago and composites genera geranium and cerastium this grassland is usually mowed in june for hay production and then extensively grazed by cattle till the end of the growing season berninger et al 2015 3 2 alpine site monte bondone 46 015 n 11 046 e fig 1 is situated at 1550 m above sea level in the italian alps the morphology of the area which covers about 2 km2 is gently sloped the mean annual temperature is about 5 5 c while mean annual rainfall is around 1190 mm with maxima in june and october the snow cover extends from november to april while the peak of the growing season generally occurs between middle june and early july marcolla et al 2011 the soil is a typic hapludalfs and has a loamy texture the site is covered by a meadow fig 3 dominated by the presence of festuca rubra nardus stricta and trifolium spp which are typical of low productive grasslands in the alpine region berninger et al 2015 this site is traditionally managed for hay production and is mowed once per year around mid july wohlfahrt et al 2008 4 study data 4 1 meteorological data basic daily weather variables i e minimum and maximum air temperature and precipitation were derived for the whole study period i e 2003 2012 from the e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 and were downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution as described in maselli et al 2012 and fibbi et al 2016 solar radiation was then obtained by the mt clim algorithm thornton et al 2000 4 2 eddy covariance data reference nep measurements were taken by the eddy covariance technique over the years 2003 2007 and 2003 2012 for amplero and monte bondone respectively these measurements were collected and processed according to the state of the art methodology i e by applying gap filling and flux partitioning to derive daily gpp and ecosystem respiration reichstein et al 2005 specifically level 4 data files including also meteorological data were freely downloaded from the european fluxes database http www europe fluxdata eu 4 3 satellite data multitemporal ndvi images of both study areas were derived from the modis terra and aqua satellite sensors the modis ndvi product mod13q1 is computed from atmospherically corrected bi directional surface reflectance masked for water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows the ndvi images which are freely distributed in tiles from the usgs website http lpdaac usgs gov have a 250 m spatial resolution and are composed over a 16 day period through a maximum value composite operation all images of the tiles corresponding to italy were downloaded for the years 2003 2012 and corrected for residual atmospheric disturbances as described in maselli et al 2009a the study also utilized some google earth ge true colour composite images of the two study sites taken during or just after the examined periods more precisely the ge scene of amplero was collected in 30 september 2009 while that of monte bondone refers to 19th july 2009 5 data processing modified c fix and biome bgc were applied in the two study areas for the entire period considered 2003 2012 the values of the ancillary data needed for this operation were extracted from the 1 km pixels centred on the flux towers while the ndvi values were extracted from windows of 3 3 250 m pixels as fully described in maselli et al 2013 the daily estimates of photosynthesis and respirations obtained were then combined to predict npp which according to biome bgc modelling of grasslands can be converted into aboveground npp by multiplication for 0 33 the same estimates were also combined to compute nep using ch factors derived from the available information sources as previously noted the amplero site is commonly subjected to both extensive mowing and cattle grazing mowing is usually performed at the end of spring mid june after which the remaining grass is grazed the biomass fraction removed through mowing can be quite high considering a maximum height of the sward around 0 3 m this fraction can reach 0 8 marcolla et al 2011 mowing however affects only a major fraction of the tower footprint area which considering local management practices was approximated to correspond to four fifths 0 8 no effect of manure deployment after mowing was taken into consideration being this practice uncommon in this area ground observations taken in similar environments managed in the same extensive way indicate that the mean fractional annual aboveground biomass removed by grazing equals about 0 25 aboveground npp staglianò et al 2001 fatica et al 2019 this value must be reduced by the fraction of ingested c directly respired by animals or returning to soil as excreta which is around 0 7 kennedy and till 1981 hence the ch factor for amplero was computed as 6 ch np p 1 12 np p 1 6 0 33 0 8 0 8 np p 7 12 0 33 0 25 0 3 np p 1 12 where npp1 12 npp1 6 and npp7 12 are the npp estimated over the respective months respectively the estimation of ch was simpler for monte bondone where mowing is usually applied once at the middle of the growing season i e in july a visual analysis of the available ge images indicated that the mowed area fraction within the tower footprint is slightly lower than that of amplero due to the presence of small forest patches see fig 3 this fraction was therefore approximated to two thirds of the footprint area 0 67 also in this case the effect of manure deployment was considered to be irrelevant and ch was computed as 7 ch np p 1 12 np p 1 7 0 33 0 67 0 8 np p 1 12 the daily gppc and nep estimates obtained for the two sites were averaged over the years covered by the respective flux tower observations 2003 2007 for amplero and 2003 2012 for monte bondone and validated through comparison with the latter the accuracy assessment was summarized using common statistics i e the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean bias error mbe 6 results 6 1 amplero fig 4 shows the annual evolution of the cws factor which is an effective descriptor of seasonal meteorological water stress this factor starts to decrease in march and reaches minimum values around 0 5 during summer i e from the end of june till the end of august after this period it increases as a consequence of the reduced insolation and the occurrence of rainfalls this annual evolution has an impact on vegetation that is indicated by a ndvi drop following the summer water stress period fig 4 the summer ndvi minimum can also be partly due to the grazing and mowing activities which usually occur during this period the reference gpp obtained by the eddy covariance technique is shown in fig 5 the annual gpp evolution reflects the behaviour of typical mediterranean vegetation which has production maxima in may june the subsequent reduction is again a consequence of both climatic conditions i e a reduction of precipitation and an increase of air temperature and management operations i e spring mowing and summer grazing in autumn a slight recovery occurs with values much lower than those achieved in spring 3 g c m 2 day 1 versus 10 g c m 2 day 1 on an annual basis the gpp total is around 1222 g c m 2 modified c fix which incorporates the above seen ndvi values is capable of reproducing this evolution both in terms of correlation r2 0 899 and errors rmse 1 02 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 60 g c m 2 day 1 fig 5 a moderate overestimation of this model induces an annual gpp total of 1440 g c m 2 fig 6 shows the mean daily evolution of nep measured at amplero as can be noted the maximum assimilation rate is reached in may followed by a marked reduction until the end of july and a recovery in autumn this annual evolution is obviously mostly determined by the corresponding gpp pattern and has similar causes on an annual basis the area behaves as a sink being the mean annual nep equal to 106 g c m 2 the application of eq 6 yields a ch factor equal to 0 861 which induces an annual off site loss of 99 0 g c m 2 the great majority of this estimate more than 90 comes from the first part of the equation which simulates spring mowing while the contribution of cattle grazing is actually minor these findings are due to both the prevalence of the npp in the first part of the season with respect to the npp after june around 460 versus 110 g c m 2 respectively and to the different values used in eq 6 for rescaling these estimates while in fact a fraction around 0 64 of the produced aboveground biomass is removed by mowing this fraction is strongly reduced for grazing by the two scalars accounting for the actually grazed grass and the c return to atmosphere and soil through animals 0 25 and 0 3 respectively the daily nep estimates obtained using these values are shown again in fig 6 the annual evolution is very close to that of the eddy covariance data indicating a behaviour as c source at the beginning of the year and after the summer minimum the annual nep total is 107 g c m 2 and the errors are very low rmse 1 05 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 00 g c m 2 day 1 6 2 monte bondone the environmental conditions characterizing the alpine grassland of monte bondone are different from those of amplero fig 7 shows the mean evolution of cws which is very close to 1 during the whole season indicating that water is usually not limiting plant growth in this area the evolution of ndvi which is shown in the same figure confirms this characteristic the growing season lasts from the end of march till the end of october without showing any significant summer reduction the mean reference gpp however reveals a different temporal pattern of photosynthesis fig 8 a strong reduction of photosynthetic activity is detected in july presumably due the effect of mowing which is annually performed in the area during this period the gpp decreases from about 13 to 6 g c m 2 day 1 on an annual basis the total gpp is 1428 g c m 2 in this situation the use of the ndvi values to drive c fix leads to overestimate the summer gpp and consequently the annual gpp total i e 1680 g c m 2 fig 8 the overall accordance between observed and estimated gpp is still good but a clear overestimation is evident in july august r2 0 906 rmse 1 54 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 70 g c m 2 day 1 the flux tower nep measurements shown in fig 9 follow a seasonal pattern consequent on that of observed gpp i e with a clear summer minimum probably induced by the mentioned disturbances the annual total is about 86 g c m 2 with the grassland which behaves as c sink from the beginning of may till the beginning of july after the summer minimum a slight increase is observed up to a secondary peak in september next the grassland starts again to behave as c source the application of eq 7 yields a ch factor equal to 0 904 which corresponds to an annual off site loss of 92 8 g c the daily nep estimates shown in fig 9 have a pattern which directly derives from that of the simulated gpp revealing an inaccurate prediction of a summer peak at the beginning of july the annual accordance between measured and estimated nep is however relatively good r2 0 417 rmse 2 36 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 01 g c m 2 day 1 also due to a certain underestimation during winter and autumn 7 discussion the modelling strategy currently applied to simulate the c balance of two managed grasslands in italy is affected by various issues the impact of which is dependent on both the ecological characteristics and management practices of each site and on the information available about these features in particular the strategy takes into account the local environmental characteristics by combining information on site terrain soil and vegetation with daily meteorological datasets the ancillary information on site characteristics was currently derived from the ecological descriptions of the two areas which have been the subject of several previous studies e g wohlfahrt et al 2008 marcolla et al 2011 maselli et al 2013 berninger et al 2015 the used interpolated meteorological datasets can also be assumed to be quite accurate in both test sites maselli et al 2012 in fact demonstrated that the daily minimum and maximum temperatures currently used can faithfully reproduce ground measurements in most terrain conditions lower accuracy can characterize the used daily rainfall which however was found to be almost unbiased when assessed towards the tower measurements in the amplero site data not shown this was less the case for monte bondone where a rainfall overestimation during the summer season leads to underestimate the effect of water stress this problem increases the original model gpp overestimation which is obviously reduced when using the tower rainfall observations from about 18 to 11 regarding the remotely sensed data in the first study site amplero the presence of a relatively large and homogeneous grassland allows an efficient application of the method to extract modis ndvi values and consequently a correct estimation of fapar and gpp seasonal evolutions maselli et al 2013 greater difficulty is encountered at monte bondone where the use of modis data is ineffective in correctly estimating the grassland gpp and nep evolutions particularly concerning the detection of the summer minima in order to investigate on this issue summer ndvi drops were simulated using the information available for this site about the biomass removal induced by mowing as previously seen mowing was estimated to affect about 67 of the footprint area where the reduction of aboveground biomass was around 80 the overall effect of this removal was therefore hypothesized to correspond to abrupt 50 ndvi reductions at dates which were approximately identified for each year from the examination of the flux tower gpp evolutions a linear recovery to the original ndvi values was then assumed within 50 days i e with a 1 daily increase the mean corrected ndvi evolution obtained in this way is shown in fig 7 fig 10 shows the gpp and nep evolutions obtained by the modelling strategy fed with the corrected ndvi values the correction has effects on both gross and net ecosystem production estimates improving the simulation of the flux tower observations concerning the summer drop for both variables in fact the accuracy is enhanced both in terms of correlation r2 0 958 for gpp and 0 678 for nep and errors rmse 0 88 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 25 g c m 2 day 1 for gpp rmse 1 67 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 02 g c m 2 day 1 for nep the variable performances obtained in the two case studies by the lue model can therefore be mainly attributed to the different capacities of the modis ndvi imagery to capture the effects of the applied green biomass removals at amplero in fact biomass losses due to late spring mowing add to losses due to cattle grazing during the second part of the growing season this induces an extensive green biomass decrease from june to september which is exacerbated by the summer dryness typical of the local mediterranean climate such decrease can be clearly detected by the used modis ndvi imagery leading to an efficient functioning of the lue model applied the case is different for monte bondone where the grassland is mowed once a year usually in july inducing abrupt and spatially concentrated biomass losses which are not reflected into modis ndvi decreases this problem is likely originated by several factors which act synergistically the first is obviously related to the insufficient spatial resolution of the modis images mowing in fact is commonly applied over areas of 1 2 ha fig 3 which are much smaller than the modis pixel size about 6 2 ha as can be seen in the same figure the area around the flux tower is also partly occupied by evergreen coniferous trees which show constantly high ndvi values during the summer season these problems are exacerbated by the limited temporal resolution of the used imagery the 16 day resolution of the original modis mvc ndvi images is in fact further reduced by the temporal filtering currently applied which corrects for residual atmospheric contaminations by removing abrupt ndvi decreases followed by rapid recoveries maselli et al 2009a all these issues added to a lack of a clear water stress period in this alpine environment induce summer ndvi plateaus which do not reflect the green biomass decreases actually occurred the correct prediction of gpp is obviously a prerequisite for the estimation of net c fluxes which however requires also an efficient simulation of all ecosystem respirations the general capacity of biome bgc to address this issue has been demonstrated in previous publications e g maselli et al 2013 chirici et al 2016 the current modelling strategy is based on the additional correction of the heterotrophic respiration estimates which is carried out using information on the biomass changes occurred in each site the importance of human induced biomass changes in determining the net c fluxes of managed grasslands has been recognized in numerous investigations among which yu et al 2018 and myrgiotis et al 2021 these authors propose to derive information on such changes from remotely sensed images which is currently unfeasible due to spatio temporal resolution issues the only high spatial resolution satellite dataset covering the time periods of the flux tower observations is in fact that acquired by the landsat mission which has an effective revisiting period insufficient to follow rapidly changing grassland conditions ju and roi 2008 the currently adopted strategy is therefore analogous to that previously applied to forest ecosystems where the biomass changes usually correspond to losses of woody tissues due to tree cutting thinning wildfires etc schulze et al 2021 this strategy uses the ratio between actual and potential woody biomass as an indicator of the ecosystem distance from equilibrium due to such losses which is employed to modify the estimated respiration rates maselli et al 2009b while this approach is not directly applicable to grasslands where permanent woody tissues are absent and green biomass losses are rapidly replenished it is postulated that the biomass quantity which is removed or added in these ecosystems can be estimated from ancillary information sources the information available for amplero indicates that this apennine site is managed by the sequential application of spring mowing and summer grazing the simulations performed indicate that the former operation which is carried out at the end of the most productive spring period is responsible for most of the occurring biomass removal and consequent rh reduction in contrast cattle grazing affects the smaller biomass quantity which is produced during the water limited summer season and is anyway less efficient in c harvesting and translocation a similar effect of mowing has been simulated in the alpine study area monte bondone based on the respective documentation this simulation strategy however should be modified when manure is deployed after mowing since this operation would obviously increase the return of biomass to soil the information collected about the two study sites or derived from existing literature which has been used to define the scalars of eqs 6 7 is plausible but obviously affected by high uncertainty which is not quantifiable experimentally a confirmation of the annual off site losses obtained through eqs 6 and 7 can however be derived from the work of berninger et al 2015 these authors in fact report off site loss observations which are slightly lower than those currently estimated i e 78 versus 92 g c m 2 for amplero and 62 versus 82 g c m 2 for monte bondone the use of these observations to drive eqs 4 and 5 yields correspondingly reduced annual nep estimates 86 and 60 g c m 2 for amplero and monte bondone respectively which are also lower than the flux tower measurements it should be noted however that all observations of berninger et al 2015 refer to unspecified time periods which are in all likelihood different from those currently considered the information about the two sites reported by the same authors also confirms that in both cases the off site biomass inputs such as deployment of manure are negligible this is in accordance with the results of the current simulation exercises which indicate that the off site losses considered fully justify the positive nep measured by the two towers as previously noted however the current modelling strategy should be applicable also to simulate the effects of off site inputs once information on the respective intensity i e annual biomass or c amount provided is available the experimental results obtained have also relevant implications about the ecological sustainability of the management practices applied in the two sites these practices in fact seem to remove only a relatively small fraction of the biomass produced annually i e around 42 and 31 of above ground npp for amplero at monte bondone respectively these fractions are compatible with moderate and conservative levels of grazing intensity respectively as defined by the usda documentation summarized in table 1 holecheck and galt 2000 both levels correspond to only partial biomass removal and a limited exploitation of environmental resources which is expected to be sustainable on the long term as concerns the general representativity of these considerations amplero and monte bondone show environmental features which are common in the apennine and alpine mountain zones respectively and are managed through traditional and typical methods hence the c cycles of these sites should be representative for managed forage resources in terms of type and intensity of exploitation which are widespread over the two mountain chains extensive management of grasslands is in fact highly represented in both investigated areas of apennines and alps scotton and crestani 2019 d ottavio et al 2021 in mountain areas dominated by mediterranean conditions such as in amplero site after the first cut the regrowth is generally so reduced that the low amount of biomass can be profitably utilized only by extensive grazing scocco et al 2016 on the other hand high mountain meadows here represented by monte bondone site are generally cut for hay production once a year andreatta et al 2022 as the possibility of performing more cuts during the same year is constrained by the short vegetative season the length of which is an important limiting factor for annual aboveground production scotton et al 2014 more generally an efficient conservation of grassland resources by means of management even at an extensive level is widely applied in italy ponzetta et al 2010 as it can reduce the risks of abandonment hilpold et al 2018 that can lead to the disappearance of grasslands and ecosystem services that they provide bengtsson et al 2019 faccioni et al 2019 8 conclusions the modelling strategy applied in the current experiments derives from several methodological investigations which are fully documented in the mentioned literature this strategy relies on the following two major strengths 1 the capacity of c fix to reproduce the gpp of grasslands including the effects of disturbances which was demonstrated by maselli et al 2013 and is confirmed by the current experiment 2 the efficiency of biome bgc integrated with c fix to simulate the autotrophic respiration and consequently the npp of the same ecosystems which was proved by the same article the prediction of nep requires the additional simulation of rh which is affected by the biomass changes off site inputs and losses caused by the management practices applied to address this issue an additional factor descriptive of such changes has been incorporated in the simulation of rh this factor can be computed on the basis of commonly available information the accuracy of which is obviously decisive for a correct estimation of local net c exchanges in particular the information collected for each site should allow a proper characterization of the two main practices responsible for the occurred c changes grazing and mowing as previously mentioned the effect of grazing could be categorized following the generalized usda scheme reported in table 1 in the case of mowing attention should be focused on the timing and intensity of this operation as well as on the possible use of natural fertilisers the simulations performed support the higher efficiency of mowing with respect to grazing in reducing rh and increasing nep mowing in fact usually removes a major part of the biomass yielded during the most productive spring period while grazing is often performed during the water limited season and is anyway less efficient in c translocation the situation could however change when manure is deployed after mowing thus increasing the return of biomass to pastures this implies that the fertilization practices applied should be properly characterized for the correct simulation of grassland net c fluxes sollenberger et al 2019 the tests performed show the general efficiency of the modified modelling strategy as well as some limitations which are mostly due to the spatial and temporal features of the datasets utilized to characterize the effects of the management practices this is particularly the case for the remote sensing images utilized which are suboptimal to identify the impact of the mowing operations occurred in the second study area a decisive step towards the solution of this problem is expected to come from the availability of sentinel 2 msi data which have been acquired since 2017 and show a spatial resolution substantially enhanced with respect to modis i e 10 versus 250 m these images should therefore be much more suited to characterize the possible disturbances and specifically the extent and intensity of grazing and mowing activities reinermann et al 2020 myrgiotis et al 2021 this possibility which was not currently explorable due to the retrospective nature of our study could be decisive to enhance the model efficiency for both scientific and operational applications in particular the modelling approach could be applied to simulate the behaviour of different grassland types exploited under various management conditions such as meadows and pastures or resources characterized by mixed utilization on the same surface and intensity

24330,the current paper presents a methodology which can simulate the net carbon fluxes of semi natural grasslands based on the combination of a parametric and a bio geochemical model the first model modified c fix estimates grassland gross primary production gpp by driving the light use efficiency approach with remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index ndvi data the latter model biome bgc simulates all main ecosystem processes based on meteorological and ancillary data the outputs of the two models are finally combined and corrected for the effects of human induced biomass changes i e mowing grazing etc the modelling strategy fed with ancillary and modis ndvi data is tested in two semi natural grasslands the first amplero on the apennines and the second monte bondone on the alps central and northern italy respectively the two sites which show diversified eco climatic conditions and are managed differently i e amplero by spring mowing plus cattle grazing and monte bondone by summer mowing were selected for the availability of eddy covariance observations of gpp and net ecosystem production nep collected during several years from 2003 to 2012 these observations were used to assess the estimates of the modelling strategy obtaining promising results for both study sites the greatest estimation errors are found in the alpine site and are mostly induced by the inaccurate detection of local grassland ndvi values which is due to the insufficient spatial and temporal resolutions of the used modis ndvi imagery the results of the study highlight the importance of information on the local management practices applied which is decisive for quantifying medium term changes in net carbon fluxes keywords c fix biome bgc gpp nep ndvi modis pasture data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction grasslands occupy a large portion of the earth ice free lands and are capable of storing great carbon c quantity especially in the soil conant et al 2017 from an eco physiological viewpoint the c cycle of grasslands includes various components photosynthesis i e gross primary production gpp by which carbon dioxide is removed from the air and autotrophic i e maintenance and growth plant respirations ra and heterotrophic soil microbial decomposition rh respirations by which carbon dioxide is released in the air the difference between gpp and ra gives the grassland net primary production npp and when also rh is removed net ecosystem production nep is obtained keenan and williams 2018 both net production variables are therefore important but while npp indicates the grassland growing potential in terms of new biomass accumulation nep indicates if the grassland is acting as c source or sink hence the latter variable is particularly relevant to characterize grassland role within the global c cycle bengtsson et al 2019 the net c fluxes of grasslands and specifically nep are determined by different factors such as climate vegetation and soil composition and status wang et al 2019 in managed ecosystems the practices applied represent relevant disturbances that affect the greenhouse gas exchange soussana et al 2007 the most common practices can imply both biomass losses i e by cattle grazing mowing etc and inputs e g by deployment of manure wohlfahrt et al 2008 the high spatio temporal variability which often characterizes the distribution and impact of such disturbances complicates the investigation on grassland role as c source or sink koncz et al 2020 particularly when using the eddy covariance technique that assumes a spatial homogeneity over the footprint area de la motte et al 2019 hence modelling approaches have been widely applied to quantify such balance but they require both a deep knowledge of ecosystem functioning and detailed information on the disturbances occurred which are rarely available gang et al 2011 this situation has promoted the increasing use of remote sensing techniques which allow to assess grassland characteristics and functions over different spatial and temporal scales argenti et al 2011 wachendorf et al 2018 reinermann et al 2020 this is particularly the case for optical sensors mounted onboard satellite systems some of which have large spatial coverage and frequent revisiting time mcroberts and tomppo 2007 white et al 2016 optical remotely sensed imagery for example can help detecting phenology or leaf area index to be then incorporated within models you et al 2019 myrgiotis et al 2021 the same imagery can provide effective estimates of the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation fapar which are combined with ancillary data to obtain the ecosystem gpp through the so called light use efficiency lue approach veroustraete et al 2002 yu 2020 this approach provides the theoretical foundation for the most widespread gpp prediction methods such as the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis gpp algorithm which has been assessed in a number of cases heinsch et al 2006 yuan et al 2014 in the specific research context the lue approach is capable of predicting the impact of green biomass changes on gpp but can yield only approximate estimates of net c fluxes npp and nep since actual ra and rh cannot be observed directly through remote sensing techniques waring and running 2007 this issue has been efficiently addressed by the integrated use of ecosystem process and remote sensing models wang et al 2011 maselli et al 2017 this strategy was successfully followed by maselli et al 2013 who combined the outputs of a lue model c fix and of a bio geochemical model biome bgc to predict the npp of mediterranean grasslands the objective of the current research is to verify the applicability of a similar modelling strategy to predict the nep of mountain managed pastures this operation requires the additional simulation of heterotrophic respiration which must take into account the impacts of the disturbances affecting each ecosystem in order to address this issue a correction of biome bgc rh estimates is proposed which can be driven by commonly available information regarding the management practices applied the modified modelling strategy is thus capable of integrating ancillary and remotely sensed data to yield estimates of actual nep over wide areas which have been validated versus the flux tower observations of two study sites the manuscript is organised as follows first the nep simulation strategy is described including the two models applied modified c fix and biome bgc and the combination of their outputs taking into account the effects of human induced disturbances i e grazing and or mowing this is followed by the introduction of two study sites in italy one on the apennines amplero and the other on the alps monte bondone where gpp and nep observations were collected for several years through the eddy covariance technique baldocchi 2003 these observations are then described together with the ground and remotely sensed datasets used in the investigation the following two sections report on the data processing performed and the results achieved in the two study areas the final sections summarize and discuss the main implications and conclusions which can be drawn from the experiment 2 modelling strategy 2 1 c fix c fix is a lue model which was originally developed to simulate the c fluxes of forest ecosystems through the combination of ground temperature and radiation measurements with remotely sensed fapar observations derived from ndvi veroustraete et al 2002 the model was then modified by including an additional meteorological water stress factor cws which can improve its applicability in semi arid mediterranean areas maselli et al 2009a cws in fact is derived from the ratio between rainfall and potential evapotranspiration and limits photosynthesis in case of short term water stress maselli et al 2009a in a subsequent study maselli et al 2013 modified c fix was applied to predict the daily gpp of grasslands gppc g c m 2 day 1 by means of 1 gp p c ε max t cor cws fapar par where εm ax is the maximum radiation use efficiency ε t cor is a factor accounting for the dependence of photosynthesis on air temperature and fapar is the fraction of par absorbed by the vegetation all referred to the day examined as more fully described in maselli et al 2013 ε max is set to 1 65 g mj 1 apar t cor is that proposed for grassland by running et al 2004 while the water stress index is computed by cumulating actual and potential evapotranspiration over a period of one month 2 2 biome bgc the bio geochemical model biome bgc was developed at the university of montana to estimate the storage and fluxes of water c and nitrogen within terrestrial ecosystems running and hunt 1993 golinkoff 2010 among the inputs required to the model there are i daily climate data i e minimum and maximum air temperature precipitation solar radiation etc ii descriptors of the main characteristics of the environment i e soil type and depth vegetation type and site conditions and iii parameters describing the ecophysiological features of vegetation biome bgc is capable of finding a quasi equilibrium with local eco climatic conditions through the spin up phase which aims at quantifying the initial amount of all c and nitrogen pools the model then proceeds with a normal simulation to estimate all respiration and allocation processes of the examined years white et al 2000 churkina et al 2003 the modelling of quasi equilibrium condition implies that the sum of all simulated respirations becomes nearly equivalent to gpp consequently annual npp approaches heterotrophic respiration and annual nep tends to zero golinkoff 2010 the version of the model currently used 4 2 includes complete parameter settings for several biome types amongst which that for grasslands was originally proposed by white et al 2000 and calibrated for italian areas by maselli et al 2013 2 3 combination and correction of model outputs following the modelling strategy described in maselli et al 2013 the daily npp and nep estimates of grasslands can be obtained by simply combining the outputs of the two models as 2 npp gp p c g r b m r b gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 3 nep gp p c g r b m r b h r b gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 where gppb grb mrb and hrb represent the biome bgc estimates of photosynthesis growth maintenance and heterotrophic respirations respectively and the subfixes 1 12 indicate the annual totals which are used to normalize the biome bgc estimates with respect to those of c fix a similar theoretical background can be used to correct the nep estimates for the effects of artificial biomass changes occurring in managed grasslands i e off site losses or inputs which can reduce or increase rh chirici et al 2022 hence still considering a condition close to equilibrium and a mean annual c change equal to δc an additional correction factor for rh ch can be computed as 4 ch np p 1 12 δ c np p 1 12 where npp1 12 is the annual npp predicted by eq 2 finally the daily nep of managed grasslands nep can be estimated as 5 nep gp p c g r b m r b h r b c h gp p b 1 12 gp p c 1 12 as can be easily understood ch becomes smaller than 1 following an off site loss and the opposite is true for an off site input in the former case the long term nep tends to be negative i e the ecosystem behaves as a c source while in the latter case it tends to be positive i e the ecosystem behaves as a c sink 3 study sites 3 1 apennine site amplero 41 904 n 13 605 e fig 1 is situated in central italy on a gently sloped area at an altitude of about 880 m above sea level the climate of the area is alpine mediterranean with mean annual precipitation of 1365 mm and mean annual temperature of about 10 c rainfall has two maxima one in spring and one in autumn while the minimum is in june the soil is a haplic phaeozem its depth is about 1 m and the percentage of clay is more than 55 this joint to the reduced slope sometimes leads to poorly drained conditions maselli et al 2013 the area is characterized by the presence of a mixed homogenous grassland fig 2 mainly composed by few dominant graminoids mainly represented by genus poa legumes genera trifolium and medicago and composites genera geranium and cerastium this grassland is usually mowed in june for hay production and then extensively grazed by cattle till the end of the growing season berninger et al 2015 3 2 alpine site monte bondone 46 015 n 11 046 e fig 1 is situated at 1550 m above sea level in the italian alps the morphology of the area which covers about 2 km2 is gently sloped the mean annual temperature is about 5 5 c while mean annual rainfall is around 1190 mm with maxima in june and october the snow cover extends from november to april while the peak of the growing season generally occurs between middle june and early july marcolla et al 2011 the soil is a typic hapludalfs and has a loamy texture the site is covered by a meadow fig 3 dominated by the presence of festuca rubra nardus stricta and trifolium spp which are typical of low productive grasslands in the alpine region berninger et al 2015 this site is traditionally managed for hay production and is mowed once per year around mid july wohlfahrt et al 2008 4 study data 4 1 meteorological data basic daily weather variables i e minimum and maximum air temperature and precipitation were derived for the whole study period i e 2003 2012 from the e obs dataset haylock et al 2008 and were downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution as described in maselli et al 2012 and fibbi et al 2016 solar radiation was then obtained by the mt clim algorithm thornton et al 2000 4 2 eddy covariance data reference nep measurements were taken by the eddy covariance technique over the years 2003 2007 and 2003 2012 for amplero and monte bondone respectively these measurements were collected and processed according to the state of the art methodology i e by applying gap filling and flux partitioning to derive daily gpp and ecosystem respiration reichstein et al 2005 specifically level 4 data files including also meteorological data were freely downloaded from the european fluxes database http www europe fluxdata eu 4 3 satellite data multitemporal ndvi images of both study areas were derived from the modis terra and aqua satellite sensors the modis ndvi product mod13q1 is computed from atmospherically corrected bi directional surface reflectance masked for water clouds heavy aerosols and cloud shadows the ndvi images which are freely distributed in tiles from the usgs website http lpdaac usgs gov have a 250 m spatial resolution and are composed over a 16 day period through a maximum value composite operation all images of the tiles corresponding to italy were downloaded for the years 2003 2012 and corrected for residual atmospheric disturbances as described in maselli et al 2009a the study also utilized some google earth ge true colour composite images of the two study sites taken during or just after the examined periods more precisely the ge scene of amplero was collected in 30 september 2009 while that of monte bondone refers to 19th july 2009 5 data processing modified c fix and biome bgc were applied in the two study areas for the entire period considered 2003 2012 the values of the ancillary data needed for this operation were extracted from the 1 km pixels centred on the flux towers while the ndvi values were extracted from windows of 3 3 250 m pixels as fully described in maselli et al 2013 the daily estimates of photosynthesis and respirations obtained were then combined to predict npp which according to biome bgc modelling of grasslands can be converted into aboveground npp by multiplication for 0 33 the same estimates were also combined to compute nep using ch factors derived from the available information sources as previously noted the amplero site is commonly subjected to both extensive mowing and cattle grazing mowing is usually performed at the end of spring mid june after which the remaining grass is grazed the biomass fraction removed through mowing can be quite high considering a maximum height of the sward around 0 3 m this fraction can reach 0 8 marcolla et al 2011 mowing however affects only a major fraction of the tower footprint area which considering local management practices was approximated to correspond to four fifths 0 8 no effect of manure deployment after mowing was taken into consideration being this practice uncommon in this area ground observations taken in similar environments managed in the same extensive way indicate that the mean fractional annual aboveground biomass removed by grazing equals about 0 25 aboveground npp staglianò et al 2001 fatica et al 2019 this value must be reduced by the fraction of ingested c directly respired by animals or returning to soil as excreta which is around 0 7 kennedy and till 1981 hence the ch factor for amplero was computed as 6 ch np p 1 12 np p 1 6 0 33 0 8 0 8 np p 7 12 0 33 0 25 0 3 np p 1 12 where npp1 12 npp1 6 and npp7 12 are the npp estimated over the respective months respectively the estimation of ch was simpler for monte bondone where mowing is usually applied once at the middle of the growing season i e in july a visual analysis of the available ge images indicated that the mowed area fraction within the tower footprint is slightly lower than that of amplero due to the presence of small forest patches see fig 3 this fraction was therefore approximated to two thirds of the footprint area 0 67 also in this case the effect of manure deployment was considered to be irrelevant and ch was computed as 7 ch np p 1 12 np p 1 7 0 33 0 67 0 8 np p 1 12 the daily gppc and nep estimates obtained for the two sites were averaged over the years covered by the respective flux tower observations 2003 2007 for amplero and 2003 2012 for monte bondone and validated through comparison with the latter the accuracy assessment was summarized using common statistics i e the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean bias error mbe 6 results 6 1 amplero fig 4 shows the annual evolution of the cws factor which is an effective descriptor of seasonal meteorological water stress this factor starts to decrease in march and reaches minimum values around 0 5 during summer i e from the end of june till the end of august after this period it increases as a consequence of the reduced insolation and the occurrence of rainfalls this annual evolution has an impact on vegetation that is indicated by a ndvi drop following the summer water stress period fig 4 the summer ndvi minimum can also be partly due to the grazing and mowing activities which usually occur during this period the reference gpp obtained by the eddy covariance technique is shown in fig 5 the annual gpp evolution reflects the behaviour of typical mediterranean vegetation which has production maxima in may june the subsequent reduction is again a consequence of both climatic conditions i e a reduction of precipitation and an increase of air temperature and management operations i e spring mowing and summer grazing in autumn a slight recovery occurs with values much lower than those achieved in spring 3 g c m 2 day 1 versus 10 g c m 2 day 1 on an annual basis the gpp total is around 1222 g c m 2 modified c fix which incorporates the above seen ndvi values is capable of reproducing this evolution both in terms of correlation r2 0 899 and errors rmse 1 02 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 60 g c m 2 day 1 fig 5 a moderate overestimation of this model induces an annual gpp total of 1440 g c m 2 fig 6 shows the mean daily evolution of nep measured at amplero as can be noted the maximum assimilation rate is reached in may followed by a marked reduction until the end of july and a recovery in autumn this annual evolution is obviously mostly determined by the corresponding gpp pattern and has similar causes on an annual basis the area behaves as a sink being the mean annual nep equal to 106 g c m 2 the application of eq 6 yields a ch factor equal to 0 861 which induces an annual off site loss of 99 0 g c m 2 the great majority of this estimate more than 90 comes from the first part of the equation which simulates spring mowing while the contribution of cattle grazing is actually minor these findings are due to both the prevalence of the npp in the first part of the season with respect to the npp after june around 460 versus 110 g c m 2 respectively and to the different values used in eq 6 for rescaling these estimates while in fact a fraction around 0 64 of the produced aboveground biomass is removed by mowing this fraction is strongly reduced for grazing by the two scalars accounting for the actually grazed grass and the c return to atmosphere and soil through animals 0 25 and 0 3 respectively the daily nep estimates obtained using these values are shown again in fig 6 the annual evolution is very close to that of the eddy covariance data indicating a behaviour as c source at the beginning of the year and after the summer minimum the annual nep total is 107 g c m 2 and the errors are very low rmse 1 05 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 00 g c m 2 day 1 6 2 monte bondone the environmental conditions characterizing the alpine grassland of monte bondone are different from those of amplero fig 7 shows the mean evolution of cws which is very close to 1 during the whole season indicating that water is usually not limiting plant growth in this area the evolution of ndvi which is shown in the same figure confirms this characteristic the growing season lasts from the end of march till the end of october without showing any significant summer reduction the mean reference gpp however reveals a different temporal pattern of photosynthesis fig 8 a strong reduction of photosynthetic activity is detected in july presumably due the effect of mowing which is annually performed in the area during this period the gpp decreases from about 13 to 6 g c m 2 day 1 on an annual basis the total gpp is 1428 g c m 2 in this situation the use of the ndvi values to drive c fix leads to overestimate the summer gpp and consequently the annual gpp total i e 1680 g c m 2 fig 8 the overall accordance between observed and estimated gpp is still good but a clear overestimation is evident in july august r2 0 906 rmse 1 54 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 70 g c m 2 day 1 the flux tower nep measurements shown in fig 9 follow a seasonal pattern consequent on that of observed gpp i e with a clear summer minimum probably induced by the mentioned disturbances the annual total is about 86 g c m 2 with the grassland which behaves as c sink from the beginning of may till the beginning of july after the summer minimum a slight increase is observed up to a secondary peak in september next the grassland starts again to behave as c source the application of eq 7 yields a ch factor equal to 0 904 which corresponds to an annual off site loss of 92 8 g c the daily nep estimates shown in fig 9 have a pattern which directly derives from that of the simulated gpp revealing an inaccurate prediction of a summer peak at the beginning of july the annual accordance between measured and estimated nep is however relatively good r2 0 417 rmse 2 36 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 01 g c m 2 day 1 also due to a certain underestimation during winter and autumn 7 discussion the modelling strategy currently applied to simulate the c balance of two managed grasslands in italy is affected by various issues the impact of which is dependent on both the ecological characteristics and management practices of each site and on the information available about these features in particular the strategy takes into account the local environmental characteristics by combining information on site terrain soil and vegetation with daily meteorological datasets the ancillary information on site characteristics was currently derived from the ecological descriptions of the two areas which have been the subject of several previous studies e g wohlfahrt et al 2008 marcolla et al 2011 maselli et al 2013 berninger et al 2015 the used interpolated meteorological datasets can also be assumed to be quite accurate in both test sites maselli et al 2012 in fact demonstrated that the daily minimum and maximum temperatures currently used can faithfully reproduce ground measurements in most terrain conditions lower accuracy can characterize the used daily rainfall which however was found to be almost unbiased when assessed towards the tower measurements in the amplero site data not shown this was less the case for monte bondone where a rainfall overestimation during the summer season leads to underestimate the effect of water stress this problem increases the original model gpp overestimation which is obviously reduced when using the tower rainfall observations from about 18 to 11 regarding the remotely sensed data in the first study site amplero the presence of a relatively large and homogeneous grassland allows an efficient application of the method to extract modis ndvi values and consequently a correct estimation of fapar and gpp seasonal evolutions maselli et al 2013 greater difficulty is encountered at monte bondone where the use of modis data is ineffective in correctly estimating the grassland gpp and nep evolutions particularly concerning the detection of the summer minima in order to investigate on this issue summer ndvi drops were simulated using the information available for this site about the biomass removal induced by mowing as previously seen mowing was estimated to affect about 67 of the footprint area where the reduction of aboveground biomass was around 80 the overall effect of this removal was therefore hypothesized to correspond to abrupt 50 ndvi reductions at dates which were approximately identified for each year from the examination of the flux tower gpp evolutions a linear recovery to the original ndvi values was then assumed within 50 days i e with a 1 daily increase the mean corrected ndvi evolution obtained in this way is shown in fig 7 fig 10 shows the gpp and nep evolutions obtained by the modelling strategy fed with the corrected ndvi values the correction has effects on both gross and net ecosystem production estimates improving the simulation of the flux tower observations concerning the summer drop for both variables in fact the accuracy is enhanced both in terms of correlation r2 0 958 for gpp and 0 678 for nep and errors rmse 0 88 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 25 g c m 2 day 1 for gpp rmse 1 67 g c m 2 day 1 and mbe 0 02 g c m 2 day 1 for nep the variable performances obtained in the two case studies by the lue model can therefore be mainly attributed to the different capacities of the modis ndvi imagery to capture the effects of the applied green biomass removals at amplero in fact biomass losses due to late spring mowing add to losses due to cattle grazing during the second part of the growing season this induces an extensive green biomass decrease from june to september which is exacerbated by the summer dryness typical of the local mediterranean climate such decrease can be clearly detected by the used modis ndvi imagery leading to an efficient functioning of the lue model applied the case is different for monte bondone where the grassland is mowed once a year usually in july inducing abrupt and spatially concentrated biomass losses which are not reflected into modis ndvi decreases this problem is likely originated by several factors which act synergistically the first is obviously related to the insufficient spatial resolution of the modis images mowing in fact is commonly applied over areas of 1 2 ha fig 3 which are much smaller than the modis pixel size about 6 2 ha as can be seen in the same figure the area around the flux tower is also partly occupied by evergreen coniferous trees which show constantly high ndvi values during the summer season these problems are exacerbated by the limited temporal resolution of the used imagery the 16 day resolution of the original modis mvc ndvi images is in fact further reduced by the temporal filtering currently applied which corrects for residual atmospheric contaminations by removing abrupt ndvi decreases followed by rapid recoveries maselli et al 2009a all these issues added to a lack of a clear water stress period in this alpine environment induce summer ndvi plateaus which do not reflect the green biomass decreases actually occurred the correct prediction of gpp is obviously a prerequisite for the estimation of net c fluxes which however requires also an efficient simulation of all ecosystem respirations the general capacity of biome bgc to address this issue has been demonstrated in previous publications e g maselli et al 2013 chirici et al 2016 the current modelling strategy is based on the additional correction of the heterotrophic respiration estimates which is carried out using information on the biomass changes occurred in each site the importance of human induced biomass changes in determining the net c fluxes of managed grasslands has been recognized in numerous investigations among which yu et al 2018 and myrgiotis et al 2021 these authors propose to derive information on such changes from remotely sensed images which is currently unfeasible due to spatio temporal resolution issues the only high spatial resolution satellite dataset covering the time periods of the flux tower observations is in fact that acquired by the landsat mission which has an effective revisiting period insufficient to follow rapidly changing grassland conditions ju and roi 2008 the currently adopted strategy is therefore analogous to that previously applied to forest ecosystems where the biomass changes usually correspond to losses of woody tissues due to tree cutting thinning wildfires etc schulze et al 2021 this strategy uses the ratio between actual and potential woody biomass as an indicator of the ecosystem distance from equilibrium due to such losses which is employed to modify the estimated respiration rates maselli et al 2009b while this approach is not directly applicable to grasslands where permanent woody tissues are absent and green biomass losses are rapidly replenished it is postulated that the biomass quantity which is removed or added in these ecosystems can be estimated from ancillary information sources the information available for amplero indicates that this apennine site is managed by the sequential application of spring mowing and summer grazing the simulations performed indicate that the former operation which is carried out at the end of the most productive spring period is responsible for most of the occurring biomass removal and consequent rh reduction in contrast cattle grazing affects the smaller biomass quantity which is produced during the water limited summer season and is anyway less efficient in c harvesting and translocation a similar effect of mowing has been simulated in the alpine study area monte bondone based on the respective documentation this simulation strategy however should be modified when manure is deployed after mowing since this operation would obviously increase the return of biomass to soil the information collected about the two study sites or derived from existing literature which has been used to define the scalars of eqs 6 7 is plausible but obviously affected by high uncertainty which is not quantifiable experimentally a confirmation of the annual off site losses obtained through eqs 6 and 7 can however be derived from the work of berninger et al 2015 these authors in fact report off site loss observations which are slightly lower than those currently estimated i e 78 versus 92 g c m 2 for amplero and 62 versus 82 g c m 2 for monte bondone the use of these observations to drive eqs 4 and 5 yields correspondingly reduced annual nep estimates 86 and 60 g c m 2 for amplero and monte bondone respectively which are also lower than the flux tower measurements it should be noted however that all observations of berninger et al 2015 refer to unspecified time periods which are in all likelihood different from those currently considered the information about the two sites reported by the same authors also confirms that in both cases the off site biomass inputs such as deployment of manure are negligible this is in accordance with the results of the current simulation exercises which indicate that the off site losses considered fully justify the positive nep measured by the two towers as previously noted however the current modelling strategy should be applicable also to simulate the effects of off site inputs once information on the respective intensity i e annual biomass or c amount provided is available the experimental results obtained have also relevant implications about the ecological sustainability of the management practices applied in the two sites these practices in fact seem to remove only a relatively small fraction of the biomass produced annually i e around 42 and 31 of above ground npp for amplero at monte bondone respectively these fractions are compatible with moderate and conservative levels of grazing intensity respectively as defined by the usda documentation summarized in table 1 holecheck and galt 2000 both levels correspond to only partial biomass removal and a limited exploitation of environmental resources which is expected to be sustainable on the long term as concerns the general representativity of these considerations amplero and monte bondone show environmental features which are common in the apennine and alpine mountain zones respectively and are managed through traditional and typical methods hence the c cycles of these sites should be representative for managed forage resources in terms of type and intensity of exploitation which are widespread over the two mountain chains extensive management of grasslands is in fact highly represented in both investigated areas of apennines and alps scotton and crestani 2019 d ottavio et al 2021 in mountain areas dominated by mediterranean conditions such as in amplero site after the first cut the regrowth is generally so reduced that the low amount of biomass can be profitably utilized only by extensive grazing scocco et al 2016 on the other hand high mountain meadows here represented by monte bondone site are generally cut for hay production once a year andreatta et al 2022 as the possibility of performing more cuts during the same year is constrained by the short vegetative season the length of which is an important limiting factor for annual aboveground production scotton et al 2014 more generally an efficient conservation of grassland resources by means of management even at an extensive level is widely applied in italy ponzetta et al 2010 as it can reduce the risks of abandonment hilpold et al 2018 that can lead to the disappearance of grasslands and ecosystem services that they provide bengtsson et al 2019 faccioni et al 2019 8 conclusions the modelling strategy applied in the current experiments derives from several methodological investigations which are fully documented in the mentioned literature this strategy relies on the following two major strengths 1 the capacity of c fix to reproduce the gpp of grasslands including the effects of disturbances which was demonstrated by maselli et al 2013 and is confirmed by the current experiment 2 the efficiency of biome bgc integrated with c fix to simulate the autotrophic respiration and consequently the npp of the same ecosystems which was proved by the same article the prediction of nep requires the additional simulation of rh which is affected by the biomass changes off site inputs and losses caused by the management practices applied to address this issue an additional factor descriptive of such changes has been incorporated in the simulation of rh this factor can be computed on the basis of commonly available information the accuracy of which is obviously decisive for a correct estimation of local net c exchanges in particular the information collected for each site should allow a proper characterization of the two main practices responsible for the occurred c changes grazing and mowing as previously mentioned the effect of grazing could be categorized following the generalized usda scheme reported in table 1 in the case of mowing attention should be focused on the timing and intensity of this operation as well as on the possible use of natural fertilisers the simulations performed support the higher efficiency of mowing with respect to grazing in reducing rh and increasing nep mowing in fact usually removes a major part of the biomass yielded during the most productive spring period while grazing is often performed during the water limited season and is anyway less efficient in c translocation the situation could however change when manure is deployed after mowing thus increasing the return of biomass to pastures this implies that the fertilization practices applied should be properly characterized for the correct simulation of grassland net c fluxes sollenberger et al 2019 the tests performed show the general efficiency of the modified modelling strategy as well as some limitations which are mostly due to the spatial and temporal features of the datasets utilized to characterize the effects of the management practices this is particularly the case for the remote sensing images utilized which are suboptimal to identify the impact of the mowing operations occurred in the second study area a decisive step towards the solution of this problem is expected to come from the availability of sentinel 2 msi data which have been acquired since 2017 and show a spatial resolution substantially enhanced with respect to modis i e 10 versus 250 m these images should therefore be much more suited to characterize the possible disturbances and specifically the extent and intensity of grazing and mowing activities reinermann et al 2020 myrgiotis et al 2021 this possibility which was not currently explorable due to the retrospective nature of our study could be decisive to enhance the model efficiency for both scientific and operational applications in particular the modelling approach could be applied to simulate the behaviour of different grassland types exploited under various management conditions such as meadows and pastures or resources characterized by mixed utilization on the same surface and intensity in terms of applied stocking rate or number of cuttings and to investigate the functioning of grassland c balances in different environmental conditions i e under future climate scenarios credit

24331,traps and poison bait are used to control invasive species and protect native species however the traps can kill native species and the poison bait may increase their mortality as it interferes with conservation efforts it is necessary to evaluate the effects of such bycatch however there are few theoretical methods for quantification of these effects this paper presents a method for quantitatively evaluating the effects of bycatch on native populations using a mathematical model that represents the population dynamics of native and invasive species the mathematical model suggested the conditions under which only invasive species will be eliminated even if bycatch occurs we also present the concept of the bycatch curve which shows the population density according to the killing rate in addition a mathematical simulation is presented using parameters estimated for the amami oshima system these theoretical results allowed us to determine the parameters that should

problems our models are similar to previous differential equation models of consider bycatch pascoe 1997 anderson and seijo 2010 clark 2010 however previous bycatch models were constructed for resource management and economic applications in the context of marine systems by contrast our model was designed for conservation applications in terrestrial systems and provides a means to quantify the consequences of bycatch and determine the most appropriate control strategy 2 methods we constructed mathematical models to describe the dynamics of native and invasive populations as predation by invasive species such as mongooses and rats is a major factor in the decline of native species courchamp et al 2003 hays and conant 2007 shiels et al 2014 this study assumed that the density of native species is negatively correlated with that of invasive species in addition this study focused on a closed system based on these assumptions a simple lotka volterra model with logistic growth was used to model changes in the population density of two species in the absence of control lotka 1910 pearl and reed 1920 volterra 1928 berryman 1992 1 d n 1 d t r 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 2 j 1 n 1 n 2 d n 2 d t r 2 n

i 2 the functional response was assumed to be mass action because invasive species such as mongooses and rats are often omnivorous and their interactions are approximately random hays and conant 2007

species and α is the specific killing rate of invasive species which generally satisfies 1 α α and c satisfy 0 α c 1 as it is obviously not possible to kill more individuals of an invasive species

distinct ways depending on the population parameters based on the results of gause and witt 1935 we reformulated the model 2 using r 1 r 1 c r 2 r 2 α c 3 d n 1 d t r 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 2 j 1 n 1 n 2 4 d n 2 d t r 2 n 2 i 2 n 2 2 j 2 n 1 n 2 these equations describe three behaviors 5 a native species become extinct and only invasive species survive if i 2 j 1 r 2 r 1 b both native and invasive species survive if j 2 i 1 r 2 r 1 i 2 j 1 c invasive species become extinct and only native species survive if r 2 r 1 j 2 i 1 if the system is in state a and the native population is threatened with extinction the condition i 2 j 1 r 2 r 1 is considered to be satisfied because the predation pressure on native species j 1 is sufficiently greater than the density dependence of invasive species i 2 in this case extinction of native species must be avoided by increasing the killing rate c this paper considers the case where the killing rate c is increased from state a increasing c yields two different results depending on whether the specific killing rate α satisfies the following inequality 6 α r 2 r 1 when 6 holds r 2 r 1 decreases monotonically with respect to c and the dynamical system reaches b at c c β and c at c c γ c β and c γ are expressed as 7 c β r 2 j 1 r 1 i 2 α j 1 i 2 c γ r 2 i 1 r 1 j 2 α i 1 j 2 as these values are given explicitly they can be used as target values for the control program on the other hand when the population parameters do not satisfy 6 r 2 r 1 increases monotonically or remains unchanged with respect to c and the system maintains state a thus to prevent the extinction of native species we have to ensure that α r 2 r 1 is valid when the system is in state b and equilibrium we are able to visualize the density changes of two species caused by the control program nullclines in 2 when the system is in equilibrium satisfy 8 r 1 i 1 n 1 j 1 n 2 c 0 r 2 i 2 n 2 j 2 n 1 α c 0 eliminating c from these equations a single curve is obtained 9 n 1 α r 1 r 2 α j 1 i 2 n 2 α i 1 j 2 when c is varied the fixed point of coexistence moves along the curve thus this curve represents the change in density of invasive and native species when the killing rate c is modified in the control plan we defined this curve as the bycatch curve fig 1 if α r 2 r 1 and j 1 i 2 hold the bycatch curve passes through the first quadrant and satisfies c c β at the fixed point that intersects with the n 2 axis and satisfies c c γ at the fixed point that intersects with the n 1 axis the bycatch curve can be adapted even though the interaction term is more complex but the fixed point of coexistence must be stable using this model we performed an example simulation assuming that the amami spiny rat is a native species and the small indian mongoose is an invasive species from bayesian estimations conducted in previous studies fukasawa et al 2013a watari et al 2013 the values of the population parameters were set to r 1 8 i 1 0 4 j 1 0 4 r 2 0 5 i 2 0 n 1 0 k 1 20 assuming that the control gradually increases c is set to increase linearly c 0 01 t where t is year as j 2 and n 2 0 were not estimated in previous studies j 2 was set to 0 01 assuming a conversion rate of about 1 40 and n 2 0 was set to 0 01 because the number of initially introduced individuals was very small in the absence of control c 0 the system is in state a because i 2 j 1 0 and r 2 r 1 0 0625 satisfy the condition i 2 j 1 r 2 r 1 if the specific killing rate α exceeds the threshold r 2 r 1 0 0625 the system can be transitioned to state b or c by increasing the killing rate c when α 1 2 3 the goals of the killing rate c β 0 50 α c γ 0 28 0 4 α 0 01 0 70 α are respectively 10 α 1 c β 0 50 c γ 0 70 α 2 c β 0 25 c γ 0 35 α 3 c β 0 17 c γ 0 23 as the linearly increasing c becomes 0 20 in 20 years and 0 40 in 40 years the simulation results fig 2 left are interpreted as follows 11 α 1 the control is very low and only the native species goes extinct α 2 the control is not sufficient and the native species goes extinct before the invasive species α 3 the control is sufficiently high and only the invasive species goes extinct it seems that α 1 2 cannot protect native species but α 3 facilitates their conservation in the case of α 3 it may be assumed that the number of invasive species has not decreased in the middle of the eradication period e g 20th year and that eradication cannot be achieved this is reasonable when comparing the killing rate at that time 0 20 with the target c γ 0 23 4 discussion it has been suggested that the negative impact of bycatch on native species is smaller than that of invasive species innes and barker 1999 hays and conant 2007 jones et al 2016 but there is no real theoretical basis for this opinion this paper suggested that only the invasive population will become extinct by increasing the killing rate if α r 2 r 1 and j 1 i 2 hold when we can configure α to satisfy α r 2 r 1 this opinion is theoretically supported when this condition is satisfied c β and c γ are important values for the killing rate as c β is the minimum killing rate at which native species survive and c γ is the minimum killing rate at which invasive species go extinct the former can serve as the first goal of eradication and the latter as the ultimate goal in addition using the bycatch curve we can visualize the path of a fixed point on the phase plane as the killing rate changes as this concept represents only the equilibrium state it may not provide detailed information on the behavior of the system in the non equilibrium state however it can be a useful indicator when implementing long term plans in which there is sufficient time for the system to reach equilibrium to apply these results in real projects information on population parameters is necessary for example there are classically static and dynamic approaches for estimating intraspecific i and interspecific interaction coefficients j macarthur and levins 1967 seifert and seifert 1976 shenbrot and krasnov 2002 when estimating these interactions for invasive species it is necessary to use a dynamic approach that can be adapted to non equilibrium conditions rather than a static approach that assumes equilibrium conditions shenbrot and krasnov 2002 in statistical estimations bayesian estimation is considered to be useful because it can take into account uncertainty watari et al 2013 alderman et al 2019 it may be ideal to estimate all parameters but it is difficult to evaluate the interactions of invasive species when we do not have time to collect enough data or the density of native species is low at the outset of the project in these cases a simple approach would be useful the model 2 assumes that invasive species have negative density dependence and benefit from predation on the native species but if the invasive species is still increasing and the native species is already low density these effects are expected to be smaller than those of other terms the model 2 is then simplified as follows 12 d n 1 d t r 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 2 j 1 n 1 n 2 c n 1 d n 2 d t r 2 n 2 α c n 2 this model has the solutions 13 n 1 t e a t e a 0 n 1 0 0 t i 1 e a τ d τ n 2 t n 2 0 e 0 t r 2 α c d τ a τ j 1 n 2 τ c r 1 d τ here the eradication goals of invasive species α c β and α c γ correspond to the intrinsic growth rate of invasive species r 2 model 12 enables us to broadly understand the population dynamics with only six parameters r 1 r 2 i 1 j 1 c α but it should again be noted that this approach is justified only if i 2 0 and j 2 0 hold example simulations from 2 and 12 are shown in fig 2 the actual killing rate imposed on invasive species in amami is considered to be roughly α c 0 02 t fukasawa et al 2013a this result corresponds to the current amami condition where native species have disappeared around the area where the mongoose was introduced watari et al 2008 2013 to avoid such a situation it would have been necessary to sufficiently increase the killing rate and specific killing rate as shown in fig 2 bottom left when α 1 control is very low or α 3 control is sufficiently high the final results do not differ between model 2 and model 12 but a large difference is observed when α 2 in this case model 2 suggests extinction of native species fig 2 middle left but model 12 indicates survival of native species and overestimates the effect of control fig 2 middle right because it ignores the initial growth of invasive species by predation as can be seen from this example when using the model 12 it is essential to check if the assumptions i 2 0 and j 2 0 are sufficiently valid to ensure that the estimates do not differ significantly from the real system the results of this study suggest the parameters that should be prioritized for estimation fig 3 we should start by measuring the intrinsic growth rate r 1 r 2 and the specific killing rate α based on these parameters and inequality 6 we can determine whether the control program eradicates only invasive species next it is recommended to estimate the interaction coefficients of the native species i 1 j 1 and killing rate c these parameters along with r 1 r 2 allow us to understand the approximate dynamics of the system by the model 12 then when we obtain the intraspecific coefficient of the invasive species i 2 we can use the condition 5 to determine whether the system exists in state a and whether eradication is urgently needed finally if the interspecific coefficient of the invasive species j 2 is acquired it is possible to set detailed goals using the model 2 and bycatch curve 9 in mathematical modeling studies control of invasive species can lead to counterintuitive results courchamp et al 1999 2000 caut et al 2007 therefore it is important to identify the characteristic interactions among species and model them in a flexible manner for example if secondary poisoning is a concern it may be necessary to use a model that takes into account predators of higher trophic levels than the invasive species in addition if the invasive species is an opportunistic predator or its spatial distribution is not uniform the interaction term must be improved a descriptive approach using food webs is useful to identify interactions among species innes and barker 1999 to resolve concerns about bycatch it is necessary to prove the validity of the control plan with sufficient evidence therefore we hope that the results of this study will not be used independently but in combination with experimental data declaration of

path of a fixed point on the phase plane as the killing rate changes as this concept represents only the equilibrium state it may not provide detailed information on the behavior of the system in the non equilibrium state however it can be a useful indicator when implementing long term plans in which there is sufficient time for the system to reach equilibrium to apply these results in real projects information on population parameters is necessary for example there are classically static and dynamic approaches for estimating intraspecific i and interspecific interaction coefficients j macarthur and levins 1967 seifert and seifert 1976 shenbrot and krasnov 2002 when estimating these interactions for invasive species it is necessary to use a dynamic approach that can be adapted to non equilibrium conditions rather than a static approach that assumes equilibrium conditions shenbrot and krasnov 2002 in statistical estimations bayesian estimation is considered to be useful because it can take into account uncertainty watari et al 2013 alderman et al 2019 it may be ideal to estimate all parameters but it is difficult to evaluate the interactions of invasive species when we do not have time to collect enough data or the density of native species is low at the outset of the project in these cases a simple approach would be useful the model 2 assumes that invasive species have negative density dependence and benefit from predation on the native species but if the invasive species is still increasing and the native species is already low density these effects are expected to be smaller than those of other terms the model 2 is then simplified as follows 12 d n 1 d t r 1 n 1 i 1 n 1 2 j 1 n 1 n 2 c n 1 d n 2 d t r 2 n 2 α c n 2 this model has the solutions 13 n 1 t e a t e a 0 n 1 0 0 t i 1 e a τ d τ n 2 t n 2 0 e 0 t r 2 α c d τ a τ j 1 n 2 τ c r 1 d τ here the eradication goals of invasive species α c β and α c γ correspond to the intrinsic growth rate of invasive species r 2 model 12 enables us to broadly understand the population dynamics with only six parameters r 1 r 2 i 1 j 1 c α but it should again be noted that this approach is justified only if i 2 0 and j 2 0 hold example simulations from 2 and 12 are shown in fig 2 the actual killing rate imposed on invasive species in amami is considered to be roughly α c 0 02 t fukasawa et al 2013a this result corresponds to the current amami condition where native species have disappeared around the area where the mongoose was introduced watari et al 2008 2013 to avoid such a situation it would have been necessary to sufficiently increase the killing rate and specific killing rate as shown in fig 2 bottom left when α 1 control is very low or α 3 control is sufficiently high the final results do not differ between model 2 and model 12 but a large difference is observed when α 2 in this case model 2 suggests extinction of native species fig 2 middle left but model 12 indicates survival of native species and overestimates the effect of control fig 2 middle right because it ignores the initial growth of invasive species by predation as can be seen from this example when using the model 12 it is essential to check if the assumptions i 2 0 and j 2 0 are sufficiently valid to ensure that the estimates do not differ significantly from the real system the results of this study suggest the parameters that should be prioritized for estimation fig 3 we should start by measuring the intrinsic growth rate r 1 r 2 and the specific killing rate α based on these parameters and inequality 6 we can determine whether the control program eradicates only invasive species next it is recommended to estimate the interaction coefficients of the native species i 1 j 1 and killing rate c these parameters along with r 1 r 2 allow us to understand the approximate dynamics of the system by the model 12 then when we obtain the intraspecific coefficient of the invasive species i 2 we can use the condition 5 to determine whether the system exists in state a and whether eradication is urgently needed finally if the interspecific coefficient of the invasive species j 2 is acquired it is possible to set detailed goals using the model 2 and bycatch curve 9 in mathematical modeling studies control of invasive species can lead to counterintuitive results courchamp et al 1999 2000 caut et al 2007 therefore it is important to identify the characteristic interactions among species and model them in a flexible manner for example if secondary poisoning is a concern it may be necessary to use a model that takes into account predators of higher trophic levels than the invasive species in addition if the invasive species is an opportunistic predator or its spatial distribution is not uniform the interaction term must be improved a descriptive approach using food webs is useful to identify interactions among species innes and barker 1999 to resolve concerns about bycatch it is necessary to prove the validity of the control plan with sufficient evidence therefore we hope that the results of this study will not be used independently but in combination with experimental data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper funding

24332,impacts due to climate change population growth and intensive agriculture continue to be a major concern worldwide sustainable agriculture with coherent land management strategies is essential to mitigate against adverse environmental impacts for the chinese loess plateau clp much research has focused on implementing soil plant atmosphere models to inform mitigation initiatives such as large scale vegetation restoration programs however model choice typically depends on measurement availability and specific research questions where many modeling approaches are established according to site specific data and parameterized via local information making their generalization elsewhere difficult furthermore in most studies only one modeling approach is selected and thus its merit is difficult to assess relative to alternatives given these challenges this review examines the capability of models with different level of complexity to simulate water fluxes and nutrient

keywords critical zone observatory ecosystem services process based modeling semi arid data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ensuring sustainable agricultural systems with their complex soil water plant interactions is an on going challenge foley et al 2011 to achieve sustainable solutions innovative research should embrace multi disciplinary systems and focus on resource use efficiencies productivity and profitability while at the same time address the dynamics of climate change which challenge sustainable crop management and biodiversity pi et al 2021 in this respect the earth s critical zone cz plays a major role in exchanges of water solutes energy gases solids and organisms among the biosphere hydrosphere atmosphere and lithosphere which in turn maintains a life sustaining environment chorover et al 2011 gordon and dietrich 2017 lin 2010 rasmussen et al 2011 further and in order to understand the effect of anthropogenic and natural changes such as those driven by change in land use and climatic variability on cz processes integrated observational long term monitoring and modeling tools are required pi et al 2021 tetzlaff et al 2017 this strategy has been shown to be crucial to improve water resources management and for environmental sustainability tetzlaff et al 2017 the inherent complexity of the cz has led to the establishment of many physically or process based model forms brilli et al 2017 clark et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 these models in many cases were developed according to the requirements of the investigated scientific field such as hydrology ecology and agriculture the diverse collection of models makes it difficult to know with any clarity for where and when it is ideal to use a specific model or a range of alternative but complementary models to provide clarity for model choice this paper reviews the application calibration and validation of models which have been employed or developed for the chinese loess plateau clp and at a variety of spatial scales the review highlights advantages and disadvantages associated with the described models together with options for their improvement accordingly a general framework for choosing or developing the most appropriate modeling approach is established where multiple models should be employed for context and objective comparison further the analytical framework bridges ecosystem services es science typically conducted through statistical models with cz science typically conducted through the process based models that are reviewed where this coupling ensures clp research has clear societal and policy relevance 1 1 characteristics of the loess plateau china s loess plateau 100 54 114 43 e and 33 43 41 16 n is composed of arid semi arid and semi humid areas and resides in the middle reaches of the yellow river encircled by mountains fig 1 the main groups of soils formed in loess are silt loam loam silt clay loam sand loam silt clay and loam sand soils that are calcareous to the surface huang et al 2010 with an average thickness of 50 200 m loess soils are highly erodible wang et al 2017 the current ecological state of the region is a result of a combination of factors including climate soil type and composition vegetation coverage and human activities rainfall in the plateau typically displays high temporal and spatial variability with main periods of rainfall from july to september and often in the form of high intensity rainstorms thus extreme soil erosion is triggered with an increased sediment transport to the yellow river shi and shao 2000 average annual precipitation in the region ranges from 150 750 mm gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest evaporation varies between 1000 to 2000 mm but may exceed 3000 mm in some areas annual mean temperature ranges between 6 to 10 c from south to north while its frost free period ranges from 185 to 210 days in the clp the five main land use types are forestland 25 69 grassland 25 44 cultivated land 22 48 unused land 17 07 orchards 1 88 and others 7 44 national development and reform commission 2010 the main crops are wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l as well as soybeans vigna angularis millet panicum miliaceum apple orchards and potatoes solanum tuberosum l chen et al 2007 huang gallichand 2006 wang et al 2017 the region is one of china s major producers of winter wheat and spring maize where the latter is on a constant yield increase with a high yield of about 12 t ha kang et al 2003 liu et al 2010 maize is grown in warm and humid valleys and flat areas orchard land use varies from apple and kiwi to jujube pear grape and peach fruit crops the plateau is the largest producer of kiwi fruit and the second largest producer of apple fruit in china wang et al 2017 1 2 vegetation restoration programs to control soil erosion and improve the ecological environment vegetation re generation has been widely applied this includes extensive tree planting since the 1970s integrated soil erosion controls at the watershed scale in the 1980s and the 1990s xin et al 2008 and the start of the government funded grain for green or sloping land conversion gfg project in 1999 lü et al 2012 that aimed at transforming low yield slope cropland into grassland forest sun et al 2015 vegetation coverage altered land use patterns and changes in soil organic carbon soc contents and water storage have all been improved by the implementation of these policies dang et al 2014 chang et al 2011 indicated that enhanced soc sequestration was possible through expanding the coverage of grassland and shrub in the northern clp together with expanding the coverage of forest in the middle and southern clp yet the high density planting of exotic tree species such as black locust r pseudoacacia chinese pine p tabulacformis and pea shrub c korshinskii has been shown to induce soil desiccation and the formation of a dry soil layer smc jia et al 2017 thus the effects of vegetation restoration on es are still unclear yet this is crucial for gauging the performance of the large scale ecological restoration programs implemented in this region and in turn informing policies towards regional socio ecological sustainability 1 3 monitoring stations across the clp many spatio temporal research datasets have been and continue to be collected measuring a wide and impressive variety of processes and elements in the cz these datasets have been used to both parameterize and validate different types of models thus the performance and value of a given model implementation is often directly dependent on data availability three stations can be identified as first batch cz observatories czos i the shenmu erosion and environment station ii the ansai comprehensive experimental station of soil and water conservation and iii the changwu agro ecology experiment station fig 1 crucially each station is located in one of the three main topographical regions of the plateau representing a gradient in both rainfall and temperature at each czo treatments of different vegetative covers and soil and water conservation practices at some combination of the plot slope watershed catchment scale were established in the 1980s 1990s their long term measurements include plant properties soil nutrients and water canopy size runoff soil losses erosion water re distribution in the root zone and meteorological records 1 4 reviewed models various process based models have been parameterized to simulate the relationship between soil moisture and associated vegetation dynamics for the three main land uses of the clp cropland shrubland and forestland zhang et al 2016 here nine models are reviewed in context of their conceptual basis and the model equations that describe the relationships between plants water and climate table 1 fig 2 given descriptions are only basic as many modifications have been applied over time further some modifications are study specific and are not always embedded in a model s software or described in its user manual most models require similar weather inputs air temperature wind speed global radiation relative humidity and precipitation and are restricted to daily time step calculations table 1 only the shaw and swccv models enable calculations at an hourly time step the main difference between the nine models is the description of the root water uptake process here some models account only for moisture conditions in the soil as the dominant process while other models include soil temperature and stomatal conductance processes table 1 therefore detailing all model differences is out of scope for this study where the reader is referred to brilli et al 2017 for fuller descriptions of carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for most of the study models chosen a further difference is related to the complexity of the biochemical modeling pools component which can be expressed by the number of model input parameters table 1 and where this number might change according to the conditions and vegetation types that are of interest given varying levels of model complexity for example by the number of parameters and different study specific validation datasets comparing prediction accuracy across the study models cannot be objectively reported furthermore no clp studies have captured information on parameter uncertainty and its consequences for model performance i e via a useful estimate of prediction error this omission is discussed addressing it is seen as good practice for future clp model work in the following sections models are reviewed in terms of a plant and soil water interactions b plant and soil nutrient interactions and c plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions 2 modeling plant and soil water interactions 2 1 context and background in water limited arid and semi arid regions soil moisture and erosion are major factors which limit plant growth and crop productivity wang et al 2013b during water stress conditions the ability of the ecosystem to respond depends on the amount of water stored in the soil profile and the plant s ability to extract it jipp et al 1998 from a regional perspective land use and topography might also effect soil moisture and provide a useful context qiu et al 2001 during the government funded re vegetation campaigns fast growing tree and shrub species were planted in the clp initial growth was often promising but the soil water quickly depleted affecting late stage growth chen et al 2010 huang et al 2001 observed a decrease in soil water following planting of apple trees compared with winter wheat which could be attributed to the higher evapotranspiration et rate of the former similar phenomenon in which soil water storage declined was observed at the top 100cm of the soil under different plant types such as grassland shrub and forest in the semi arid hilly area of the clp chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 this is mainly because the soil water was not able to be fully replenished from an agriculture perspective winter wheat monoculture covers 56 of arable land use in the plateau therefore adequate water mass balance assessments for this crop are highly necessary in areas of the clp where the total annual rainfall is just under 600mm water availability is a primary limiting factor for grain yield furthermore winter wheat is sown in mid september and harvested in early july of the following year which does not coincide with the rainy season soil water storage has a critical role in mitigating the effect of inter annual variation of precipitation on crop growth to maximize soil water storage different approaches are implemented such as to keep the soil fallow during the rainy season summer or by limited irrigation practices huang et al 2003 kang et al 2002 maize is another core crop whose growing season of april to september does not match the rainy season i e june to september which provides 50 60 of the annual total rainfall shortage of rain water at the early growth stage together with erratic rainfall at later growth stages can reduce maize yield zhang et al 2014 in this respect conservation tillage together with other field management practices such as mulching with plastic film have been extensively applied to improve water use efficiency and thereby stabilize high yields 2 2 model implementation and review huang et al 2006 applied the epic model for simulating winter wheat and maize at the changwu agro ecological experimental station for a 20 year field experiment the model performed relatively well in predicting soil water content swc and et due to accurate input values for three key hydrological processes precipitation percolation and runoff however runoff as a component of soil water balance created computation errors that affected modeling of subsequent processes such as yield and contaminant transport results were therefore only valid for situations where runoff measurements were fully controlled such as those for terraces with border dykes wang and li 2010 extended the study of huang et al 2006 and evaluated epic for winter wheat spring maize alfalfa north china milkvetch and small leaf carmona cameraria microphylla epic performed well for predicting swc yields of winter wheat and spring maize and dry forage of alfalfa and milkvetch however the predictions for small leaf carmona were poor a different investigation in the changwu site involved the application of the shaw model to an apple orchard to investigate the effect on soil water content huang gallichand 2006 the study reported apple trees do deplete water eventually but in this case no specific model sensitivity was reported using the swccv model jia et al 2019 indicated that an optimal plant coverage or biomass is important for regional water balance soil protection and vegetation sustainability further a modified biome bgc model has been used to simulate the long term dynamics of actual et aet net primary productivity npp and leaf area index lai for alfalfa pea shrub sea buckthorn hippophae rhamnoides and black locust jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 generally the modified biome bgc performed well in terms of simulating aet dynamics for the four grass shrub and tree species as npp and lai are linearly related with aet biome bgc is thus similarly suited to simulating npp and lai for the same species the optimal plant coverage expressed as the maximum lai and the optimal swccv expressed as npp for different precipitation regions were also quantified to provide a re vegetation standard index where this index enables future re vegetation activities to be objectively guided to ensure a sustainable eco hydrological environment the aquacrop model has been used to simulate both plant above ground biomass grain yield and canopy cover cc and swc characteristics zhang et al 2013 simulations were performed for winter wheat yield under rainfed conditions where the model performed well for yield and cc but not so well for biomass and swc the aquacrop model was sensitive to snowfall which affected model s performance considerably across key crop development stages essentially it was more important to define when the snow began to melt rather than when it fell an additional example for improper description of the winter conditions in the clp is the application of the ceres wheat model which is embedded in dssat csm zheng et al 2017 this model has been applied to facilitate the development of optimal water management practices although simulations for above ground biomass lai and grain yield were adequate the model could not properly account for frosting conditions during winter this resulted in recommending impractical optimized planting dates furthermore the model did not perform well for simulating winter wheat biomass within water stress conditions the descriptions given illustrate that the establishment of a modeling tool for a specific process under specific environmental conditions can neglect critical processes for example while swc is typically predicted well by a range of models there can be errors in runoff assessments due to poor boundary condition definition i e structural error further since it is virtually impossible to construct a super model that would include all processes and associated nuances a modeling framework using multiple models is recommended for example huang et al 2006 epic huang and gallichand 2006 shaw and jia et al 2019 swccv each reported good levels of swc prediction accuracy despite implementing different water flow models furthermore given that the soil physical parameters in the above mentioned studies were attained from different sources swc prediction can be considered robust nevertheles only concurrent implementations of epic shaw and swcc would provide objectivity to this premise for clarity the water flow model for epic requires the wilting point field capacity saturated swc and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters to be estimated from default empirical equations for shaw the brooks and corey 1966 hydraulic functions four parameters are required while for swccv the van genuchten 1980 hydraulic functions five parameters is implemented parameters for both hydraulic functions of shaw and swccv can be estimated according to measured retention and unstaturated hydraulic curves or attained by pedo transfer functions e g schaap et al 2001 3 modeling plant and soil nutrient interactions 3 1 context and background due to natural drought conditions intensive human disturbance and severe soil erosion the clp region has the lowest soc density socd in china yu et al 2007 yet soc is a key indicator of soil quality and overall soil productivity because of its influence on cation exchange capacity aggregation and water retention increasing organic c content in the plateau is possible through the re forestation of degraded soils and ecosystems soil c sequestration is vital as it enhances soil fertility while reducing carbon dioxide co2 emissions han et al 2016 socd tends to be highest in hilly plateau soils i e areas of high elevation and low temperature and valley soils i e areas of low elevation and high precipitation high levels of fine soil particle contents also tend to coincide with high socd values socd tends to be higher under cropland than under forest or grassland at the regional scale of the entire plateau liu et al 2011 cultivation processes such as land levelling and terracing fertilization tillage and crop residue management tend to increase soc accumulation in all areas of the plateau where irrigation mitigates against shortages in rainfall liu et al 2011 note that there are cases where cropland soils can have lower soc contents compared to those under forest and grassland chen et al 2007 dang et al 2014 gong et al 2006 li et al 2005 wang et al 2001 this occurs in areas that are characterized with relatively homogeneous environments additional vital soil properties for soil productivity and quality are soil total n stn and soil total p stp comber et al 2018 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 reduction of stn and stp can decrease soil nutrient supply porosity and soil structure where the loss of stn and stp by soil erosion leaching or rainfall scouring exacerbates the situation wang et al 2009 soils data from a variety of land use types cropland grassland shrubland woodland wasteland and abandoned land have been investigated where significant differences were observed for soil organic matter som stn and nitrate nitrogen non gong et al 2006 similarly the spatial homogeneity for stn and stp can change significantly with land use and will broadly decrease in this order cropland grassland shrubland wang et al 2009 ultimately the numerous studies concerning vegetation restoration in the clp displayed the positive effect of vegetation restoration by improving soil quality as stocks of soc stn and stp increase with re vegetational age jia et al 2012 3 2 model implementation and review it has been suggested that water use efficiency wue and meeting plant n requirements could be improved by plastic film mulching particularly with black film together with a controlled fertilizer release for maize thereby increasing grain yield in the region liu et al 2016 in this respect mulching and fallow cropping as part of conventional management practices and their effect on the water balance and wue in winter wheat have been evaluated using the coupmodel zhang et al 2007a 2007b model simulations indicated that mulching increased soil water storage increased wheat transpiration but decreased soil evaporation thus a higher wheat yield and improved wue was achieved furthermore water was found to reach deeper horizons resulting in extensive deep percolation in a wet year zhang et al 2007a 2007b however the coupmodel model showed weaker performance when the soil was frozen or partially frozen n use efficiency is similarly important for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2016 showed a winter wheat sown with a green manure legume crop was able to fix atmospheric n2 and thereby improve the soil n pool cultivation of the green manure in the summer was viewed as a better option than bare fallow however simulations from coupmodel indicated that growing green manure in the fallow period without considering optimal harvest times ca 30 days before sowing the winter wheat reduced soil water storage and lowered wheat yields zhang et al 2007a 2007b for the north china plain the apsim model has been used to analyze the crop yield and resource use efficiency of wheat maize systems chen et al 2010a 2010b c for example apsim was applied to a alfalfa lucerne wheat rotation system in order to establish best management practice chen et al 2008 the benefits of integrating alfalfa with annual cropping included that of reduced runoff and improved soil water storage provided a just in time removal date prior to sowing winter wheat is achieved furthermore alfalfa has been shown to improve the wue and soil fertility in cropping systems however the apsim model was less successful in simulating the variability of the deep soil water content chen et al 2008 this was attributed to not accounting for the root water uptake from deeper parts of the cz note that there is a degree of uncertainty concerning the benefits of alfalfa to crop yield due to the extraction of water from deeper soil layers and the development of desiccated layers li huang 2008 thus future simulations with the apsim model would have to include a better description of the deep percolation in the cz som enhances soil chemical and physical characteristics it is both a nutrient sink and source and it promotes biological activity thus som is a key component of the soil resource base craswell and lefroy 2001 fluctuations in the amount quality and turnover rate of som due to changes in soil management practice can influence the soil s physical chemical and biological properties haynes 2000 jiang et al 2006 the dssat csm model has been used to simulate spring maize and winter wheat providing tolerable levels accuracy for simulations of topsoil soc and soil organic n son under regular fertilizer application conditions li et al 2015 dssat csm can similarly be used to investigate the effects of climate change on crop yields and simulate soil nitrate accumulation and leaching under different fertilizer treatments rainfall conditions and management practices note that the dssat csm model showed sensitivity to n stress which effected the model performances again as before different models use different parameters to simulate the same process where implementations of multiple models for the same study would provide some objectivity to simulation accuracy for example to describe winter wheat growth using coupmodel 12 parameters were used zhang et al 2007a five of these parameters were calibrated fraction of carbon in leaf reallocated to grain fraction of carbon in stem reallocated to grain fraction of carbon in root reallocated to grain radiation use efficiency and specific leaf area while the remaining seven parameters were measured and or attained from the literature in contrast in dssat csm seven parameters were calibrated for winter wheat growth optimum vernalizing temperature photoperiod response grain filling kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis standard kernel size under optimum conditions standard non stressed mature tiller the calibrated parameters of both dssat csm and coupmodel are site specific and cannot be generalized land use type is a key factor to account for as associated levels of variation in stn and stp directly influence the accuracy of the model s simulations for soil nutrient status and nutrient movement wang et al 2009 further the effect of land uses on soil properties should be expressed by their different behaviors and patterns at various spatial scales thus a key challenge is to apply the dssat csm model or any other model in this respect over different spatial scales while plot scale models tend to be more complex and informative as spatial or temporal scales increase the applied models are inherently oversimplified while the value of implementing a plot scale model over an area larger than 1 km2 is debatable further work is required in this respect noting that problematic scale issues are inherent to any cz or es analysis whether mathematical or statistical comber and harris 2022 4 modeling plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions 4 1 context and background in soil plant atmosphere systems plants with their roots provide pathways to transfer water from the soil to the atmosphere deep roots re distribute deep soil water to shallower topsoil layers when the leaf stomata close which enhances plant water transport efficiency lee et al 2005 for shallow soil layers which are generally within the root zone the distributional pattern of the swc is dependent on land use and topography e g slope gradient and aspect while infiltration evaporation and percolation should not be neglected qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2013a b for each land use type roots are distributed differently depending on the specific vegetation which brings about different water uptake and transpiration and hence different soil water distributions the soil water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere system is significantly affected by land use where wue varies with root density in the different soil layers qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2013a b 4 2 model implementations and review for simulating such processes the waves model has been compared with a simple to implement modified statistical dynamic model huang et al 2001 based on the eagleson statistical dynamic water balance model eagleson 1978 the modifications accounted for seasonal variations of precipitation and soil moisture and their influence on plant transpiration resulting in different computations for soil water properties and water flow simulations from the modified model accurately predicted the mean water balance components and the dynamic processes of the mean soil moisture for a specific wheat fertility productivity condition huang et al 2001 the production of annual crop biomass can be directly proportional to the quantity of radiation intercepted the amount of water transpired and the makeup of the nutrients taken up gregory et al 1997 precipitation being the major source of available water for dryland crops needs to be used efficiently to sustain yields and to avoid stored soil water depletion availability of soil water directly influences nutrient loss and the rate of mineralization of n from som gregory et al 1997 this may result in increased residual n accumulation in the soil after crop harvest which can degrade environmental quality through increased n leaching into the groundwater and emissions of greenhouse gases such as n2o on the other hand soils enriched with n through manures and fertilizers can increase crop yields in the presence of abundant soil water that may then result in increased soil water depletion wang et al 2013a b the core task of the ceres wheat model was to solve such yield related problems with respect to determining the main factors that influence yield and to concurrently determine the optimum irrigation and fertilizer management practices accordingly the model was applied across the whole guanzhong region of the shaanxi province of the clp where it simulated the interaction of n water and climatic factors in order to evaluate their contributions to wheat yield and associated management strategies ji et al 2014 note in a different study that both ceres wheat and dssat csm inaccurately simulated winter wheat biomass under stressed conditions zheng et al 2017 the influence of vegetative restoration on deep soil water storage has been the focus of many clp studies chen et al 2008 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2013c despite reducing soil erosion and water losses artificial plantings can lead to the formation of dry soil layers which can significantly restrict land productivity chen et al 2008 fu et al 2012 tested the shaw model in a shrubland environment for two shrub species caragana korshinkii kom and salix psammophila and observed that increased plant coverage was associated with reduced water storage in the upper soil layers water content differed vertically across the soil profile due to differences in root water uptake between the two species generally denser shrub coverage increased the degree of soil desiccation the shaw model showed a poor performance during the freeze thaw cycles since its assumed soil hydraulic properties were inaccurate for a frozen soil the epic model has been applied to forage crop rotation systems alfalfa potato winter wheat and was found to reliably capture monthly swc and the vertical distribution of soil water wang et al 2011 wang et al 2013c the model s simulation accuracy strongly depended on input parameters such as seasonal rainfall solar radiation soil characteristics and user defined et and soil moisture equations wang et al 2011 the epic model has proved to be an effective tool to predict soil desiccation however wang et al 2012 highlighted a decrease in swc due to the long term cultivation of a grain crop after alfalfa here the appropriate stand age of alfalfa would be 8 10 years and the appropriate cultivation years for following a grain cropping system would be 16 18 years cultivating shallow root crops such as potato and soybean has also been recommended to recover soil desiccation after alfalfa wang et al 2012 swc plays a crucial role in biological and hydrological processes including above and below ground runoff flooding solute transportation soil erosion plant growth and land air interactions hydrological ecological and climatic modeling can help understand variation in swc down the soil profile which is critical to water management and associated planting strategies mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2013a b c epic has also been applied to an artificial black locust forest to evaluate biomass and soil desiccation effects and to an apple orchard malus pumila where water and nutrients were re affirmed as the most important factors that influence yield fertilization can also be advantageous in improving wue and yields of dryland orchards but conversely may increase water consumption through transpiration causing soil desiccation because of the deteriorated soil condition peng et al 2017 5 ecosystem research critical zone processes and a modeling framework few studies world wide have fully incorporated es in the assessment of basin scale ecological restoration projects where their incorporation could open up opportunities for enhancing benefits to human livelihood and generating public support trabucchi et al 2012 the prevailing quantification methods for es are usually based on statistical analyses fu et al 2018 hu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 these ignore system dynamics and associated uncertainty and feedbacks because of a lack of the mechanistic understandings of the processes involved i e that obtained through physically based models nicholson et al 2009 thus there is a great urgency to bridge es science with cz science through process based models to provide research that has clear societal and policy relevance and with outputs that allow management approaches at different landscape scales to be modified through interventions field et al 2015 lü et al 2012 luo et al 2019 as described throughout this review a more comprehensive modeling framework that would account for most dominant spatio temporal cz processes is necessary particular attention should be given to non uniqueness or equifinality where very different model structures and or parameter sets are able to describe some observed behaviors with similar model response beven 2006 beven and binley 2014 it has been acknowledge recently that data driven models suffer from similar phenomenon schmidt et al 2020 this concept of equifinality makes it difficult to define objectively model acceptability various methods and techniques have been proposed to identify the best model such as the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology beven and binley 1992 the use of the information theory to discriminate models pachepsky et al 2006 and a frequency based performance measure teegavarapu et al 2022 other methods such as the diagnostic efficiency de schwemmle et al 2021 offers the capability to disaggregate the different sources of errors i e the model parameters the model structure and or the input data by using model ensembles for simulating the same process e g hassall et al 2022 one can determine the main error source of the different models preceding to the models training stage sensitivity analyses can provide information regarding which parameters and processes are the most important for specific modeled conditions or systems sensitivity evaluations can help reduce model complexity and improve efficiency local and global sensitivity analyses are possible where the former is a one at a time approach while the latter considers multiple parameters at the same time link et al 2018 naves et al 2020 the local form does not account for interactions between parameters while the global form does and as such is computationally intensive which can make it prohibitive in its use the use of ensemble of model projections to estimate prediction uncertainty comparable to the suggested approach above is a common practice in fields such as climate research déqué et al 2007 reto et al 2010 strobach and bel 2020 and ecosystem research schwalm et al 2010 this method enables the user to change and test different factors that can affect model uncertainty such as initial condition model parameters spatial temporal resolution the simulated results are often considered to provide equal weighted averages thus it is assumed that the biases of an individual model are partly canceled by averaging all predictions reto et al 2010 this approach might be utilized in soil modeling practices to determine the influence of each model parameter its uncertainty and its structure on the simulated outputs e g brown and heuvelink 2005 krishnan and aggarwal 2018 shan et al 2021 furthermore most soil models as models in other fields reto et al 2010 strobach and bel 2020 are established according to current and recent past conditions jasper et al 2006 besides the urgent need to calculate uncertainties of models predictions there are uncertainties regarding future conditions a model calibrated under historic conditions may have questionable validity under future scenarios if the model states differ substantially from those in the calibration period this challenges for example future projections of different ecological systems that might be effected by climate change mcmahon et al 2009 a modeling framework which can be directly used as a model based decision support tool dst has in part been developed for the clp hu et al 2015 this dst provides a platform to explore different management scenarios and to optimally plan them the dst has four modules a a module for scenario development b the integrated es model base c the es trade off tool and d the multi objective spatial optimization module based on the fast non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with this dst scenario testing and optimal decision making analyses can be performed considering climate precipitation and temperature land cover vegetation built up areas croplands etc and socioeconomic population and economic growth factors via different scenarios the ess of soil and water and their optimal combinations can be simulated in turn adaptive management policy recommendations for vegetation restoration soil and water resource use and the payment for ess for regional sustainability can be derived based on the utility of various trade off analyses and multi criteria optimizations the dst as with any dst has the capability to be upgraded and refined for example through hybrid modelling strategies where process based models are combined with statistical and or machine learning models kuhnert 2014 say to better characterize extreme events curceac et al 2020 2022 6 conclusions in this review a multitude of loess plateau studies were summarized in order to illustrate the disadvantages and advantages related to the specific process based modelling approach taken each study s model performance was typically bound under different climate land use and temporal and spatial scales models were categorized in terms of i plant and soil water interactions ii plant and soil nutrient interactions and iii plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions in each category a clear deficiency existed in that research studies typically selected only one modelling approach for analyzing the dominant soil plant processes using only one modeling approach might mislead say through the indication of only one or the wrong dominant process and as such multiple models should be employed for context and comparison in this respect the establishment of a modelling framework that includes several models to describe the same process might more accurately highlight prevailing factors where the use of model ensembles is also possible the capacity to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameter uncertainty should also be included such a framework has in part been established where some of the process based models described typically associated with critical zone science are coupled with analytical tools typically associated ecosystem services that together provide both societal and policy relevance to loess plateau research for future studies the reporting of a given model s suitability and its relative accuracy to alternatives should be promoted where a common set of model accuracy diagnostics are used to aid comparison across studies and processes answers to questions of why a given model was adopted how well was it calibrated and how well was it validated are crucial to ensure informed management or policy decisions especially when they involve substantive financial investments declaration of competing interest the authors

24332,impacts due to climate change population growth and intensive agriculture continue to be a major concern worldwide sustainable agriculture with coherent land management strategies is essential to mitigate against adverse environmental impacts for the chinese loess plateau clp much research has focused on implementing soil plant atmosphere models to inform mitigation initiatives such as large scale vegetation restoration programs however model choice typically depends on measurement availability and specific research questions where many modeling approaches are established according to site specific data and parameterized via local information making their generalization elsewhere difficult furthermore in most studies only one modeling approach is selected and thus its merit is difficult to assess relative to alternatives given these challenges this review examines the capability of models with different level of complexity to simulate water fluxes and nutrient transformations for the clp reviewed models were typically employed under different climate conditions e g snowmelt soil freezing and thawing and across different land uses e g revegetated areas which reflects the robustness of some models e g for description of vegetation grow but at the same time illustrates model weaknesses that should be addressed e g water simulations under thawing conditions on conducting this review a general framework for choosing or developing the most appropriate modeling approach is established given a study site s climatic and ecological conditions and research aims keywords critical zone observatory ecosystem services process based modeling semi arid data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction ensuring sustainable agricultural systems with their complex soil water plant interactions is an on going challenge foley et al 2011 to achieve sustainable solutions innovative research should embrace multi disciplinary systems and focus on resource use efficiencies productivity and profitability while at the same time address the dynamics of climate change which challenge sustainable crop management and biodiversity pi et al 2021 in this respect the earth s critical zone cz plays a major role in exchanges of water solutes energy gases solids and organisms among the biosphere hydrosphere atmosphere and lithosphere which in turn maintains a life sustaining environment chorover et al 2011 gordon and dietrich 2017 lin 2010 rasmussen et al 2011 further and in order to understand the effect of anthropogenic and natural changes such as those driven by change in land use and climatic variability on cz processes integrated observational long term monitoring and modeling tools are required pi et al 2021 tetzlaff et al 2017 this strategy has been shown to be crucial to improve water resources management and for environmental sustainability tetzlaff et al 2017 the inherent complexity of the cz has led to the establishment of many physically or process based model forms brilli et al 2017 clark et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 these models in many cases were developed according to the requirements of the investigated scientific field such as hydrology ecology and agriculture the diverse collection of models makes it difficult to know with any clarity for where and when it is ideal to use a specific model or a range of alternative but complementary models to provide clarity for model choice this paper reviews the application calibration and validation of models which have been employed or developed for the chinese loess plateau clp and at a variety of spatial scales the review highlights advantages and disadvantages associated with the described models together with options for their improvement accordingly a general framework for choosing or developing the most appropriate modeling approach is established where multiple models should be employed for context and objective comparison further the analytical framework bridges ecosystem services es science typically conducted through statistical models with cz science typically conducted through the process based models that are reviewed where this coupling ensures clp research has clear societal and policy relevance 1 1 characteristics of the loess plateau china s loess plateau 100 54 114 43 e and 33 43 41 16 n is composed of arid semi arid and semi humid areas and resides in the middle reaches of the yellow river encircled by mountains fig 1 the main groups of soils formed in loess are silt loam loam silt clay loam sand loam silt clay and loam sand soils that are calcareous to the surface huang et al 2010 with an average thickness of 50 200 m loess soils are highly erodible wang et al 2017 the current ecological state of the region is a result of a combination of factors including climate soil type and composition vegetation coverage and human activities rainfall in the plateau typically displays high temporal and spatial variability with main periods of rainfall from july to september and often in the form of high intensity rainstorms thus extreme soil erosion is triggered with an increased sediment transport to the yellow river shi and shao 2000 average annual precipitation in the region ranges from 150 750 mm gradually decreasing from southeast to northwest evaporation varies between 1000 to 2000 mm but may exceed 3000 mm in some areas annual mean temperature ranges between 6 to 10 c from south to north while its frost free period ranges from 185 to 210 days in the clp the five main land use types are forestland 25 69 grassland 25 44 cultivated land 22 48 unused land 17 07 orchards 1 88 and others 7 44 national development and reform commission 2010 the main crops are wheat triticum aestivum l and maize zea mays l as well as soybeans vigna angularis millet panicum miliaceum apple orchards and potatoes solanum tuberosum l chen et al 2007 huang gallichand 2006 wang et al 2017 the region is one of china s major producers of winter wheat and spring maize where the latter is on a constant yield increase with a high yield of about 12 t ha kang et al 2003 liu et al 2010 maize is grown in warm and humid valleys and flat areas orchard land use varies from apple and kiwi to jujube pear grape and peach fruit crops the plateau is the largest producer of kiwi fruit and the second largest producer of apple fruit in china wang et al 2017 1 2 vegetation restoration programs to control soil erosion and improve the ecological environment vegetation re generation has been widely applied this includes extensive tree planting since the 1970s integrated soil erosion controls at the watershed scale in the 1980s and the 1990s xin et al 2008 and the start of the government funded grain for green or sloping land conversion gfg project in 1999 lü et al 2012 that aimed at transforming low yield slope cropland into grassland forest sun et al 2015 vegetation coverage altered land use patterns and changes in soil organic carbon soc contents and water storage have all been improved by the implementation of these policies dang et al 2014 chang et al 2011 indicated that enhanced soc sequestration was possible through expanding the coverage of grassland and shrub in the northern clp together with expanding the coverage of forest in the middle and southern clp yet the high density planting of exotic tree species such as black locust r pseudoacacia chinese pine p tabulacformis and pea shrub c korshinskii has been shown to induce soil desiccation and the formation of a dry soil layer smc jia et al 2017 thus the effects of vegetation restoration on es are still unclear yet this is crucial for gauging the performance of the large scale ecological restoration programs implemented in this region and in turn informing policies towards regional socio ecological sustainability 1 3 monitoring stations across the clp many spatio temporal research datasets have been and continue to be collected measuring a wide and impressive variety of processes and elements in the cz these datasets have been used to both parameterize and validate different types of models thus the performance and value of a given model implementation is often directly dependent on data availability three stations can be identified as first batch cz observatories czos i the shenmu erosion and environment station ii the ansai comprehensive experimental station of soil and water conservation and iii the changwu agro ecology experiment station fig 1 crucially each station is located in one of the three main topographical regions of the plateau representing a gradient in both rainfall and temperature at each czo treatments of different vegetative covers and soil and water conservation practices at some combination of the plot slope watershed catchment scale were established in the 1980s 1990s their long term measurements include plant properties soil nutrients and water canopy size runoff soil losses erosion water re distribution in the root zone and meteorological records 1 4 reviewed models various process based models have been parameterized to simulate the relationship between soil moisture and associated vegetation dynamics for the three main land uses of the clp cropland shrubland and forestland zhang et al 2016 here nine models are reviewed in context of their conceptual basis and the model equations that describe the relationships between plants water and climate table 1 fig 2 given descriptions are only basic as many modifications have been applied over time further some modifications are study specific and are not always embedded in a model s software or described in its user manual most models require similar weather inputs air temperature wind speed global radiation relative humidity and precipitation and are restricted to daily time step calculations table 1 only the shaw and swccv models enable calculations at an hourly time step the main difference between the nine models is the description of the root water uptake process here some models account only for moisture conditions in the soil as the dominant process while other models include soil temperature and stomatal conductance processes table 1 therefore detailing all model differences is out of scope for this study where the reader is referred to brilli et al 2017 for fuller descriptions of carbon c and nitrogen n cycles for most of the study models chosen a further difference is related to the complexity of the biochemical modeling pools component which can be expressed by the number of model input parameters table 1 and where this number might change according to the conditions and vegetation types that are of interest given varying levels of model complexity for example by the number of parameters and different study specific validation datasets comparing prediction accuracy across the study models cannot be objectively reported furthermore no clp studies have captured information on parameter uncertainty and its consequences for model performance i e via a useful estimate of prediction error this omission is discussed addressing it is seen as good practice for future clp model work in the following sections models are reviewed in terms of a plant and soil water interactions b plant and soil nutrient interactions and c plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions 2 modeling plant and soil water interactions 2 1 context and background in water limited arid and semi arid regions soil moisture and erosion are major factors which limit plant growth and crop productivity wang et al 2013b during water stress conditions the ability of the ecosystem to respond depends on the amount of water stored in the soil profile and the plant s ability to extract it jipp et al 1998 from a regional perspective land use and topography might also effect soil moisture and provide a useful context qiu et al 2001 during the government funded re vegetation campaigns fast growing tree and shrub species were planted in the clp initial growth was often promising but the soil water quickly depleted affecting late stage growth chen et al 2010 huang et al 2001 observed a decrease in soil water following planting of apple trees compared with winter wheat which could be attributed to the higher evapotranspiration et rate of the former similar phenomenon in which soil water storage declined was observed at the top 100cm of the soil under different plant types such as grassland shrub and forest in the semi arid hilly area of the clp chen et al 2010 jia et al 2017 this is mainly because the soil water was not able to be fully replenished from an agriculture perspective winter wheat monoculture covers 56 of arable land use in the plateau therefore adequate water mass balance assessments for this crop are highly necessary in areas of the clp where the total annual rainfall is just under 600mm water availability is a primary limiting factor for grain yield furthermore winter wheat is sown in mid september and harvested in early july of the following year which does not coincide with the rainy season soil water storage has a critical role in mitigating the effect of inter annual variation of precipitation on crop growth to maximize soil water storage different approaches are implemented such as to keep the soil fallow during the rainy season summer or by limited irrigation practices huang et al 2003 kang et al 2002 maize is another core crop whose growing season of april to september does not match the rainy season i e june to september which provides 50 60 of the annual total rainfall shortage of rain water at the early growth stage together with erratic rainfall at later growth stages can reduce maize yield zhang et al 2014 in this respect conservation tillage together with other field management practices such as mulching with plastic film have been extensively applied to improve water use efficiency and thereby stabilize high yields 2 2 model implementation and review huang et al 2006 applied the epic model for simulating winter wheat and maize at the changwu agro ecological experimental station for a 20 year field experiment the model performed relatively well in predicting soil water content swc and et due to accurate input values for three key hydrological processes precipitation percolation and runoff however runoff as a component of soil water balance created computation errors that affected modeling of subsequent processes such as yield and contaminant transport results were therefore only valid for situations where runoff measurements were fully controlled such as those for terraces with border dykes wang and li 2010 extended the study of huang et al 2006 and evaluated epic for winter wheat spring maize alfalfa north china milkvetch and small leaf carmona cameraria microphylla epic performed well for predicting swc yields of winter wheat and spring maize and dry forage of alfalfa and milkvetch however the predictions for small leaf carmona were poor a different investigation in the changwu site involved the application of the shaw model to an apple orchard to investigate the effect on soil water content huang gallichand 2006 the study reported apple trees do deplete water eventually but in this case no specific model sensitivity was reported using the swccv model jia et al 2019 indicated that an optimal plant coverage or biomass is important for regional water balance soil protection and vegetation sustainability further a modified biome bgc model has been used to simulate the long term dynamics of actual et aet net primary productivity npp and leaf area index lai for alfalfa pea shrub sea buckthorn hippophae rhamnoides and black locust jia et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 generally the modified biome bgc performed well in terms of simulating aet dynamics for the four grass shrub and tree species as npp and lai are linearly related with aet biome bgc is thus similarly suited to simulating npp and lai for the same species the optimal plant coverage expressed as the maximum lai and the optimal swccv expressed as npp for different precipitation regions were also quantified to provide a re vegetation standard index where this index enables future re vegetation activities to be objectively guided to ensure a sustainable eco hydrological environment the aquacrop model has been used to simulate both plant above ground biomass grain yield and canopy cover cc and swc characteristics zhang et al 2013 simulations were performed for winter wheat yield under rainfed conditions where the model performed well for yield and cc but not so well for biomass and swc the aquacrop model was sensitive to snowfall which affected model s performance considerably across key crop development stages essentially it was more important to define when the snow began to melt rather than when it fell an additional example for improper description of the winter conditions in the clp is the application of the ceres wheat model which is embedded in dssat csm zheng et al 2017 this model has been applied to facilitate the development of optimal water management practices although simulations for above ground biomass lai and grain yield were adequate the model could not properly account for frosting conditions during winter this resulted in recommending impractical optimized planting dates furthermore the model did not perform well for simulating winter wheat biomass within water stress conditions the descriptions given illustrate that the establishment of a modeling tool for a specific process under specific environmental conditions can neglect critical processes for example while swc is typically predicted well by a range of models there can be errors in runoff assessments due to poor boundary condition definition i e structural error further since it is virtually impossible to construct a super model that would include all processes and associated nuances a modeling framework using multiple models is recommended for example huang et al 2006 epic huang and gallichand 2006 shaw and jia et al 2019 swccv each reported good levels of swc prediction accuracy despite implementing different water flow models furthermore given that the soil physical parameters in the above mentioned studies were attained from different sources swc prediction can be considered robust nevertheles only concurrent implementations of epic shaw and swcc would provide objectivity to this premise for clarity the water flow model for epic requires the wilting point field capacity saturated swc and saturated hydraulic conductivity parameters to be estimated from default empirical equations for shaw the brooks and corey 1966 hydraulic functions four parameters are required while for swccv the van genuchten 1980 hydraulic functions five parameters is implemented parameters for both hydraulic functions of shaw and swccv can be estimated according to measured retention and unstaturated hydraulic curves or attained by pedo transfer functions e g schaap et al 2001 3 modeling plant and soil nutrient interactions 3 1 context and background due to natural drought conditions intensive human disturbance and severe soil erosion the clp region has the lowest soc density socd in china yu et al 2007 yet soc is a key indicator of soil quality and overall soil productivity because of its influence on cation exchange capacity aggregation and water retention increasing organic c content in the plateau is possible through the re forestation of degraded soils and ecosystems soil c sequestration is vital as it enhances soil fertility while reducing carbon dioxide co2 emissions han et al 2016 socd tends to be highest in hilly plateau soils i e areas of high elevation and low temperature and valley soils i e areas of low elevation and high precipitation high levels of fine soil particle contents also tend to coincide with high socd values socd tends to be higher under cropland than under forest or grassland at the regional scale of the entire plateau liu et al 2011 cultivation processes such as land levelling and terracing fertilization tillage and crop residue management tend to increase soc accumulation in all areas of the plateau where irrigation mitigates against shortages in rainfall liu et al 2011 note that there are cases where cropland soils can have lower soc contents compared to those under forest and grassland chen et al 2007 dang et al 2014 gong et al 2006 li et al 2005 wang et al 2001 this occurs in areas that are characterized with relatively homogeneous environments additional vital soil properties for soil productivity and quality are soil total n stn and soil total p stp comber et al 2018 wang et al 2009 zhao et al 2015 reduction of stn and stp can decrease soil nutrient supply porosity and soil structure where the loss of stn and stp by soil erosion leaching or rainfall scouring exacerbates the situation wang et al 2009 soils data from a variety of land use types cropland grassland shrubland woodland wasteland and abandoned land have been investigated where significant differences were observed for soil organic matter som stn and nitrate nitrogen non gong et al 2006 similarly the spatial homogeneity for stn and stp can change significantly with land use and will broadly decrease in this order cropland grassland shrubland wang et al 2009 ultimately the numerous studies concerning vegetation restoration in the clp displayed the positive effect of vegetation restoration by improving soil quality as stocks of soc stn and stp increase with re vegetational age jia et al 2012 3 2 model implementation and review it has been suggested that water use efficiency wue and meeting plant n requirements could be improved by plastic film mulching particularly with black film together with a controlled fertilizer release for maize thereby increasing grain yield in the region liu et al 2016 in this respect mulching and fallow cropping as part of conventional management practices and their effect on the water balance and wue in winter wheat have been evaluated using the coupmodel zhang et al 2007a 2007b model simulations indicated that mulching increased soil water storage increased wheat transpiration but decreased soil evaporation thus a higher wheat yield and improved wue was achieved furthermore water was found to reach deeper horizons resulting in extensive deep percolation in a wet year zhang et al 2007a 2007b however the coupmodel model showed weaker performance when the soil was frozen or partially frozen n use efficiency is similarly important for sustainable agriculture in arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2016 showed a winter wheat sown with a green manure legume crop was able to fix atmospheric n2 and thereby improve the soil n pool cultivation of the green manure in the summer was viewed as a better option than bare fallow however simulations from coupmodel indicated that growing green manure in the fallow period without considering optimal harvest times ca 30 days before sowing the winter wheat reduced soil water storage and lowered wheat yields zhang et al 2007a 2007b for the north china plain the apsim model has been used to analyze the crop yield and resource use efficiency of wheat maize systems chen et al 2010a 2010b c for example apsim was applied to a alfalfa lucerne wheat rotation system in order to establish best management practice chen et al 2008 the benefits of integrating alfalfa with annual cropping included that of reduced runoff and improved soil water storage provided a just in time removal date prior to sowing winter wheat is achieved furthermore alfalfa has been shown to improve the wue and soil fertility in cropping systems however the apsim model was less successful in simulating the variability of the deep soil water content chen et al 2008 this was attributed to not accounting for the root water uptake from deeper parts of the cz note that there is a degree of uncertainty concerning the benefits of alfalfa to crop yield due to the extraction of water from deeper soil layers and the development of desiccated layers li huang 2008 thus future simulations with the apsim model would have to include a better description of the deep percolation in the cz som enhances soil chemical and physical characteristics it is both a nutrient sink and source and it promotes biological activity thus som is a key component of the soil resource base craswell and lefroy 2001 fluctuations in the amount quality and turnover rate of som due to changes in soil management practice can influence the soil s physical chemical and biological properties haynes 2000 jiang et al 2006 the dssat csm model has been used to simulate spring maize and winter wheat providing tolerable levels accuracy for simulations of topsoil soc and soil organic n son under regular fertilizer application conditions li et al 2015 dssat csm can similarly be used to investigate the effects of climate change on crop yields and simulate soil nitrate accumulation and leaching under different fertilizer treatments rainfall conditions and management practices note that the dssat csm model showed sensitivity to n stress which effected the model performances again as before different models use different parameters to simulate the same process where implementations of multiple models for the same study would provide some objectivity to simulation accuracy for example to describe winter wheat growth using coupmodel 12 parameters were used zhang et al 2007a five of these parameters were calibrated fraction of carbon in leaf reallocated to grain fraction of carbon in stem reallocated to grain fraction of carbon in root reallocated to grain radiation use efficiency and specific leaf area while the remaining seven parameters were measured and or attained from the literature in contrast in dssat csm seven parameters were calibrated for winter wheat growth optimum vernalizing temperature photoperiod response grain filling kernel number per unit canopy weight at anthesis standard kernel size under optimum conditions standard non stressed mature tiller the calibrated parameters of both dssat csm and coupmodel are site specific and cannot be generalized land use type is a key factor to account for as associated levels of variation in stn and stp directly influence the accuracy of the model s simulations for soil nutrient status and nutrient movement wang et al 2009 further the effect of land uses on soil properties should be expressed by their different behaviors and patterns at various spatial scales thus a key challenge is to apply the dssat csm model or any other model in this respect over different spatial scales while plot scale models tend to be more complex and informative as spatial or temporal scales increase the applied models are inherently oversimplified while the value of implementing a plot scale model over an area larger than 1 km2 is debatable further work is required in this respect noting that problematic scale issues are inherent to any cz or es analysis whether mathematical or statistical comber and harris 2022 4 modeling plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions 4 1 context and background in soil plant atmosphere systems plants with their roots provide pathways to transfer water from the soil to the atmosphere deep roots re distribute deep soil water to shallower topsoil layers when the leaf stomata close which enhances plant water transport efficiency lee et al 2005 for shallow soil layers which are generally within the root zone the distributional pattern of the swc is dependent on land use and topography e g slope gradient and aspect while infiltration evaporation and percolation should not be neglected qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2013a b for each land use type roots are distributed differently depending on the specific vegetation which brings about different water uptake and transpiration and hence different soil water distributions the soil water cycle in the soil plant atmosphere system is significantly affected by land use where wue varies with root density in the different soil layers qiu et al 2001 wang et al 2013a b 4 2 model implementations and review for simulating such processes the waves model has been compared with a simple to implement modified statistical dynamic model huang et al 2001 based on the eagleson statistical dynamic water balance model eagleson 1978 the modifications accounted for seasonal variations of precipitation and soil moisture and their influence on plant transpiration resulting in different computations for soil water properties and water flow simulations from the modified model accurately predicted the mean water balance components and the dynamic processes of the mean soil moisture for a specific wheat fertility productivity condition huang et al 2001 the production of annual crop biomass can be directly proportional to the quantity of radiation intercepted the amount of water transpired and the makeup of the nutrients taken up gregory et al 1997 precipitation being the major source of available water for dryland crops needs to be used efficiently to sustain yields and to avoid stored soil water depletion availability of soil water directly influences nutrient loss and the rate of mineralization of n from som gregory et al 1997 this may result in increased residual n accumulation in the soil after crop harvest which can degrade environmental quality through increased n leaching into the groundwater and emissions of greenhouse gases such as n2o on the other hand soils enriched with n through manures and fertilizers can increase crop yields in the presence of abundant soil water that may then result in increased soil water depletion wang et al 2013a b the core task of the ceres wheat model was to solve such yield related problems with respect to determining the main factors that influence yield and to concurrently determine the optimum irrigation and fertilizer management practices accordingly the model was applied across the whole guanzhong region of the shaanxi province of the clp where it simulated the interaction of n water and climatic factors in order to evaluate their contributions to wheat yield and associated management strategies ji et al 2014 note in a different study that both ceres wheat and dssat csm inaccurately simulated winter wheat biomass under stressed conditions zheng et al 2017 the influence of vegetative restoration on deep soil water storage has been the focus of many clp studies chen et al 2008 jia et al 2019 wang et al 2013c despite reducing soil erosion and water losses artificial plantings can lead to the formation of dry soil layers which can significantly restrict land productivity chen et al 2008 fu et al 2012 tested the shaw model in a shrubland environment for two shrub species caragana korshinkii kom and salix psammophila and observed that increased plant coverage was associated with reduced water storage in the upper soil layers water content differed vertically across the soil profile due to differences in root water uptake between the two species generally denser shrub coverage increased the degree of soil desiccation the shaw model showed a poor performance during the freeze thaw cycles since its assumed soil hydraulic properties were inaccurate for a frozen soil the epic model has been applied to forage crop rotation systems alfalfa potato winter wheat and was found to reliably capture monthly swc and the vertical distribution of soil water wang et al 2011 wang et al 2013c the model s simulation accuracy strongly depended on input parameters such as seasonal rainfall solar radiation soil characteristics and user defined et and soil moisture equations wang et al 2011 the epic model has proved to be an effective tool to predict soil desiccation however wang et al 2012 highlighted a decrease in swc due to the long term cultivation of a grain crop after alfalfa here the appropriate stand age of alfalfa would be 8 10 years and the appropriate cultivation years for following a grain cropping system would be 16 18 years cultivating shallow root crops such as potato and soybean has also been recommended to recover soil desiccation after alfalfa wang et al 2012 swc plays a crucial role in biological and hydrological processes including above and below ground runoff flooding solute transportation soil erosion plant growth and land air interactions hydrological ecological and climatic modeling can help understand variation in swc down the soil profile which is critical to water management and associated planting strategies mendham et al 2011 wang et al 2013a b c epic has also been applied to an artificial black locust forest to evaluate biomass and soil desiccation effects and to an apple orchard malus pumila where water and nutrients were re affirmed as the most important factors that influence yield fertilization can also be advantageous in improving wue and yields of dryland orchards but conversely may increase water consumption through transpiration causing soil desiccation because of the deteriorated soil condition peng et al 2017 5 ecosystem research critical zone processes and a modeling framework few studies world wide have fully incorporated es in the assessment of basin scale ecological restoration projects where their incorporation could open up opportunities for enhancing benefits to human livelihood and generating public support trabucchi et al 2012 the prevailing quantification methods for es are usually based on statistical analyses fu et al 2018 hu et al 2017 liu et al 2019 these ignore system dynamics and associated uncertainty and feedbacks because of a lack of the mechanistic understandings of the processes involved i e that obtained through physically based models nicholson et al 2009 thus there is a great urgency to bridge es science with cz science through process based models to provide research that has clear societal and policy relevance and with outputs that allow management approaches at different landscape scales to be modified through interventions field et al 2015 lü et al 2012 luo et al 2019 as described throughout this review a more comprehensive modeling framework that would account for most dominant spatio temporal cz processes is necessary particular attention should be given to non uniqueness or equifinality where very different model structures and or parameter sets are able to describe some observed behaviors with similar model response beven 2006 beven and binley 2014 it has been acknowledge recently that data driven models suffer from similar phenomenon schmidt et al 2020 this concept of equifinality makes it difficult to define objectively model acceptability various methods and techniques have been proposed to identify the best model such as the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methodology beven and binley 1992 the use of the information theory to discriminate models pachepsky et al 2006 and a frequency based performance measure teegavarapu et al 2022 other methods such as the diagnostic efficiency de schwemmle et al 2021 offers the capability to disaggregate the different sources of errors i e the model parameters the model structure and or the input data by using model ensembles for simulating the same process e g hassall et al 2022 one can determine the main error source of the different models preceding to the models training stage sensitivity analyses can provide information regarding which parameters and processes are the most important for specific modeled conditions or systems sensitivity evaluations can help reduce model complexity and improve efficiency local and global sensitivity analyses are possible where the former is a one at a time approach while the latter considers multiple parameters at the same time link et al 2018 naves et al 2020 the local form does not account for interactions between parameters while the global form does and as such is computationally intensive which can make it prohibitive in its use the use of ensemble of model projections to estimate prediction uncertainty comparable to the suggested approach above is a common practice in fields such as climate research déqué et al 2007 reto et al 2010 strobach and bel 2020 and ecosystem research schwalm et al 2010 this method enables the user to change and test different factors that can affect model uncertainty such as initial condition model parameters spatial temporal resolution the simulated results are often considered to provide equal weighted averages thus it is assumed that the biases of an individual model are partly canceled by averaging all predictions reto et al 2010 this approach might be utilized in soil modeling practices to determine the influence of each model parameter its uncertainty and its structure on the simulated outputs e g brown and heuvelink 2005 krishnan and aggarwal 2018 shan et al 2021 furthermore most soil models as models in other fields reto et al 2010 strobach and bel 2020 are established according to current and recent past conditions jasper et al 2006 besides the urgent need to calculate uncertainties of models predictions there are uncertainties regarding future conditions a model calibrated under historic conditions may have questionable validity under future scenarios if the model states differ substantially from those in the calibration period this challenges for example future projections of different ecological systems that might be effected by climate change mcmahon et al 2009 a modeling framework which can be directly used as a model based decision support tool dst has in part been developed for the clp hu et al 2015 this dst provides a platform to explore different management scenarios and to optimally plan them the dst has four modules a a module for scenario development b the integrated es model base c the es trade off tool and d the multi objective spatial optimization module based on the fast non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii nsga ii with this dst scenario testing and optimal decision making analyses can be performed considering climate precipitation and temperature land cover vegetation built up areas croplands etc and socioeconomic population and economic growth factors via different scenarios the ess of soil and water and their optimal combinations can be simulated in turn adaptive management policy recommendations for vegetation restoration soil and water resource use and the payment for ess for regional sustainability can be derived based on the utility of various trade off analyses and multi criteria optimizations the dst as with any dst has the capability to be upgraded and refined for example through hybrid modelling strategies where process based models are combined with statistical and or machine learning models kuhnert 2014 say to better characterize extreme events curceac et al 2020 2022 6 conclusions in this review a multitude of loess plateau studies were summarized in order to illustrate the disadvantages and advantages related to the specific process based modelling approach taken each study s model performance was typically bound under different climate land use and temporal and spatial scales models were categorized in terms of i plant and soil water interactions ii plant and soil nutrient interactions and iii plant soil water and soil nutrient interactions in each category a clear deficiency existed in that research studies typically selected only one modelling approach for analyzing the dominant soil plant processes using only one modeling approach might mislead say through the indication of only one or the wrong dominant process and as such multiple models should be employed for context and comparison in this respect the establishment of a modelling framework that includes several models to describe the same process might more accurately highlight prevailing factors where the use of model ensembles is also possible the capacity to conduct a sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameter uncertainty should also be included such a framework has in part been established where some of the process based models described typically associated with critical zone science are coupled with analytical tools typically associated ecosystem services that together provide both societal and policy relevance to loess plateau research for future studies the reporting of a given model s suitability and its relative accuracy to alternatives should be promoted where a common set of model accuracy diagnostics are used to aid comparison across studies and processes answers to questions of why a given model was adopted how well was it calibrated and how well was it validated are crucial to ensure informed management or policy decisions especially when they involve substantive financial investments declaration of competing interest the authors

24333,the indian economy is thought to be primarily dependent on agriculture in plants with various climatic circumstances illness is highly prevalent and natural as a result the quality of crop deteriorates getting the best quality and quantity of harvest is farmers most challenging task due to recent changes in weather cycles crop diseases must be identified and prevented as soon as possible to improve productivity deep learning is an artificial intelligence branch it has been actively discussed in academic and industrial circles in recent days because of the advantages of autonomous learning and feature extraction the use of learning based algorithms in plant leaf disease recognition can help to strengthen the objectivity of plant leaf disease feature extraction minimize the limitations of intentionally selecting disease spot features and speed up the study in this paper we examine existing approaches to detecting plant leaf disease using deep learning and high end imaging methods as well as their challenges we anticipate that our research will be useful to researchers interested in plant disease identification the traditional cnn has the issue of using up too much computational power to address this issue this research developed a dcnn dilated convolutional neural network model with global average pooling gap which will be constructed by changing regular cnn convolution kernels with dilated convolution kernels and the fully connected layer in traditional cnn replaced by global average pooling the dilated convolution gives the advantages of less computational cost and reduced memory usage then gap avoids overfitting these two new concepts are implemented with cnn and the results of this method is compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods using performance metric such as precision recall f1 score and accuracy the classification includes four classes such as bacterial blight blast brown spot and turgo the performance metrics shows that in the same experimental setup the dcnn model with gap improves training accuracy by 5 49 percent on average compared to the classic cnn model and the results are compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods keywords plant leaf disease deep learning artificial intelligence dcnn gap data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction outbreaks of plant diseases have a negative impact on agricultural productivity if plant diseases are not discovered soon there will be more food instability climate change and regional variations in weather patterns are factors in plant diseases in agriculture climate fluctuations like excessive insufficient precipitation and extremely hot cold weather can cause crops to contract viral fungal and bacterial diseases islam et al 2017 in the agriculture world automation in identification of plant diseases based on plant leaves is a big milestone furthermore quick and accurate detection of plant leaf diseases has a positive impact on crop productivity and quality it is vital to control and stop the spread of illness across the farm in order to produce the highest quality harvest to stop diseases from spreading it s important to recognize them by their symptoms figure out why they re spreading and strive to manage them plant diseases can harm plants both above and below the ground level the leaves of sick plants typically show noticeable blemishes generally speaking each disease has a unique visual pattern that can be used to spot anomalies the majority of disease symptoms might begin to manifest on a plant s leaves which are typically the main source for identifying plant illnesses ebrahimi et al 2017 plant disease identification in a genuine complex natural setting has numerous problems including a modest difference between the lesion region and the backdrop low contrast substantial fluctuations in the extent of the lesion area and a lot of noise in the lesion image there are also a lot of distractions when gathering photographs of plant diseases in natural light traditional classical approaches frequently appear powerless at this moment and improving detection outcomes is difficult fuentes et al 2020 deep learning models have been successfully applied in several sectors of computer vision in recent years including de noising senthilselvi et al 2021 medical image processing sankareswaran and krishnan 2022 food adulteration detection surya and senthilselvi 2022 and metal purification detection senthilselvi et al 2020 yellow dots brown dots spotting and other signs can be used to diagnose leaf diseases and the illness can be controlled by taking precautions to prevent the dots from reappearing on crops including rice wheat oats potatoes tomatoes pomegranates and so on the majority of the time farmers relied on their eyes to identify the illness but this method is slow and inaccurate in the agricultural sector to identify a disease farmers may need professional support with the development of automated solutions for these tasks it is now simpler to properly identify disease which reduces the demand for skilled workers and lowers farmer costs it is very challenging to create such automatic algorithms that detect plant diseases by optically seeing symptoms on plant leaves 1 1 global average pooling gap the gap layer replaces the fully connected layer in traditional cnn it produces a separate feature map for each class by finding the average of features received from the previous layer then the calculated feature maps were given to the softmax layer but in the traditional cnn the features maps from the convolutional layers are converted to single dimensional vectors then given to the fully connected layer the advantages of implementing a gap layer is reduction of overfitting fig 1 shows the comparison of fully connected layer and gap layer 1 2 dilated convolution dc a technique for expanding the kernel by poking holes between its parts in simple terms it s the same as convolution but with pixel skipping to cover a wider portion of the input dilated convolution allows you to cover a greater area of the source image without pooling the goal is to extract maximum knowledge from the outcome of each convolution process at the same computing cost this approach provides a larger field of view the magnitude of the dilation factor l is determined by examining what more knowledge is gained with every convolution at various l values we can get extra details without expanding the amount of kernel parameters by employing this strategy fig 2 explains traditional convolution and dilated convolution advantages of dc 1 loss of coverage is nil hence higher receptive field 2 the architecture with dilated convolution removes the pooling operation hence 3 very less memory usage and high resolution image 4 the computational cost is less the paper is organized as follows the literature review is described

they identify common apple leaf diseases using their trained deep cnn they achieve overall accuracy 97 62 and provide a solution for apple leaf diseases identification jayme garcia and arnalbarbedo barbedo 2019 discussed a deep learning model for plant disease identification using individual lesions and spots rather than considering the entire leaf they take individual lesions and spots for consideration and it is useful to identify more diseases affecting the particular leaf chongke et al proposed a high stable low cost apple leaf diseases identification model using mobilenet they compare their model with other deep learning methods and show that their model is low cost and highly stable ngugiet al ngugi et al 2021 reviewed about the role of machine learning and image processing techniques for detection of diseases and crop pests they review different convolutional neural network architectures in terms of recall precision specificity recognition accuracy f1 score storage requirements and training durations geetharamani and arun pandian geetharamani and pandian 2019 discussed plant leaf diseases identification using deep cnn deep convolutional neural network they trained the model using an open dataset of 39 different classes of background images and plant leaves they use six augmentation methods namely gamma correction image flipping pca principal component analysis color augmentation noise injection scaling and rotation to increase the model performance they use data augmentation they train the model using different batch sizes dropouts and epochs they achieve 96 46 of plant diseases classification accuracy jatin arora et al arora and agrawal 2020 discussed classification and recognition of maize plant diseases to increase the accuracy they use deep forest algorithm zhao et al explained zhao et al 2021 about the detection of plant diseases using double gan generative adversarial network they give solution for unbalanced dataset to balance the dataset they use double gan to generate healthy plant leaves images double gan is divided into two modules in the first module they give unhealthy leaves and healthy leaves as input to wasserstein generative adversarial network for obtain model they achieve 99 80 and 99 53 of plant species and disease recognition respectively wu et al discussed wu et al 2020 about the identification of tomato leaf diseases using dcgan deep convolutional generative adversarial networks they propose new method of data augmentation by gan to overcome the limitation in rotation translation and flip their new model generates images that are augmented by dcgan they modify the hyper parameters adjusting the architecture of the cnn and identify different gan to improve the model they conclude that their model improves the accuracy of detecting tomato leaf disease 2 1 findings from literature survey learnings from literature survey s no author details methodology used accuracy 1 sethy et al

94 33 the above mentioned methods are versions of pre trained traditional cnn models the traditional cnn has the issue of using up too much computational power the proposed method gives the advantages of less computational cost and reduced memory usage by changing regular cnn convolution kernels with dilated convolution kernels 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials the datasets were obtained from sethy et al sethy 2020 there are 1584 bacterial blight images class 0 1600 blast images class 1 900 brown spot images class 2 and 1308 turgo images class 3 totaling 5932 rice leaf images table 1 gives the entire dataset information table 2 explains the class information and fig 3 gives the information about images per class fig 4 shows the sample rice leaf images in this research 80 of the input is used as the training set and 20 is used as the testing set it is the most typical split ratio 3 2 method the proposed architecture for rice plant leaf disease classification includes two steps 1 pre processing and 2 classification pre processing techniques include image augmentation and enhancement for classification a convolutional neural network cnn with dilated convolution and global pooling is used fig 5 explains the flow diagram proposed method fig 6 explains the proposed architecture 3 2 1 preprocessing the image dimension of 300 300 is used for this research normally every image has some unwanted information called noise the noises were removed using a fuzzy filter it is rule based filter preserving edge information texture details fine details and quick response are the advantages of using fuzzy filter the denoised images are given as input to the augmentation network the augmentation process improves the performance of the proposed deep neural networks by increasing the number of training images the training images were increased by doing some mathematical operations on the images such as rotation scaling shifting shearing and flipping fig 7 explains the preprocessing 3 2 2 classification the resized rice leaf image of dimension 200 200 given as input to dilated convolutional layer in this research dilation rate 2 with filter size of 3 3 with 0 padding and stride 2 is used to extract features from the input image the output of the dilated convolution layer is given as input to the max pooling layer this layer is otherwise called down sampling layer and it is used for dimensionality reduction the difference between normal convolution and dilated convolution is a space is inserted between kernel elements hence a wider kernel is created to learn the features of the given rice leaf after a consecutive dilated convolution and max pooling a feature map is created in normal ccn the feature maps were given as input to the fully connected layer but in this research the feature maps are given to the gap layer the advantage of using the gap layer is reduction of trainable parameters by generating an average feature map received from the previous layer the output of the gap layer is directly fed to the softmax layer it decides the class of the given rice leaf image based on the calculation done by the softmax function 4 result and discussion 4 1 experimental setup all of the tests were carried out using the google colab gpu setup which is open source the keras python3 package and tensorflow as a backdrop are used to create each model the results are validated using a cross validation method 4 2 cross validation it is a method for estimating learning based model performance it s a way of determining how well the outcome of a data analysis will generalize to a different collection of data in this method many small train test splits were produced using the initial training dataset then the model will be tuned using these splits in k fold cross validation the training dataset is divided into k subgroups the algorithm is then iteratively trained on k 1 subsets with the remaining subset serving as the test set this allows us to test our model on previously unseen data in this research 10 fold cross validation is used to find the validated output fig 8 explains the 10 fold cross validation process 4 3 performance metric this section explains performance metrics eqs 1 2 3 and 4 explains accuracy precision recall and f1 score respectively table 3 4 explains performance metric comparison and cross validation respectively fig 9 explains performance metric comparison and fig 10 explains accuracy value at different folds 4 3 1 accuracy the accuracy takes into account the sum of true positive tp and true negative tn components in the numerator and the sum of all confusion matrix entries in the denominator tp and tn are the elements that the model successfully classified and are located on the main diagonal of the confusion matrix whereas the denominator includes all components false positive fp false negative fn that are not located on the main diagonal and have been mistakenly classified by the model 1 a c c u r a c y t p t n t p t n f p f n 4 3 2 precision when the consequences of fp are large precision is a great measure to use a fp in plant leaf disease detection happens when an image class that is not infected real negative is mistakenly identified as infected if the plant leaf disease detection model s precision is low it will affect the farmers production 2 pr e c i s i o

plant leaf disease detection if a diseased leaf actual positive is predicted as non diseased leaf predicted negative the consequence is the unnecessary suggestion of pesticides the cost related to fn will be very high if the leaf disease is contagious 3 re c a l l t p t p f n 4 3 4 f1 score to find the right balance among precision and recall and there is an unequal class distribution i e high volume of actual negatives in the dataset f1 score would be a preferable statistic to utilize 4 f 1 s c o r e 2 pr e c i s i o n re c a l l pr e c i s i o n re c a l l 5 conclusion this research presents a comparative study on learning based rice plant disease classification and explains the two new concepts dilated convolution and global average pooling gap the dilated convolution gives the advantages of less computational cost and reduced memory usage then gap avoids overfitting these two new concepts are implemented with cnn and the results of this method is compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods using performance metric such as precision recall f1 score and accuracy the classification includes four classes such as bacterial blight blast brown spot and turgo the experiments are conducted on google colab setup with needed python libraries the default adam optimizer is used to reduce the loss value and to improve accuracy value the experimental outcome shows that in the same experimental setup the proposed model improves training accuracy by 5 49 percent on average compared to the classic cnn model and the results are compared with other learning and hybrid learning methods in future the proposed dcnn with gap model tested for different dataset and different network parameters declaration ethics approval and consent to participate no

of less computational cost and reduced memory usage by changing regular cnn convolution kernels with dilated convolution kernels 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials the datasets were obtained from sethy et al sethy 2020 there are 1584 bacterial blight images class 0 1600 blast images class 1 900 brown spot images class 2 and 1308 turgo images class 3 totaling 5932 rice leaf images table 1 gives the entire dataset information table 2 explains the class information and fig 3 gives the information about images per class fig 4 shows the sample rice leaf images in this research 80 of the input is used as the training set and 20 is used as the testing set it is the most typical split ratio 3 2 method the proposed architecture for rice plant leaf disease classification includes two steps 1 pre processing and 2 classification pre processing techniques include image augmentation and enhancement for classification a convolutional neural network cnn with dilated convolution and global pooling is used fig 5 explains the flow diagram proposed method fig 6 explains the proposed architecture 3 2 1 preprocessing the image dimension of 300 300 is used for this research normally every image has some unwanted information called noise the noises were removed using a fuzzy filter it is rule based filter preserving edge information texture details fine details and quick response are the advantages of using fuzzy filter the denoised images are given as input to the augmentation network the augmentation process improves the performance of the proposed deep neural networks by increasing the number of training images the training images were increased by doing some mathematical operations on the images such as rotation scaling shifting shearing and flipping fig 7 explains the preprocessing 3 2 2 classification the resized rice leaf image of dimension 200 200 given as input to dilated convolutional layer in this research dilation rate 2 with filter size of 3 3 with 0 padding and stride 2 is used to extract features from the input image the output of the dilated convolution layer is given as input to the max pooling layer this layer is otherwise called down sampling layer and it is used for dimensionality reduction the difference between normal convolution and dilated convolution is a space is inserted between kernel elements hence a wider kernel is created to learn the features of the given rice leaf after a consecutive dilated convolution and max pooling a feature map is created in normal ccn the feature maps were given as input to the fully connected layer but in this research the feature maps are given to the gap layer the advantage of using the gap layer is reduction of trainable parameters by generating an average feature map received from the previous layer the output of the gap layer is directly fed to the softmax layer it decides the class of the given rice leaf image based on the calculation done by the softmax function 4 result and discussion 4 1 experimental setup all of the tests were carried out using the google colab gpu setup which is open source the keras python3 package and tensorflow as a backdrop are used to create each model the results are validated using a cross validation method 4 2 cross validation it is a method for estimating learning based model performance it s a way of determining how well the outcome of a data analysis will generalize to a different collection of data in this method many small train test splits were produced using the initial training dataset then the model will be tuned using these splits in k fold cross validation the training dataset is divided into k subgroups the algorithm is then iteratively trained on k 1 subsets with the remaining subset serving as the test set this allows us to test our model on previously unseen data in this research 10 fold cross validation is used to find the validated output fig 8 explains the 10 fold cross validation process 4 3

validation respectively fig 9 explains performance metric comparison and fig 10 explains accuracy value at different folds 4 3 1 accuracy the accuracy takes into account the sum of true positive tp and true negative tn components in the numerator and the sum of all confusion matrix entries in the denominator tp and tn are the elements that the model successfully classified and are located on the

presents a comparative study on learning based rice plant disease classification and explains the two new concepts dilated convolution and global average pooling gap the dilated convolution gives the advantages of less computational cost and reduced memory usage then gap avoids overfitting these two new concepts are implemented with cnn and the results of this method is compared with other

24334,understanding the underlying mechanisms for pathogen spillover is a main quest in epidemiology given the complexity of multi host systems several factors may play a relative role in spillover dynamics a relatively less studied factor is the internal dynamics of pathogens that result from inter strain competition the competitive interactions among strains can cause deterministic changes in the population dynamics of pathogens such changes may affect the potential host range of pathogens influencing the probability of pathogen spillover here our main goal is to show how an evolutionary game played by coexisting strains may induce pulses of pathogen spillover to this end we build a multi host multi strain mean field model in which strains residing in a reservoir host have different capacities to explore an incidental host we modelled inter strain competition as a superinfection network and apply a game theoretical analysis to it the results indicate that game outcome depends on how reservoir hosts deal with the superinfection process if superinfection is lethal results in competitive exclusion or in coinfection our analysis suggests that game outcome can produce cycles in the strain composition that are cryptic in relation to the epidemiological dynamics of reservoirs cycles in strain frequency composition cause small or no effect in the reservoir population this suggests that relying solely on reservoir distribution and prevalence may subestimate the chance of pathogen spillover moreover pulses of spillover can rely on the standing variation of pathogens with no need for the emergence of novel mutations that increases pathogen host range keywords cyclic dominance cross infection emerging infectious diseases multi host pathogens data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in multihost systems pathogens circulate from one species to another depending on the transmission route offered by each host woolhouse et al 2001 as a consequence disease outbreak in one species can be initiated by pathogens propagules that spill over from one host species to another as in other studies daszak et al 2000 power and mitchell 2004 borremans et al 2019 cross et al 2019 we use the term pathogen spillover as a reference for this process given the complexity involved in multihost systems there are many ecological factors driving events of spillover plowright et al 2017 if the host pathogen interaction produced by the spillover process is not stable natural fluctuations in these ecological drivers may give rise to pulses of pathogen spillover plowright et al 2016 host species that are able to stably sustain pathogen populations are called reservoir species haydon et al 2002 ashford 2003 given the stability of their interactions reservoirs play a key role in promoting spillover events in multi host communities wasik et al 2019 letko et al 2020 in addition many reservoir species seem to sustain high diversity of pathogen strains with no apparent change in the severity of the disease baum et al 2012 van brussel and holmes 2022 a possible reason for this is that different strains may trigger the same immunological response in some hosts mandl et al 2015 another explanation is that reservoirs may be capable of producing a variety of antibody responses that confer host tolerance to a wide range of pathogens roy and kirchner 2000 baum et al 2012 either way the fact that different strains have similar epidemiology in reservoirs does not mean that their capacity to explore alternative hosts are equal morris et al 2019 instead several studies suggest that increasing strain diversity in reservoirs may also increase the chance of spillover dennehy et al 2010 olival et al 2017 brooks et al 2019 letko et al 2020 remien and nuismer 2020 feronato et al 2021 this is because the region that a host occupies in the fitness landscape of a pathogen may vary depending on the pathogen strain smith tsurkan et al 2010 besides being host dependent the fitness landscape of pathogens may also vary with the composition of their own population newton et al 1998 this is because the within interactions among different strains may have alternative outcomes depending on the frequency composition kirkup and riley 2004 andrade domínguez et al 2014 superinfection is one type of inter strain competition in which a secondary strain infects an already infected host nowak and may 1994 after superinfection the outcome of the inter strain competition may be either host death hamid et al 2002 competitive exclusion from the within host environment duncan et al 2018 or strain coexistence leverich et al 2008 except in the case that is lethal to the host superinfection can maintain pathogen diversity in the host population nowak and may 1994 mosquera and adler 1998 if strains have different capacities to explore novel hosts the strain diversity maintained by the process of superinfection may increase the probability of pathogen spillover if that is the case spillover would be facilitated by the internal dynamics of pathogens rather than by fluctuations on the external factors however we are unaware of studies about the role of superinfection to the dynamics of pathogen spillover evolutionary game theory is one way to study the internal dynamics of populations this is because it is centred in scenarios of intraspecific interactions among different phenotypes in a given population nowak and sigmund 2004 depending on how interactions occur within the game evolutionary dynamics yields to alternative population states kerr et al 2002 kirkup and riley 2004 moreover game dynamics may produce deterministic population cycles which maintains population polymorphism in a relatively predictable manner claussen and traulsen 2008 laird 2014 szolnoki et al 2014 in this sense game dynamics may be a mechanism that bridges superinfection dynamics and events of pathogen spillover here our main goal is to show how game dynamics in inter strain interactions can drive pulses of pathogen spillover to this end we build and analyse a set of mean field equations representing the epidemiological dynamics of a multi host multi strain system in which different strains have different capacities to explore other hosts our analysis indicates that if different strains have no differential effects to the reservoir host the game dynamics may become cryptic in relation to the epidemiology of reservoirs large fluctuations in the frequency composition of strains but small or absent fluctuations in the infected class of reservoir see mougi 2012 for an example of cryptic cycles in eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey systems the outcome of this game is mainly defined by whether inter strain competition results in competitive exclusion coinfection or host death then pulses of pathogen spillover emerge whenever the game dynamics produces oscillations in the frequency composition of strains 2 models and analysis here we present and analyse a multi species version of the classical susceptible infected susceptible s i s model brauer et al 2008 the model is composed by a set of ordinary differential equations ode s describing the temporal change in the density of susceptible and infected classes during disease epidemics the term density is used as a reference for the fact that increasing the number of individuals also increases population crowding begon et al 2007 we consider two host species namely a reservoir host and an incidental host ashford 2003 the reservoir host sustains a polymorphic pathogen population composed by a diversity of strains the frequency of each strain in the reservoir population depends on the inter strain competition which we describe as a superinfection evolutionary game we assume that the incidental host cannot stably sustain the epidemics and thus outbreaks are always started by a spillover process only a particular strain is capable of infecting the incidental host consequently the chance of spillover depends on the encounter between individuals in the susceptible class of the incidental host and reservoirs infected with that particular strain the rate at which this encounter occurs is directly proportional to the frequency of that strain in the reservoir then because the superinfection game affects the frequency composition in the pathogen population patterns of spillover depends on the game outcome this section is organized as follows first we describe the epidemiological model in terms of their specific variables and parameters next we show how the superinfection can be described by a competition network and how game dynamics can be derived from this network then we use analytical treatments to derive the game outcomes and point out the conditions required for the emergence of cyclical outbreaks we summarize our results with numerical simulations and their interpretations the full r script used in our numerical analysis can be found in the github repository https github com pbolanhom gdsp 2 1 epidemiological dynamics consider a host community composed by a reservoir host and an incidental host hereafter we use subscripts r and i to denote the variables and parameters of reservoir and incidental hosts respectively let their population density be n r t s r t i r t and n i t s i t i i t where s t and i t are the densities of susceptible and infected classes in their populations we assume that the reservoir host is initially infected with n pathogen strains p 1 n let these strains be contained in the set p p 1 n then let i r p be the population density of reservoirs that are infected with strain p thus the overall density of the infected class of reservoir is the sum of the densities of classes infected by each strain i r p n i r p the incidental host is only susceptible to infection by strain p 1 for both hosts greek letters α β and γ denote the epidemiological parameters for virulence transmission rate and recovery rate respectively assuming that hosts populations grow logistically and transmission is direct transmission depends on the direct contact between individuals the system can be described by the following set of ode s 1a d s r d t b r n r p 1 n γ r p i r p s r d r l r n r p 1 n β r p i r p 1b d i r p d t i r p β r p s r γ r p q p i r q θ p q g θ q p p p 1c d s i d t b i n i γ i i i s i d i l i n i β i i i β r i i r 1 1d d i i d t i i s i β i γ i s i β r i i r 1 where symbol p p reads for all p within set p parameters b and d stands for hosts intrinsic born and death rates respectively l is the density dependent mortality of hosts this parameter reflects the intra specific competition in hosts populations note that both infected and susceptible individuals contribute to the born rate the term b n b s b i which implies that infection does not impairs host reproduction also note that newborn hosts are allocated to the susceptible class the term b n only appears in eqs 1a and 1c indicating that there is no vertical transmission of pathogens γ d l n α γ is the removal rate of the infected classes the parameter β r i is the rate of cross transmission between the hosts note however that cross transmission only occurs from reservoirs to incidental hosts and is thus unidirectional also note that β r i multiplies i r 1 in eqs 1c and 1d which reflects the fact that i i is only susceptible to strain p 1 fig 1 depicts the motif describing the dynamics of model 1 the term q p i r q θ p q g θ q p in eq 1b describes the superinfection process in the reservoir population where index q represents another strain within the set p that is interacting with strain p p the upper limit in this summation term is omitted for simplicity the subscript q p already indicates that the summation is over all the n elements of p parameter θ p q denotes the rate at which strain p superinfects another strain q while θ q p denotes the opposite direction parameter g represents a phenomenological class transfer coefficient this parameter describes how superinfected individuals move across the infected classes i r p the range of this parameter is 0 g 2 and different modes of transference emerge depending on its value interval there are three possibilities if g 1 the superinfectant strain causes the competitive exclusion of the previous strain with no cost for the host in this case class transfer occurs immediately after superinfection and is the classical form of superinfection models nowak and may 1994 in the case that 1 g 2 the quantity of individuals that is removed from the superinfected class is larger than the quantity incremented in the superinfectant class thus for this parameter interval superinfection imposes a mortality cost for hosts a comprehensive study on this type of process can be found in mosquera and adler 1998 the last case occurs when 0 g 1 a g value within this interval means that less individuals leave one class than are incremented in the next this means that some individuals remain coinfected with the two strains after superinfection 2 1 1 the superinfection network we use a network theoretical approach to describe the superinfection dynamics consider a network in which nodes represent different strains and weighted directed links stands for the direction of superinfection for example if there is an arrow departing from node 1 towards node 2 it means that strain p 1 superinfects strain p 2 the weight of these links is denoted by the rate of superinfection θ p q fig 2 depicts an example of a superinfection network mathematically the link structure of any network can be described by its adjacency matrix a the entries of a are the weights of links between connected nodes newman 2004 here the adjacency matrix of the superinfection network is 2a a θ 11 θ 1 n θ n 1 θ n n note that the entries of matrix a are in the form θ p q to get the values of θ q p we simply evaluate the entries of the transposed matrix a t we define the following function for the value of θ p q 2b θ p q β r p ϵ if a link exists from p to q 0 otherwise where parameter ϵ is the rate to which superinfection occurs in relation to primary infections this parameter have the same interpretation as parameter s in the seminal paper of nowak and may 1994 thus if we build the superinfection network as if more virulent strains superinfect less virulent strains and assume that l r γ r p 0 no density dependence and no recovery rate and that b r n r b r constant immigration rate of uninfected individuals eqs 1a and 1b goes back to exactly the same system developed and analysed in nowak and may 1994 2 2 game dynamics in this sub section we apply an evolutionary game analysis to the superinfection network as depicted in the motif of fig 1 the game dynamics in model 1 is part of the dynamics of the infected reservoir class eq 1b thus we start by showing how to evaluate any game dynamics in the superinfection network then we use this approach to analyse a rock paper scissors game and derive its outcome and relationships with pulses of pathogen spillover evolutionary game theory describes the change in the frequency of players or strategies in a given population ray mukherjee and mukherjee 2016 cressman and tao 2014 the players of the superinfection game are the n strains p 1 n that coexist in the reservoir host let f r p t i r p t i r t be the frequency of each strain in the reservoir where i r t p n i r p t then after taking the time derivative of f r p t see appendix a we get the following replicator equation describing the temporal dynamics of frequencies d f r p d t f r p d i r p i r p d t d i r i r d t where the first and second terms within the brackets of the above equation are the per capita growth rate of strain p and the per capita growth rate of the overall reservoir infected class under the assumption of well mixed populations which is an implicit assumption in mean field models morozov and poggiale 2012 these per capita growth rates are equivalent to the fitness of strains and of the overall population fitness mcpeek 2017 respectively we assume that strains have no differential epidemiological parameters to the reservoir host thus let the epidemiological parameters of each strain in the reservoir be for all p p β r p β r α r p α r and γ r p γ r this yields to the following replicator equation 3 d f r p d t f r p i r q p f r q θ p q g θ q p p 1 n f r p q p f r q θ p q g θ q p the entire derivation of eq 3 can be found in appendix a in evolutionary game theory each player receives a payoff for playing the game with a specific opponent biologically this payoff composes the reproductive success of those players nowak 2006 if a strain p plays the superinfection game with another strain q p receives a reproductive value that is a balance between how many infected individuals are incorporated into the class p and how many individuals leave the class p thus the replicator eq 3 indicates that θ p q g θ q p is the payoff coefficient of any strain p playing the game with a given strain q remember that the values of θ p q are the entries of superinfection network adjacency matrix a while the values of θ q p are the entries of a t therefore any game that can be described by the replicator eq 3 have the following payoff matrix 4 p a g a t θ 11 g θ 11 θ 1 n g θ n 1 θ n 1 g θ 1 n θ n n g θ n n where p in eq 4 is a n x n matrix with the payoff coefficients θ p q g θ q p in its entries the entries of each row represents the payoff that a player in the row get for playing the game with a given opponent eq 4 also shows the connection between the superinfection network which have the adjacency matrix a and game dynamics this connection allows us to analyse a variety evolutionary games among strains by drawing their network representation to show this we analyse the rock paper scissors r p s game zhou 2016 a famous game that has relevant biological applications kerr et al 2002 kirkup and riley 2004 szolnoki et al 2014 mark rowland et al 2017 2 2 1 the r p s game the r p s game describes a closed loop of intransitive competition gallien et al 2017 in which rock beats paper paper beats scissor and scissor beats rock to incorporate the r p s game in our model we simply assume an analogous network structure intransitive loop among n 3 strains to the superinfection network this configuration is depicted in fig 3 then we take the adjacency matrix of the network in fig 3 and use eq 4 to calculate the payoff matrix of the game this yields to 5 p 0 θ 12 g θ 31 g θ 12 0 θ 23 θ 31 g θ 23 0 the row entries of matrix 5 denote the costs and benefits of a given strain in each row playing the game against their opponents in each column positive values denote that the player strain receives a benefit for playing against that opponent while negative values denote a cost generally speaking there are two types of contests in this game a tie or a win lose contest zhou 2016 the tie contest occurs when the two players pertain to the same strain because the payoff matrix 5 is hollow the diagonal entries are zero a tie outcome is always zero the win lose outcome of each player is the sum of all other entries of each row except for the diagonal element here this sum is always β r ϵ 1 g selection may give advantage to different population compositions depending on which contest provides a higher payoff whether a higher outcome comes from a tie or a win lose contest depends on the signal of 1 g we discuss the implications of this to our results further in the text 2 2 2 game outcome and its relationship with spillover pulses the frequency composition f r f r 1 f r 2 f r 3 of pathogen strains reaches its equilibrium at f r f ˆ r whenever the superscript ˆ appears in this paper it indicates that the quantity below it is evaluated at the interior equilibrium of model 1 it is known that the r p s game has a unique interior equilibrium that is given by the homogeneous composition f ˆ r 1 3 1 3 1 3 nowak 2006 cressman and tao 2014 zhou 2016 here f ˆ r is always stable which means that if the initial frequency composition is exactly f ˆ r the system remains at its interior equilibrium if however the initial composition is heterogeneous f r p f r q f r p 0 p system dynamics depends on the asymptotic stability of f ˆ r following nowak 2006 the asymptotic stability and thus the game outcome can be evaluated by analysing the signal of the determinant det p of the payoff matrix 5 6b det p θ 12 θ 23 θ 31 1 g 3 ϵ β r 3 1 g 3 note that because parameters ϵ and β r must be positive numbers the signal of det p depends only on the value of parameter g if 0 g 1 det p is positive indicating that the interior equilibrium f ˆ r is asymptotically stable this means that the trajectories of the replicator system 3 oscillate around the interior equilibrium until they converge to a stable state at f ˆ r bottom row of fig 4a and fig 4b in the case that g 1 det p 0 and thus f ˆ r is asymptotically unstable in this case the replicator dynamics will give rise to stable limit cycles middle row of fig 4a and fig 4b under the g 1 scenario the superinfection term vanishes from the dynamics of the overall infected class i r the term θ p q g θ q p vanishes see eq a 5 in appendix a as a consequence the strain dynamics becomes decoupled from the overall infected class of reservoirs hence while the game dynamics produces large oscillations in the strain composition there is no signature of these oscillations on the dynamics of i r we call these cryptic cycles as a reference to the cryptic cycles in the eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey interactions in which cycles in predator population produce almost no change in the population dynamics of preys mougi 2012 kinnison et al 2015 if however g falls within the interval 1 g 2 the determinant det p is negative as in the previous case a negative determinants also indicates that the interior equilibrium is asymptotically unstable however the oscillations that emerge from system dynamics are non periodic and unstable the trajectories starting at any non zero heterogeneous composition oscillate around f ˆ r in periods that continuously increases top row of fig 4a and fig 4b this type of dynamical behaviour is called heteroclinic cycles and is a known result in superinfection dynamics nowak and may 1994 theoretically as noted in may and leonard 2003 heteroclinic cycles never lead to the total extinction of either one or two players of the r p s game even for the case in which t the frequency of the non dominant players will never reach zero without an arbitrary decision or a rounding error nowak 2006 vandermeer 2011 however because these frequencies represent biological populations it is plausible to expect lower limits of frequencies in which that population is driven to extinction e g allee effects environmental fluctuations for this reason the biological interpretation of the heteroclinic cycles in fig 4 is that they eventually lead to monomorphic pathogen populations at the interior equilibrium the density of the infected class of the incidental host is 7 i ˆ i s ˆ i s ˆ i β i l i d i α i γ i d i α i γ i s ˆ i β i l i 2 4 l i s ˆ i β r i i r f r 1 2 l i in the appendix b we show the calculation of eq 7 and that it is an increasing function of f r 1 the incidental host may or may not stably sustain the epidemics in absence of the reservoir this depends on the value of the reproductive ratio of the pathogen in the incidental host r 0 i 8 r 0 i β i s ˆ i γ i the derivation of r 0 i follows lion and metz 2018 and can be found in appendix c r 0 i measures how many secondary infections is produced by each infected individual the condition for stable maintenance of epidemics requires that r 0 i 1 here we set our parameter values so that r 0 i 1 therefore stable epidemics on the incidental host is necessarily maintained by spillover from reservoirs this means that if the equilibrium composition f ˆ r is not reached the density of the infected class of the incidental host i i follows the oscillatory trajectory of the replicator dynamics this can be seen in fig 4c note how the density of infected incidental hosts solid red lines in column c abruptly increases following the increases in f r 1 purple lines in column b this sudden increases are analogous to pulses of spillover since they produce outbreaks that are started and maintained by the reservoir population power and mitchell 2004 because oscillations in the frequency composition are caused by the shape of the payoff matrix game dynamics has an indirect causal effect in these pulses of pathogen spillover 3 discussion given the complexity of epidemiological systems containing multiple host species several factors can be evoked in order to study causal pathways involved in spillover events here we have shown that pulses of pathogen spillover may be a consequence of oscillations in the frequency composition of pathogen strains these oscillations are deterministic and happens as the outcome of an evolutionary r p s game played by different strains that coexist in a reservoir population our analysis suggests that pulses of spillover does not necessarily depends on seasonal fluctuations of environmental conditions nor on the emergence of new mutations that increases potential host range of pathogens instead they can be caused by the internal game dynamics of a pathogen population the outcome of the evolutionary r p s game was driven by parameter g in terms of game theory g defines whether the pathogen population mostly benefits from a tie or from a win lose outcome see zhou 2016 in the r p s game analysed here the tie outcome is always 0 whereas the win lose outcome is approximately 1 g our results suggests that selection gives advantages to alternative population compositions depending on the balance between these outcomes if g 1 then 1 g 0 and thus the tie outcome is greater this means that the overall fitness of pathogen population is higher if the game is played between individuals of the same strain in accordance our simulations have shown that in this case system dynamics generates heteroclinic cycles which eventually produces monomorphic populations nowak 2006 if however g 1 1 g 0 indicating that a win lose outcome is greater this is coherent with our results in which trajectories converge towards a polymorphic composition with homogeneous frequency distribution this homogeneous distribution minimizes the probability that the game will be played by two individuals of the same strain finally if g 1 1 g 0 both outcomes are equal in this case heterogeneous polymorphism is maintained by stable limit cycles a possible interpretation is that the limit cycles alternates the dominance of each outcome in terms of epidemiology g describes how inter strain competition affects the superinfected hosts this means that g is likely to vary with host traits since that tolerance to superinfection may be related to host physiology mosquera and adler 1998 cronin et al 2010 portugal et al 2011 mandl et al 2015 irving et al 2021 therefore host traits can modulate pathogen diversity even when different strains have no differential effect to the host this has some interesting implications to the evolution of host pathogen interactions first if hosts tolerate superinfection pathogen diversification may occur even in pathogens considered highly fit to their hosts the reason is that if diversification occurs in pathogen traits that has no differential effect to the host their lineage can be maintained by superinfection second these lineages may have different capacities to explore novel host species through spillover processes mandl et al 2015 then even if novel hosts are unable to sustain the interaction parameter g of the novel host may give opportunity to the emergence of new variants in that host wasik et al 2019 in this sense spillover can be seen as a process by which pathogens explore their repertoire of potential host species this idea suggests that the emergence of infectious diseases in novel host pathogen interactions may actually be the rule rather than the exception in the evolutionary dynamics of pathogenic species we find that superinfection affects reservoir demography for the parameter interval 1 g 2 this is not surprising since that for this interval inter strain competition is lethal for some hosts consequently host death causes small declines in the infected class even though strains have no differential virulence to the reservoir α r p this happens because whenever a rare strain rises in frequency it does it by superinfecting host individuals causing their death then because there is no vertical transmission in our model newborn individuals are rapidly added to the susceptible class maintaining the stability of the overall population density n r whenever the rising strain is strain p 1 these demographic effects on the reservoir matches the spillover pulses studies have shown that replacing infected by susceptible individuals may increase pathogen circulation peel et al 2014 field et al 2015 as noted in plowright et al 2016 increased circulation may cause pathogen shedding to other populations augmenting the chance of spillover this implicates a causal relationship between cohort replenishment and pathogen spillover in our model however that is not the case since replenishment and spillover are correlated process with no direct causality between them in fact both are driven by oscillations in the strain composition associated with the partial lethality of the inter strain competition that is not to say that such a causality does not exist rather it is to point out that the internal dynamics of pathogens may naturally change its potential host range even when the current host pathogen system is considered stable other studies have focused on the role of internal dynamics to the emergence of cyclic outbreaks although not the only relevant factor cross immunity seems to be a key element for the emergence of these cycles andreasen et al 1997 kamo and sasaki 2002 zhang and cao 2014 zhang 2016 cross immunity occurs when infection by one strain confers total or partial host protection against other strains gill and murphy 1977 often in superinfection models cross immunity is inversely proportional to parameter ϵ nowak and may 1994 if ϵ 0 it means that cross immunity is total and thus hosts infected with a given strain becomes immune to infection by another strain as the value of ϵ increases cross immunity decreases and thus infected hosts are susceptible to secondary infections by other strains in the scenario studied here however cyclic outbreaks occurs to the incidental host which is susceptible to the infection by a single strain and thus cross immunity does not play a role in this cycles instead the cycles are caused by oscillations in the frequency of reservoirs infected by different strains the realism of the model analysed here can be enhanced in several ways for example our model only encompasses one reservoir species and one incidental host in nature however host pathogen interactions may involve several other species woolhouse et al 2001 legget et al 2013 in a more complex environment spillover may be followed by spillback events auld et al 2017 one possible problem of this limitation is that since our incidental host is only susceptible to strain p 1 spillback events may cause an additional insertion of strain 1 back to its original host depending on which point of the dynamics this occurs the other strains may be excluded from the reservoir host in such a case strain p 1 may become dominant in the reservoir and pulses would stop furthermore this may occur with other strains and other host species thus it would be interesting to evaluate our results in a more complex host community this can be done by evaluating the reservoir system eqs 1a and 1b coupled with a more complex host community another possibility is to evaluate the result of other game dynamics for example the hawk dove game sigmund and nowak 1999 can be used to study the evolution of mutualistic interactions among strains this can be done by assuming a superinfection network which produces the payoff matrix that describes the hawk dove game as we have shown the internal dynamics of pathogens within reservoir populations may change the risk of spillover with no apparent signatures in the epidemiological dynamics of reservoirs this means that changes in strain composition may occur cryptically in relation to the size of the infected class this suggests that evaluating only the distribution of reservoirs and their seroprevalence may subestimate the probability of pathogen spillover furthermore such changes in frequency composition can occur rapidly since they rely on the standing variation of pathogen population in this paper we have assumed that spillover does not results in host exploitation by the pathogen since that the incidental host cannot self sustain the host pathogen interaction however in terms of evolutionary trajectories the spillover process can represent a window of opportunity for the pathogen to evolve in an alternative fitness landscape this can lead to a further diversification process braga et al 2018 to conclude we emphasize that changes in pathogen frequency distribution due to its internal game dynamics may be a key mechanism underlying the emergence of new host pathogen interactions credit authorship

quantity is the difference between the rate of which individuals that are inserted into the infected class s i β i and the rate at which they are removed γ i then following lion and metz 2018 the

24334,understanding the underlying mechanisms for pathogen spillover is a main quest in epidemiology given the complexity of multi host systems several factors may play a relative role in spillover dynamics a relatively less studied factor is the internal dynamics of pathogens that result from inter strain competition the competitive interactions among strains can cause deterministic changes in the population dynamics of pathogens such changes may affect the potential host range of pathogens influencing the probability of pathogen spillover here our main goal is to show how an evolutionary game played by coexisting strains may induce pulses of pathogen spillover to this end we build a multi host multi strain mean field model in which strains residing in a reservoir host have different capacities to explore an incidental host we modelled inter strain competition as a superinfection network and apply a game theoretical analysis to it the results indicate that game outcome depends on how reservoir hosts deal with the superinfection process if superinfection is lethal results in competitive exclusion or in coinfection our analysis suggests that game outcome can produce cycles in the strain composition that are cryptic in relation to the epidemiological dynamics of reservoirs cycles in strain frequency composition cause small or no effect in the reservoir population this suggests that relying solely on reservoir distribution and prevalence may subestimate the chance of pathogen spillover moreover pulses of spillover can rely on the standing variation of pathogens with no need for the emergence of novel mutations that increases pathogen host range keywords cyclic dominance cross infection emerging infectious diseases multi host pathogens data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction in multihost systems pathogens circulate from one species to another depending on the transmission route offered by each host woolhouse et al 2001 as a consequence disease outbreak in one species can be initiated by pathogens propagules that spill over from one host species to another as in other studies daszak et al 2000 power and mitchell 2004 borremans et al 2019 cross et al 2019 we use the term pathogen spillover as a reference for this process given the complexity involved in multihost systems there are many ecological factors driving events of spillover plowright et al 2017 if the host pathogen interaction produced by the spillover process is not stable natural fluctuations in these ecological drivers may give rise to pulses of pathogen spillover plowright et al 2016 host species that are able to stably sustain pathogen populations are called reservoir species haydon et al 2002 ashford 2003 given the stability of their interactions reservoirs play a key role in promoting spillover events in multi host communities wasik et al 2019 letko et al 2020 in addition many reservoir species seem to sustain high diversity of pathogen strains with no apparent change in the severity of the disease baum et al 2012 van brussel and holmes 2022 a possible reason for this is that different strains may trigger the same immunological response in some hosts mandl et al 2015 another explanation is that reservoirs may be capable of producing a variety of antibody responses that confer host tolerance to a wide range of pathogens roy and kirchner 2000 baum et al 2012 either way the fact that different strains have similar epidemiology in reservoirs does not mean that their capacity to explore alternative hosts are equal morris et al 2019 instead several studies suggest that increasing strain diversity in reservoirs may also increase the chance of spillover dennehy et al 2010 olival et al 2017 brooks et al 2019 letko et al 2020 remien and nuismer 2020 feronato et al 2021 this is because the region that a host occupies in the fitness landscape of a pathogen may vary depending on the pathogen strain smith tsurkan et al 2010 besides being host dependent the fitness landscape of pathogens may also vary with the composition of their own population newton et al 1998 this is because the within interactions among different strains may have alternative outcomes depending on the frequency composition kirkup and riley 2004 andrade domínguez et al 2014 superinfection is one type of inter strain competition in which a secondary strain infects an already infected host nowak and may 1994 after superinfection the outcome of the inter strain competition may be either host death hamid et al 2002 competitive exclusion from the within host environment duncan et al 2018 or strain coexistence leverich et al 2008 except in the case that is lethal to the host superinfection can maintain pathogen diversity in the host population nowak and may 1994 mosquera and adler 1998 if strains have different capacities to explore novel hosts the strain diversity maintained by the process of superinfection may increase the probability of pathogen spillover if that is the case spillover would be facilitated by the internal dynamics of pathogens rather than by fluctuations on the external factors however we are unaware of studies about the role of superinfection to the dynamics of pathogen spillover evolutionary game theory is one way to study the internal dynamics of populations this is because it is centred in scenarios of intraspecific interactions among different phenotypes in a given population nowak and sigmund 2004 depending on how interactions occur within the game evolutionary dynamics yields to alternative population states kerr et al 2002 kirkup and riley 2004 moreover game dynamics may produce deterministic population cycles which maintains population polymorphism in a relatively predictable manner claussen and traulsen 2008 laird 2014 szolnoki et al 2014 in this sense game dynamics may be a mechanism that bridges superinfection dynamics and events of pathogen spillover here our main goal is to show how game dynamics in inter strain interactions can drive pulses of pathogen spillover to this end we build and analyse a set of mean field equations representing the epidemiological dynamics of a multi host multi strain system in which different strains have different capacities to explore other hosts our analysis indicates that if different strains have no differential effects to the reservoir host the game dynamics may become cryptic in relation to the epidemiology of reservoirs large fluctuations in the frequency composition of strains but small or absent fluctuations in the infected class of reservoir see mougi 2012 for an example of cryptic cycles in eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey systems the outcome of this game is mainly defined by whether inter strain competition results in competitive exclusion coinfection or host death then pulses of pathogen spillover emerge whenever the game dynamics produces oscillations in the frequency composition of strains 2 models and analysis here we present and analyse a multi species version of the classical susceptible infected susceptible s i s model brauer et al 2008 the model is composed by a set of ordinary differential equations ode s describing the temporal change in the density of susceptible and infected classes during disease epidemics the term density is used as a reference for the fact that increasing the number of individuals also increases population crowding begon et al 2007 we consider two host species namely a reservoir host and an incidental host ashford 2003 the reservoir host sustains a polymorphic pathogen population composed by a diversity of strains the frequency of each strain in the reservoir population depends on the inter strain competition which we describe as a superinfection evolutionary game we assume that the incidental host cannot stably sustain the epidemics and thus outbreaks are always started by a spillover process only a particular strain is capable of infecting the incidental host consequently the chance of spillover depends on the encounter between individuals in the susceptible class of the incidental host and reservoirs infected with that particular strain the rate at which this encounter occurs is directly proportional to the frequency of that strain in the reservoir then because the superinfection game affects the frequency composition in the pathogen population patterns of spillover depends on the game outcome this section is organized as follows first we describe the epidemiological model in terms of their specific variables and parameters next we show how the superinfection can be described by a competition network and how game dynamics can be derived from this network then we use analytical treatments to derive the game outcomes and point out the conditions required for the emergence of cyclical outbreaks we summarize our results with numerical simulations and their interpretations the full r script used in our numerical analysis can be found in the github repository https github com pbolanhom gdsp 2 1 epidemiological dynamics consider a host community composed by a reservoir host and an incidental host hereafter we use subscripts r and i to denote the variables and parameters of reservoir and incidental hosts respectively let their population density be n r t s r t i r t and n i t s i t i i t where s t and i t are the densities of susceptible and infected classes in their populations we assume that the reservoir host is initially infected with n pathogen strains p 1 n let these strains be contained in the set p p 1 n then let i r p be the population density of reservoirs that are infected with strain p thus the overall density of the infected class of reservoir is the sum of the densities of classes infected by each strain i r p n i r p the incidental host is only susceptible to infection by strain p 1 for both hosts greek letters α β and γ denote the epidemiological parameters for virulence transmission rate and recovery rate respectively assuming that hosts populations grow logistically and transmission is direct transmission depends on the direct contact between individuals the system can be described by the following set of ode s 1a d s r d t b r n r p 1 n γ r p i r p s r d r l r n r p 1 n β r p i r p 1b d i r p d t i r p β r p s r γ r p q p i r q θ p q g θ q p p p 1c d s i d t b i n i γ i i i s i d i l i n i β i i i β r i i r 1 1d d i i d t i i s i β i γ i s i β r i i r 1 where symbol p p reads for all p within set p parameters b and d stands for hosts intrinsic born and death rates respectively l is the density dependent mortality of hosts this parameter reflects the intra specific competition in hosts populations note that both infected and susceptible individuals contribute to the born rate the term b n b s b i which implies that infection does not impairs host reproduction also note that newborn hosts are allocated to the susceptible class the term b n only appears in eqs 1a and 1c indicating that there is no vertical transmission of pathogens γ d l n α γ is the removal rate of the infected classes the parameter β r i is the rate of cross transmission between the hosts note however that cross transmission only occurs from reservoirs to incidental hosts and is thus unidirectional also note that β r i multiplies i r 1 in eqs 1c and 1d which reflects the fact that i i is only susceptible to strain p 1 fig 1 depicts the motif describing the dynamics of model 1 the term q p i r q θ p q g θ q p in eq 1b describes the superinfection process in the reservoir population where index q represents another strain within the set p that is interacting with strain p p the upper limit in this summation term is omitted for simplicity the subscript q p already indicates that the summation is over all the n elements of p parameter θ p q denotes the rate at which strain p superinfects another strain q while θ q p denotes the opposite direction parameter g represents a phenomenological class transfer coefficient this parameter describes how superinfected individuals move across the infected classes i r p the range of this parameter is 0 g 2 and different modes of transference emerge depending on its value interval there are three possibilities if g 1 the superinfectant strain causes the competitive exclusion of the previous strain with no cost for the host in this case class transfer occurs immediately after superinfection and is the classical form of superinfection models nowak and may 1994 in the case that 1 g 2 the quantity of individuals that is removed from the superinfected class is larger than the quantity incremented in the superinfectant class thus for this parameter interval superinfection imposes a mortality cost for hosts a comprehensive study on this type of process can be found in mosquera and adler 1998 the last case occurs when 0 g 1 a g value within this interval means that less individuals leave one class than are incremented in the next this means that some individuals remain coinfected with the two strains after superinfection 2 1 1 the superinfection network we use a network theoretical approach to describe the superinfection dynamics consider a network in which nodes represent different strains and weighted directed links stands for the direction of superinfection for example if there is an arrow departing from node 1 towards node 2 it means that strain p 1 superinfects strain p 2 the weight of these links is denoted by the rate of superinfection θ p q fig 2 depicts an example of a superinfection network mathematically the link structure of any network can be described by its adjacency matrix a the entries of a are the weights of links between connected nodes newman 2004 here the adjacency matrix of the superinfection network is 2a a θ 11 θ 1 n θ n 1 θ n n note that the entries of matrix a are in the form θ p q to get the values of θ q p we simply evaluate the entries of the transposed matrix a t we define the following function for the value of θ p q 2b θ p q β r p ϵ if a link exists from p to q 0 otherwise where parameter ϵ is the rate to which superinfection occurs in relation to primary infections this parameter have the same interpretation as parameter s in the seminal paper of nowak and may 1994 thus if we build the superinfection network as if more virulent strains superinfect less virulent strains and assume that l r γ r p 0 no density dependence and no recovery rate and that b r n r b r constant immigration rate of uninfected individuals eqs 1a and 1b goes back to exactly the same system developed and analysed in nowak and may 1994 2 2 game dynamics in this sub section we apply an evolutionary game analysis to the superinfection network as depicted in the motif of fig 1 the game dynamics in model 1 is part of the dynamics of the infected reservoir class eq 1b thus we start by showing how to evaluate any game dynamics in the superinfection network then we use this approach to analyse a rock paper scissors game and derive its outcome and relationships with pulses of pathogen spillover evolutionary game theory describes the change in the frequency of players or strategies in a given population ray mukherjee and mukherjee 2016 cressman and tao 2014 the players of the superinfection game are the n strains p 1 n that coexist in the reservoir host let f r p t i r p t i r t be the frequency of each strain in the reservoir where i r t p n i r p t then after taking the time derivative of f r p t see appendix a we get the following replicator equation describing the temporal dynamics of frequencies d f r p d t f r p d i r p i r p d t d i r i r d t where the first and second terms within the brackets of the above equation are the per capita growth rate of strain p and the per capita growth rate of the overall reservoir infected class under the assumption of well mixed populations which is an implicit assumption in mean field models morozov and poggiale 2012 these per capita growth rates are equivalent to the fitness of strains and of the overall population fitness mcpeek 2017 respectively we assume that strains have no differential epidemiological parameters to the reservoir host thus let the epidemiological parameters of each strain in the reservoir be for all p p β r p β r α r p α r and γ r p γ r this yields to the following replicator equation 3 d f r p d t f r p i r q p f r q θ p q g θ q p p 1 n f r p q p f r q θ p q g θ q p the entire derivation of eq 3 can be found in appendix a in evolutionary game theory each player receives a payoff for playing the game with a specific opponent biologically this payoff composes the reproductive success of those players nowak 2006 if a strain p plays the superinfection game with another strain q p receives a reproductive value that is a balance between how many infected individuals are incorporated into the class p and how many individuals leave the class p thus the replicator eq 3 indicates that θ p q g θ q p is the payoff coefficient of any strain p playing the game with a given strain q remember that the values of θ p q are the entries of superinfection network adjacency matrix a while the values of θ q p are the entries of a t therefore any game that can be described by the replicator eq 3 have the following payoff matrix 4 p a g a t θ 11 g θ 11 θ 1 n g θ n 1 θ n 1 g θ 1 n θ n n g θ n n where p in eq 4 is a n x n matrix with the payoff coefficients θ p q g θ q p in its entries the entries of each row represents the payoff that a player in the row get for playing the game with a given opponent eq 4 also shows the connection between the superinfection network which have the adjacency matrix a and game dynamics this connection allows us to analyse a variety evolutionary games among strains by drawing their network representation to show this we analyse the rock paper scissors r p s game zhou 2016 a famous game that has relevant biological applications kerr et al 2002 kirkup and riley 2004 szolnoki et al 2014 mark rowland et al 2017 2 2 1 the r p s game the r p s game describes a closed loop of intransitive competition gallien et al 2017 in which rock beats paper paper beats scissor and scissor beats rock to incorporate the r p s game in our model we simply assume an analogous network structure intransitive loop among n 3 strains to the superinfection network this configuration is depicted in fig 3 then we take the adjacency matrix of the network in fig 3 and use eq 4 to calculate the payoff matrix of the game this yields to 5 p 0 θ 12 g θ 31 g θ 12 0 θ 23 θ 31 g θ 23 0 the row entries of matrix 5 denote the costs and benefits of a given strain in each row playing the game against their opponents in each column positive values denote that the player strain receives a benefit for playing against that opponent while negative values denote a cost generally speaking there are two types of contests in this game a tie or a win lose contest zhou 2016 the tie contest occurs when the two players pertain to the same strain because the payoff matrix 5 is hollow the diagonal entries are zero a tie outcome is always zero the win lose outcome of each player is the sum of all other entries of each row except for the diagonal element here this sum is always β r ϵ 1 g selection may give advantage to different population compositions depending on which contest provides a higher payoff whether a higher outcome comes from a tie or a win lose contest depends on the signal of 1 g we discuss the implications of this to our results further in the text 2 2 2 game outcome and its relationship with spillover pulses the frequency composition f r f r 1 f r 2 f r 3 of pathogen strains reaches its equilibrium at f r f ˆ r whenever the superscript ˆ appears in this paper it indicates that the quantity below it is evaluated at the interior equilibrium of model 1 it is known that the r p s game has a unique interior equilibrium that is given by the homogeneous composition f ˆ r 1 3 1 3 1 3 nowak 2006 cressman and tao 2014 zhou 2016 here f ˆ r is always stable which means that if the initial frequency composition is exactly f ˆ r the system remains at its interior equilibrium if however the initial composition is heterogeneous f r p f r q f r p 0 p system dynamics depends on the asymptotic stability of f ˆ r following nowak 2006 the asymptotic stability and thus the game outcome can be evaluated by analysing the signal of the determinant det p of the payoff matrix 5 6b det p θ 12 θ 23 θ 31 1 g 3 ϵ β r 3 1 g 3 note that because parameters ϵ and β r must be positive numbers the signal of det p depends only on the value of parameter g if 0 g 1 det p is positive indicating that the interior equilibrium f ˆ r is asymptotically stable this means that the trajectories of the replicator system 3 oscillate around the interior equilibrium until they converge to a stable state at f ˆ r bottom row of fig 4a and fig 4b in the case that g 1 det p 0 and thus f ˆ r is asymptotically unstable in this case the replicator dynamics will give rise to stable limit cycles middle row of fig 4a and fig 4b under the g 1 scenario the superinfection term vanishes from the dynamics of the overall infected class i r the term θ p q g θ q p vanishes see eq a 5 in appendix a as a consequence the strain dynamics becomes decoupled from the overall infected class of reservoirs hence while the game dynamics produces large oscillations in the strain composition there is no signature of these oscillations on the dynamics of i r we call these cryptic cycles as a reference to the cryptic cycles in the eco evolutionary dynamics of predator prey interactions in which cycles in predator population produce almost no change in the population dynamics of preys mougi 2012 kinnison et al 2015 if however g falls within the interval 1 g 2 the determinant det p is negative as in the previous case a negative determinants also indicates that the interior equilibrium is asymptotically unstable however the oscillations that emerge from system dynamics are non periodic and unstable the trajectories starting at any non zero heterogeneous composition oscillate around f ˆ r in periods that continuously increases top row of fig 4a and fig 4b this type of dynamical behaviour is called heteroclinic cycles and is a known result in superinfection dynamics nowak and may 1994 theoretically as noted in may and leonard 2003 heteroclinic cycles never lead to the total extinction of either one or two players of the r p s game even for the case in which t the frequency of the non dominant players will never reach zero without an arbitrary decision or a rounding error nowak 2006 vandermeer 2011 however because these frequencies represent biological populations it is plausible to expect lower limits of frequencies in which that population is driven to extinction e g allee effects environmental fluctuations for this reason the biological interpretation of the heteroclinic cycles in fig 4 is that they eventually lead to monomorphic pathogen populations at the interior equilibrium the density of the infected class of the incidental host is 7 i ˆ i s ˆ i s ˆ i β i l i d i α i γ i d i α i γ i s ˆ i β i l i 2 4 l i s ˆ i β r i i r f r 1 2 l i in the appendix b we show the calculation of eq 7 and that it is an increasing function of f r 1 the incidental host may or may not stably sustain the epidemics in absence of the reservoir this depends on the value of the reproductive ratio of the pathogen in the incidental host r 0 i 8 r 0 i β i s ˆ i γ i the derivation of r 0 i follows lion and metz 2018 and can be found in appendix c r 0 i measures how many secondary infections is produced by each infected individual the condition for stable maintenance of epidemics requires that r 0 i 1 here we set our parameter values so that r 0 i 1 therefore stable epidemics on the incidental host is necessarily maintained by spillover from reservoirs this means that if the equilibrium composition f ˆ r is not reached the density of the infected class of the incidental host i i follows the oscillatory trajectory of the replicator dynamics this can be seen in fig 4c note how the density of infected incidental hosts solid red lines in column c abruptly increases following the increases in f r 1 purple lines in column b this sudden increases are analogous to pulses of spillover since they produce outbreaks that are started and maintained by the reservoir population power and mitchell 2004 because oscillations in the frequency composition are caused by the shape of the payoff matrix game dynamics has an indirect causal effect in these pulses of pathogen spillover 3 discussion given the complexity of epidemiological systems containing multiple host species several factors can be evoked in order to study causal pathways involved in spillover events here we have shown that pulses of pathogen spillover may be a consequence of oscillations in the frequency composition of pathogen strains these oscillations are deterministic and happens as the outcome of an evolutionary r p s game played by different strains that coexist in a reservoir population our analysis suggests that pulses of spillover does not necessarily depends on seasonal fluctuations of environmental conditions nor on the emergence of new mutations that increases potential host range of pathogens instead they can be caused by the internal game dynamics of a pathogen population the outcome of the evolutionary r p s game was driven by parameter g in terms of game theory g defines whether the pathogen population mostly benefits from a tie or from a win lose outcome see zhou 2016 in the r p s game analysed here the tie outcome is always 0 whereas the win lose outcome is approximately 1 g our results suggests that selection gives advantages to alternative population compositions depending on the balance between these outcomes if g 1 then 1 g 0 and thus the tie outcome is greater this means that the overall fitness of pathogen population is higher if the game is played between individuals of the same strain in accordance our simulations have shown that in this case system dynamics generates heteroclinic cycles which eventually produces monomorphic populations nowak 2006 if however g 1 1 g 0 indicating that a win lose outcome is greater this is coherent with our results in which trajectories converge towards a polymorphic composition with homogeneous frequency distribution this homogeneous distribution minimizes the probability that the game will be played by two individuals of the same strain finally if g 1 1 g 0 both outcomes are equal in this case heterogeneous polymorphism is maintained by stable limit cycles a possible interpretation is that the limit cycles alternates the dominance of each outcome in terms of epidemiology g describes how inter strain competition affects the superinfected hosts this means that g is likely to vary with host traits since that tolerance to superinfection may be related to host physiology mosquera and adler 1998 cronin et al 2010 portugal et al 2011 mandl et al 2015 irving et al 2021 therefore host traits can modulate pathogen diversity even when different strains have no differential effect to the host this has some interesting implications to the evolution of host pathogen interactions first if hosts tolerate superinfection pathogen diversification may occur even in pathogens considered highly fit to their hosts the reason is that if diversification occurs in pathogen traits that has no differential effect to the host their lineage can be maintained by superinfection second these lineages may have different capacities to explore novel host species through spillover processes mandl et al 2015 then even if novel hosts are unable to sustain the interaction parameter g of the novel host may give opportunity to the emergence of new variants in that host wasik et al 2019 in this sense spillover can be seen as a process by which pathogens explore their repertoire of potential host species this idea suggests that the emergence of infectious diseases in novel host pathogen interactions may actually be the rule rather than the exception in the evolutionary dynamics of pathogenic species we find that superinfection affects reservoir demography for the parameter interval 1 g 2 this is not surprising since that for this interval inter strain competition is lethal for some hosts consequently host death causes small declines in the infected class even though strains have no differential virulence to the reservoir α r p this happens because whenever a rare strain rises in frequency it does it by superinfecting host individuals causing their death then because there is no vertical transmission in our model newborn individuals are rapidly added to the susceptible class maintaining the stability of the overall population density n r whenever the rising strain is strain p 1 these demographic effects on the reservoir matches the spillover pulses studies have shown that replacing infected by susceptible individuals may increase pathogen circulation peel et al 2014 field et al 2015 as noted in plowright et al 2016 increased circulation may cause pathogen shedding to other populations augmenting the chance of spillover this implicates a causal relationship between cohort replenishment and pathogen spillover in our model however that is not the case since replenishment and spillover are correlated process with no direct causality between them in fact both are driven by oscillations in the strain composition associated with the partial lethality of the inter strain competition that is not to say that such a causality does not exist rather it is to point out that the internal dynamics of pathogens may naturally change its potential host range even when the current host pathogen system is considered stable other studies have focused on the role of internal dynamics to the emergence of cyclic outbreaks although not the only relevant factor cross immunity seems to be a key element for the emergence of these cycles andreasen et al 1997 kamo and sasaki 2002 zhang and cao 2014 zhang 2016 cross immunity occurs when infection by one strain confers total or partial host protection against other strains gill and murphy 1977 often in superinfection models cross immunity is inversely proportional to parameter ϵ nowak and may 1994 if ϵ 0 it means that cross immunity is total and thus hosts infected with a given strain becomes immune to infection by another strain as the value of ϵ increases cross immunity decreases and thus infected hosts are susceptible to secondary infections by other strains in the scenario studied here however cyclic outbreaks occurs to the incidental host which is susceptible to the infection by a single strain and thus cross immunity does not play a role in this cycles instead the cycles are caused by oscillations in the frequency of reservoirs infected by different strains the realism of the model analysed here can be enhanced in several ways for example our model only encompasses one reservoir species and one incidental host in nature however host pathogen interactions may involve several other species woolhouse et al 2001 legget et al 2013 in a more complex environment spillover may be followed by spillback events auld et al 2017 one possible problem of this limitation is that since our incidental host is only susceptible to strain p 1 spillback events may cause an additional insertion of strain 1 back to its original host depending on which point of the dynamics this occurs the other strains may be excluded from the reservoir host in such a case strain p 1 may become dominant in the reservoir and pulses would stop furthermore this may occur with other strains and other host species thus it would be interesting to evaluate our results in a more complex host community this can be done by evaluating the reservoir system eqs 1a and 1b coupled with a more complex host community another possibility is to evaluate the result of other game dynamics for example the hawk dove game sigmund and nowak 1999 can be used to study the evolution of mutualistic interactions among strains this can be done by assuming a superinfection network which produces the payoff matrix that describes the hawk dove game as we have shown the internal dynamics of pathogens within reservoir populations may change the risk of spillover with no apparent signatures in the epidemiological dynamics of reservoirs this means that changes in strain composition may occur cryptically in relation to the size of the infected class this suggests that evaluating only the distribution of reservoirs and their seroprevalence may subestimate the probability of pathogen spillover furthermore such changes in frequency composition can occur rapidly since they rely on the standing variation of pathogen population in this paper we have assumed that spillover does not results in host exploitation by the pathogen since that the incidental host cannot self sustain the host pathogen interaction however in terms of evolutionary trajectories the spillover process can represent a window of opportunity for the pathogen to evolve in an alternative fitness landscape this can lead to a further diversification process braga et al 2018 to conclude we emphasize that changes in pathogen frequency distribution due to its internal game dynamics may be a key mechanism underlying the emergence of new host pathogen interactions credit authorship

where i r t p 1 n i r p t is the overall density of the infected class in the reservoir population to evaluate the temporal dynamics of f r p t we apply the quotient rule from calculus which yields to

equation depicted in eq 3 appendix b the equilibrium density of the infected class of the incidental host population assuming that reservoir variables are constant we can write the following model for the incidental host b 1 d s i d t b i n i γ i i i s i d i l i n i β i i i β r i i r 1 b 2 d i i d t i i s i β i d i l i n i α i γ i s i β r i i r 1 at the equilibrium the per capita growth rate of i i must be zero thus setting d i i i i d t 0 and rearranging the terms leads to the following second degree polynomial b 3 d i i i i d t s i β i d i l i n i α i γ i s i i i β r i i r 1 0 s i β i d i l i

solve b 3 for i i yields to b 4 i i s i β i l i d i α i γ i d i α i γ i s i β i l i 2 4 l i s i β r i i r f r 1 2 l i note that eq b 4 has two versions one in which the square root term is negative and one in which it is positive our numerical simulations indicates that the interior equilibrium i ˆ r is the positive version b 5 i ˆ i s ˆ i f r 1 s ˆ i β i l i d i α i γ i d i α i γ i s ˆ i β i l

s ˆ i f r 1 for this reason it is not clear from eq b 5 how i ˆ i varies as a function of f r 1 fig b 1 shows a numerical analysis to understand how i ˆ i varies with f r 1 for a range of transmission rates note that for all the evaluated values of β i i ˆ i is an increasing function of f r 1 appendix c deriving the reproductive ratio in eq 8 the reproductive ratio r 0 i can be derived from the per capita growth rate d i i i i d t lion and metz 2018 the reproductive ratio of pathogens is a quantity used to describe how many individuals is infected by each already infected individual within a given population eq 1d incorporates the infections caused by the reservoir host in this sense in order to do the derivation we first need to set the cross infection term to zero β r i i r 1 0 this leads to c 1 d i i i i d t s i β i d i l i n i α i γ i s i β i γ i now the above quantity describes the per capita growth rate of the incidental host in absence of the reservoir population this quantity is the difference between the rate of which individuals that are inserted into the infected class s i β i and the rate at which they are removed γ i then following lion and metz 2018 the reproductive ratio can be written as the ratio between these terms c 2 r 0 i s i β i γ i
