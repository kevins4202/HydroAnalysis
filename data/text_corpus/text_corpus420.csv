2100,in this study a method of aquifer hydrologic property estimation incorporating the deep learning method was developed to improve the estimation efficiency of a process based model based on groundwater level fluctuation glf patterns as a reference study a data driven method suggested by jeong et al 2020 was considered the uncertainty of the glf patterns resulting from different yearly patterns of precipitation which were considered as noise in the previous study was effectively discarded using the newly proposed method of applying the conditional variational autoencoder cvae the cvae was used to acquire the specific glf patterns under certain identical precipitation patterns for all the monitoring stations the data driven hydrologic property estimation model was developed to predict two hydrologic parameters ρ and k of the process based model using the generated glf patterns from the cvae network as the input variables the actual glf and precipitation data that were acquired from nationwide groundwater monitoring stations in south korea were applied to validate the developed method it was found that the estimated and target hydrologic properties were highly correlated correlation coefficients cc 0 9833 and 0 9589 for ρ and k respectively which significantly improved the results when compared to the previous study cc 0 7207 and 0 8663 for α n and k respectively consequently the developed model can contribute to a more accurate hydrologic property estimation of aquifers additionally it can facilitate efficient groundwater development planning since the manual fitting of the process based model by an expert is not required keywords hydrologic property estimation data driven estimation model groundwater level fluctuation pattern precipitation pattern conditional variational autoencoder data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaluation of the hydrological characteristics of an aquifer is essential for understanding the groundwater system which can provide useful insights for groundwater management and conservation taylor and alley 2001 for example the recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity are applied to assess the efficiency of aquifer development chatterjee and ray 2014 they are used for groundwater vulnerability assessments especially when applied to the drastic method aller et al 1987 al rawabdeh et al 2013 el assar et al 2016 masoud and el osta 2016 hydrologic properties differ due to the diversity of the geologic materials consisting of aquifers and uncertainty which leads to difficulty in the quantitative evaluation of the hydrologic properties to understand the aquifer properties various methods including field tests and mathematical modeling have been applied park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 wen et al 2010 klepikova et al 2016 ola et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 ige et al 2018 jeong et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 one of the common methods of hydrologic property estimation is based on the pumping test which evaluates the well performance by measuring the groundwater level gl drawdown and recovery pattern during groundwater pumping from a well additionally various field tests such as slug constant head and push pull tests have been conducted campbell et al 1990 istok et al 1997 hayashi and quinton 2004 kazushi and kouta 2008 quinn et al 2011 fabbri et al 2012 ola et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 paradis et al 2018 based on these field test methods the characteristics of an aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity permeability coefficient or effective porosity have been evaluated by incorporating various process based modeling of the gl responses and geological information of the aquifer for multiple testing wells however even in the same aquifer the evaluated results from the field tests can differ depending on the compliance to the test guidelines e g the application of pumping equipment with inappropriate horsepower or the expert handling of the test equipment and the analysis of the results in addition case by case modeling is required for property estimation for all pumping wells which is highly labor intensive and can result in subjective estimations another approach time series gl monitoring has been commonly applied to evaluate the groundwater behavior in an aquifer park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 the pattern of gl fluctuation glf in response to the precipitation pattern provides principal information for aquifer hydraulics such as the recharge rate rasmussen and andreasen 1959 healy and cook 2002 discharge wu et al 2021 and hydraulic conductivity park et al 2011 the majority of the methods are based on mathematical modeling of the time series glf data and various process based models delineating groundwater flow in an aquifer have been developed park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 in the study of park and parker 2008 the hydrologic properties relevant to hydraulic conductivity and the recharge rate were evaluated based on the closed form of a mathematical model governing glf variations in response to precipitation pp model the pp model was supplemented by jeong and park 2017 jp model where delayed recharge flux and unsaturated zone drainage variation according to the season were additionally considered by applying the precipitation as the function of time instead of a constant value however the application of these process based methods requires a sufficient theoretical background in mathematical equations and model optimization furthermore similar to the problem of the pumping test it requires a case by case model fitting for the glf pattern to monitor data recently the data driven approach has been widely applied as an alternative method to a process based model using accumulated groundwater monitoring data jeong and park 2019 mirarabi et al 2019 kanyama et al 2021 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 the data driven model is useful for defining the statistical relationship between various monitored data relevant to the groundwater system and the relational information plays multiple roles in interpreting groundwater behavior many data driven models have been used for gl modeling based on exogenous influencing factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration for example daliakopoulos et al 2005 developed an artificial neural network ann based model to estimate the glf patterns over 18 months in the messara valley greece using monthly precipitation temperature and discharge time series data as the input variables also sahoo et al 2017 estimated the gl for two aquifer systems high plains and mississippi river valley using a hybrid ann model with various exogenous influencing factors precipitation average temperature and monthly stream discharge as input variables however most of the studies applying the data driven method have been focused on gl modeling while estimation of the aquifer hydrologic properties has been rarely studied thus further studies need to be implemented to validate the expandability of the data driven method and to develop an effective method for obtaining insights into the field of groundwater science during a study estimating aquifer hydrologic properties based on data driven models jeong et al 2020 developed a model that can estimate the parameters related to hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate using the glf pattern the parameters of the newly observed glf pattern were evaluated by comparing data with glf patterns of known hydrologic properties in particular jeong et al 2020 proposed an efficient method for extracting meaningful data scientific features of the glf patterns to improve the estimation performance the extracted features were applied as an input variable of the regression models that can estimate hydrologic properties however jeong et al 2020 overlooked the importance of precipitation patterns affecting glf patterns the different yearly precipitation patterns cause statistical inconsistency in the extracted features of glf patterns even in the same aquifer which results in a deterioration of the model s estimation performance consequently this current study proposes a more robust feature extraction method to overcome the disadvantages of the method suggested by jeong et al 2020 to reduce the estimation uncertainty caused by different precipitation patterns a method applying the conditional variable autoencoder cvae network is proposed to generate glf patterns under identical precipitation patterns for all monitoring stations based on this process hydrologic property estimation can be implemented solely based on glf patterns regardless of different precipitation patterns according to the observatory year two regression models that efficiently estimate the recharge to precipitation ratio and the coefficient of gl recession rate of the jp model have been developed where the target properties of the regression model are set by optimizing the jp model to the actual glf data for validation of the proposed method ten years of actual gl and precipitation time series data were acquired from 31 monitoring stations and the data were provided by the national groundwater information management and service center gims and automated synoptic observing system asos of the korea meteorological administration kma in south korea 2 methodology 2 1 limitations of the previous method the study of jeong et al 2020 proposed an efficient regression model to directly estimate the hydrologic properties from the glf pattern where the low dimensional features of the glf patterns are extracted using the denoising autoencoder dae and applied as the explanatory variables of the model to improve the accuracy of the estimation model however the extracted features of the glf patterns that are solely based on the dae are highly affected by the precipitation pattern which means that the hydrologic properties of every year can be different even when the gl data is acquired from the same monitoring station fig 1 shows the limitation of the previous study using the synthetic gl data that were generated by the method suggested by park and parker 2008 i e the pp model fig 1 a shows three cases where the glf patterns black solid lines that were synthesized under identical hydrogeological conditions i e k 0 05 for all cases but correspond to different precipitation patterns started at a different time blue bars precipitation occurred on days 100 170 and 240 for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the extracted low dimensional features two dimension based on the dae for the synthesized glf pattern 365 dimension are shown in fig 1 b as shown in the figure the low dimensional features of the glf patterns were significantly separated in the data space even though the glf patterns were generated with identical hydrologic properties and this is caused by different precipitation patterns therefore to extract the low dimensional features of the gl while solely accommodating the hydrologic property of the aquifer a method to exclude the effect of the precipitation pattern is necessary and this is conducted by setting a unified precipitation pattern for the gl data of all the monitoring stations in this study the cvae was applied to extract the refined low dimensional features regardless of the different precipitation patterns according to the observatory year which led to improving the hydrologic property estimation model the detailed method for using the cvae is explained in the following section 2 2 proposed method in this study the method proposed in this study mainly consisted of two processes p1 and p2 in fig 2 the regression model for estimating the hydrologic parameters of the aquifer for all the possible glf patterns constrained with a specific precipitation pattern p in fig 2 was constructed in the first process i e p1 to construct the regression model all possible hydrologic parameters of the jp model and the low dimensional features of the corresponding glf which were extracted using dae were used as the response and explanatory variables respectively this manuscript provides a summarized theoretical background of the jp model below and please refer to jeong and park 2017 for more information in the second process p2 the generation of a new glf pattern conditioned to a precipitation pattern p in p1 was proposed using the cvae network this process addresses the limitations of the previous method and minimizes the influence of different precipitation patterns on the annual glf of each monitoring station for cvae network training the annual glf patterns for ten years in each region a total of 31 monitoring stations were used as the input and target variables of the model where the corresponding precipitation patterns were applied as the conditioning variables based on the trained cvae network the annual glf pattern for the target monitoring station can be newly generated under fixed precipitation conditions p which was transformed to the low dimensional features two dimension through the dae in the p1 process then the hydrologic properties for the target monitoring station were calculated by the regression model using the low dimensional features as the input variable more detailed information on the main process for developing the estimation model is detailed in the following section which is composed of 1 generating the synthetic glf patterns under a specific precipitation pattern using the jp model 2 low dimensional feature extraction for the generated synthetic glf patterns using the dae model 3 applying the cvae network for the conditioning of a specific precipitation pattern p to the glf pattern observed at the target monitoring station 4 constructing the regression model for estimating the hydrologic properties of the target monitoring station 2 2 1 generating synthetic groundwater level fluctuation patterns using a jp model the jp model is a process based glf pattern estimation model based on precipitation and combinations of the four parameters α t 1 inversely related to the residence time of the infiltrated water in the unsaturated zone s y specific yield ρ the recharge to precipitation ratio according to the fillable porosity sophocleus 1991 and k t 1 the rate coefficient related to gl recession for the saturated zone proposed by jeong and park 2017 parameters of α and s y are related to the flux of the groundwater which can vary according to the hydrologic condition of the unsaturated zone uz where a large α and s y values represent a dominant advective recharge flux of the infiltrated water and a slow gl recession within the uz respectively in particular the influences of α and s y are dominant during the pre and post storm periods in south korea jeong and park 2017 meanwhile ρ and k are directly related to the amount of recharge flux and rate of gl recession of the saturated zone respectively large ρ and k values indicate the favorable potential for recharge and groundwater advection in the aquifer and these parameters show stronger influences compared to the parameters of α and s y regardless of the climatic period jeong and park 2017 therefore the two hydrologic parameters ρ and k of the jp model were considered to be the main factors affecting the variation in the glf patterns to construct a network that could explain more diverse glf patterns a data generation process was conducted to simulate all the possible synthetic glf patterns based on the jp model before performing data generation the range of the two hydrologic parameters was determined by comparing the actual glf patterns with the fitted glf patterns using the jp model thereafter synthetic glf patterns that could be simulated under the specific precipitation conditions p were generated by the jp model using all the possible combinations of the hydrologic properties within the determined range of each parameter 2 2 2 feature extraction of the synthetic groundwater level fluctuation patterns using the denoising autoencoder in general the prediction performance of the regression model highly depends on the dimensionality of the input variables kwak et al 2008 in this aspect the high dimensionality of the gl data as the input variable can deteriorate the hydrologic property estimation quality of the model therefore an algorithm that is more effective at extracting the low dimensional features of the gl data might be beneficial for improving the estimation performance of the regression model the dae a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm can be a countermeasure to effectively reduce the dimension of the data and conserve its data scientific information the two dimensional data space containing the information of the high dimensional glf pattern was constructed based on the dae to improve the representability of the synthetic gl data of the actual glf patterns an infinitesimal amount of gaussian random noise was included by mimicking the actual fluctuations fig 3 shows the learning network of the dae for m th sample data having n dimensions the dae network consisted of two symmetrical ann structures i e encoder and decoder in fig 3 the network could compress the input variable by setting the number of neurons in the hidden layer to be smaller than the input layer and the low dimensional features could be extracted from the neck of the network c in fig 3 because of the nonlinear symmetric network structure it is known that dae shows superior performance in the feature extraction of complex high dimensional data when compared to other existing methods e g principal component analysis and self organizing map hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 in this study tied weights w i in fig 3 were applied to improve the computational efficiency in the learning process and an adam optimization algorithm using root mean squared error rmse as a loss function was applied to optimize the weights the theoretical details including the equation in the dae are not included in this study for full details of the dae methods please see vincent et al 2008 2 2 3 precipitation conditioning based on the conditional variational autoencoder models the main objective of this section is to remove the uncertainty caused by different annual precipitation patterns and to obtain precise estimation results by generating unified glf patterns for each monitoring station the cvae was used to generate glf patterns to minimize the influence of yearly precipitation patterns in the training process of the cvae the relationship between the input and conditioning variables is trained and accordingly variations in the input variable that may occur under specific conditioning variables can be estimated the main structure of the cvae used in this study consisted of two symmetric networks encoder and decoder that were connected to train the probability distribution of the input variables the structure of the network is shown in fig 4 the encoder of the network receives the input variable x and generates a latent vector z while the decoder plays the role of reconstructing x using z the conditioning layer is placed beside the encoding layer and latent vector therefore the relationship between the input and conditioning variables can be trained through the repeated encoding feature extraction and decoding data reconstruction processes of the network in this study gl and precipitation data with regional labels were used as the input and conditioning variables of the cvae model respectively accordingly the interrelation between the glf and precipitation patterns of each monitoring station was trained through the learning process and new glf patterns were generated using the decoder in particular in the data generation process glf patterns can be generated where the influence of yearly precipitation is excluded by assigning p as the conditioning variable for all corresponding input variables in the cvae network training an adam optimization algorithm using kullback leilber divergence and cross entropy as a loss function kullback and leibler 1951 kingma and ba 2015 was applied to optimize the weights all the networks using the dae and cvae of sections 2 2 2 2 2 3 were coded using python 3 9 van rossum and drake 2009 and pytorch 1 12 1 paszke et al 2019 and early stopping was applied to avoid overfitting and improve computational efficiency in the learning process the hardware used for training and estimation was equipped with an intel xeon 2 69 ghz cpu 48 cores and two sockets 128 gb memory and a microsoft windows 10 operating system 2 2 4 construction of the hydrologic property estimation model the regression model for estimating the two hydrologic properties ρ and k based on the glf patterns was constructed using the data acquired in sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 to train the regression model the low dimensional features of the synthetic glf patterns that were generated under specific precipitation conditions p section 2 2 1 2 2 2 and the corresponding jp model parameters ρ and k were used as the input and target variables respectively in this study a regression tree was used to develop the estimation model breiman et al 1984 provide a more theoretical background on the regression tree to estimate the hydrologic properties for the location of interest a new glf pattern for the location was generated by the cvae using the same precipitation p and was subsequently applied to the trained dae to extract the low dimensional features next the extracted glf features were applied to the trained regression model as input variables to estimate the hydrologic properties the hydrologic parameters estimated using the developed regression model were compared to the hydrologic properties optimized by the jp model fitting where the correlation coefficient cc between two values was evaluated to validate the performance of the developed regression model 3 data acquisition and preprocessing 3 1 data acquisition all the gl data which were applied to the proposed method were obtained from the gims www gims go kr in south korea the gims is an observation network system that is operated to identify and manage the status and variational trends in the gl and water quality a total of 668 monitoring stations have been in operation since 1995 for automatic gl monitoring in addition the precipitation data were obtained from the weather observing station corresponding to the location of each gl monitoring station and all data were acquired from the asos of the kma https www weather go kr the daily averaged gl and precipitation monitoring data which were obtained for 10 years at a total of 31 monitoring stations were used for model implementation the applied monitoring stations gl and precipitation for this study are indicated in fig 5 a the aquifers in south korea are mainly composed of unconsolidated sediment porous volcanic rock semi consolidated sedimentary rock non porous volcanic rock intrusive igneous rock clastic sedimentary rock limestone and metamorphic rock as shown in fig 5 b with intrusive igneous rock being predominant in south korea covering 19 of the total area lee et al 2018 the dominant aquifers of the country located in low relief mountainous areas are mainly composed of crystallized bedrock igneous and metamorphic rock the groundwater flow of which is limited by the lateral extension from the connected fractures lee and kwon 2016 the shallow aquifer overlays the bedrock aquifer and consists of unconsolidated sediment the thickness of the unconsolidated sediments which affects the recharge process of the infiltrated water from precipitation ranges from 2 to 30 m from the surface and the depth of the gl ranges from 1 to 22 m lee et al 2007 the glf pattern of the aquifer is an interaction concomitant with the hydro physical characteristics according to the composition of the deep and shallow aquifers which provides information on aquifer characteristics the majority of the deep and shallow aquifers showed 0 8 m of the range of annual glf the aquifers showing 1 5 2 0 m range are most common for both aquifer types 19 1 and 21 6 for the deep and shallow aquifer respectively table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 0 01 to 500 m day in south korea lee et al 2018 which varies significantly with respect to the hydrogeologic units composing the aquifer the annual precipitation in south korea ranges from 1 000 to 1 400 mm by region and more than half of the annual precipitation is concentrated during the wet season from june to august in addition the precipitation from december to february is less than 10 of the total annual precipitation and 5 15 of annual precipitation is recharged into the aquifer krc 2019 previous studies on the relationship between precipitation and the amount of groundwater have shown a high seasonal correlation between precipitation and glf patterns yang and ahn 2008 kim et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 lee et al 2019 3 2 data preprocessing the data acquired from the gims included outliers caused by various unexpected factors e g monitoring equipment error and abnormal aquifer system changes which might result in degradation of the reliability of the modeling results without preprocessing of the raw monitoring data in this study several preprocessing techniques were applied to the raw data to minimize the influence of outliers on the results in south korea precipitation rarely occurs during the period from december to january and the recharge flux is relatively reduced due to the near surface soil freeze luo et al 2002 since the analysis of the glf pattern with the precipitation was the key aspect of this study the gl data from the period february november were selectively used to model implementation which is beneficial for reducing the dimension of the feature and improving the performance of the data driven model in addition the outliers included in the gl data were preprocessed using the moving average outlier detection method and any detected outliers were replaced based on linear interpolation a year of gl data including a long consecutive missing period more than 30 d in a year was excluded from the analysis and reconstruction using linear interpolation was conducted for the other case less than 30 d in a year some missing precipitation data were observed and the corresponding values were replaced with zero in addition gl data corrupted by artificial activity e g groundwater pumping were not considered in this study which can deteriorate the understanding of the natural process of aquifer characteristics to improve the training performance of the developed data driven model all the applied data were normalized to a range of 0 to 1 preventing the trained model from being biased toward the input data of having a relatively larger value for the format of the regional label one hot encoding was applied to the 31 monitoring stations 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic groundwater level data generation using the jp model before generating the synthetic glf pattern the range of the two hydrologic parameters of the jp model ρ and k was determined by optimization of the jp model to all the actual glf patterns in south korea the hydrologic parameter was estimated using 310 annual gl data points 10 years for 31 monitoring stations examples of the fitting results are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the simulated gl reasonably represents the actual gl data the range of the hydrologic parameters was determined by setting a 10 margin to the estimated values to consider estimation errors that may occur during the fitting process and to sufficiently cover the various aquifer characteristics as a result the minimum and maximum values of ρ were evaluated as 0 1 and 20 and the values of k were determined to be 0 01 and 2 the minimum and maximum values of each hydrologic parameter were divided into equal intervals 0 1 and 0 01 for ρ and k respectively therefore 40 000 combinations of the hydrologic parameters were obtained that could be used as the input variable of the jp model then the synthetic glf patterns were generated using all the combinations of the hydrologic parameters with conditioning to a specific precipitation pattern p an example of the generated glf patterns for a specific precipitation pattern is shown in fig 7 where fig 7 a shows the various glf patterns corresponding to different combinations of hydrologic parameters and fig 7 b is the applied precipitation pattern for the synthetic glf data generation the two hydrologic parameters are linked by a complex formula and affect each other in the process of generating the glf pattern but ρ dominantly affects the groundwater recharge rate and k is generally related to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer jeong and park 2017 therefore as shown in fig 7 a the rate of gl rising was relatively high when the value of ρ was large blue solid line when compared to a small ρ value red solid line moreover a large value of k generated a rapid descending pattern in the gl the degree of the slope of the decreasing gl corresponded to a large k value 0 13 and was significantly bigger than that which corresponded to a small k value 0 01 4 2 feature extraction results for the synthetic groundwater level data based on the denoising autoencoder the low dimensional features of the synthetic glf patterns were extracted based on the simple dae network with a single hidden layer the input layer of the constructed dae network layer i in fig 3 consisted of the same number of neurons as the input data dimension n gl 120 the number of neurons for the hidden layer and compressed layer h 1 and c respectively in fig 3 was 60 and 20 respectively and all the layers were connected using the exponential linear unit activation function to express the features more intuitively two dimensional visualization was conducted by applying the kernel principal component analysis technique to the data that were extracted from layer c of the dae network the result of the visualization is shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the values of the 1 st and 2 nd features the projected values of the glf pattern within two dimensional data space got smaller with an increasing value of k where the slope of the declined gl was steeper with a higher value of k furthermore the values of the 1 st and 2 nd features increased as the values of ρ were larger it is also shown that the value of ρ affected the maximum level of the gl and did not affect the slope of the glf when compared to the value of k the results indicate that the extracted low dimensional features from the dae network appropriately discriminated the various patterns of the glf and described the corresponding hydrologic properties which indicates the superior feasibility of the developed dae network for extracting the specific low dimensional features of the glf patterns 4 3 groundwater level fluctuation pattern reconstruction based on the conditional variational autoencoder a cvae network with two hidden layers fig 4 was constructed to acquire the glf patterns under specific precipitation conditions p where the gl n gl 300 and the precipitation n p 300 were used as the input variables and the 31 labels n l 31 indicating the region from 1 to 31 were used as the conditioning variables for the cvae network training in addition the number of neurons in the hidden layers was set smaller than that of the input layer to extract the low dimensional informative features of the input gl data each hidden layer h 1 and h 2 had 200 neurons and 100 neurons respectively and the number of neurons in the latent vector z was set to 50 where the number of neurons for each layer was decided by the trial and error method all the layers were connected by the leaky relu activation function also the training and testing dataset ratio was set to 9 1 and at least a year of gl data was acquired from all monitoring stations and included in the testing dataset to validate the cvae for all the stations the examples of the glf pattern reconstruction results the output results of the trained cvae network for the actual precipitation patterns based on the trained model are shown in fig 9 the validation results for the two monitoring stations are represented in the figure and the results for the rest of the monitoring stations are provided in supplementary material i the quantitative performance validation for the results was conducted by evaluating the cc and rmse between the actual glf pattern blue dots in fig 9 and the generated glf pattern red solid line in fig 9 the results of which for each monitoring station are shown in table 2 the mean values of the cc and rmse for all the testing data were 0 8425 and 0 0293 m respectively the high correlation and the low differences between the actual and estimated gls indicate that the constructed cvae network can reasonably express the relationship between the gl and precipitation patterns for each region the glf pattern reconstruction results under the specific precipitation pattern p at a certain monitoring station are exemplified in fig 10 when comparing fig 10 a and fig 10 b the reconstructed glf patterns from the trained cvae network show unified patterns over the three years based on the trained cvae network the glf patterns of each region were generated under the specific precipitation pattern p by assigning the same precipitation patterns for all the gl monitoring stations the uncertainty of the low dimensional features of the gl pattern which is caused by the influence of different yearly precipitation patterns can be minimized the effect of precipitation conditioning of the cvae network on uncertainty minimization for the reconstructed glf pattern was additionally validated in the low dimensional feature space because the low dimensional feature was applied to develop the hydrologic property estimation model the purpose of this study for the validation the mean of the pair wise distance between the low dimensional feature values before and after applying the cvae network for each monitoring station was compared where an additional dae network solely for validation was proposed to extract the low dimensional features of the reconstructed glf patterns under precipitation conditioning the validation results are provided in fig 11 and table 3 the figure shows the low dimensional features of the glf pattern before and after applying the precipitation conditioning to the cvae network for each monitoring station the black and blue colored numbers respectively as shown in the figure the distribution of the extracted low dimensional features of each monitoring station after precipitation conditioning was relatively narrow in the feature space the results for station number eight clearly show the differences between the results before and after applying the cvae network which implies a reduction in the variance between the pair wise distance of the features after precipitation conditioning the table clarifies this result the average distance between the low dimensional features decreased by 51 8 after the precipitation conditioning before 1 3691 after 0 7093 therefore hydrologic property estimation models that use the uncertainty minimized low dimensional features from the cvae network as the input variables can be more accurate than a model that does not apply the cvae network 4 4 validation results of the hydrologic property estimation model the low dimensional features of a total of 310 data points 10 years of data from 31 monitoring stations were reconstructed by the cvae network under the same precipitation pattern p and were prepared as the input variables of the model and the representative hydrologic properties for each monitoring station were comprehensively evaluated by calculating the mean of the prediction results over the 10 years the validation results of the developed estimation models for ρ and k are shown in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the results of the estimation model without the application of the cvae network i e no conditioning of p and fig 12 b shows the results of applying the cvae network the left and right figures show scatter plots of the estimation results for ρ and k respectively in each figure the x and y axes indicate the prediction results using the estimation models and manually fitted hydrologic properties respectively the dashed black line represents the one to one correspondence between the estimated and target values as shown in the figures after applying the cvae network fig 12 b most of the scatter points were closely distributed along the one to one correspondence line compared with the results in fig 12 a which indicates the superiority of the proposed method in applying the cvae network the effectiveness of the cvae network was also validated more quantitatively by calculating the cc between the estimated and target values where the estimation model applying the cvae network showed high cc values for ρ and k 0 9833 and 0 9589 respectively compared with the results without application of the cvae network ρ 0 3826 k 0 8801 therefore the results show that the performance of the hydrologic property estimation model can be improved using the proposed method in this study by overcoming the challenge arising from the differences in the annual precipitation patterns as shown in the validation results the developed regression model in this study is operated based on all the cases of hydrologic properties acquired from various synthetic glf patterns without a case by case model optimization process for the process based gl model based on the developed model the actual glf patterns that need to be analyzed and compared to all synthetic cases of glf patterns incorporated in the developed model and the hydrologic properties of the target glf patterns can be acquired efficiently therefore the developed regression model is useful for evaluating the hydrologic properties of all monitoring stations regardless of the number of glf patterns in addition when we apply process based modeling for hydrologic property estimation the model can be applied as a preliminary analysis tool to provide the proper initial conditions for time efficient optimization 5 conclusions in the previous study jeong et al 2020 developed a data driven estimation model that can estimate the hydrologic properties of an aquifer using the glf pattern according to the precipitation pattern however for the estimation model developed by jeong et al 2020 it is difficult to reduce the uncertainty arising from the different glf patterns due to different yearly precipitation patterns even for the same monitoring station to reduce the uncertainty caused by the precipitation patterns a method applying the cvae network was proposed to generate specific glf patterns corresponding to a certain identical precipitation pattern for all the monitoring stations then the regression model was developed using the generated glf patterns and the hydrologic properties that were estimated by the manual fitting of the process based model jeong and park 2017 as the input and output variables respectively for validation of the proposed method in this study ten years of actual gl and precipitation data were applied which were acquired from the gims and asos of the kma in south korea the results confirmed that the statistical characteristics of the low dimensional features of the glf patterns after precipitation conditioning by the cvae network were more consistent when compared to that before precipitation conditioning additionally quantitatively the pairwise distance of the low dimensional features after applying the cvae network was decreased by approximately 52 on average which indicates the effectiveness of the cvae network for reducing the uncertainty resulting from the different precipitation patterns furthermore the hydrologic properties estimation results using the low dimensional features of the glf patterns as the input variable were highly correlated to the properties of the manual fitting of the process based estimation model for the target properties of ρ and k the estimated cc values from the proposed model to the target hydrologic properties were 0 9833 and 0 9589 respectively all the results indicate that the proposed estimation model is useful for more accurate estimation by minimizing the influence of different precipitation patterns regardless of the location of the monitoring stations even though all the cases of synthesized hydrologic properties of the jp model were applied as the target of the proposed model in this study the proposed method is flexible in incorporating any results of estimation models or field tests when preparing the target hydrologic property therefore the proposed methodological process of this study can be used to develop a surrogate model for estimating any type of hydrologic property the results of which would be useful in providing preliminary information for hydrologic property estimation in gl modeling since south korea operates approximately 700 gl monitoring stations with the government planning to increase the number of stations to 1 000 the method of this study is also promising toward providing a time efficient estimation result in addition the model can be simply operated to evaluate hydraulic properties by any analyst who may not entirely majored in gl modeling as such the developed model has extensive potential for designing groundwater quantity management plans by more efficiently identifying aquifer characteristics however the proposed method requires high quality monitoring data because all the processes are conducted based on the pattern of the applied data therefore the performance of the developed method can deteriorate when the data are highly contaminated by noise or contain unexpected exogenous factors e g groundwater pumping moreover further model development that can accommodate a more short term period gl time series pattern should be established to improve the applicability of the developed model although this study proposed a method to evaluate the main hydrologic properties showing dominant influences for describing the aquifer characteristics it is necessary to discuss other measurements representing the aquifer characteristics e g the delay time of the infiltrated water in the

2100,in this study a method of aquifer hydrologic property estimation incorporating the deep learning method was developed to improve the estimation efficiency of a process based model based on groundwater level fluctuation glf patterns as a reference study a data driven method suggested by jeong et al 2020 was considered the uncertainty of the glf patterns resulting from different yearly patterns of precipitation which were considered as noise in the previous study was effectively discarded using the newly proposed method of applying the conditional variational autoencoder cvae the cvae was used to acquire the specific glf patterns under certain identical precipitation patterns for all the monitoring stations the data driven hydrologic property estimation model was developed to predict two hydrologic parameters ρ and k of the process based model using the generated glf patterns from the cvae network as the input variables the actual glf and precipitation data that were acquired from nationwide groundwater monitoring stations in south korea were applied to validate the developed method it was found that the estimated and target hydrologic properties were highly correlated correlation coefficients cc 0 9833 and 0 9589 for ρ and k respectively which significantly improved the results when compared to the previous study cc 0 7207 and 0 8663 for α n and k respectively consequently the developed model can contribute to a more accurate hydrologic property estimation of aquifers additionally it can facilitate efficient groundwater development planning since the manual fitting of the process based model by an expert is not required keywords hydrologic property estimation data driven estimation model groundwater level fluctuation pattern precipitation pattern conditional variational autoencoder data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evaluation of the hydrological characteristics of an aquifer is essential for understanding the groundwater system which can provide useful insights for groundwater management and conservation taylor and alley 2001 for example the recharge rate and hydraulic conductivity are applied to assess the efficiency of aquifer development chatterjee and ray 2014 they are used for groundwater vulnerability assessments especially when applied to the drastic method aller et al 1987 al rawabdeh et al 2013 el assar et al 2016 masoud and el osta 2016 hydrologic properties differ due to the diversity of the geologic materials consisting of aquifers and uncertainty which leads to difficulty in the quantitative evaluation of the hydrologic properties to understand the aquifer properties various methods including field tests and mathematical modeling have been applied park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 wen et al 2010 klepikova et al 2016 ola et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 ige et al 2018 jeong et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 one of the common methods of hydrologic property estimation is based on the pumping test which evaluates the well performance by measuring the groundwater level gl drawdown and recovery pattern during groundwater pumping from a well additionally various field tests such as slug constant head and push pull tests have been conducted campbell et al 1990 istok et al 1997 hayashi and quinton 2004 kazushi and kouta 2008 quinn et al 2011 fabbri et al 2012 ola et al 2016 sandoval et al 2017 paradis et al 2018 based on these field test methods the characteristics of an aquifer such as hydraulic conductivity permeability coefficient or effective porosity have been evaluated by incorporating various process based modeling of the gl responses and geological information of the aquifer for multiple testing wells however even in the same aquifer the evaluated results from the field tests can differ depending on the compliance to the test guidelines e g the application of pumping equipment with inappropriate horsepower or the expert handling of the test equipment and the analysis of the results in addition case by case modeling is required for property estimation for all pumping wells which is highly labor intensive and can result in subjective estimations another approach time series gl monitoring has been commonly applied to evaluate the groundwater behavior in an aquifer park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 jeong et al 2018 mirarabi et al 2019 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 the pattern of gl fluctuation glf in response to the precipitation pattern provides principal information for aquifer hydraulics such as the recharge rate rasmussen and andreasen 1959 healy and cook 2002 discharge wu et al 2021 and hydraulic conductivity park et al 2011 the majority of the methods are based on mathematical modeling of the time series glf data and various process based models delineating groundwater flow in an aquifer have been developed park and parker 2008 cuthbert 2010 jeong and park 2017 in the study of park and parker 2008 the hydrologic properties relevant to hydraulic conductivity and the recharge rate were evaluated based on the closed form of a mathematical model governing glf variations in response to precipitation pp model the pp model was supplemented by jeong and park 2017 jp model where delayed recharge flux and unsaturated zone drainage variation according to the season were additionally considered by applying the precipitation as the function of time instead of a constant value however the application of these process based methods requires a sufficient theoretical background in mathematical equations and model optimization furthermore similar to the problem of the pumping test it requires a case by case model fitting for the glf pattern to monitor data recently the data driven approach has been widely applied as an alternative method to a process based model using accumulated groundwater monitoring data jeong and park 2019 mirarabi et al 2019 kanyama et al 2021 sun et al 2022 pham et al 2022 elbeltagi et al 2022 the data driven model is useful for defining the statistical relationship between various monitored data relevant to the groundwater system and the relational information plays multiple roles in interpreting groundwater behavior many data driven models have been used for gl modeling based on exogenous influencing factors e g precipitation and evapotranspiration for example daliakopoulos et al 2005 developed an artificial neural network ann based model to estimate the glf patterns over 18 months in the messara valley greece using monthly precipitation temperature and discharge time series data as the input variables also sahoo et al 2017 estimated the gl for two aquifer systems high plains and mississippi river valley using a hybrid ann model with various exogenous influencing factors precipitation average temperature and monthly stream discharge as input variables however most of the studies applying the data driven method have been focused on gl modeling while estimation of the aquifer hydrologic properties has been rarely studied thus further studies need to be implemented to validate the expandability of the data driven method and to develop an effective method for obtaining insights into the field of groundwater science during a study estimating aquifer hydrologic properties based on data driven models jeong et al 2020 developed a model that can estimate the parameters related to hydraulic conductivity and recharge rate using the glf pattern the parameters of the newly observed glf pattern were evaluated by comparing data with glf patterns of known hydrologic properties in particular jeong et al 2020 proposed an efficient method for extracting meaningful data scientific features of the glf patterns to improve the estimation performance the extracted features were applied as an input variable of the regression models that can estimate hydrologic properties however jeong et al 2020 overlooked the importance of precipitation patterns affecting glf patterns the different yearly precipitation patterns cause statistical inconsistency in the extracted features of glf patterns even in the same aquifer which results in a deterioration of the model s estimation performance consequently this current study proposes a more robust feature extraction method to overcome the disadvantages of the method suggested by jeong et al 2020 to reduce the estimation uncertainty caused by different precipitation patterns a method applying the conditional variable autoencoder cvae network is proposed to generate glf patterns under identical precipitation patterns for all monitoring stations based on this process hydrologic property estimation can be implemented solely based on glf patterns regardless of different precipitation patterns according to the observatory year two regression models that efficiently estimate the recharge to precipitation ratio and the coefficient of gl recession rate of the jp model have been developed where the target properties of the regression model are set by optimizing the jp model to the actual glf data for validation of the proposed method ten years of actual gl and precipitation time series data were acquired from 31 monitoring stations and the data were provided by the national groundwater information management and service center gims and automated synoptic observing system asos of the korea meteorological administration kma in south korea 2 methodology 2 1 limitations of the previous method the study of jeong et al 2020 proposed an efficient regression model to directly estimate the hydrologic properties from the glf pattern where the low dimensional features of the glf patterns are extracted using the denoising autoencoder dae and applied as the explanatory variables of the model to improve the accuracy of the estimation model however the extracted features of the glf patterns that are solely based on the dae are highly affected by the precipitation pattern which means that the hydrologic properties of every year can be different even when the gl data is acquired from the same monitoring station fig 1 shows the limitation of the previous study using the synthetic gl data that were generated by the method suggested by park and parker 2008 i e the pp model fig 1 a shows three cases where the glf patterns black solid lines that were synthesized under identical hydrogeological conditions i e k 0 05 for all cases but correspond to different precipitation patterns started at a different time blue bars precipitation occurred on days 100 170 and 240 for cases 1 2 and 3 respectively the extracted low dimensional features two dimension based on the dae for the synthesized glf pattern 365 dimension are shown in fig 1 b as shown in the figure the low dimensional features of the glf patterns were significantly separated in the data space even though the glf patterns were generated with identical hydrologic properties and this is caused by different precipitation patterns therefore to extract the low dimensional features of the gl while solely accommodating the hydrologic property of the aquifer a method to exclude the effect of the precipitation pattern is necessary and this is conducted by setting a unified precipitation pattern for the gl data of all the monitoring stations in this study the cvae was applied to extract the refined low dimensional features regardless of the different precipitation patterns according to the observatory year which led to improving the hydrologic property estimation model the detailed method for using the cvae is explained in the following section 2 2 proposed method in this study the method proposed in this study mainly consisted of two processes p1 and p2 in fig 2 the regression model for estimating the hydrologic parameters of the aquifer for all the possible glf patterns constrained with a specific precipitation pattern p in fig 2 was constructed in the first process i e p1 to construct the regression model all possible hydrologic parameters of the jp model and the low dimensional features of the corresponding glf which were extracted using dae were used as the response and explanatory variables respectively this manuscript provides a summarized theoretical background of the jp model below and please refer to jeong and park 2017 for more information in the second process p2 the generation of a new glf pattern conditioned to a precipitation pattern p in p1 was proposed using the cvae network this process addresses the limitations of the previous method and minimizes the influence of different precipitation patterns on the annual glf of each monitoring station for cvae network training the annual glf patterns for ten years in each region a total of 31 monitoring stations were used as the input and target variables of the model where the corresponding precipitation patterns were applied as the conditioning variables based on the trained cvae network the annual glf pattern for the target monitoring station can be newly generated under fixed precipitation conditions p which was transformed to the low dimensional features two dimension through the dae in the p1 process then the hydrologic properties for the target monitoring station were calculated by the regression model using the low dimensional features as the input variable more detailed information on the main process for developing the estimation model is detailed in the following section which is composed of 1 generating the synthetic glf patterns under a specific precipitation pattern using the jp model 2 low dimensional feature extraction for the generated synthetic glf patterns using the dae model 3 applying the cvae network for the conditioning of a specific precipitation pattern p to the glf pattern observed at the target monitoring station 4 constructing the regression model for estimating the hydrologic properties of the target monitoring station 2 2 1 generating synthetic groundwater level fluctuation patterns using a jp model the jp model is a process based glf pattern estimation model based on precipitation and combinations of the four parameters α t 1 inversely related to the residence time of the infiltrated water in the unsaturated zone s y specific yield ρ the recharge to precipitation ratio according to the fillable porosity sophocleus 1991 and k t 1 the rate coefficient related to gl recession for the saturated zone proposed by jeong and park 2017 parameters of α and s y are related to the flux of the groundwater which can vary according to the hydrologic condition of the unsaturated zone uz where a large α and s y values represent a dominant advective recharge flux of the infiltrated water and a slow gl recession within the uz respectively in particular the influences of α and s y are dominant during the pre and post storm periods in south korea jeong and park 2017 meanwhile ρ and k are directly related to the amount of recharge flux and rate of gl recession of the saturated zone respectively large ρ and k values indicate the favorable potential for recharge and groundwater advection in the aquifer and these parameters show stronger influences compared to the parameters of α and s y regardless of the climatic period jeong and park 2017 therefore the two hydrologic parameters ρ and k of the jp model were considered to be the main factors affecting the variation in the glf patterns to construct a network that could explain more diverse glf patterns a data generation process was conducted to simulate all the possible synthetic glf patterns based on the jp model before performing data generation the range of the two hydrologic parameters was determined by comparing the actual glf patterns with the fitted glf patterns using the jp model thereafter synthetic glf patterns that could be simulated under the specific precipitation conditions p were generated by the jp model using all the possible combinations of the hydrologic properties within the determined range of each parameter 2 2 2 feature extraction of the synthetic groundwater level fluctuation patterns using the denoising autoencoder in general the prediction performance of the regression model highly depends on the dimensionality of the input variables kwak et al 2008 in this aspect the high dimensionality of the gl data as the input variable can deteriorate the hydrologic property estimation quality of the model therefore an algorithm that is more effective at extracting the low dimensional features of the gl data might be beneficial for improving the estimation performance of the regression model the dae a nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm can be a countermeasure to effectively reduce the dimension of the data and conserve its data scientific information the two dimensional data space containing the information of the high dimensional glf pattern was constructed based on the dae to improve the representability of the synthetic gl data of the actual glf patterns an infinitesimal amount of gaussian random noise was included by mimicking the actual fluctuations fig 3 shows the learning network of the dae for m th sample data having n dimensions the dae network consisted of two symmetrical ann structures i e encoder and decoder in fig 3 the network could compress the input variable by setting the number of neurons in the hidden layer to be smaller than the input layer and the low dimensional features could be extracted from the neck of the network c in fig 3 because of the nonlinear symmetric network structure it is known that dae shows superior performance in the feature extraction of complex high dimensional data when compared to other existing methods e g principal component analysis and self organizing map hinton and salakhutdinov 2006 in this study tied weights w i in fig 3 were applied to improve the computational efficiency in the learning process and an adam optimization algorithm using root mean squared error rmse as a loss function was applied to optimize the weights the theoretical details including the equation in the dae are not included in this study for full details of the dae methods please see vincent et al 2008 2 2 3 precipitation conditioning based on the conditional variational autoencoder models the main objective of this section is to remove the uncertainty caused by different annual precipitation patterns and to obtain precise estimation results by generating unified glf patterns for each monitoring station the cvae was used to generate glf patterns to minimize the influence of yearly precipitation patterns in the training process of the cvae the relationship between the input and conditioning variables is trained and accordingly variations in the input variable that may occur under specific conditioning variables can be estimated the main structure of the cvae used in this study consisted of two symmetric networks encoder and decoder that were connected to train the probability distribution of the input variables the structure of the network is shown in fig 4 the encoder of the network receives the input variable x and generates a latent vector z while the decoder plays the role of reconstructing x using z the conditioning layer is placed beside the encoding layer and latent vector therefore the relationship between the input and conditioning variables can be trained through the repeated encoding feature extraction and decoding data reconstruction processes of the network in this study gl and precipitation data with regional labels were used as the input and conditioning variables of the cvae model respectively accordingly the interrelation between the glf and precipitation patterns of each monitoring station was trained through the learning process and new glf patterns were generated using the decoder in particular in the data generation process glf patterns can be generated where the influence of yearly precipitation is excluded by assigning p as the conditioning variable for all corresponding input variables in the cvae network training an adam optimization algorithm using kullback leilber divergence and cross entropy as a loss function kullback and leibler 1951 kingma and ba 2015 was applied to optimize the weights all the networks using the dae and cvae of sections 2 2 2 2 2 3 were coded using python 3 9 van rossum and drake 2009 and pytorch 1 12 1 paszke et al 2019 and early stopping was applied to avoid overfitting and improve computational efficiency in the learning process the hardware used for training and estimation was equipped with an intel xeon 2 69 ghz cpu 48 cores and two sockets 128 gb memory and a microsoft windows 10 operating system 2 2 4 construction of the hydrologic property estimation model the regression model for estimating the two hydrologic properties ρ and k based on the glf patterns was constructed using the data acquired in sections 2 2 1 2 2 3 to train the regression model the low dimensional features of the synthetic glf patterns that were generated under specific precipitation conditions p section 2 2 1 2 2 2 and the corresponding jp model parameters ρ and k were used as the input and target variables respectively in this study a regression tree was used to develop the estimation model breiman et al 1984 provide a more theoretical background on the regression tree to estimate the hydrologic properties for the location of interest a new glf pattern for the location was generated by the cvae using the same precipitation p and was subsequently applied to the trained dae to extract the low dimensional features next the extracted glf features were applied to the trained regression model as input variables to estimate the hydrologic properties the hydrologic parameters estimated using the developed regression model were compared to the hydrologic properties optimized by the jp model fitting where the correlation coefficient cc between two values was evaluated to validate the performance of the developed regression model 3 data acquisition and preprocessing 3 1 data acquisition all the gl data which were applied to the proposed method were obtained from the gims www gims go kr in south korea the gims is an observation network system that is operated to identify and manage the status and variational trends in the gl and water quality a total of 668 monitoring stations have been in operation since 1995 for automatic gl monitoring in addition the precipitation data were obtained from the weather observing station corresponding to the location of each gl monitoring station and all data were acquired from the asos of the kma https www weather go kr the daily averaged gl and precipitation monitoring data which were obtained for 10 years at a total of 31 monitoring stations were used for model implementation the applied monitoring stations gl and precipitation for this study are indicated in fig 5 a the aquifers in south korea are mainly composed of unconsolidated sediment porous volcanic rock semi consolidated sedimentary rock non porous volcanic rock intrusive igneous rock clastic sedimentary rock limestone and metamorphic rock as shown in fig 5 b with intrusive igneous rock being predominant in south korea covering 19 of the total area lee et al 2018 the dominant aquifers of the country located in low relief mountainous areas are mainly composed of crystallized bedrock igneous and metamorphic rock the groundwater flow of which is limited by the lateral extension from the connected fractures lee and kwon 2016 the shallow aquifer overlays the bedrock aquifer and consists of unconsolidated sediment the thickness of the unconsolidated sediments which affects the recharge process of the infiltrated water from precipitation ranges from 2 to 30 m from the surface and the depth of the gl ranges from 1 to 22 m lee et al 2007 the glf pattern of the aquifer is an interaction concomitant with the hydro physical characteristics according to the composition of the deep and shallow aquifers which provides information on aquifer characteristics the majority of the deep and shallow aquifers showed 0 8 m of the range of annual glf the aquifers showing 1 5 2 0 m range are most common for both aquifer types 19 1 and 21 6 for the deep and shallow aquifer respectively table 1 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ranges from 0 01 to 500 m day in south korea lee et al 2018 which varies significantly with respect to the hydrogeologic units composing the aquifer the annual precipitation in south korea ranges from 1 000 to 1 400 mm by region and more than half of the annual precipitation is concentrated during the wet season from june to august in addition the precipitation from december to february is less than 10 of the total annual precipitation and 5 15 of annual precipitation is recharged into the aquifer krc 2019 previous studies on the relationship between precipitation and the amount of groundwater have shown a high seasonal correlation between precipitation and glf patterns yang and ahn 2008 kim et al 2016 jeong and park 2017 lee et al 2019 3 2 data preprocessing the data acquired from the gims included outliers caused by various unexpected factors e g monitoring equipment error and abnormal aquifer system changes which might result in degradation of the reliability of the modeling results without preprocessing of the raw monitoring data in this study several preprocessing techniques were applied to the raw data to minimize the influence of outliers on the results in south korea precipitation rarely occurs during the period from december to january and the recharge flux is relatively reduced due to the near surface soil freeze luo et al 2002 since the analysis of the glf pattern with the precipitation was the key aspect of this study the gl data from the period february november were selectively used to model implementation which is beneficial for reducing the dimension of the feature and improving the performance of the data driven model in addition the outliers included in the gl data were preprocessed using the moving average outlier detection method and any detected outliers were replaced based on linear interpolation a year of gl data including a long consecutive missing period more than 30 d in a year was excluded from the analysis and reconstruction using linear interpolation was conducted for the other case less than 30 d in a year some missing precipitation data were observed and the corresponding values were replaced with zero in addition gl data corrupted by artificial activity e g groundwater pumping were not considered in this study which can deteriorate the understanding of the natural process of aquifer characteristics to improve the training performance of the developed data driven model all the applied data were normalized to a range of 0 to 1 preventing the trained model from being biased toward the input data of having a relatively larger value for the format of the regional label one hot encoding was applied to the 31 monitoring stations 4 results and discussion 4 1 synthetic groundwater level data generation using the jp model before generating the synthetic glf pattern the range of the two hydrologic parameters of the jp model ρ and k was determined by optimization of the jp model to all the actual glf patterns in south korea the hydrologic parameter was estimated using 310 annual gl data points 10 years for 31 monitoring stations examples of the fitting results are shown in fig 6 as shown in the figure the simulated gl reasonably represents the actual gl data the range of the hydrologic parameters was determined by setting a 10 margin to the estimated values to consider estimation errors that may occur during the fitting process and to sufficiently cover the various aquifer characteristics as a result the minimum and maximum values of ρ were evaluated as 0 1 and 20 and the values of k were determined to be 0 01 and 2 the minimum and maximum values of each hydrologic parameter were divided into equal intervals 0 1 and 0 01 for ρ and k respectively therefore 40 000 combinations of the hydrologic parameters were obtained that could be used as the input variable of the jp model then the synthetic glf patterns were generated using all the combinations of the hydrologic parameters with conditioning to a specific precipitation pattern p an example of the generated glf patterns for a specific precipitation pattern is shown in fig 7 where fig 7 a shows the various glf patterns corresponding to different combinations of hydrologic parameters and fig 7 b is the applied precipitation pattern for the synthetic glf data generation the two hydrologic parameters are linked by a complex formula and affect each other in the process of generating the glf pattern but ρ dominantly affects the groundwater recharge rate and k is generally related to the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer jeong and park 2017 therefore as shown in fig 7 a the rate of gl rising was relatively high when the value of ρ was large blue solid line when compared to a small ρ value red solid line moreover a large value of k generated a rapid descending pattern in the gl the degree of the slope of the decreasing gl corresponded to a large k value 0 13 and was significantly bigger than that which corresponded to a small k value 0 01 4 2 feature extraction results for the synthetic groundwater level data based on the denoising autoencoder the low dimensional features of the synthetic glf patterns were extracted based on the simple dae network with a single hidden layer the input layer of the constructed dae network layer i in fig 3 consisted of the same number of neurons as the input data dimension n gl 120 the number of neurons for the hidden layer and compressed layer h 1 and c respectively in fig 3 was 60 and 20 respectively and all the layers were connected using the exponential linear unit activation function to express the features more intuitively two dimensional visualization was conducted by applying the kernel principal component analysis technique to the data that were extracted from layer c of the dae network the result of the visualization is shown in fig 8 as shown in the figure the values of the 1 st and 2 nd features the projected values of the glf pattern within two dimensional data space got smaller with an increasing value of k where the slope of the declined gl was steeper with a higher value of k furthermore the values of the 1 st and 2 nd features increased as the values of ρ were larger it is also shown that the value of ρ affected the maximum level of the gl and did not affect the slope of the glf when compared to the value of k the results indicate that the extracted low dimensional features from the dae network appropriately discriminated the various patterns of the glf and described the corresponding hydrologic properties which indicates the superior feasibility of the developed dae network for extracting the specific low dimensional features of the glf patterns 4 3 groundwater level fluctuation pattern reconstruction based on the conditional variational autoencoder a cvae network with two hidden layers fig 4 was constructed to acquire the glf patterns under specific precipitation conditions p where the gl n gl 300 and the precipitation n p 300 were used as the input variables and the 31 labels n l 31 indicating the region from 1 to 31 were used as the conditioning variables for the cvae network training in addition the number of neurons in the hidden layers was set smaller than that of the input layer to extract the low dimensional informative features of the input gl data each hidden layer h 1 and h 2 had 200 neurons and 100 neurons respectively and the number of neurons in the latent vector z was set to 50 where the number of neurons for each layer was decided by the trial and error method all the layers were connected by the leaky relu activation function also the training and testing dataset ratio was set to 9 1 and at least a year of gl data was acquired from all monitoring stations and included in the testing dataset to validate the cvae for all the stations the examples of the glf pattern reconstruction results the output results of the trained cvae network for the actual precipitation patterns based on the trained model are shown in fig 9 the validation results for the two monitoring stations are represented in the figure and the results for the rest of the monitoring stations are provided in supplementary material i the quantitative performance validation for the results was conducted by evaluating the cc and rmse between the actual glf pattern blue dots in fig 9 and the generated glf pattern red solid line in fig 9 the results of which for each monitoring station are shown in table 2 the mean values of the cc and rmse for all the testing data were 0 8425 and 0 0293 m respectively the high correlation and the low differences between the actual and estimated gls indicate that the constructed cvae network can reasonably express the relationship between the gl and precipitation patterns for each region the glf pattern reconstruction results under the specific precipitation pattern p at a certain monitoring station are exemplified in fig 10 when comparing fig 10 a and fig 10 b the reconstructed glf patterns from the trained cvae network show unified patterns over the three years based on the trained cvae network the glf patterns of each region were generated under the specific precipitation pattern p by assigning the same precipitation patterns for all the gl monitoring stations the uncertainty of the low dimensional features of the gl pattern which is caused by the influence of different yearly precipitation patterns can be minimized the effect of precipitation conditioning of the cvae network on uncertainty minimization for the reconstructed glf pattern was additionally validated in the low dimensional feature space because the low dimensional feature was applied to develop the hydrologic property estimation model the purpose of this study for the validation the mean of the pair wise distance between the low dimensional feature values before and after applying the cvae network for each monitoring station was compared where an additional dae network solely for validation was proposed to extract the low dimensional features of the reconstructed glf patterns under precipitation conditioning the validation results are provided in fig 11 and table 3 the figure shows the low dimensional features of the glf pattern before and after applying the precipitation conditioning to the cvae network for each monitoring station the black and blue colored numbers respectively as shown in the figure the distribution of the extracted low dimensional features of each monitoring station after precipitation conditioning was relatively narrow in the feature space the results for station number eight clearly show the differences between the results before and after applying the cvae network which implies a reduction in the variance between the pair wise distance of the features after precipitation conditioning the table clarifies this result the average distance between the low dimensional features decreased by 51 8 after the precipitation conditioning before 1 3691 after 0 7093 therefore hydrologic property estimation models that use the uncertainty minimized low dimensional features from the cvae network as the input variables can be more accurate than a model that does not apply the cvae network 4 4 validation results of the hydrologic property estimation model the low dimensional features of a total of 310 data points 10 years of data from 31 monitoring stations were reconstructed by the cvae network under the same precipitation pattern p and were prepared as the input variables of the model and the representative hydrologic properties for each monitoring station were comprehensively evaluated by calculating the mean of the prediction results over the 10 years the validation results of the developed estimation models for ρ and k are shown in fig 12 fig 12 a shows the results of the estimation model without the application of the cvae network i e no conditioning of p and fig 12 b shows the results of applying the cvae network the left and right figures show scatter plots of the estimation results for ρ and k respectively in each figure the x and y axes indicate the prediction results using the estimation models and manually fitted hydrologic properties respectively the dashed black line represents the one to one correspondence between the estimated and target values as shown in the figures after applying the cvae network fig 12 b most of the scatter points were closely distributed along the one to one correspondence line compared with the results in fig 12 a which indicates the superiority of the proposed method in applying the cvae network the effectiveness of the cvae network was also validated more quantitatively by calculating the cc between the estimated and target values where the estimation model applying the cvae network showed high cc values for ρ and k 0 9833 and 0 9589 respectively compared with the results without application of the cvae network ρ 0 3826 k 0 8801 therefore the results show that the performance of the hydrologic property estimation model can be improved using the proposed method in this study by overcoming the challenge arising from the differences in the annual precipitation patterns as shown in the validation results the developed regression model in this study is operated based on all the cases of hydrologic properties acquired from various synthetic glf patterns without a case by case model optimization process for the process based gl model based on the developed model the actual glf patterns that need to be analyzed and compared to all synthetic cases of glf patterns incorporated in the developed model and the hydrologic properties of the target glf patterns can be acquired efficiently therefore the developed regression model is useful for evaluating the hydrologic properties of all monitoring stations regardless of the number of glf patterns in addition when we apply process based modeling for hydrologic property estimation the model can be applied as a preliminary analysis tool to provide the proper initial conditions for time efficient optimization 5 conclusions in the previous study jeong et al 2020 developed a data driven estimation model that can estimate the hydrologic properties of an aquifer using the glf pattern according to the precipitation pattern however for the estimation model developed by jeong et al 2020 it is difficult to reduce the uncertainty arising from the different glf patterns due to different yearly precipitation patterns even for the same monitoring station to reduce the uncertainty caused by the precipitation patterns a method applying the cvae network was proposed to generate specific glf patterns corresponding to a certain identical precipitation pattern for all the monitoring stations then the regression model was developed using the generated glf patterns and the hydrologic properties that were estimated by the manual fitting of the process based model jeong and park 2017 as the input and output variables respectively for validation of the proposed method in this study ten years of actual gl and precipitation data were applied which were acquired from the gims and asos of the kma in south korea the results confirmed that the statistical characteristics of the low dimensional features of the glf patterns after precipitation conditioning by the cvae network were more consistent when compared to that before precipitation conditioning additionally quantitatively the pairwise distance of the low dimensional features after applying the cvae network was decreased by approximately 52 on average which indicates the effectiveness of the cvae network for reducing the uncertainty resulting from the different precipitation patterns furthermore the hydrologic properties estimation results using the low dimensional features of the glf patterns as the input variable were highly correlated to the properties of the manual fitting of the process based estimation model for the target properties of ρ and k the estimated cc values from the proposed model to the target hydrologic properties were 0 9833 and 0 9589 respectively all the results indicate that the proposed estimation model is useful for more accurate estimation by minimizing the influence of different precipitation patterns regardless of the location of the monitoring stations even though all the cases of synthesized hydrologic properties of the jp model were applied as the target of the proposed model in this study the proposed method is flexible in incorporating any results of estimation models or field tests when preparing the target hydrologic property therefore the proposed methodological process of this study can be used to develop a surrogate model for estimating any type of hydrologic property the results of which would be useful in providing preliminary information for hydrologic property estimation in gl modeling since south korea operates approximately 700 gl monitoring stations with the government planning to increase the number of stations to 1 000 the method of this study is also promising toward providing a time efficient estimation result in addition the model can be simply operated to evaluate hydraulic properties by any analyst who may not entirely majored in gl modeling as such the developed model has extensive potential for designing groundwater quantity management plans by more efficiently identifying aquifer characteristics however the proposed method requires high quality monitoring data because all the processes are conducted based on the pattern of the applied data therefore the performance of the developed method can deteriorate when the data are highly contaminated by noise or contain unexpected exogenous factors e g groundwater pumping moreover further model development that can accommodate a more short term period gl time series pattern should be established to improve the applicability of the developed model although this study proposed a method to evaluate the main hydrologic properties showing dominant influences for describing the aquifer characteristics it is necessary to discuss other measurements representing the aquifer characteristics e g the delay time of the infiltrated water in the

2101,intermittently open closed estuaries ioces are dynamic sensitive estuaries that periodically close as a function of competing marine and fluvial energies once closed ioces are often artificially opened to relieve localised flooding artificial openings are generally effective as a short term flood mitigation strategy however sometimes ioces can close immediately after excavation without draining the lagoon in this situation the opening does not achieve its management purpose and reimplementation is required costing many thousands of dollars at a time and leading to adverse impacts on estuary biota using a dataset of 137 openings at 37 ioces globally we show that the hydraulic gradient or grade at opening and offshore significant wave height determine whether an estuary will remain open and drain its lagoon the hydraulic gradient represents the energy slope between the estuary and the ocean and wave height determines the capacity of waves to infill the channel with sediment to counter offshore erosion artificial openings are only successful when ioces are opened with a hydraulic gradient steeper than 0 017 m m equivalent to a grade of 1 60 and when significant wave height is below 4 30 m these findings highlight that the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of opening success despite it being widely used to decide when to implement artificial openings using near continuous monitoring of geomorphic change at 28 artificial openings we show that the hydraulic gradient and grade at the time of opening controls the rate of channel expansion outflow velocity at the mouth lagoon drainage rate and the time to reach peak channel width and outflow velocities the tidal stage at opening can be used to either speed up or slow down the rates of change potentially reducing the occurrence of fish kills associated with rapid drainage although the decision to open an estuary is a complex balance between environmental cultural socio economic and practical factors we present a simple and cost effective way to predict if artificial openings will be successful the thresholds of our study can be used to complement existing decision support tools but as a standalone method are best suited for emergency openings where draining the lagoon to reduce flooding is the main management priority keywords estuary estuary entrance processes intermittently open closed estuaries estuary management artificial openings data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intermittently open closed estuaries ioces are dynamic and sensitive estuaries with entrances that close as a function of competing marine vs fluvial energies ranasinghe et al 1999 slinger 2017 once closed ioces are often artificially opened to relieve localised flooding within the basin sinclair et al 2022 however the imbalance of energies can result in immediate closure and managers are forced to reopen estuaries at the expense of citizens and risk further degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat becker et al 2009 mcsweeney et al 2018 the decision to open an estuary requires careful consideration of social and environmental factors as openings can have severe ecological consequences associated with the rapid decrease in water level e g mass fish deaths and changes in community structure keneley et al 2013 conde et al 2019 adams and van niekerk 2020 however the process of opening an estuary at a time such that it remains open and drains its basin is simply a physical process what is needed is an understanding of the processes and variables necessary to predict if an estuary once opened will remain open and drain thereby alleviating flooding and reducing the need for reimplementation this will enable a better assessment of the potential biological and social benefits vs trade offs of artificial openings and add a further layer to existing management tools ioces are common in wave dominated settings globally comprising 15 of all estuaries on microtidal coasts mcsweeney et al 2017 their entrance state is controlled by the net direction of sediment transport at the mouth and when onshore sediment transport via waves dominates over offshore sediment transport via ebb tidal currents ioces close ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2003 behrens et al 2013 orescanin et al 2021 during this closed state the lagoon water level will rise and can inundate property and infrastructure on the floodplain to mitigate against flooding ioces are artificially opened before a natural opening threshold is reached artificial openings involve excavation of a channel through the berm to reconnect the estuary to the sea while most artificial openings are undertaken for flood mitigation purposes they can be implemented to allow fish passage to the ocean crippa et al 2013 largier et al 2019 recruit juvenile fish and prawns griffiths 1999 reduce nutrient levels conde et al 2015 or improve water quality and conditions for biota artificial openings are a common management procedure globally being documented in australia haines and thom 2007 brazil netto et al 2012 new zealand schallenberg et al 2010 portugal fortunato et al 2014 spain moreno et al 2010 south africa whitfield et al 2012 and the u s a elwany et al 1998 artificial openings are generally effective as a short term flood mitigation strategy however there are times where ioces close immediately after excavation and the lagoon water level does not decrease mcsweeney et al 2018 orescanin et al 2021 in this situation the opening is unsuccessful as it does not achieve its management purposes of keeping the entrance open and reducing flooding reimplementation is then required often costing tens of thousands of dollars east gippsland catchment management authority egcma 2014 stephens and murtagh 2012 and if undertaken frequently can cause adverse impacts on macroinvertebrate fish and vegetation biomass and potentially increase long term siltation gladstone et al 2006 anandraj et al 2008 rodríguez gallego et al 2010 swift et al 2018 given the widespread occurrence of artificial openings globally being able to predict when openings will be successful is critical to reducing the need for reimplementation for the purposes of this study we define a successful opening as one that stays open after excavation and achieves its management purpose of sufficiently draining the basin to reduce flooding currently the lagoon water level is the most widely used determinant for deciding when to implement artificial openings haines and thom 2007 schallenberg et al 2010 adams and van niekerk 2020 openings are usually undertaken when the lagoon water level reaches a set elevation i e often called a trigger height or when critical infrastructure becomes inundated everett et al 2007 conde et al 2019 whitfield et al 2012 when possible openings are implemented prior to forecast rainfall to coincide with increased river flow and avoided when offshore swells are high whitfield et al 2012 conde et al 2015 we propose that considering the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of whether an artificial opening will be successful rather a combination of factors which influence capacity of the channel to erode and transport sediment seaward beck and basson 2008 the three stage semi empirical model of gordon 1990 provides a good summary of the idealised sequence of geomorphic change during a successful estuary entrance opening fig 1 a f for an estuary to stay open and drain it needs to transition through stage 1 to surpass some critical velocity threshold whereby it can maintain offshore sediment transport in this model stage 1 sees the initial connection to the ocean via a narrow shallow channel fig 1a c erosion rates are low as the threshold conditions for sediment transport are only marginally exceeded outflow velocity is initially a function of the energy slope between the estuary and the ocean gordon 1990 in stage 2 the flow becomes supercritical outflow velocity increases and a semi circular weir develops at the upstream end of the channel fig 1a a series of hydraulic jumps form downstream of the weir which migrate upstream fig 1d e the channel widens and incises at a faster rate and as discharge at the mouth increases the lagoon drains more rapidly stretch and parkinson 2006a 2006b wainwright and baldock 2015 mcsweeney et al 2020 bed slope adjustment translates upstream and eventually the weir migrates into the lagoon and collapses causing a transition into stage 3 gordon 1990 in stage 3 the flow becomes subcritical fig 1a f as hydraulic head between the estuary and ocean decreases channel expansion slows discharge enters the falling limb of the hydrograph and the estuary water level eventually stabilises at an elevation near mean sea level msl fig 1a in the context of fig 1a unsuccessful openings essentially bypass stages 2 and 3 and track directly back to a closed state fig 1a f this is due to either a outflow velocity being insufficient to initiate or maintain offshore sediment transport gordon 1990 b high offshore waves that overwhelm seaward erosion and infill the channel with sediment mcsweeney et al 2018 or c a combination of both a and b we hypothesise that it is possible to pinpoint the thresholds for implementing successful artificial openings as based on the interaction of three simple variables at the time of opening hydraulic head i e the head difference between the estuary and the ocean berm length and offshore wave height high hydraulic head and short berm lengths have been recognised as an important factor driving natural openings cooper 2001 kraus et al 2002 2008 but despite this they have not been widely quantified for artificial openings largely due to a lack of data to calculate the berm length at the scale of the entrance these three variables hydraulic head berm length and wave height represent the balance between the driving and resisting forces for opening hydraulic head represents the energy available to initiate and maintain an entrance opening while the berm length represents the distance over which that energy is expended in transporting sediment seaward dividing hydraulic head by the berm length quantifies the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient is the driving force that causes water to move in the direction of maximum decreasing head i e seaward harvey and odum 1990 robinson et al 2006 conceptually openings are likely to be unsuccessful when hydraulic head between the estuary and the ocean is low and the berm length long this results in a lower energy gradient which translates to less potential energy lower outflow velocity and a reduced capacity to erode sediment seaward gordon 1990 parkinson and stretch 2007 beck and basson 2008 young 2018 largier et al 2019 offshore wave height adds a third element high waves are likely to increase deposition rates in the channel and push the estuary towards closure especially if outflow velocity is low and cannot counteract wave driven deposition ranasinghe et al 1999 morris and turner 2010 given this we propose that some critical ratio between the hydraulic gradient and wave height at opening can predict the success of artificial openings in this study we aim to a identify whether the hydraulic gradient is a good predictor of whether artificial openings will be successful b determine the critical relationship between hydraulic gradient and offshore wave height that may delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings and c determine if opening at different hydraulic gradients impacts on the rates and magnitude of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage during opening for c this will enable us to determine if the hydraulic gradient is a critical factor in ensuring that the estuary will track throughout the full opening sequence of gordon 1990 as per fig 1a f and not revert back to immediate closure the decision to artificially open ioces is complex and the goal of this study is to provide guidance for estuary entrance management especially when the priority is to reduce flooding e g emergency artificial openings the hydraulic gradient can be easily measured at a low cost and the thresholds established from our study can be converted into a simple and cost effective decision support tool to complement existing decision making procedures as an adaptive management tool artificial openings are likely to remain an essential management practice into the future especially given the predicted increases in coastal flooding due to sea level rise haines and thom 2007 gerwing et al 2020 stein et al 2021 the findings presented here will aid managers to avoid undertaking artificial openings at times when they are likely to be unsuccessful and thus reduce the need for reimplementation reducing the need to reimplement openings may reduce biological effects although draining an estuary quickly can cause abrupt changes in the system and so we stress that openings should be decided upon on a case by case basis given these potential risks vs benefits 2 regional setting we have analysed estuary entrance openings at 37 ioces in the u s a south africa australia and brazil table 1 fig 2 a d study sites were selected because there were historic records of the timing of entrance openings and data enabling us to calculate the hydraulic gradient at opening because ioces are constrained to wave dominated coasts and front rivers with seasonally or interannually variable flow regimes the broad scale boundary conditions are similar for all study sites whitfield and bate 2007 mcsweeney et al 2017 clark and o connor 2019 a detailed description of the regional setting for each study site is provided in appendix 1 all ioces in our analysis are found on beaches with medium to coarse grained sand and most are in temperate climate zones appendix 1 3 material and methods we have collated records of 137 estuary entrance openings at 37 ioces table 1 for 123 openings we could also determine the offshore hs at the time of each opening and the change in estuary water level pre post opening table 1 for a further 14 openings there was no information for hs as the time of opening was not available or the exact pre post opening change in water level but the hg and grade were known see table 1 sites denoted with all openings were classified as being successful or unsuccessful and the thresholds of hydraulic gradient significant wave height hs and a suite of morphological variables e g lagoon water level and berm length were compared between openings thresholds of hydraulic gradient grade and hs were extracted to delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings and the statistical significance of grade and hs as predictors of opening outcome were tested using binary logistic regression analysis using a subset of 28 artificial openings which we were able to measure in the field or obtain high enough temporal resolution data from literature we then determine the relationship between the hydraulic gradient and grade at opening to the magnitude and rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage these 28 openings were selected as we had measured the whole drainage sequence in the field or had high confidence in the data 3 1 records of estuary entrance openings the time and date of each estuary opening was determined from direct observations during field work existing literature council records or citizen scientist databases full information of the sources of data for each site is included in appendix 2 t1 and s1 contains the timing and date of all openings council records of estuary entrance openings were obtained from the shoalhaven city council for lakes tabourie and conjola in new south wales australia and via the estuary entrance management support system eemss for 10 sites in victoria australia eemss is a decision support tool used by estuary managers which records the time and date of openings mode of opening i e natural or artificial and the water level prior to and after opening arundel 2006 a main source of citizen scientist data was the estuarywatch program which aims to capture information immediately prior to and after estuary entrance openings at ioces in victoria corangamite catchment management authority 2012 estuarywatch volunteers record the time and date of openings mode of opening estuary water level berm height and length and take photos of the entrance morphology data from estuarywatch was often used in conjunction with records from eemss to cross check the timing of openings a further source of citizen scientist data was coastsnap harley et al 2019 which was used specifically for narrabeen lagoon in new south wales coastsnap is a database of crowd sourced images captured from public smartphone cameras where the time and date stamp of each image is recorded because of the high frequency of images capturing estuary entrance openings i e where the excavator was visible the time stamp of images could be used to determine the time of opening for natural openings recorded by estuarywatch most had a known time of breaching recorded but if the precise time was unknown e g it was said to breach overnight the opening was assumed to occur at low tide this is because natural openings mainly occur at low tides when a sufficient gradient exists to permit channel scouring bickerton and pierce 1988 cooper 2001 we recognise that we cannot determine the precise timing of these natural openings but assuming they occurred at low tide the time of breaching was likely accurate to within 3 h as tides in victoria are semi diurnal for ioces with water level gauges in their lagoons gauged data was used to cross check the timing of openings 3 2 hydraulic gradient and grade calculation for each estuary entrance opening we calculated the hydraulic gradient and grade at the time of opening the hydraulic gradient is a ratio between the height difference between the estuary water level and the sea level i e hydraulic head and the distance across the berm fig 3 a b this best represents the energy slope between the estuary and ocean and is calculated as per eq 1 1 h y d r a u l i c g r a d i e n t h 1 h 2 b l where hydraulic gradient is in m m h1 is the lagoon surface water elevation at the time of opening in m relative to msl h2 is the sea level at the time of opening in m msl and bl is the berm length at the time of opening in m fig 3a b the hydraulic gradient is then converted to grade eq 2 2 grade 1 h y d r a u l i c g r a d i e n t the estuary water level at the time of opening h1 was either taken from water level gauges in the estuary local council or citizen scientist records also recorded from gauges or known elevations recorded in literature all water levels were measured or corrected to be relative to msl for sea level h2 we used the ocean tidal elevation at the time of opening we recognise that using the tidal elevation alone does not account for nearshore wave setup wind effects or changes in barometric pressure but for the purposes of this study we chose to keep our calculation simple so it could be easily recreated by without the use of complex equations or modelling tidal elevations were taken from tide charts at the time of the opening and when necessary corrected from local chart datum to be relative to msl using corrections from the closest tidal gauge for openings that we monitored directly in the field the berm length was surveyed using a trimble r6 real time kinematic rtk gps immediately prior to opening the berm length was surveyed as extending from the most seaward extent of the lagoon to the most landward edge of the swash zone with the seaward limit identified as a visual average over several minutes fig 3a b for lakes tabourie and conjola shoalhaven city council provided surveyed berm lengths taken prior to openings for openings documented by estuarywatch the berm length was monitored prior to opening by citizen scientists in the field see corangamite catchment management authority 2012 for methods openings were only included if the berm had been surveyed within 14 days of an opening see s1 we recognise that a longer duration between berm length measurements and the timing of opening may induce error but it is likely that the berm length will only decrease as the estuary water level rises and the estuary approaches an opening this means that the berm length for openings with a longer duration between the measurement and entrance opening it is likely a maximum possible value for all openings sourced from literature the berm length was measured in the field and was surveyed on the same day as opening for narrabeen lagoon coastsnap was used to obtain berm lengths harley et al 2019 harley and kinsela 2022 crowd sourced smartphone images were georectified using pre existing ground control points in coastsnap v3 software run in matlab r2021a berm lengths were then extracted from the georectified images for berm lengths measured by estuarywatch local councils recorded in literature and as extracted from coastsnap berm length was consistently defined in the same manner as our field data and as shown in fig 3a b the average time between berm length measurements and entrance opening for the whole dataset was 2 5 days median of 0 days 3 3 wave heights to analyse the influence of wave height offshore hs at the time of each opening was determined hs was obtained from a combination of buoy observations hindcast data from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s wavewatch iii wwiii v 3 14 tolman 2009 or as recorded in literature appendix 2 hindcast data was only used for estuaries in victoria where wwiii has been proven to be a reliable source of wave data and shows good agreement with satellite altimetry visual observations and buoys hemer et al 2007 mcsweeney 2020 for hindcast data hs was taken as an hourly average and hindcast from the nearest location to the estuary entrance at 0 5 resolution while use of offshore hs may not account for nearshore changes in wave characteristics it is appropriate for our study as this data would be most readily and freely available via wave and weather forecasts for managers who wish to assess the influence of hs on estuary entrance openings for several openings described in literature only the hydraulic gradient or grade at opening for past successful openings was recorded table 1 for these openings we could not determine the hs as the precise date or time of opening was not provided but include the hydraulic gradient and grade in our analysis for successful openings 3 4 lagoon water level analysis and classifying openings for sites with water level gauges within the basin or sufficient data from council and citizen scientist records we calculated the pre post opening change in water level and the total drainage time drainage time was calculated as the duration between the time of opening and until the water level reached a minimum value after which it did not fall any further all openings in our dataset were classified as being successful or unsuccessful as based whether the opening achieved its main management purposes of a opening the entrance b keeping the entrance open and c reducing the lagoon water level sufficiently to alleviate flooding the total drop in water level was used to assist classification openings that closed immediately after excavation were deemed unsuccessful also classified as unsuccessful were openings which stayed open for hours to days but the drop in basin water level did not exceed 10 cm and where flooding was not reduced a 10 cm reduction in water level was used as a threshold as 10 cm of drainage was insufficient to reduce flooding based on field observations in victoria unsuccessful openings of this type were all sites in victoria that closed within 1 5 days of excavation with reimplementation occurring soon after our pre post opening water level dataset also had a clear break in drainage values of 10 cm and 25 cm enabling 10 cm to be a logical threshold to delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings see s1 successful openings were those which stayed open after excavation and drained the lagoon by 10 cm to reduce flooding morphologic information from field observations photo evidence and descriptions of each opening were also used to support the classification of openings being successful or unsuccessful 3 5 factors that determine opening success once openings were classified as successful or unsuccessful a series of physical parameters at the time of opening were investigated as drivers of success parameters included the pre opening water level hydraulic head berm length hydraulic gradient grade and hs distributions and descriptive statistics of each parameter were created for successful and unsuccessful openings thresholds were then extracted for parameters hs hydraulic gradient and grade that clearly delineated between successful and unsuccessful openings to statistically analyse the relationship between grade hs and opening type i e successful vs unsuccessful we undertook binary logistic regression in ibm spss statistics software v 28 grade also representing hydraulic gradient as its inverse value and hs values were input for a range of successful n 105 and unsuccessful n 18 openings with successful openings classified as group 1 and unsuccessful as group 2 one outlier in the unsuccessful opening dataset was removed as the cook s d value and z residual were extremely high fox 1997 removing this outlier improved model performance the model was validated via the chi squared value pseudo r squared values cox and snell and nagelkerke values hosmer and lemeshow test value percentage classified as correct and then applied to several openings as a test where the outcome was known 3 6 geomorphic change during openings for 28 artificial openings at 15 different sites we collated measurements of the change in channel width depth outflow velocity discharge and water level during the drainage period either from field monitoring or as extracted from literature table 2 for six sites in victoria we monitored geomorphic change in the field after each artificial opening table 2 monitoring commenced prior to channel excavation and occurred near continuously for up to 2 days after opening until the estuary had stopped draining estuary entrance morphology was measured using a rtk gps along a fixed cross section at the inlet throat when strong outflow prevented crossing of the channel the channel width was measured using a laser range finder and the depth was measured with a stadia pole with both averaged at least three times outflow surface velocity was measured at the inlet throat corresponding with the timing of each morphological survey velocities were measured in the centre of the channel i e the thalweg using a marsh mcbirney portable flow meter mounted on a wading rod while measuring velocities across the cross section and to capture changes with depth would be ideal this was outside the scope of our study as we were constrained by time and strong outflow during field work when strong outflow prevented readings being taken directly in the channel floats were used to measure outflow velocity timed over 10 m at least three velocity measurements were taken each time and then averaged velocities measured by these two methods were comparable within 0 2 m s on average discharge was calculated using the cross sectional area from morphological surveys and the average outflow velocity the estuary water level was monitored continuously via telemetry gauges or through the deployment of pressure transducers anchored in the estuary basin pressure transducer data was corrected for barometric pressure fluctuations and all water level measurements corrected to msl through literature mining we obtained similar datasets of field observations of geomorphic change and lagoon water level for 10 artificial openings table 2 our field monitoring methods were similar to those used in literature e g smith and zarillo 1988 and enable consistency when comparing to our field data most datasets obtained from literature had near continuous measurements of outflow velocity channel width and discharge during the drainage period enabling us to track change over time openings at bot river terrigal lagoon and wilson inlet had no velocity measurements recorded the 1994 opening at wamberal lagoon had no velocity data and only the maximum discharge was available for terrigal lagoon which was modelled using both the field and literature datasets we extracted the maximum channel width velocity and discharge for each opening and the time taken in hours to reach these maximum values we then calculated an average rate of change for each opening and each parameter maximum values the time to reach the maximum and the average rate of change were correlated with the grade at opening grade 1 hydraulic gradient to determine if grade influences these parameters the grade at opening was also correlated with the percent of the basin drained calculated as the end of drainage water level relative to the starting value total drainage time and the average rate of drainage parameters were also correlated with an estimate of the basin water volume at opening two sites were excluded from this analysis as they were outliers with very large swa relative to the other sites wilson inlet 48 km2 and bot river 14 km2 table 1 basin volume was calculated from the surface water area in table 1 multiplied by hydraulic head this is an approximation only as detailed measurements of basin volume were outside the scope of the study and no bathymetric data was available when graphing relationships the estuary surface water area swa table 1 was used to classify sites into four size categories 1 swa of 0 0 0 5 km2 2 0 5 1 0 km2 3 1 0 2 0 km2 and 4 2 0 km2 to visually assess any grouping effects of size 4 results 4 1 classifying the outcome of openings based on morphologic observations and the pre post opening change in water level we observe three types of opening to occur table 3 fig 4 a c type 1 openings are successful openings as they maintain an open entrance after channel excavation and drain the lagoon substantially to reduce flooding fig 4a type 2 and 3 openings are considered unsuccessful as they do not achieve their management aims type 2 openings see the estuary entrance close immediately after opening and the lagoon water level does not decrease at all fig 4b type 3 openings may maintain an open entrance after excavation but channel incision and expansion are limited and the lagoon water level does not fall 10 cm fig 4c all type 3 openings closed within several days of opening e g fig 4c overall 119 openings were classified as being successful type 1 and 18 were unsuccessful with 14 being type 2 and four being type 3 table 3 the 14 openings where the precise change in water level was not available were all classified as being successful type 1 openings this is because descriptions in literature morphological measurements or photo evidence indicate substantial incision and widening of the channel and a marked decrease in estuary water level 10 cm e g the presence of scarps incision at the former berm position channel bank erosion or exposure of the lagoon bed after drainage applying this classification to the 137 openings we can now analyse the physical drivers that determine the outcome of entrance openings in more detail 4 2 factors influencing the outcome of estuary entrance openings the distributions of a range of physical variables measured prior to opening were compared against the different types of openings as defined in table 3 fig 5 a f table 4 all variables aside from hydraulic gradient and grade show a large degree of overlap between successful i e type 1 and unsuccessful i e types 2 and 3 openings fig 5a d pre opening water level and hydraulic head were both higher on average for successful openings but showed considerable overlap with unsuccessful openings indicating that these parameters alone are not good predictors of whether an opening will be successful table 4 fig 5a b for both parameters the range for successful openings was larger than that of unsuccessful openings fig 5a b for berm length successful openings had lower i e shorter berm length s on average compared to unsuccessful openings but again there was a high degree of overlap fig 5c several unsuccessful openings occurred with berm length s lower than the mean for successful openings 61 m indicating that berm length alone does not delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings fig 5c table 4 successful openings occurred with lower hs on average but again there was substantial overlap for the different types of opening table 4 fig 5d interestingly one opening proved to be unsuccessful at maintaining an open entrance i e being a type 2 opening at a hs as low as 0 61 m fig 5d no opening was successful when hs was 4 3 m table 4 out of all variables hydraulic gradient and grade show the most definitive split between successful and unsuccessful openings fig 5e f successful openings tend to have steeper grades and hydraulic gradients than unsuccessful openings overall fig 5e f table 4 the lowest hydraulic gradient that an estuary entrance opening has been successful at is 0 017 m m which translates to a grade of 1 60 fig 5e f table 4 this 1 60 threshold represents a clear break between successful and unsuccessful openings an exception is the three outliers shown on fig 5f under type 2 openings where the corresponding hs is labelled for each opening for these openings despite the grade being 1 60 the hs was 4 1 5 1 m being above the 95th percentile of hs 4 0 m for all openings this indicates that even when the grade at opening is above the 1 60 threshold if hs is extremely high openings can be unsuccessful this indicates the interplay of hydraulic gradient or grade and hs likely determines the outcome of an opening 4 3 thresholds of hydraulic gradient grade and hs the relationship between hydraulic gradient and grade vs hs at opening for all 123 openings with hs data is shown in fig 6 a b using grade vs hs a 1 60 threshold equivalent to a hydraulic gradient of 0 017 m m delineates between most successful and unsuccessful openings regardless of hs fig 6b table 5 however there are four openings with grades steeper than 1 60 that were still unsuccessful these openings are annotated on fig 6b and are as follows 1 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 15 and hs 4 8 m 2 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 35 and hs 5 1 m 3 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 58 and hs 4 1 m and 4 a type 3 opening with a grade of 1 59 and hs 1 8 m for 1 and 2 these openings likely closed due to high waves 4 5 m that overwhelmed offshore sediment transport in the channel for 3 this opening was likely unsuccessful due to the hs 4 1 m being still quite high and coupled with a grade 1 58 which is very close to the 1 60 threshold for 4 the 1 8 m hs is below the mean hs 2 05 m for all successful openings indicating that waves were unlikely to play a key role in closing the entrance for this opening the low grade 1 59 was likely the primary cause this indicates that while the 1 60 grade threshold is a good predictor of opening outcome openings with grades of 1 58 1 60 are still at risk of closure and are more likely to not substantially drain their basins this indicates an area of risk to consider when implementing artificial openings to analyse the drivers of unsuccessful openings in more detail we compare the timing of the opening relative to the tidal stage for the nine unsuccessful openings undertaken with a grade 1 70 and hs 4 5 m fig 6c openings with a grade 1 70 were chosen as they are close to the 1 60 threshold and a hs 4 5 m excludes openings which likely closed due to very high waves all of these openings aside from one merri river were implemented on a rising tide fig 6c for openings 3 gellibrand river grade 1 58 and 4 aire river grade 1 59 mentioned in section 4 3 above both openings were implemented on a rising tide and 6 h prior to the next high fig 6c this means that in addition to having a grade close to the 1 60 threshold at opening hydraulic head would be progressively decreasing over several hours as the tide rises fig 6c the one unsuccessful opening that occurred on a falling tide merri river was undertaken on a mixed semidiurnal tide where the fall in tidal stage from the time of opening until the next low was only 0 38 m with a longer than normal 6 h duration until the next low 21 08 18 fig 6c this indicates that openings undertaken on a rising tide are more likely to be unsuccessful because as the tide rises hydraulic head is decreasing considering the tidal stage is important for openings at grades close to the 1 60 threshold as exemplified by openings 3 and 4 opening on a rising tide is likely to decrease the chance of an opening being successful when the grade is on the cusp of the 1 60 threshold a binary logistic regression model was performed to assess whether grade and hs are statistically significant in predicting the outcome of openings i e successful or unsuccessful the overall model was found to be statistically significant with a significant chi squared value p 0 001 and a nagelkerke r squared value of 0 79 see appendix 3 for full validation the hosmer and lemeshow test value 0 98 was not significant indicating an adequate model fit results indicate that both grade and hs show a statistically significant influence on the outcome of artificial openings table 6 hs is a positive predictor of the probability of an opening being unsuccessful b 1 538 s e 0 64 wald χ2 1 5 739 p 0 017 and grade is also a positive predictor of the probability of an opening being unsuccessful b 0 357 s e 0 119 wald χ2 1 9 049 p 0 003 specifically the odds of an opening being unsuccessful will be on average increased by 365 for every per unit increase in hs and by 42 9 for every per unit increase in grade table 6 the 95 confidence intervals indicate that hs has a wide range of influence with orders of magnitude difference whereas grade has a more constant influence with a narrower confidence interval table 6 the model correctly predicted 99 of successful openings and 77 of unsuccessful openings giving an overall percentage correct prediction rate of 96 table 6 the model was slightly less accurate in predicting unsuccessful openings 4 4 natural vs artificial openings in comparing the hydraulic gradient and grade values for natural vs artificial openings natural openings occurred at steeper grades and hydraulic gradients than artificial openings on average table 5 fig 6d e the most gradual grade that a natural opening occurred at was 1 53 and the steepest was 1 7 table 5 the most gradual grade for a successful artificial opening was 1 60 and the steepest was 1 10 table 5 fig 6b when the grade reaches 1 10 we suggest that artificial openings could potentially be held off as it is likely that a grade this steep would likely lead to a natural opening occurring soon but due to a lack of natural openings with hs 4 3 m it is uncertain whether higher waves would inhibit or promote opening fig 6b natural openings occurred with higher hs mean of 2 3 m on average compared to successful artificial openings mean 2 0 m however the median 1 9 m was the same table 5 4 5 field observations of post opening geomorphic change for a subset of 28 openings the relationship between the grade at opening and geomorphic change during the opening were analysed using a combination of field data and observations recorded in literature fig 7 a l for outflow velocity openings with a steeper grade tended to reach a higher maximum velocity overall with the relationship between grade and maximum velocity showing a linear r2 of 0 59 fig 7a openings with a steeper grade also reached their maximum velocity faster and the average rate of change in velocity was higher compared to those with a more gradual grade fig 7b c both variables showed a non linear correlation with the grade at opening and had moderately strong relationships r2 of 0 66 for time to reach max velocity and 0 56 for average rate of change in velocity there was no clear relationship between the grade at opening and the maximum channel width but the time to reach the maximum channel width showed a modest correlation with grade linear r2 of 0 50 fig 7d e this means that openings with a steeper grade reached their maximum width faster but the grade did not necessarily impact on the maximum width overall openings with a steeper grade also saw a higher average rate of change in channel width linear r2 of 0 57 fig 7f the grade at opening did not show a strong correlation with the maximum discharge or the time taken to reach maximum discharge fig 7g h the average rate of change in discharge showed a moderate non linear relationship with grade at opening with a r2 of 0 42 but with several outliers in the dataset fig 7i this indicates that discharge at the mouth is likely controlled by variables other than grade potentially due to the influence of basin volume or morphology the grade at opening showed a moderately strong linear correlation r2 of 0 57 with the percent of the basin drained but the total drainage time i e time to reach a minimum water level did not correlate well with the grade at opening fig 7j k this is again likely because the basin size and morphology vary between sites and impacts on drainage time the average drainage rate showed a strong non linear correlation with the grade at opening r2 of 0 71 indicating that the grade at opening strongly controls the average rate of lagoon drainage during opening fig 7l the approximate basin volume at opening showed a stronger correlation with the maximum discharge and channel width compared to grade r2 of 0 53 and 0 43 fig 7m n this indicates that larger estuaries tend to reach higher peak discharges and erode larger channels however there was still considerable spread within the data 4 6 case studies as case studies to examine these relationships in more detail we compare between two artificial openings at the aire river victoria undertaken with different starting grades but similar lagoon water levels volumes upstream fluvial discharges into the estuary difference of 0 5 m3 s 1 department of environment land water and planning 2022 and offshore hs 1 the first opening in 2019 fig 8 a had a grade at opening of 1 39 lagoon water level of 1 55 m msl and offshore hs of 2 6 m the estuary was opened on a falling tide 2 the second opening in 2021 fig 8b had a more gradual grade at opening of 1 51 water level of 1 51 m msl and offshore hs of 2 7 m fig 8b the estuary was opened on a rising tide for the first opening maximum outflow velocity and channel width were reached within 4 h and maximum discharge within 5 h fig 8a the maximum velocity was 3 07 m s channel width 35 m and discharge 174 m3 s fig 8a the basin drained by 61 of its starting water level at an average drainage rate 0 05 m hour in comparison the second opening took much longer 18 h to reach peak values for all variables fig 8b the maximum velocity 2 4 m s and discharge 83 m3 s were lower than the previous opening but the maximum channel width was comparable 36 m fig 8b the basin water level decreased by 50 and the average drainage rate of the was 0 02 m hour both being less than the first opening the average rate of change in all variables was much slower during the second opening with the flow velocity and discharge hydrographs being more drawn out and channel width taking multiple tidal cycles to reach its maximum value fig 8a b because the estuary water level hs and upstream fluvial discharge at opening were similar these case studies demonstrate that the grade at opening is likely to influence the magnitude and rates of change of channel expansion velocity discharge and drainage during opening these case studies along with the openings examined in fig 6c demonstrate that the tidal stage i e rising or falling can play a key role in determining the rates of change in geomorphic variables the first opening at aire river fig 8a was undertaken on a falling tide with hydraulic head increasing throughout the first few hours of the opening the maximum outflow velocity and discharge occurred at the time of the next low tide 5 h after opening meaning the channel was in a state where it was not at risk of closing on the next rising tide essentially having already transitioned into stages 2 3 of gordon 1990 the second opening fig 8b occurred on a rising tide which decreased hydraulic head during the first few hours of the opening combined with the lower grade at opening the rising tide and decreasing head likely contributed to the slower rates of change during the first few hours of the opening fig 8b with the next low tide on 05 03 21 outflow velocity increased periodically then fell again at the time of the next high tide fig 8b on 06 03 21 the low tide was 0 5 m lower than on 05 03 21 coinciding with this low tide all variables reached their maximum values and rates of change increased fig 8b 5 discussion 5 1 controls on opening success from a range of physical variables the hydraulic gradient or grade and offshore hs at the time of opening determine the success of artificial entrance openings for ioces hydraulic gradient quantifies the balance between the forces driving hydraulic head and resisting the opening berm length hs represents another resisting force as waves work to infill the channel with sediment from the marine side from an analysis of 137 ioces openings globally we present an empirical model to predict if artificial openings will be successful in terms of staying open and draining the estuary lagoon fig 9 the parameters required to predict opening success i e berm length water level tidal elevation and hs can be easily and quickly measured in the field or freely obtained from predictions our model provides a way to incorporate geomorphic information into decision making about artificial openings and can act as a decision support tool although the decision to open ioces depends on a complex interplay of social cultural and ecological factors the thresholds determined from our study are particularly relevant when the primary management purpose is to ensure an estuary remains open to reduce flooding e g emergency openings from our data a grade threshold of 1 60 delineates between successful and unsuccessful openings this equates to a hydraulic gradient of 0 017 m m but from now onwards we will use the term grade for consistency this means that if the priority is to have an estuary stay open and drain its basin artificial openings should ideally be implemented when the grade is 1 60 or steeper considering the hs at the time of opening is important and neither variable can be looked at in isolation while hs varied widely across all unsuccessful openings no artificial openings were successful when hs was 4 3 m and when hs increases openings at less steeper grades become more unlikely to be successful from our dataset undertaking openings when the grade is 1 58 1 60 represents a zone of risk as some openings are still unsuccessful fig 9 openings undertaken when the grade is 1 58 1 60 tend to stay open for several days but not drain their basins 10 cm i e type 3 openings because the grade is below 1 60 openings in this zone are also at a risk higher of closing immediately if undertaken during larger wave heights combining grade or hydraulic gradient and hs represent a balance between the driving and resisting forces the head of the lagoon represents the destructive force promoting breaching and a longer berm represents the resting forces largier et al 2019 as the berm length shortens the increase in potential energy translates to faster outflow velocities and rates of offshore sediment transport gordon 1990 young 2018 with every opening a critical transport threshold fig 1a must be achieved so that offshore transport can be sustained over tidal cycles gordon 1990 furthermore this critical transport threshold must be able to overcome the competing delivery of onshore sediment from waves which can result in deposition that decreases channel slope and therefore the energy gradient small ioces opened in the zone of risk are likely more susceptible to closure than larger systems as they have shorter duration outflow periods resulting in reduced channel erosion overall for these small systems the thresholds of our study should be applied quite strictly and there is potential for the basin volume or estuary size to be incorporated as a modifier when considering risk of closure binary logistic regression analysis indicates that grade and hs are statistically significant predictors of opening success table 6 appendix 3 the regression model can be used in conjunction with the empirical model of fig 9 as a further assessment of whether an opening is likely to be successful or unsuccessful the regression results also enable us to assess the interplay between grade and hs in more detail grade has a more constant influence on opening outcome whereas hs has a wide range of influence with orders of magnitude difference table 6 this means that under very high waves hs can have a very strong impact on the likelihood of success for artificial openings the model was slightly less accurate in predicting unsuccessful openings but as more unsuccessful openings occur we can input data to further improve the model the same applies for openings in the zone of risk 5 2 natural vs artificial openings in our dataset natural openings occur at steeper grades on average compared to artificial openings table 5 this is to be expected as artificial openings pre empt the natural threshold for opening being crossed interestingly natural openings occurred at higher hs on average 2 31 m compared to artificial openings 2 00 m but across a similar range of hs table 5 this could be a function of two things 1 people try to avoid artificial openings during high waves or 2 because natural openings occur at steeper grades hs can be higher as the energy balance still swings in the favour of opening this second point is quite well represented in our dataset again confirming that the interplay of these two variables is key fig 9 hydraulic gradient thresholds have previously been used to predict the timing of natural openings from the lagoon side by kraus et al 2008 via the breach susceptibility index our data also suggests that the relationship between the grade and hs can potentially be used to predict proximity to a natural opening the management implications are that when the grade reaches 1 10 or steeper an estuary will likely be close to naturally opening and so artificial openings could be held off if flooding is not critically threatening people and property this would save costs and potentially reduce the risks of adverse effects on biota that can occur after artificial openings ribeiro et al 2013 one limitation is that we do not have good data to quantify what happens when the hs is high and grade is very steep under a very steep grade and particularly on coarser grained beaches high waves can add water to the lagoon resulting in seepage and piping on the berm face which act as a mechanism of natural opening typically on the falling tide kraus et al 2002 stretch and zeitsman 2004 we observed a natural opening to occur via this mechanism at the sherbrook river australia when then grade was 1 7 and hs 2 6 m see appendix 4 for details and images this opening is visible on fig 6a b as the natural opening with the steepest grade overall it is possible that at very steep grades and when the lagoon is close to the berm crest high waves may act as a mechanism for natural openings in this way however more observational data is needed natural openings are most common during falling tides due to the maximum energy gradient cooper 2001 and are particularly common on spring low tides bickerton and pierce 1988 5 3 controls on geomorphic change and drainage during an opening geomorphic change of the channel and the lagoon drainage rate is directly controlled by the grade at the time of opening fig 7a l and the rate at which an estuary transitions through the three geomorphic stages described by gordon 1990 fig 1 to ensure an estuary stays open and drains its basin the faster that stage 1 is completed and the channel reaches stages 2 or 3 will lessen the risk of the channel closing opening at a steeper grade sees an estuary reach a higher maximum outflow velocity overall and to reach that peak velocity faster fig 7a c openings with a steeper grade also reached their maximum channel width faster and saw higher rates of increase in average channel width fig 7e f this is likely a function of the maximum outflow velocity being reached faster facilitating more rapid channel expansion the grade at opening did not show a strong relationship with discharge at the mouth but rather the approximate basin volume was positively correlated with the maximum discharge and channel width fig 7g i m n this indicates that larger ioces and those opened with a higher water volume in the basin tend to incise larger channels due to higher fluvial power and potentially more sustained periods of high discharge opening at a steeper grade saw estuaries reduce their starting water level by a higher proportion overall and have a higher average drainage rate fig 7j l therefore if the goal is to keep an estuary open and drain its basin it is more likely to be successful at a steeper grade as critical transport conditions occur earlier in the opening sequence and the lagoon water level is lowered faster this means that by the next high tide where hydraulic head is lower due to the lower lagoon water level and higher tidal stage the estuary is already in a fluvial dominated state and likely to counter any wave driven deposition further even if the opening is on the falling limb of the hydrograph for discharge it has likely already drained sufficiently to alleviate flooding clearly opening at a steeper grade has potential to see an estuary track through the stages of gordon 1990 faster in terms of velocity channel width and lagoon drainage and meaning it is geomorphically more efficient at getting water off the floodplain and achieving its management purpose in reality an important consideration is that rapid drainage is not always ideal as it can contribute to mass fish deaths either due to the loss of the oxygen rich top layer of water when stratified or fish becoming stranded becker et al 2009 whitfield and cowley 2018 we will address this issue in later sections of the manuscript as illustrated by our dataset and the case studies examined in section 4 6 the tidal stage does not just influence the outcome of an opening but the rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage occurring during the opening figs 6c and 8a b this is an important consideration during the first few hours of opening when critical transport conditions and velocities need to be reached to initiate and maintain offshore sediment transport for openings close to the minimum 1 60 grade threshold for success opening on a falling tide may ensure that the grade steepens during the first few hours of opening and gives the opening sufficient energy to transition into stages 2 3 of the opening sequence of gordon 1990 5 4 implications for management our results show that the lagoon water level is not the only predictor of whether openings will be successful fig 5a which suggests that we need to rethink the way in which we decide when to artificially open ioces if the goal is to open ioces so that they stay open and drain their lagoons opening at a 1 60 grade threshold or steeper and during lower hs is important while hs is already commonly considered by managers egcma 2014 instead of opening when the water level reaches a set height or trigger level adding grade to the normal suite of variables to investigate would go a long way towards ensuring openings are successful practically this would mean that the berm length would need to be measured prior to each opening however this could be undertaken at a low cost and relatively easily e g surveying using a measuring wheel or by stepping out the berm if surveying equipment was not available essentially in a geomorphic sense the relationship between the forces promoting opening hydraulic head and resisting opening berm length and hs is critical and all of these variables need to be considered the stage of the tide and whether it is rising or falling is also very important and should be included in decision making in a consistent manner depending on the situation the tidal stage could be used to our advantage to either increase or decrease hydraulic head and shift an estuary towards being more likely to open and transition through the stags of gordon 1990 faster or potentially track through these stages slower opening at on a falling tide or mid falling tide might give openings a higher likelihood of being successful if they are on the cusp of the 1 60 grade threshold and an opening cannot be postponed as it would mean that hydraulic head is increasing in the critical first few hours of opening giving it the extra push the incise a channel and maintain offshore sediment transport our data suggests that the berm height does not play a critical role in determining the outcome of artificial openings as it is all about the energy gradient hydraulic head berm length while sometimes considered as a factor in decision making the berm height essentially only matters in terms of the volume of sand to be excavated which may increase cost of excavation for natural openings however the berm height relative to the lagoon water level may be important as an indicator of proximity to a natural opening the decision to artificially open ioces is complex and in reality there are many more considerations that simply getting an estuary to stay open and drain conde et al 2015 the decision to open or not will always depend on the individual opening the priority outcome and careful weighting of the risks vs benefits arundel 2006 and our model is intended as a guide that should complement other socio economic practical and environmental considerations and existing decision making frameworks conducting artificial openings so that they transition through the stages of gordon s 1990 model rapidly and drain rapidly could for example increase the risk of fish mortalities openings where the lagoon has drained quickly due to a steep grade at opening have seen fish become stranded on the floodplain whitfield and cowley 2018 therefore we anticipate that our thresholds and findings are most useful for emergency openings where the risks and benefits are carefully considered and the primary goal is to ensure an estuary stays open and reduces flooding when used as a supporting tool we anticipate that they would be useful in saving time and money by reducing the need for reimplementation reducing the number of artificial openings is important for maintaining high levels of scour and minimising detrimental environmental effects stephens and murtagh 2012 adams and van niekerk 2020 5 5 decision support tool for the first time we can give valid geomorphic thresholds to guide artificial opening decision making based on statistically significant predictors of opening success from this we present a simple decision support tool that can be used in conjunction with other tools or guidelines to provide an assessment of whether artificial openings are likely to be successful from a purely geomorphic perspective fig 10 this tool is useful when either there is sufficient data to predict that there is no adverse risk to biota etc or when the most important consideration is to ensure the estuary stays open and drains sufficiently to reduce flooding we recognise that the decision to open estuaries is complex and has many interacting elements however our tool can be utilised in line with existing procedures and at minimal to no cost for example as a spreadsheet that calculates grade from estuary water level berm length and tidal elevation at the time of opening to exemplify the use of our decision support tool when the primary purpose is to drain the lagoon and reduce flooding we apply the tool to two sites the aire river and curdies inlet australia fig 11 a e both sites saw artificial openings implemented because of emergency flooding closure occurring within hours with no lagoon drainage and then a further opening implemented days later that was then successful on 01 05 14 aire river yellow circle on fig 11a was opened at a steep grade of 1 15 well within the range for success but when hs was very high at 4 8 m there was substantial flooding so a decision to artificially open was made however due to high waves the channel infilled within several hours fig 11b the ideal scenario as guided by our decision support tool fig 10 would have been to wait until hs decreased and then undertake the opening alternatively if the grade increased to 1 10 or steeper managers could consider waiting for a natural opening to minimise risk to the system in saying this we recognise that the situation is not always that simple due to public pressure feasibility to get machinery to the mouth and the hazard and economic implications of flooding however a second opening on the 10 05 14 yellow square on fig 11a was then undertaken at a similar grade but once hs had decreased to 1 5 m and was successful on 16 06 19 curdies inlet orange circle on fig 11a was opened at a grade of 1 66 when hs was 3 2 m fig 11c again waves infilled the channel but due to the low grade combined with relatively high waves outflow did not reach sufficient velocities to incise a channel after excavation the combination of a low grade and relatively high waves led to immediate closure fig 11c the opening was also conducted on a rising tide fig 11e in following our decision support tool fig 10 we would recommend that the opening be undertaken on the falling tide to maximise hydraulic head and increase the grade or wait until more favourable conditions on 17 06 19 a second opening was undertaken orange square on fig 11a in more favourable conditions and was successful the grade had increased to 1 41 hs was 2 6 m and the opening was undertaken on a falling tide fig 11d e we attribute the success of this opening to the lower waves steeper grade and the opening being undertaken on a falling tide which maximised hydraulic head during the first few critical hours of opening in addition to the decision support tool of figs 9 and 10 our binary logistic regression model can be used as a further method of assessment in applying the model to the two openings at curdies inlet for example the model predicted the first opening to have a 97 chance of failing which it did and the second opening which was successful to have a 1 chance of failing combing the thresholds and decision support tool figs 9 and 10 the regression model table 6 and a consideration of the tidal stage allows for a sound assessment of whether an opening is likely to be successful or not purely in terms of staying open and draining tis lagoon 6 conclusions using data from 137 estuary entrance openings we present a simple and straight forward way to predict the outcome of artificial openings that will reduce the number of unsuccessful openings and the costs and environmental risks associated with reimplementation the grade or hydraulic gradient and hs at the time of opening control whether artificial openings will be successful importantly the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of opening success despite it being widely used to decide when to implement artificial openings a grade of 1 60 or steeper is required for a successful opening but opening estuaries at grades between 1 60 and 1 58 can still be risky especially when offshore waves are high no opening was successful when hs was 4 3 m or higher and openings at higher wave heights generally need a steeper grade to be successful the grade at opening also strongly influences the rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage during artificial openings there is potential to use the tidal stage to our advantage to either speed up or slow down the rate of channel expansion increases in outflow velocity and lagoon drainage particularly during the early stages of an opening the parameters required to predict the outcome of artificial openings using our method i e berm length water level tidal elevation and hs can be easily measured in the field or freely obtained from predictions or remote sensing e g berm length could be measured using coastsnap and inlettracker heimhuber et al 2021 the thresholds and models presented can be tested and refined as more data is collected we envisage that the thresholds and basic decision support tools developed here will be most useful when the primary management goal is to keep an estuary open and drain the lagoon to reduce flooding the decision when to implement artificial openings remains complex and we caution that while these thresholds provide specific guidance in terms of geomorphic processes they should always be considered in conjunction with other environmental cultural socio economic and practical factors relevant to the decision making process lastly the thresholds from our study have only proved to apply for microtidal estuaries with sizes and morphologies as described in table 1 and appendix 1 further research is needed to test their applicability to meso tidal systems where the tidal range is larger and may impact on changes in hydraulic head prior to and during openings credit authorship contribution statement sarah louise mcsweeney

2101,intermittently open closed estuaries ioces are dynamic sensitive estuaries that periodically close as a function of competing marine and fluvial energies once closed ioces are often artificially opened to relieve localised flooding artificial openings are generally effective as a short term flood mitigation strategy however sometimes ioces can close immediately after excavation without draining the lagoon in this situation the opening does not achieve its management purpose and reimplementation is required costing many thousands of dollars at a time and leading to adverse impacts on estuary biota using a dataset of 137 openings at 37 ioces globally we show that the hydraulic gradient or grade at opening and offshore significant wave height determine whether an estuary will remain open and drain its lagoon the hydraulic gradient represents the energy slope between the estuary and the ocean and wave height determines the capacity of waves to infill the channel with sediment to counter offshore erosion artificial openings are only successful when ioces are opened with a hydraulic gradient steeper than 0 017 m m equivalent to a grade of 1 60 and when significant wave height is below 4 30 m these findings highlight that the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of opening success despite it being widely used to decide when to implement artificial openings using near continuous monitoring of geomorphic change at 28 artificial openings we show that the hydraulic gradient and grade at the time of opening controls the rate of channel expansion outflow velocity at the mouth lagoon drainage rate and the time to reach peak channel width and outflow velocities the tidal stage at opening can be used to either speed up or slow down the rates of change potentially reducing the occurrence of fish kills associated with rapid drainage although the decision to open an estuary is a complex balance between environmental cultural socio economic and practical factors we present a simple and cost effective way to predict if artificial openings will be successful the thresholds of our study can be used to complement existing decision support tools but as a standalone method are best suited for emergency openings where draining the lagoon to reduce flooding is the main management priority keywords estuary estuary entrance processes intermittently open closed estuaries estuary management artificial openings data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction intermittently open closed estuaries ioces are dynamic and sensitive estuaries with entrances that close as a function of competing marine vs fluvial energies ranasinghe et al 1999 slinger 2017 once closed ioces are often artificially opened to relieve localised flooding within the basin sinclair et al 2022 however the imbalance of energies can result in immediate closure and managers are forced to reopen estuaries at the expense of citizens and risk further degradation of water quality and aquatic habitat becker et al 2009 mcsweeney et al 2018 the decision to open an estuary requires careful consideration of social and environmental factors as openings can have severe ecological consequences associated with the rapid decrease in water level e g mass fish deaths and changes in community structure keneley et al 2013 conde et al 2019 adams and van niekerk 2020 however the process of opening an estuary at a time such that it remains open and drains its basin is simply a physical process what is needed is an understanding of the processes and variables necessary to predict if an estuary once opened will remain open and drain thereby alleviating flooding and reducing the need for reimplementation this will enable a better assessment of the potential biological and social benefits vs trade offs of artificial openings and add a further layer to existing management tools ioces are common in wave dominated settings globally comprising 15 of all estuaries on microtidal coasts mcsweeney et al 2017 their entrance state is controlled by the net direction of sediment transport at the mouth and when onshore sediment transport via waves dominates over offshore sediment transport via ebb tidal currents ioces close ranasinghe and pattiaratchi 2003 behrens et al 2013 orescanin et al 2021 during this closed state the lagoon water level will rise and can inundate property and infrastructure on the floodplain to mitigate against flooding ioces are artificially opened before a natural opening threshold is reached artificial openings involve excavation of a channel through the berm to reconnect the estuary to the sea while most artificial openings are undertaken for flood mitigation purposes they can be implemented to allow fish passage to the ocean crippa et al 2013 largier et al 2019 recruit juvenile fish and prawns griffiths 1999 reduce nutrient levels conde et al 2015 or improve water quality and

unsuccessful as it does not achieve its management purposes of keeping the entrance open and reducing flooding reimplementation is then required often costing tens of thousands of dollars east

predict when openings will be successful is critical to reducing the need for reimplementation for the purposes of this study we define a successful opening as one that stays open after excavation and achieves its management purpose of sufficiently draining the basin to reduce flooding currently the lagoon water level is the most widely used determinant for deciding when to implement artificial openings haines and thom 2007 schallenberg et al 2010 adams and van niekerk 2020 openings are usually undertaken when the lagoon water level reaches a set elevation i e often called a trigger height or when critical infrastructure becomes inundated everett et al 2007 conde et al 2019 whitfield et al 2012 when possible openings are implemented prior to forecast rainfall to coincide with increased river flow and avoided when offshore swells are high whitfield et al 2012 conde et al 2015 we propose that considering the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of whether an artificial opening will be successful rather a combination of factors which influence capacity of the channel to erode and transport sediment seaward beck and basson 2008 the three stage semi empirical model of gordon 1990 provides a good summary of the idealised sequence of geomorphic change during a successful estuary entrance opening fig 1 a f for an estuary to stay open and drain it needs to transition through stage 1 to surpass some critical velocity threshold whereby it can maintain offshore sediment transport in this model stage 1 sees the initial connection to the ocean via a narrow shallow channel fig 1a c erosion rates are low as the threshold conditions for sediment transport are only marginally exceeded outflow velocity is initially a function of the energy slope between the estuary and the ocean gordon 1990 in stage 2 the flow becomes supercritical outflow velocity increases and a semi circular weir develops at the upstream end of the channel fig 1a a series of hydraulic jumps form downstream of the weir which migrate upstream fig 1d e the channel widens and incises at a faster rate and as discharge at the mouth increases the lagoon drains more rapidly stretch and parkinson 2006a 2006b wainwright and baldock 2015 mcsweeney et al 2020 bed slope adjustment translates upstream and eventually the weir migrates into the lagoon and collapses causing a transition into stage 3 gordon 1990 in stage 3 the flow becomes subcritical fig 1a f as hydraulic head between the estuary and ocean decreases channel expansion slows discharge enters the falling limb of the hydrograph and the estuary water level eventually stabilises at an elevation near mean sea level msl fig 1a in the context of fig 1a unsuccessful openings essentially bypass stages 2 and 3 and track directly back to a closed state fig 1a f this is due to either a outflow velocity being insufficient to initiate or maintain offshore sediment transport gordon 1990 b high offshore waves that overwhelm seaward erosion and infill the channel with sediment mcsweeney et al 2018 or c a combination of both a and b we hypothesise that it is possible to pinpoint the thresholds for implementing successful artificial openings as based on the interaction of three simple variables at the time of opening hydraulic head i e the head difference between the estuary and the ocean berm length and offshore wave height high hydraulic head and short berm lengths have been recognised as an important factor driving natural openings cooper 2001 kraus et al 2002 2008 but despite this they have not been widely quantified for artificial openings largely due to a lack of data to calculate the berm length at the scale of the entrance these three variables hydraulic head berm length and wave height represent the balance between the driving and resisting forces for opening hydraulic head represents the energy available to initiate and maintain an entrance opening while the berm length represents the distance over which that energy is expended in transporting sediment seaward dividing hydraulic head by the berm length quantifies the hydraulic gradient the hydraulic gradient is the driving force that causes water to move in the direction of maximum decreasing head i e seaward harvey and odum 1990 robinson et al 2006 conceptually openings are likely to be unsuccessful when hydraulic head between the estuary and the ocean is low and the berm length long this results in a lower energy gradient which translates to less potential energy lower outflow velocity and a reduced capacity to erode sediment seaward gordon 1990 parkinson and stretch 2007 beck and basson 2008 young 2018 largier et al 2019 offshore wave height adds a third element high waves are likely to increase deposition rates in the channel and push the estuary towards closure especially if outflow velocity is low and cannot counteract wave driven deposition ranasinghe et al 1999 morris and turner 2010 given this we propose that some critical ratio between the hydraulic gradient and wave height at opening can predict the success of artificial openings in this study we aim to a identify whether the hydraulic gradient is a good predictor of whether artificial openings will be successful b determine the critical relationship between hydraulic gradient and offshore wave height that may delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings and c determine if opening at different hydraulic gradients impacts on the rates and magnitude of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage during opening for c this will enable us to determine if the hydraulic gradient is a critical factor in ensuring that the estuary will track throughout the full opening sequence of gordon 1990 as per fig 1a f and not revert back to immediate closure the decision to artificially open ioces is complex and the goal of this study is to provide guidance for estuary entrance management especially when the priority is to reduce flooding e g emergency artificial openings the hydraulic gradient can be easily measured at a low cost and the thresholds established from our study can be converted into a simple and cost effective decision support tool to complement existing decision making procedures as an adaptive management tool artificial openings are likely to remain an essential management practice into the future especially given the predicted increases in coastal flooding due to sea level rise haines and thom 2007 gerwing et al 2020 stein et al 2021 the findings presented here will aid managers to avoid undertaking artificial openings at times when they are likely to be unsuccessful and thus reduce the need for reimplementation reducing the need to reimplement openings may reduce biological effects although draining an estuary quickly can cause abrupt changes in the system and so we stress that openings should be decided upon on a case by case basis given these potential risks vs benefits 2 regional setting we have analysed estuary entrance openings at 37 ioces in the u s a south africa australia and brazil table 1 fig 2 a d study sites were selected because there were historic records of the timing of entrance openings and data enabling us to calculate the hydraulic gradient at opening because ioces are constrained to wave dominated coasts and front rivers with seasonally or interannually variable flow regimes the broad scale boundary conditions are similar for all study sites whitfield and bate 2007 mcsweeney et al 2017 clark and o connor 2019 a detailed description of the regional setting for each study site is provided in appendix 1 all ioces in our analysis are found on beaches with medium to coarse grained sand and most are in temperate climate zones appendix 1 3 material and methods we have collated records of 137 estuary entrance openings at 37 ioces table 1 for 123 openings we could also determine the offshore hs at the time of each opening and the change in estuary water level pre post opening table 1 for a further 14 openings there was no information for hs as the time of opening was not available or the exact pre post opening change in water level but the hg and grade were known see table 1 sites denoted with all openings were classified as being successful or unsuccessful and the thresholds of hydraulic gradient significant wave height hs and a suite of morphological variables e g lagoon water level and berm length were compared between openings thresholds of hydraulic gradient grade and hs were extracted to delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings and the statistical significance of grade and hs as predictors of opening outcome were tested using binary logistic regression analysis using a subset of 28 artificial openings which we were able to measure in the field or obtain high enough temporal resolution data from literature we then determine the relationship between the hydraulic gradient and grade at opening to the magnitude and rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage these 28 openings were selected as we had measured the whole drainage sequence in the field or had high confidence in the data 3 1 records of estuary entrance openings the time and date of each estuary opening was determined from direct observations during field work existing literature council records or citizen scientist databases full information of the sources of data for each site is included in appendix 2 t1 and s1 contains the timing and date of all openings council records of estuary entrance openings were obtained from the shoalhaven city council for lakes tabourie and conjola in new south wales australia and via the estuary entrance management support system eemss for 10 sites in victoria australia eemss is a decision support tool used by estuary managers which records the time and date of openings mode of opening i e natural or artificial and the water level prior to and after opening arundel 2006 a main source of citizen scientist data was the estuarywatch program which aims to capture information immediately prior to and after estuary entrance openings at ioces in victoria corangamite catchment management authority 2012 estuarywatch volunteers record the time and date of openings mode of opening estuary water level berm height and length and take photos of the entrance morphology data from estuarywatch was often used in conjunction with records from eemss to cross check the timing of openings a further source of citizen scientist data was coastsnap harley et al 2019 which was used specifically for narrabeen lagoon in new south wales coastsnap is a database of crowd sourced images captured from public smartphone cameras where the time and date stamp of each image is recorded because of the high frequency of images capturing estuary entrance openings i e where the excavator was visible the time stamp of images could be used to determine the time of opening for natural openings recorded by estuarywatch most had a known time of breaching recorded but if the precise time was unknown e g it was said to breach overnight the opening was assumed to occur at low tide this is because natural openings mainly occur at low tides when a sufficient gradient exists to permit channel scouring bickerton and pierce 1988 cooper 2001 we recognise that we cannot determine the precise timing of these natural openings but assuming they occurred at low tide the time of breaching was likely accurate to within 3 h as tides in victoria are semi diurnal for ioces with water level gauges in their lagoons gauged data was used to cross check the timing of openings 3 2 hydraulic gradient and grade calculation for each estuary entrance opening we calculated the hydraulic gradient and grade at the time of opening the hydraulic gradient is a ratio between the height difference between the estuary water level and the sea level i e hydraulic head and the distance across the berm fig 3 a b this best represents the energy slope between the estuary and ocean and is calculated as per eq 1 1 h y d r a u l i c g r a d i e n t h 1 h 2 b l where hydraulic gradient is in m m h1 is the lagoon surface water elevation at the time of opening in m relative to msl h2 is the sea level at the time of opening in m msl and bl is the berm length at the time of opening in m fig 3a b the hydraulic gradient is then converted to grade eq 2 2 grade 1 h y d r a u l i c g r a d i e n t the estuary water level at the time of opening h1 was either taken from water level gauges in the estuary local council or citizen scientist records also recorded from gauges or known elevations recorded in literature all water levels were measured or corrected to be relative to msl for sea level h2 we used the ocean tidal elevation at the time of opening we recognise that using the tidal elevation alone does not account for nearshore wave setup wind effects or changes in barometric pressure but for the purposes of this study we chose to keep our calculation simple so it could be easily recreated by without the use of complex equations or modelling tidal elevations were taken from tide charts at the time of the opening and when necessary corrected from local chart datum to be relative to msl using corrections from the closest tidal gauge for openings that we monitored directly in the field the berm length was surveyed using a trimble r6 real time kinematic rtk gps immediately prior to opening the berm length was surveyed as extending from the most seaward extent of the lagoon to the most landward edge of the swash zone with the seaward limit identified as a visual average over several minutes fig 3a b for lakes tabourie and conjola shoalhaven city council provided surveyed berm lengths taken prior to openings for openings documented by estuarywatch the berm length was monitored prior to opening by citizen scientists in the field see corangamite catchment management authority 2012 for methods openings were only included if the berm had been surveyed within 14 days of an opening see s1 we recognise that a longer duration between berm length measurements and the timing of opening may induce error but it is likely that the berm length will only decrease as the estuary water level rises and the estuary approaches an opening this means that the berm length for openings with a longer duration between the measurement and entrance opening it is likely a maximum possible value for all openings sourced from literature the berm length was measured in the field and was surveyed on the same day as opening for narrabeen lagoon coastsnap was used to obtain berm lengths harley et al 2019 harley and kinsela 2022 crowd sourced smartphone images were georectified using pre existing ground control points in coastsnap v3 software run in matlab r2021a berm lengths were then extracted from the georectified images for berm lengths measured by estuarywatch local councils recorded in literature and as extracted from coastsnap berm length was consistently defined in the same manner as our field data and as shown in fig 3a b the average time between berm length measurements and entrance opening for the whole dataset was 2 5 days median of 0 days 3 3 wave heights to analyse the influence of wave height offshore hs at the time of each opening was determined hs was obtained from a combination of buoy observations hindcast data from national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa s wavewatch iii wwiii v 3 14 tolman 2009 or as recorded in literature appendix 2 hindcast data was only used for estuaries in victoria where wwiii has been proven to be a reliable source of wave data and shows good agreement with satellite altimetry visual observations and buoys hemer et al 2007 mcsweeney 2020 for hindcast data hs was taken as an hourly average and hindcast from the nearest location to the estuary entrance at 0 5 resolution while use of offshore hs may not account for nearshore changes in wave characteristics it is appropriate for our study as this data would be most readily and freely available via wave and weather forecasts for managers who wish to assess the influence of hs on estuary entrance openings for several openings described in literature only the hydraulic gradient or grade at opening for past successful openings was recorded table 1 for these openings we could not determine the hs as the precise date or time of opening was not provided but include the hydraulic gradient and grade in our analysis for successful openings 3 4 lagoon water level analysis and classifying openings for sites with water level gauges within the basin or sufficient data from council and citizen scientist records we calculated the pre post opening change in water level and the total drainage time drainage time was calculated as the duration between the time of opening and until the water level reached a minimum value after which it did not fall any further all openings in our dataset were classified as being successful or unsuccessful as based whether the opening achieved its main management purposes of a opening the entrance b keeping the entrance open and c reducing the lagoon water level sufficiently to alleviate flooding the total drop in water level was used to assist classification openings that closed immediately after excavation were deemed unsuccessful also classified as unsuccessful were openings which stayed open for hours to days but the drop in basin water level did not exceed 10 cm and where flooding was not reduced a 10 cm reduction in water level was used as a threshold as 10 cm of drainage was insufficient to reduce flooding based on field observations in victoria unsuccessful openings of this type were all sites in victoria that closed within 1 5 days of excavation with reimplementation occurring soon after our pre post opening water level dataset also had a clear break in drainage values of 10 cm and 25 cm enabling 10 cm to be a logical threshold to delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings see s1 successful openings were those which stayed open after excavation and drained the lagoon by 10 cm to reduce flooding morphologic information from field observations photo evidence and descriptions of each opening were also used to support the classification of openings being successful or unsuccessful 3 5 factors that determine opening success once openings were classified as successful or unsuccessful a series of physical parameters at the time of opening were investigated as drivers of success parameters included the pre opening water level hydraulic head berm length hydraulic gradient grade and hs distributions and descriptive statistics of each parameter were created for successful and unsuccessful openings thresholds were then extracted for parameters hs hydraulic gradient and grade that clearly delineated between successful and unsuccessful openings to statistically analyse the relationship between grade hs and opening type i e successful vs unsuccessful we undertook binary logistic regression in ibm spss statistics software v 28 grade also representing hydraulic gradient as its inverse value and hs values were input for a range of successful n 105 and unsuccessful n 18 openings with successful openings classified as group 1 and unsuccessful as group 2 one outlier in the unsuccessful opening dataset was removed as the cook s d value and z residual were extremely high fox 1997 removing this outlier improved model performance the model was validated via the chi squared value pseudo r squared values cox and snell and nagelkerke values hosmer and lemeshow test value percentage classified as correct and then applied to several openings as a test where the outcome was known 3 6 geomorphic change during openings for 28 artificial openings at 15 different sites we collated measurements of the change in channel width depth outflow velocity discharge and water level during the drainage period either from field monitoring or as extracted from literature table 2 for six sites in victoria we monitored geomorphic change in the field after each artificial opening table 2 monitoring commenced prior to channel excavation and occurred near continuously for up to 2 days after opening until the estuary had stopped draining estuary entrance morphology was measured using a rtk gps along a fixed cross section at the inlet throat when strong outflow prevented crossing of the channel the channel width was measured using a laser range finder and the depth was measured with a stadia pole with both averaged at least three times outflow surface velocity was measured at the inlet throat corresponding with the timing of each morphological survey velocities were measured in the centre of the channel i e the thalweg using a marsh mcbirney portable flow meter mounted on a wading rod while measuring velocities across the cross section and to capture changes with depth would be ideal this was outside the scope of our study as we were constrained by time and strong outflow during field work when strong outflow prevented readings being taken directly in the channel floats were used to measure outflow velocity timed over 10 m at least three velocity measurements were taken each time and then averaged velocities measured by these two methods were comparable within 0 2 m s on average discharge was calculated using the cross sectional area from morphological surveys and the average outflow velocity the estuary water level was monitored continuously via telemetry gauges or through the deployment of pressure transducers anchored in the estuary basin pressure transducer data was corrected for barometric pressure fluctuations and all water level measurements corrected to msl through literature mining we obtained similar datasets of field observations of geomorphic change and lagoon water level for 10 artificial openings table 2 our field monitoring methods were similar to those used in literature e g smith and zarillo 1988 and enable consistency when comparing to our field data most datasets obtained from literature had near continuous measurements of outflow velocity channel width and discharge during the drainage period enabling us to track change over time openings at bot river terrigal lagoon and wilson inlet had no velocity measurements recorded the 1994 opening at wamberal lagoon had no velocity data and only the maximum discharge was available for terrigal lagoon which was modelled using both the field and literature datasets we extracted the maximum channel width velocity and discharge for each opening and the time taken in hours to reach these maximum values we then calculated an average rate of change for each opening and each parameter maximum values the time to reach the maximum and the average rate of change were correlated with the grade at opening grade 1 hydraulic gradient to determine if grade influences these parameters the grade at opening was also correlated with the percent of the basin drained calculated as the end of drainage water level relative to the starting value total drainage time and the average rate of drainage parameters were also correlated with an estimate of the basin water volume at opening two sites were excluded from this analysis as they were outliers with very large swa relative to the other sites wilson inlet 48 km2 and bot river 14 km2 table 1 basin volume was calculated from the surface water area in table 1 multiplied by hydraulic head this is an approximation only as detailed measurements of basin volume were outside the scope of the study and no bathymetric data was available when graphing relationships the estuary surface water area swa table 1 was used to classify sites into four size categories 1 swa of 0 0 0 5 km2 2 0 5 1 0 km2 3 1 0 2 0 km2 and 4 2 0 km2 to visually assess any grouping effects of size 4 results 4 1 classifying the outcome of openings based on morphologic observations and the pre post opening change in water level we observe three types of opening to occur table 3 fig 4 a c type 1 openings are successful openings as they maintain an open entrance after channel excavation and drain the lagoon substantially to reduce flooding fig 4a type 2 and 3 openings are considered unsuccessful as they do not achieve their management aims type 2 openings see the estuary entrance close immediately after opening and the lagoon water level does not decrease at all fig 4b type 3 openings may maintain an open entrance after excavation but channel incision and expansion are limited and the lagoon water level does not fall 10 cm fig 4c all type 3 openings closed within several days of opening e g fig 4c overall 119 openings were classified as being successful type 1 and 18 were unsuccessful with 14 being type 2 and four being type 3 table 3 the 14 openings where the precise change in water level was not available were all classified as being successful type 1 openings this is because descriptions in literature morphological measurements or photo evidence indicate substantial incision and widening of the channel and a marked decrease in estuary water level 10 cm e g the presence of scarps incision at the former berm position channel bank erosion or exposure of the lagoon bed after drainage applying this classification to the 137 openings we can now analyse the physical drivers that determine the outcome of entrance openings in more detail 4 2 factors influencing the outcome of estuary entrance openings the distributions of a range of physical variables measured prior to opening were compared against the different types of openings as defined in table 3 fig 5 a f table 4 all variables aside from hydraulic gradient and grade show a large degree of overlap between successful i e type 1 and unsuccessful i e types 2 and 3 openings fig 5a d pre opening water level and hydraulic head were both higher on average for successful openings but showed considerable overlap with unsuccessful openings indicating that these parameters alone are not good predictors of whether an opening will be successful table 4 fig 5a b for both parameters the range for successful openings was larger than that of unsuccessful openings fig 5a b for berm length successful openings had lower i e shorter berm length s on average compared to unsuccessful openings but again there was a high degree of overlap fig 5c several unsuccessful openings occurred with berm length s lower than the mean for successful openings 61 m indicating that berm length alone does not delineate between successful and unsuccessful openings fig 5c table 4 successful openings occurred with lower hs on average but again there was substantial overlap for the different types of opening table 4 fig 5d interestingly one opening proved to be unsuccessful at maintaining an open entrance i e being a type 2 opening at a hs as low as 0 61 m fig 5d no opening was successful when hs was 4 3 m table 4 out of all variables hydraulic gradient and grade show the most definitive split between successful and unsuccessful openings fig 5e f successful openings tend to have steeper grades and hydraulic gradients than unsuccessful openings overall fig 5e f table 4 the lowest hydraulic gradient that an estuary entrance opening has been successful at is 0 017 m m which translates to a grade of 1 60 fig 5e f table 4 this 1 60 threshold represents a clear break between successful and unsuccessful openings an exception is the three outliers shown on fig 5f under type 2 openings where the corresponding hs is labelled for each opening for these openings despite the grade being 1 60 the hs was 4 1 5 1 m being above the 95th percentile of hs 4 0 m for all openings this indicates that even when the grade at opening is above the 1 60 threshold if hs is extremely high openings can be unsuccessful this indicates the interplay of hydraulic gradient or grade and hs likely determines the outcome of an opening 4 3 thresholds of hydraulic gradient grade and hs the relationship between hydraulic gradient and grade vs hs at opening for all 123 openings with hs data is shown in fig 6 a b using grade vs hs a 1 60 threshold equivalent to a hydraulic gradient of 0 017 m m delineates between most successful and unsuccessful openings regardless of hs fig 6b table 5 however there are four openings with grades steeper than 1 60 that were still unsuccessful these openings are annotated on fig 6b and are as follows 1 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 15 and hs 4 8 m 2 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 35 and hs 5 1 m 3 a type 2 opening with a grade of 1 58 and hs 4 1 m and 4 a type 3 opening with a grade of 1 59 and hs 1 8 m for 1 and 2 these openings likely closed due to high waves 4 5 m that overwhelmed offshore sediment transport in the channel for 3 this opening was likely unsuccessful due to the hs 4 1 m being still quite high and coupled with a grade 1 58 which is very close to the 1 60 threshold for 4 the 1 8 m hs is below the mean hs 2 05 m for all successful openings indicating that waves were unlikely to play a key role in closing the entrance for this opening the low grade 1 59 was likely the primary cause this indicates that while the 1 60 grade threshold is a good predictor of opening outcome openings with grades of 1 58 1 60 are still at risk of closure and are more likely to not substantially drain their basins this indicates an area of risk to consider when implementing artificial openings to analyse the drivers of unsuccessful openings in more detail we compare the timing of the opening relative to the tidal stage for the nine unsuccessful openings undertaken with a grade 1 70 and hs 4 5 m fig 6c openings with a grade 1 70 were chosen as they are close to the 1 60 threshold and a hs 4 5 m excludes openings which likely closed due to very high waves all of these openings aside from one merri river were implemented on a rising tide fig 6c for openings 3 gellibrand river grade 1 58 and 4 aire river grade 1 59 mentioned in section 4 3 above both openings were implemented on a rising tide and 6 h prior to the next high fig 6c this means that in addition to having a grade close to the 1 60 threshold at opening hydraulic head would be progressively decreasing over several hours as the tide rises fig 6c the one unsuccessful opening that occurred on a falling tide merri river was undertaken on a mixed semidiurnal tide where the fall in tidal stage from the time of opening until the next low was only 0 38 m with a longer than normal 6 h duration until the next low 21 08 18 fig 6c this indicates that openings undertaken on a rising tide are more likely to be unsuccessful because as the tide rises hydraulic head is decreasing considering the tidal stage is important for openings at grades close to the 1 60 threshold as exemplified by openings 3 and 4 opening on a rising tide is likely to decrease the chance of an opening being successful when the grade is on the cusp of the 1 60 threshold a binary logistic regression model was performed to assess whether grade and hs are statistically significant in predicting the outcome of openings i e successful or unsuccessful the overall model was found to be statistically significant with a significant chi squared value p 0 001 and a nagelkerke r squared value of 0 79 see appendix 3 for full validation the hosmer and lemeshow test value 0 98 was not significant indicating an adequate model fit results indicate that both grade and hs show a statistically significant influence on the outcome of artificial openings table 6 hs is a positive predictor of the probability of an opening being unsuccessful b 1 538 s e 0 64 wald χ2 1 5 739 p 0 017 and grade is also a positive predictor of the probability of an opening being unsuccessful b 0 357 s e 0 119 wald χ2 1 9 049 p 0 003 specifically the odds of an opening being unsuccessful will be on average increased by 365 for every per unit increase in hs and by 42 9 for every per unit increase in grade table 6 the 95 confidence intervals indicate that hs has a wide range of influence with orders of magnitude difference whereas grade has a more constant influence with a narrower confidence interval table 6 the model correctly predicted 99 of successful openings and 77 of unsuccessful openings giving an overall percentage correct prediction rate of 96 table 6 the model was slightly less accurate in predicting unsuccessful openings 4 4 natural vs artificial openings in comparing the hydraulic gradient and grade values for natural vs artificial openings natural openings occurred at steeper grades and hydraulic gradients than artificial openings on average table 5 fig 6d e the most gradual grade that a natural opening occurred at was 1 53 and the steepest was 1 7 table 5 the most gradual grade for a successful artificial opening was 1 60 and the steepest was 1 10 table 5 fig 6b when the grade reaches 1 10 we suggest that artificial openings could potentially be held off as it is likely that a grade this steep would likely lead to a natural opening occurring soon but due to a lack of natural openings with hs 4 3 m it is uncertain whether higher waves would inhibit or promote opening fig 6b natural openings occurred with higher hs mean of 2 3 m on average compared to successful artificial openings mean 2 0 m however the median 1 9 m was the same table 5 4 5 field observations of post opening geomorphic change for a subset of 28 openings the relationship between the grade at opening and geomorphic change during the opening were analysed using a combination of field data and observations recorded in literature fig 7 a l for outflow velocity openings with a steeper grade tended to reach a higher maximum velocity overall with the relationship between grade and maximum velocity showing a linear r2 of 0 59 fig 7a openings with a steeper grade also reached their maximum velocity faster and the average rate of change in velocity was higher compared to those with a more gradual grade fig 7b c both variables showed a non linear correlation with the grade at opening and had moderately strong relationships r2 of 0 66 for time to reach max velocity and 0 56 for average rate of change in velocity there was no clear relationship between the grade at opening and the maximum channel width but the time to reach the maximum channel width showed a modest correlation with grade linear r2 of 0 50 fig 7d e this means that openings with a steeper grade reached their maximum width faster but the grade did not necessarily impact on the maximum width overall openings with a steeper grade also saw a higher average rate of change in channel width linear r2 of 0 57 fig 7f the grade at opening did not show a strong correlation with the maximum discharge or the time taken to reach maximum discharge fig 7g h the average rate of change in discharge showed a moderate non linear relationship with grade at opening with a r2 of 0 42 but with several outliers in the dataset fig 7i this indicates that discharge at the mouth is likely controlled by variables other than grade potentially due to the influence of basin volume or morphology the grade at opening showed a moderately strong linear correlation r2 of 0 57 with the percent of the basin drained but the total drainage time i e time to reach a minimum water level did not correlate well with the grade at opening fig 7j k this is again likely because the basin size and morphology vary between sites and impacts on drainage time the average drainage rate showed a strong non linear correlation with the grade at opening r2 of 0 71 indicating that the grade at opening strongly controls the average rate of lagoon drainage during opening fig 7l the approximate basin volume at opening showed a stronger correlation with the maximum discharge and channel width compared to grade r2 of 0 53 and 0 43 fig 7m n this indicates that larger estuaries tend to reach higher peak discharges and erode larger channels however there was still considerable spread within the data 4 6 case studies as case studies to examine these relationships in more detail we compare between two artificial openings at the aire river victoria undertaken with different starting grades but similar lagoon water levels volumes upstream fluvial discharges into the estuary difference of 0 5 m3 s 1 department of environment land water and planning 2022 and offshore hs 1 the first opening in 2019 fig 8 a had a grade at opening of 1 39 lagoon water level of 1 55 m msl and offshore hs of 2 6 m the estuary was opened on a falling tide 2 the second opening in 2021 fig 8b had a more gradual grade at opening of 1 51 water level of 1 51 m msl and offshore hs of 2 7 m fig 8b the estuary was opened on a rising tide for the first opening maximum outflow velocity and channel width were reached within 4 h and maximum discharge within 5 h fig 8a the maximum velocity was 3 07 m s channel width 35 m and discharge 174 m3 s fig 8a the basin drained by 61 of its starting water level at an average drainage rate 0 05 m hour in comparison the second opening took much longer 18 h to reach peak values for all variables fig 8b the maximum velocity 2 4 m s and discharge 83 m3 s were lower than the previous opening but the maximum channel width was comparable 36 m fig 8b the basin water level decreased by 50 and the average drainage rate of the was 0 02 m hour both being less than the first opening the average rate of change in all variables was much slower during the second opening with the flow velocity and discharge hydrographs being more drawn out and channel width taking multiple tidal cycles to reach its maximum value fig 8a b because the estuary water level hs and upstream fluvial discharge at opening were similar these case studies demonstrate that the grade at opening is likely to influence the magnitude and rates of change of channel expansion velocity discharge and drainage during opening these case studies along with the openings examined in fig 6c demonstrate that the tidal stage i e rising or falling can play a key role in determining the rates of change in geomorphic variables the first opening at aire river fig 8a was undertaken on a falling tide with hydraulic head increasing throughout the first few hours of the opening the maximum outflow velocity and discharge occurred at the time of the next low tide 5 h after opening meaning the channel was in a state where it was not at risk of closing on the next rising tide essentially having already transitioned into stages 2 3 of gordon 1990 the second opening fig 8b occurred on a rising tide which decreased hydraulic head during the first few hours of the opening combined with the lower grade at opening the rising tide and decreasing head likely contributed to the slower rates of change during the first few hours of the opening fig 8b with the next low tide on 05 03 21 outflow velocity increased periodically then fell again at the time of the next high tide fig 8b on 06 03 21 the low tide was 0 5 m lower than on 05 03 21 coinciding with this low tide all variables reached their maximum values and rates of change increased fig 8b 5 discussion 5 1 controls on opening success from a range of physical variables the hydraulic gradient or grade and offshore hs at the time of opening determine the success of artificial entrance openings for ioces hydraulic gradient quantifies the balance between the forces driving hydraulic head and resisting the opening berm length hs represents another resisting force as waves work to infill the channel with sediment from the marine side from an analysis of 137 ioces openings globally we present an empirical model to predict if artificial openings will be successful in terms of staying open and draining the estuary lagoon fig 9 the parameters required to predict opening success i e berm length water level tidal elevation and hs can be easily and quickly measured in the field or freely obtained from predictions our model provides a way to incorporate geomorphic information into decision making about artificial openings and can act as a decision support tool although the decision to open ioces depends on a complex interplay of social cultural and ecological factors the thresholds determined from our study are particularly relevant when the primary management purpose is to ensure an estuary remains open to reduce flooding e g emergency openings from our data a grade threshold of 1 60 delineates between successful and unsuccessful openings this equates to a hydraulic gradient of 0 017 m m but from now onwards we will use the term grade for consistency this means that if the priority is to have an estuary stay open and drain its basin artificial openings should ideally be implemented when the grade is 1 60 or steeper considering the hs at the time of opening is important and neither variable can be looked at in isolation while hs varied widely across all unsuccessful openings no artificial openings were successful when hs was 4 3 m and when hs increases openings at less steeper grades become more unlikely to be successful from our dataset undertaking openings when the grade is 1 58 1 60 represents a zone of risk as some openings are still unsuccessful fig 9 openings undertaken when the grade is 1 58 1 60 tend to stay open for several days but not drain their basins 10 cm i e type 3 openings because the grade is below 1 60 openings in this zone are also at a risk higher of closing immediately if undertaken during larger wave heights combining grade or hydraulic gradient and hs represent a balance between the driving and resisting forces the head of the lagoon represents the destructive force promoting breaching and a longer berm represents the resting forces largier et al 2019 as the berm length shortens the increase in potential energy translates to faster outflow velocities and rates of offshore sediment transport gordon 1990 young 2018 with every opening a critical transport threshold fig 1a must be achieved so that offshore transport can be sustained over tidal cycles gordon 1990 furthermore this critical transport threshold must be able to overcome the competing delivery of onshore sediment from waves which can result in deposition that decreases channel slope and therefore the energy gradient small ioces opened in the zone of risk are likely more susceptible to closure than larger systems as they have shorter duration outflow periods resulting in reduced channel erosion overall for these small systems the thresholds of our study should be applied quite strictly and there is potential for the basin volume or estuary size to be incorporated as a modifier when considering risk of closure binary logistic regression analysis indicates that grade and hs are statistically significant predictors of opening success table 6 appendix 3 the regression model can be used in conjunction with the empirical model of fig 9 as a further assessment of whether an opening is likely to be successful or unsuccessful the regression results also enable us to assess the interplay between grade and hs in more detail grade has a more constant influence on opening outcome whereas hs has a wide range of influence with orders of magnitude difference table 6 this means that under very high waves hs can have a very strong impact on the likelihood of success for artificial openings the model was slightly less accurate in predicting unsuccessful openings but as more unsuccessful openings occur we can input data to further improve the model the same applies for openings in the zone of risk 5 2 natural vs artificial openings in our dataset natural openings occur at steeper grades on average compared to artificial openings table 5 this is to be expected as artificial openings pre empt the natural threshold for opening being crossed interestingly natural openings occurred at higher hs on average 2 31 m compared to artificial openings 2 00 m but across a similar range of hs table 5 this could be a function of two things 1 people try to avoid artificial openings during high waves or 2 because natural openings occur at steeper grades hs can be higher as the energy balance still swings in the favour of opening this second point is quite well represented in our dataset again confirming that the interplay of these two variables is key fig 9 hydraulic gradient thresholds have previously been used to predict the timing of natural openings from the lagoon side by kraus et al 2008 via the breach susceptibility index our data also suggests that the relationship between the grade and hs can potentially be used to predict proximity to a natural opening the management implications are that when the grade reaches 1 10 or steeper an estuary will likely be close to naturally opening and so artificial openings could be held off if flooding is not critically threatening people and property this would save costs and potentially reduce the risks of adverse effects on biota that can occur after artificial openings ribeiro et al 2013 one limitation is that we do not have good data to quantify what happens when the hs is high and grade is very steep under a very steep grade and particularly on coarser grained beaches high waves can add water to the lagoon resulting in seepage and piping on the berm face which act as a mechanism of natural opening typically on the falling tide kraus et al 2002 stretch and zeitsman 2004 we observed a natural opening to occur via this mechanism at the sherbrook river australia when then grade was 1 7 and hs 2 6 m see appendix 4 for details and images this opening is visible on fig 6a b as the natural opening with the steepest grade overall it is possible that at very steep grades and when the lagoon is close to the berm crest high waves may act as a mechanism for natural openings in this way however more observational data is needed natural openings are most common during falling tides due to the maximum energy gradient cooper 2001 and are particularly common on spring low tides bickerton and pierce 1988 5 3 controls on geomorphic change and drainage during an opening geomorphic change of the channel and the lagoon drainage rate is directly controlled by the grade at the time of opening fig 7a l and the rate at which an estuary transitions through the three geomorphic stages described by gordon 1990 fig 1 to ensure an estuary stays open and drains its basin the faster that stage 1 is completed and the channel reaches stages 2 or 3 will lessen the risk of the channel closing opening at a steeper grade sees an estuary reach a higher maximum outflow velocity overall and to reach that peak velocity faster fig 7a c openings with a steeper grade also reached their maximum channel width faster and saw higher rates of increase in average channel width fig 7e f this is likely a function of the maximum outflow velocity being reached faster facilitating more rapid channel expansion the grade at opening did not show a strong relationship with discharge at the mouth but rather the approximate basin volume was positively correlated with the maximum discharge and channel width fig 7g i m n this indicates that larger ioces and those opened with a higher water volume in the basin tend to incise larger channels due to higher fluvial power and potentially more sustained periods of high discharge opening at a steeper grade saw estuaries reduce their starting water level by a higher proportion overall and have a higher average drainage rate fig 7j l therefore if the goal is to keep an estuary open and drain its basin it is more likely to be successful at a steeper grade as critical transport conditions occur earlier in the opening sequence and the lagoon water level is lowered faster this means that by the next high tide where hydraulic head is lower due to the lower lagoon water level and higher tidal stage the estuary is already in a fluvial dominated state and likely to counter any wave driven deposition further even if the opening is on the falling limb of the hydrograph for discharge it has likely already drained sufficiently to alleviate flooding clearly opening at a steeper grade has potential to see an estuary track through the stages of gordon 1990 faster in terms of velocity channel width and lagoon drainage and meaning it is geomorphically more efficient at getting water off the floodplain and achieving its management purpose in reality an important consideration is that rapid drainage is not always ideal as it can contribute to mass fish deaths either due to the loss of the oxygen rich top layer of water when stratified or fish becoming stranded becker et al 2009 whitfield and cowley 2018 we will address this issue in later sections of the manuscript as illustrated by our dataset and the case studies examined in section 4 6 the tidal stage does not just influence the outcome of an opening but the rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage occurring during the opening figs 6c and 8a b this is an important consideration during the first few hours of opening when critical transport conditions and velocities need to be reached to initiate and maintain offshore sediment transport for openings close to the minimum 1 60 grade threshold for success opening on a falling tide may ensure that the grade steepens during the first few hours of opening and gives the opening sufficient energy to transition into stages 2 3 of the opening sequence of gordon 1990 5 4 implications for management our results show that the lagoon water level is not the only predictor of whether openings will be successful fig 5a which suggests that we need to rethink the way in which we decide when to artificially open ioces if the goal is to open ioces so that they stay open and drain their lagoons opening at a 1 60 grade threshold or steeper and during lower hs is important while hs is already commonly considered by managers egcma 2014 instead of opening when the water level reaches a set height or trigger level adding grade to the normal suite of variables to investigate would go a long way towards ensuring openings are successful practically this would mean that the berm length would need to be measured prior to each opening however this could be undertaken at a low cost and relatively easily e g surveying using a measuring wheel or by stepping out the berm if surveying equipment was not available essentially in a geomorphic sense the relationship between the forces promoting opening hydraulic head and resisting opening berm length and hs is critical and all of these variables need to be considered the stage of the tide and whether it is rising or falling is also very important and should be included in decision making in a consistent manner depending on the situation the tidal stage could be used to our advantage to either increase or decrease hydraulic head and shift an estuary towards being more likely to open and transition through the stags of gordon 1990 faster or potentially track through these stages slower opening at on a falling tide or mid falling tide might give openings a higher likelihood of being successful if they are on the cusp of the 1 60 grade threshold and an opening cannot be postponed as it would mean that hydraulic head is increasing in the critical first few hours of opening giving it the extra push the incise a channel and maintain offshore sediment transport our data suggests that the berm height does not play a critical role in determining the outcome of artificial openings as it is all about the energy gradient hydraulic head berm length while sometimes considered as a factor in decision making the berm height essentially only matters in terms of the volume of sand to be excavated which may increase cost of excavation for natural openings however the berm height relative to the lagoon water level may be important as an indicator of proximity to a natural opening the decision to artificially open ioces is complex and in reality there are many more considerations that simply getting an estuary to stay open and drain conde et al 2015 the decision to open or not will always depend on the individual opening the priority outcome and careful weighting of the risks vs benefits arundel 2006 and our model is intended as a guide that should complement other socio economic practical and environmental considerations and existing decision making frameworks conducting artificial openings so that they transition through the stages of gordon s 1990 model rapidly and drain rapidly could for example increase the risk of fish mortalities openings where the lagoon has drained quickly due to a steep grade at opening have seen fish become stranded on the floodplain whitfield and cowley 2018 therefore we anticipate that our thresholds and findings are most useful for emergency openings where the risks and benefits are carefully considered and the primary goal is to ensure an estuary stays open and reduces flooding when used as a supporting tool we anticipate that they would be useful in saving time and money by reducing the need for reimplementation reducing the number of artificial openings is important for maintaining high levels of scour and minimising detrimental environmental effects stephens and murtagh 2012 adams and van niekerk 2020 5 5 decision support tool for the first time we can give valid geomorphic thresholds to guide artificial opening decision making based on statistically significant predictors of opening success from this we present a simple decision support tool that can be used in conjunction with other tools or guidelines to provide an assessment of whether artificial openings are likely to be successful from a purely geomorphic perspective fig 10 this tool is useful when either there is sufficient data to predict that there is no adverse risk to biota etc or when the most important consideration is to ensure the estuary stays open and drains sufficiently to reduce flooding we recognise that the decision to open estuaries is complex and has many interacting elements however our tool can be utilised in line with existing procedures and at minimal to no cost for example as a spreadsheet that calculates grade from estuary water level berm length and tidal elevation at the time of opening to exemplify the use of our decision support tool when the primary purpose is to drain the lagoon and reduce flooding we apply the tool to two sites the aire river and curdies inlet australia fig 11 a e both sites saw artificial openings implemented because of emergency flooding closure occurring within hours with no lagoon drainage and then a further opening implemented days later that was then successful on 01 05 14 aire river yellow circle on fig 11a was opened at a steep grade of 1 15 well within the range for success but when hs was very high at 4 8 m there was substantial flooding so a decision to artificially open was made however due to high waves the channel infilled within several hours fig 11b the ideal scenario as guided by our decision support tool fig 10 would have been to wait until hs decreased and then undertake the opening alternatively if the grade increased to 1 10 or steeper managers could consider waiting for a natural opening to minimise risk to the system in saying this we recognise that the situation is not always that simple due to public pressure feasibility to get machinery to the mouth and the hazard and economic implications of flooding however a second opening on the 10 05 14 yellow square on fig 11a was then undertaken at a similar grade but once hs had decreased to 1 5 m and was successful on 16 06 19 curdies inlet orange circle on fig 11a was opened at a grade of 1 66 when hs was 3 2 m fig 11c again waves infilled the channel but due to the low grade combined with relatively high waves outflow did not reach sufficient velocities to incise a channel after excavation the combination of a low grade and relatively high waves led to immediate closure fig 11c the opening was also conducted on a rising tide fig 11e in following our decision support tool fig 10 we would recommend that the opening be undertaken on the falling tide to maximise hydraulic head and increase the grade or wait until more favourable conditions on 17 06 19 a second opening was undertaken orange square on fig 11a in more favourable conditions and was successful the grade had increased to 1 41 hs was 2 6 m and the opening was undertaken on a falling tide fig 11d e we attribute the success of this opening to the lower waves steeper grade and the opening being undertaken on a falling tide which maximised hydraulic head during the first few critical hours of opening in addition to the decision support tool of figs 9 and 10 our binary logistic regression model can be used as a further method of assessment in applying the model to the two openings at curdies inlet for example the model predicted the first opening to have a 97 chance of failing which it did and the second opening which was successful to have a 1 chance of failing combing the thresholds and decision support tool figs 9 and 10 the regression model table 6 and a consideration of the tidal stage allows for a sound assessment of whether an opening is likely to be successful or not purely in terms of staying open and draining tis lagoon 6 conclusions using data from 137 estuary entrance openings we present a simple and straight forward way to predict the outcome of artificial openings that will reduce the number of unsuccessful openings and the costs and environmental risks associated with reimplementation the grade or hydraulic gradient and hs at the time of opening control whether artificial openings will be successful importantly the estuary water level alone is not a good predictor of opening success despite it being widely used to decide when to implement artificial openings a grade of 1 60 or steeper is required for a successful opening but opening estuaries at grades between 1 60 and 1 58 can still be risky especially when offshore waves are high no opening was successful when hs was 4 3 m or higher and openings at higher wave heights generally need a steeper grade to be successful the grade at opening also strongly influences the rates of geomorphic change and lagoon drainage during artificial openings there is potential to use the tidal stage to our advantage to either speed up or slow down the rate of channel expansion increases in outflow velocity and lagoon drainage particularly during the early stages of an opening the parameters required to predict the outcome of artificial openings using our method i e berm length water level tidal elevation and hs can be easily measured in the field or freely obtained from predictions or remote sensing e g berm length could be measured using coastsnap and inlettracker heimhuber et al 2021 the thresholds and models presented can be tested and refined as more data is collected we envisage that the thresholds and basic decision support tools developed here will be most useful when the primary management goal is to keep an estuary open and drain the lagoon to reduce flooding the decision when to implement artificial openings remains complex and we caution that while these thresholds provide specific guidance in terms of geomorphic processes they should always be considered in conjunction with other environmental cultural socio economic and practical factors relevant to the decision making process lastly the thresholds from our study have only proved to apply for microtidal estuaries with sizes and morphologies as described in table 1 and appendix 1 further research is needed to test their applicability to meso tidal systems where the tidal range is larger and may impact on changes in hydraulic head prior to and during openings credit authorship contribution statement sarah louise mcsweeney

2102,the global food and water crises caused by climate warming are becoming increasingly significant one of the important aspects of surface water transfer is evapotranspiration the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is of great significance in water resource management however accurate estimation of large scale et is challenging due to the adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels the heterogeneity of the subsurface and the instability of the lower atmosphere therefore in this paper a surface energy balance model y sebal was proposed based on the sebal model and improved sensible heat flux calculation and used to simulate large scale actual evapotranspiration based on the principle of surface energy balance this model introduced the empirical formula of sensible heat flux and simplifies the selection of limit to address the challenge of calculating the sensible heat flux of the crucial variable in the sebal model the study simulated the spatial and temporal evolution of regional evapotranspiration with the model and verified the model simulation performance in addition the sensitivity of the model driven data was quantified the results showed that the simulation value of the y sebal model was highly consistent with the eddy covariance measurement data in the verification results the r value was 0 82 the index of agreement was 0 90 and the root mean square error was 0 81 mm d 1 the performance verification indices were better than the sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model and the model had the highest sensitivity to wind speed reaching 0 714 the y sebal model improved the simulation performance of the original model and simulated the actual evapotranspiration the study can provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at the regional scale keywords remote sensing based evapotranspiration y sebal model sensible heat flux validation data availability all the source data used in this study are publicly available and open access processed data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request 1 introduction evapotranspiration is of great importance in agricultural water resource management in the existing studies the calculation of et is mainly based on the high precision methods of traditional point observations such as the eddy correlation method kizer and elliott 1991 the bowen ratio method and the weighing lysimeter wright 1991 these methods calculate the data of stations or small areas but it is often difficult to extend them to a large scale with the advancement of remote sensing technology the limitations imposed by traditional empirical and experimental observation methods have been largely reduced especially in regions with poor measurement conditions famiglietti et al 2015 rajib et al 2018 samain et al 2012 with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology it has become a realistic trend to study evapotranspiration estimation by using remote sensing images to decode the surface information and combine it with physical models to estimate the evapotranspiration in the region many models have emerged in the study of remote sensing evapotranspiration such as the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal among them the sebal method proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998b is commonly used this model calculates latent heat fluxes by the energy balance residual method using indicators such as radiation temperature shortwave radiation reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index the sebal method is stable in heterogeneous environments and has been shown to be effective in estimating et in agricultural areas sun et al 2011 jassas et al 2015 in the quantification process the sebal model has less demand for ground data and is not limited to small area use therefore it is widely used worldwide bastiaanssen et al 1998a b allen et al 2001 bastiaanssen et al 2005 jassas et al 2015 subsequent researchers have improved the sebal model for different use scenarios and many improved models based on the surface energy balance principle have emerged long and singh 2012 proposed a calibration method based on surface radiation temperature vegetation index feature space introducing a trapezoidal feature space of surface vegetation cover and surface radiation temperature instead of the rectangular feature space of the sebal model mhawej et al 2020 proposed the sebali model and developed an automated surface energy balance system without the need of soil related datasets and achieved good simulation results senay et al 2022 coupled the ssebop model with google earth engine to simulate the actual evapotranspiration in the united states using landsat data sebal model assumed that there are cold and hot limit pixels in the feature space similarly the feature has been inherited into some improved models thus there are still two limitations firstly the conditions of the underlying surface in the study area are complex leading to the complexity of the underlying surface boundary layer transmission theory when setting the model it is easy to introduce the subjective error of parameter calibration which makes the inversion accuracy of the sebal model largely limited by the selection of cold and hot pixels but adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels is challenging mhawej et al 2020 although the automated model and the calibration scheme of automatic selection of cold and hot pixels based on statistical methods have been developed gao et al 2011 morton et al 2013 the interpretation schemes of each model are quite different leading to significant differences in the inversion results of different models at the same time the land use type at pixel scale is limited by the representativeness of remote sensing data which has great uncertainty in determining the warm and cold edge secondly the instability of the lower atmosphere caused by surface heating makes it difficult to determine the thermodynamic aerodynamic resistance r ah and temperature difference dt which requires at least five iterative calculations to adjust the estimates morse et al 2000 allen et al 2002 majid and adelehalsadat 2019 leading to difficulty in calculating the sensible heat flux some studies use the extremum of long time series of surface temperature to replace the warm and cold edges of the feature space but that may deviate from its physical meaning minacapilli et al 2016 since the key process variables of the sebal model can be obtained from the flux station data and are less dependent on the surface data the optimization and improvement direction of the sebal model needs to be taken into account the following three aspects 1 the physical meaning of the sebal model needs to be fixed in the mechanism principle to avoid the mutual substitution of input parameters 2 the parameter selection should be consistent with the remote sensing products to avoid the process deviation between input and output due to the limitations of remote sensing products 3 the simulation process needs to be simplified to reduce uncertainty in process variables of limit selection in feature space the purpose of the study was to provide a methodological basis for the evaluation of spatiotemporal evolution of et in the study area and to provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at regional scale in the study three aspects were comprehensively considered and y sebal model was proposed to solve the above two limitations the study clarified the physical meaning directly from the principle of surface energy balance focused on the pixel scale and selected a unified remote sensing product the simulation process was simplified without additional feature space and the calculation of sensible heat flux the key variable in the surface energy balance system had been improved the nonlinear relationship between net radiation flux and sensible heat flux was established to simplify limit selection which reduce the uncertainty brought by parameter determination the eddy covariance measurement data were used to verify the simulation performance of the model furthermore the spatiotemporal characteristics of et were analyzed and the sensitivity of driving data was quantified the study provided a reference for improving the accuracy of the et estimation method and also provided scientific information for agricultural water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area in the paper qinghai province of china was selected as the study area because of its extensive area diversified landform and fragile ecosystem in addition to being permanently disturbed by human activities qinghai province china is located between 31 36 n 39 19 n 89 35 e 103 04 e fig 1 it has a plateau continental climate the region is faced with the contradiction between balancing economic development and environmental protection the terrain of qinghai province is generally high in the west and low in the east high in the north and south and low in the middle with complex terrain and diverse landforms the annual average temperature in the territory is 5 1 9 0 c the total distribution of annual precipitation in the province gradually decreases from southeast to northwest the annual precipitation in most areas in the territory is below 400 mm the rainy season is concentrated in july august and september during which the monthly average temperature is higher it is also the main growing season of vegetation in qinghai province 2 2 data collection in the study the et of qinghai province in china was estimated by using remote sensing images and meteorological data from 2001 to 2009 table 1 the meteorological station data including wind speed mm d 1 sunshine hours h daily maximum temperature c daily minimum temperature c relative humidity latitude longitude and altitude were provided by the china meteorological administration 2019 the meteorological data were interpolated using inverse distance weighting methods to obtain the spatial distribution of the study area eddy flux data were provided by chinaflux 2019 modis remote sensing products were widely used by global researchers due to their advantages of easily accessible wide spectral range high data quality and high update frequency and were important data sources for agricultural hydrological remote sensing research mu et al 2011 remote sensing data were provided by the us geological survey and the geospatial data cloud the average simulation value of the pixel window centered on haibei station was extracted to consider the influence of the remote sensing product resolution and minimize the error caused by pixel distortion 2 3 methods 2 3 1 y sebal model the sebal model is a physical model based on the principle of energy balance proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998b the main advantage of this model is that only a small number of meteorological elements combined with remote sensing images can be used to retrieve regional evapotranspiration and the simulation performance of the model is stable therefore this model has achieved good simulation results in many countries and regions in the world the y sebal model proposed in this study was composed of a set of algorithms the model was also based on the complete surface energy balance equation bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1 λ e t r n g h where r n is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 2 r n 1 α k in s in s out 1 ε 0 s in where r n is the net radiation flux k in is the input shortwave radiation w m 2 α is the surface reflectance

emissivity was calculated by the empirical formula of the normalized vegetation index 3 ε 0 1 0094 0 047 ln n d v i where ndvi 0 otherwise the emissivity is assumed to be zero van de griend and owe

temperature s out is calculated by the following equation 7 s out ε 0 s t s 4 where t s is the radiant surface temperature it is very difficult to calculate the soil heat flux directly so it is estimated by an empirical equation according to different land covers 8 g 0 3 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n v e g e t a t i o n c o v e r r n 100 w a t e r 0 2 r n b a r e s o i l the sebal model calculates the soil heat flux using the radiation temperature short wave radiation reflectivity and the vegetation component estimated by the normalized vegetation index the regional effective momentum flux is estimated by using the surface radiation temperature and shortwave reflectivity and then the flux is used to obtain the regional average momentum roughness combined with the normalized vegetation index the spatial distribution of the regional average momentum roughness is obtained a coefficient representing the relationship between momentum roughness and thermodynamic roughness is introduced to obtain the spatial distribution of thermodynamic roughness the sebal model avoids the errors caused by spatial data interpolation and surface temperature correction the sebal model assumes that when the reference height of the air temperature is higher than the plant canopy and the air temperature changes slightly the temperature gradient between the aerodynamic surface and the air at the reference height is proportional to the increase in the surface radiation temperature because there is a linear relationship between the temperature gradient and the surface radiation temperature the linear coefficient can be solved by manually determining the cold and hot pixels if the temperature gradient is determined the sensible heat flux can be calculated however this result is only the first estimate and the determination of the sensible heat flux requires at least five iterations li and zhao 2010 the repeated calculation of h will lead to the problems of uncertainty and calculation difficulty in each scene image therefore in this study the calculation of h was improved in the sebal model and the y sebal model was proposed to reduce the error caused by iterative calculation and the accuracy of coefficient calibration the model assumed that the weather is clear and cloudless and the temperature gradient remains constant at all pixels with a linear relationship the research of wu et al 2013 show that there is a significant positive correlation between sensible heat flux and solar radiation the sebal model assumes that the net radiation flux is the only energy source mkhwanazi et al 2015 and the exponential relationship of et has a more reasonable explanation than the linear relationship nyambayo and potts 2010 therefore in this study a nonlinear exponential relationship was used to directly link the sensible heat flux and the net radiation flux 9 h a e b r n c where a b and c are constants taking values a 155 1 b 0 001629 c 171 4 respectively li 2022 the

uncertainty into three categories including model structure parameter estimation and natural variability here we focus on the driving variable the one at a time method is a commonly used local sensitivity analysis method this method involves changing model parameters one by one while keeping other parameters unchanged o neill et al 1980 under the condition that the change percentage of each parameter is the same sensitivity ranking can be assigned according to the change in model output to quickly identify sensitive parameters 12 vr 10 100 run base run 10 run base 13 vr 10 100 run base run 10 run base 14 vr 10 vr 10 vr 10 where vr 10 and vr 10 are the percentage changes of the simulated values when the selected parameters increase and decrease by 10 respectively vr 10 takes extremum and is considered to be the sensitivity of analog values to selected parameters dufrene et al 2005 in the paper the new y sebal model was developed by improving the calculation of sensible heat flux fewer input parameters were required by the model including meteorological data and remote sensing data first we used the inverse distance weighting method to apply meteorological data and interpolated point data into area data in order to obtain the same spatial resolution as remote sensing images second we used the y sebal model to estimate the actual et based on remote sensing images 3 results 3 1 model validation in this study the calculation of sensible heat flux was improved and a parameterized y sebal model was established the eddy covariance measurements of haibei station in qinghai province from 2003 to 2009 were used to verify the y sebal model overall the y sebal model successfully simulated the evapotranspiration at haibei station the r value between the measured and simulated evapotranspiration was approximately 0 82 which was better than the simulation results using the optimal parameters of the sebal model in 2003 2009 table 2 y sebal showed better performance the scatter diagram indicated that the slope of linear fitting of haibei station was approximately 0 73 fig 2 therefore the improved y sebal model for sensible heat flux calculation can improve the simulation performance however according to the slope and root mean square error rmse the model underestimated the daily evapotranspiration which was more prominent in large daily evapotranspiration in order to enhance the applicability of y sebal model additional verification station haibei marsh and the comparation with grid scale actual et products mod16 and ssebop were added in haibei marsh station the r value of y sebal was about 0 76 table 3 which also had a good improvement compared with other models changwu station which was located on the same loess plateau as haibei station was also considered by this paper comparing the et simulation value of changwu station with the flux station the result showed the r value of the simulation result was about 0 85 and the rmse was about 0 85 mm d 1 in conclusion y sebal showed better simulation performance compared with both sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model table 4 3 2 performance of the y sebal model in et simulation the results of et simulated using the y sebal model were shown in fig 3 the y sebal model simulated the et fluctuation of long time series in general the simulation results of the y sebal model were generally close to the measured values of vorticity flux stations and the simulated interannual et trend were basically consistent with the ec flux data showed similar distribution characteristics the vegetation community of the haibei alpine grassland flux observation station was composed of shrubs and herbs and the grazing time for winter pasture is approximately the first ten days of october to the last ten days of may of the following year yu et al 2006 the simulation results indicated that et starts to rise in february and reached a peak at the end of june when the vegetation at the observation station was growing well and then decreased because the local dominant species stipa aliena helictotrichon tibeticum aster flaccidus etc entered the flowering and fruiting stages resulting in the weakening of physiological activities and transpiration at the same time with the changes in climate factors et continued to decline although it fluctuated to a certain extent it generally showed a downward trend the same characteristics were reflected in the haibei alpine marsh flux observation and research station as far as the seasonal variation of et was concerned summer was the largest season of et and winter was the smallest indicating that this method was consistent with the climate change in northwest china and has certain applicability fig 3 also showed that the y sebal model will underestimate et as previously described and the possible reasons for the underestimation would be explained in the discussion section 3 3 spatiotemporal variation in et simulation clarifying the spatial and temporal variations in et in arid and semiarid regions was an important guide for studying regional hydrology agricultural water demand irrigation planning and water resource management in the region therefore in this study the y sebal model was used to quantify et in qinghai province from 2001 to 2009 fig 4 showed that in terms of spatial distribution there were significant regional differences in annual et in qinghai province in general the annual et value in the central northern and eastern regions was higher than that in other regions this distribution was contrary to the different altitudes in qinghai province the central and northern part was mainly the desert area of the qaidam basin which was the center of the high et value the larger et in this region was consistent with the fact that its climate was dry another high value center of et was located in the northeast which was the agricultural area of qinghai province it was the area with the most superior natural conditions in qinghai province the area had low altitude good light and heat conditions and sufficient sunshine there was a negative correlation between altitude and temperature that is the lower the altitude was the higher the temperature the faster wind speed was mainly located in high altitude areas which explained why there were high values in high altitude areas in the south to explore the spatial frequency distribution characteristics of the annual et in the study area the annual et in each period was grid averaged and the pixel frequency distribution of its simulation value was counted as shown in fig 5 the annual et range simulated by the y sebal model in the study area was 0 800 mm year and the frequency distribution was concentrated in a unimodal distribution that is a large number of pixels were gathered in the 590 610 mm year area however from the perspective of temporal evolution the annual et frequency distribution simulated by the y sebal model had obvious temporal heterogeneity specifically the frequency distribution statistics in 2001 were different from the simulation values in other years mainly in the range of 550 600 mm year the possible reason was that the interannual difference in meteorological factors was large which had a significant impact on the inversion results 4 discussion the accuracy of calculating sensible heat flux soil heat flux and net radiation flux determines the accuracy of modeling et based on surface energy balance and the quantification of sensible heat flux was the key process at present there are many models based on the balance of surface energy including some developed on the basis of the sebal model such as the m sebal sebali and other models taking the temperature of the bare soil and the dense vegetation cover in the study area as the anchor point the m sebal model changes the traditional feature space and connects the surface radiation temperature with the vegetation fraction to form a trapezoidal space fig 6 m sebal also assumes that the cold edge of the model is based on the air temperature it is worth noting that with the increase of vegetation coverage the warm edge temperature gradually decreases which is consistent with the negative correlation between surface temperature and vegetation index proposed by goward et al 1985 however due to the unclear understanding of the relevant mechanism the uniform change of warm edge temperature with vegetation fraction needs further exploration in addition the feature space needs to be controlled by the warm edge at the upper boundary and the cold edge at the lower boundary which requires that the two spaces have the same warm bare soil wet bare soil and wet vegetation pixels with sufficient water supply otherwise the system error will be accumulated although the regression empirical method is used to determine that most of the study results are linear they will still be disturbed by false warm and cold edges and have obvious spatial scale effect therefore using this method can only get the so called observation warm edge and cold edge and has no physical significance minacapilli et al 2016 s study in the determination of limit pixel also reflects the same situation the sebali model is mainly applied to the situation of lacking soil moisture data and ground measured data the model uses remote sensing data and reanalysis data combined with water pressure factor yuan et al 2007 to replace the missing soil related data sets fig 7 mhawej and faour 2020 coupled the sebali model with google earth engine to realize the inversion of evapotranspiration from big data cloud computing filling the gap of remote sensing calculation of evapotranspiration in the absence of ground data but does not change the principle of cold and hot pixel selection in addition the remote sensing product itself may have inevitable errors all data required by the model are from remote sensing data and reanalysis meteorological data the method may accumulate the original errors in the product thus affecting the accuracy of inversion therefore the ground measurement data is indispensable under the normal scenario and the parameter optimization based on the measured data is the basis for the good consistency between the model simulation results and the measured data zhao et al 2020 the ssebop model is a predefined simplified surface energy balance model proposed by senay et al 2013 the model requires predefined boundary conditions that is the temperature difference dt between the hot and cold reference temperature is determined in advance fig 7 in other words the cold and hot limit of the model does not depend on the pixel scale but uses a set of reference cold and hot temperatures for a limited and uniform hydrological climate area the key link of the model is the determination of the correction coefficient c which requires the calculation of the air temperature and the temperature of dense vegetation cover the principle is worthy of reference but there are problems of spatial heterogeneity and the same strict requirements for the underlying surface as m sebal it will lead to overestimation in areas with complex terrain and high reflectivity table 2 and 3 therefore to solve the problem the y sebal model was proposed the model did not distinguish between soil evaporation and plant transpiration but considered evapotranspiration as a whole since the evapotranspiration was regarded as a whole and the specific evapotranspiration forms were not subdivided the specific numerical distribution of simulated annual evapotranspiration might be more concentrated fig 5 the successful inversion of et by the y sebal model depended on sensible heat flux soil heat flux and net radiation flux however the accuracy of net radiation flux directly affected the two variables of sensible heat flux and soil heat flux therefore the y sebal model put forward higher requirements for the calculation accuracy and accuracy of net radiation flux the most difference between the y sebal sebal and other models that need to select cold and hot pixels was the calculation of sensible heat flux the y sebal model improved the aerodynamic resistance obtained through roughness which was a parameter required for sensible heat flux calculation it was worth noting that the study focused directly on the four variables of the surface energy balance without introducing the feature space the sensible heat flux was directly related to the net radiation flux and expressed by the equation thus a simplified simulation process was achieved at each image element to improve the simulation performance in the paper the y sebal model was constructed and successfully simulates et in qinghai province compared with the sebal model the performance indicators were improved to a certain extent at haibei station the r of the y sebal model was 0 82 and the rmse was 0 81 mm d 1 the y sebal model also performed better when compared to the raster scale actual evapotranspiration products mod16 and ssebop the simulation performance remained stable when extended to other stations the results showed that the principle of the assumption of y sbeal model was valid obviously it was feasible to connect the calculation of sensible heat flux and net radiation flux directly through empirical formula the success of y sebal model was that it simplified the limit selection in the feature space and effectively reduced the differences in simulation results caused by different limit selection the inverse distance weight method was used for meteorological interpolation the calculation method of sensible heat flux was improved and the error caused by iterative calculation was reduced it was the basis and advantage of the y sebal model to better study the advantages of this model four years of ec measurement data and simulation values were linearly fitted at haibei station as shown in fig 8 the multiyear average slope k 0 76 and r2 0 78 achieved good simulation performance in the aspect of trend simulation the overall trend of et simulated by the y sebal model was basically consistent with the measured value of the vorticity flux station with similar distribution characteristics however the measured data of simulated et compared with ec were generally underestimated which might be due to the following reasons the underlying surface of the study area was heterogeneous and the deviation and error were relatively high when applied in mountainous areas previous researchers had also found errors in the accuracy of non uniform underlying surfaces zhong et al 2020 this could also be explained by the model mechanism the y sebal model improved the calculation of sensible heat flux connecting the sensible heat flux with the net radiation flux reducing the systematic error caused by iterative calculation the same soil heat flux was closely related to the net radiation flux which increased the importance of the net radiation flux in the whole model in other words the accuracy of the net radiation flux calculation would directly determine the accuracy of et simulation so the deviation and error of net radiation flux would be directly substituted into the simulated et and the product quality of input parameters would directly determine the accuracy of et simulation future research needs to consider the problem of reducing the system error and heterogeneity of the underlying surface the model inversion et was susceptible to the sensitivity of the drivers and produces errors the sensitivity of the driving data of the y sebal model was also calculated in this paper as shown in fig 9 where the sensitivity of wind speed was the highest at haibei station reaching 0 714 the second was albedo with a sensitivity of 0 696 and the third was the normalized difference vegetation index with a sensitivity of approximately 0 662 however the sensitivities of air temperature and surface temperature were relatively low at 0 309 and 0 237 respectively similar results were also shown in haibei marsh station previous studies have shown that the main cause of et variation in central and western china is due to reduced wind speed ying et al 2010 in australia wind speed has been found to be a driver closely related to evaporation variation in evaporation dishes rayner 2007 roderick et al 2007 with wind accelerating the mobility of evaporating surface air which in turn affects evapotranspiration wind can accelerate the mobility of air on the evaporating surface and thus affect evaporation large scale changes in atmospheric circulation can affect wind speed chen et al 2006 incident solar radiation has also been found to be highly correlated with wind speed xu et al 2006 on the tibetan plateau researchers have found that wind speed is the most important factor affecting et0 chen et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 ruhoff et al 2012 compared the results of et simulated from modis satellite images with eddy correlation values in brazil and found that ndvi temperature gradient and net radiation are highly sensitive input parameters to the model it is worth noting that various meteorological factors including wind speed albedo downward solar radiation relative humidity and air temperature can affect et directly or indirectly shi et al 2017 tomer and schilling 2009 du et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2012 yang et al 2019 errors in these input parameters could lead to great uncertainty in et estimation distinguishing the main features that influence et variability in areas with complex topography and land use types was critical 5 conclusions the sebal model with improved sensible heat flux was proposed to address the problems of adequate selection of hot and cold pixels heterogeneity of the subsurface and instability of the lower atmosphere the simulation results showed that the et simulated by the y sebal model had good similarity with the ec values of the flux stations compared with the sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model the y sebal model had satisfactory performance in estimating et the spatial and temporal evolution of the study area was quantitatively assessed using the model proposed in this study and the results showed that the y sebal model could better capture the seasonal variation characteristics of et in arid and semi arid regions it was worth noting that wind speed albedo and vegetation index were the three most sensitive driving factors therefore y sebal model was an effective method to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of evapotranspiration and provided a reference for the assessment and management of agricultural water use in large scale arid and semi arid areas the most sensitive drivers might introduce uncertainty to et estimation although the model had been applied outside the research field and achieved good simulation results the applicability of the model was still insufficient future study would continue to focus on the simulation effect of y sebal model in different areas and evaluate the applicability of large scale areas credit authorship

2102,the global food and water crises caused by climate warming are becoming increasingly significant one of the important aspects of surface water transfer is evapotranspiration the accurate estimation of evapotranspiration et is of great significance in water resource management however accurate estimation of large scale et is challenging due to the adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels the heterogeneity of the subsurface and the instability of the lower atmosphere therefore in this paper a surface energy balance model y sebal was proposed based on the sebal model and improved sensible heat flux calculation and used to simulate large scale actual evapotranspiration based on the principle of surface energy balance this model introduced the empirical formula of sensible heat flux and simplifies the selection of limit to address the challenge of calculating the sensible heat flux of the crucial variable in the sebal model the study simulated the spatial and temporal evolution of regional evapotranspiration with the model and verified the model simulation performance in addition the sensitivity of the model driven data was quantified the results showed that the simulation value of the y sebal model was highly consistent with the eddy covariance measurement data in the verification results the r value was 0 82 the index of agreement was 0 90 and the root mean square error was 0 81 mm d 1 the performance verification indices were better than the sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model and the model had the highest sensitivity to wind speed reaching 0 714 the y sebal model improved the simulation performance of the original model and simulated the actual evapotranspiration the study can provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at the regional scale keywords remote sensing based evapotranspiration y sebal model sensible heat flux validation data availability all the source data used in this study are publicly available and open access processed data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request 1 introduction evapotranspiration is of great importance in agricultural water resource management in the existing studies the calculation of et is mainly based on the high precision methods of traditional point observations such as the eddy correlation method kizer and elliott 1991 the bowen ratio method and the weighing lysimeter wright 1991 these methods calculate the data of stations or small areas but it is often difficult to extend them to a large scale with the advancement of remote sensing technology the limitations imposed by traditional empirical and experimental observation methods have been largely reduced especially in regions with poor measurement conditions famiglietti et al 2015 rajib et al 2018 samain et al 2012 with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing technology it has become a realistic trend to study evapotranspiration estimation by using remote sensing images to decode the surface information and combine it with physical models to estimate the evapotranspiration in the region many models have emerged in the study of remote sensing evapotranspiration such as the surface energy balance index sebi menenti and choudhury 1993 the simplified surface energy balance index s sebi roerink et al 2000 the surface energy balance system sebs su 2002 and the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal among them the sebal method proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998b is commonly used this model calculates latent heat fluxes by the energy balance residual method using indicators such as radiation temperature shortwave radiation reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index the sebal method is stable in heterogeneous environments and has been shown to be effective in estimating et in agricultural areas sun et al 2011 jassas et al 2015 in the quantification process the sebal model has less demand for ground data and is not limited to small area use therefore it is widely used worldwide bastiaanssen et al 1998a b allen et al 2001 bastiaanssen et al 2005 jassas et al 2015 subsequent researchers have improved the sebal model for different use scenarios and many improved models based on the surface energy balance principle have emerged long and singh 2012 proposed a calibration method based on surface radiation temperature vegetation index feature space introducing a trapezoidal feature space of surface vegetation cover and surface radiation temperature instead of the rectangular feature space of the sebal model mhawej et al 2020 proposed the sebali model and developed an automated surface energy balance system without the need of soil related datasets and achieved good simulation results senay et al 2022 coupled the ssebop model with google earth engine to simulate the actual evapotranspiration in the united states using landsat data sebal model assumed that there are cold and hot limit pixels in the feature space similarly the feature has been inherited into some improved models thus there are still two limitations firstly the conditions of the underlying surface in the study area are complex leading to the complexity of the underlying surface boundary layer transmission theory when setting the model it is easy to introduce the subjective error of parameter calibration which makes the inversion accuracy of the sebal model largely limited by the selection of cold and hot pixels but adequate selection of the hot and cold pixels is challenging mhawej et al 2020 although the automated model and the calibration scheme of automatic selection of cold and hot pixels based on statistical methods have been developed gao et al 2011 morton et al 2013 the interpretation schemes of each model are quite different leading to significant differences in the inversion results of different models at the same time the land use type at pixel scale is limited by the representativeness of remote sensing data which has great uncertainty in determining the warm and cold edge secondly the instability of the lower atmosphere caused by surface heating makes it difficult to determine the thermodynamic aerodynamic resistance r ah and temperature difference dt which requires at least five iterative calculations to adjust the estimates morse et al 2000 allen et al 2002 majid and adelehalsadat 2019 leading to difficulty in calculating the sensible heat flux some studies use the extremum of long time series of surface temperature to replace the warm and cold edges of the feature space but that may deviate from its physical meaning minacapilli et al 2016 since the key process variables of the sebal model can be obtained from the flux station data and are less dependent on the surface data the optimization and improvement direction of the sebal model needs to be taken into account the following three aspects 1 the physical meaning of the sebal model needs to be fixed in the mechanism principle to avoid the mutual substitution of input parameters 2 the parameter selection should be consistent with the remote sensing products to avoid the process deviation between input and output due to the limitations of remote sensing products 3 the simulation process needs to be simplified to reduce uncertainty in process variables of limit selection in feature space the purpose of the study was to provide a methodological basis for the evaluation of spatiotemporal evolution of et in the study area and to provide a new solution for improving the retrieval of evapotranspiration by remote sensing at regional scale in the study three aspects were comprehensively considered and y sebal model was proposed to solve the above two limitations the study clarified the physical meaning directly from the principle of surface energy balance focused on the pixel scale and selected a unified remote sensing product the simulation process was simplified without additional feature space and the calculation of sensible heat flux the key variable in the surface energy balance system had been improved the nonlinear relationship between net radiation flux and sensible heat flux was established to simplify limit selection which reduce the uncertainty brought by parameter determination the eddy covariance measurement data were used to verify the simulation performance of the model furthermore the spatiotemporal characteristics of et were analyzed and the sensitivity of driving data was quantified the study provided a reference for improving the accuracy of the et estimation method and also provided scientific information for agricultural water management 2 materials and methods 2 1 research area in the paper qinghai province of china was selected as the study area because of its extensive area diversified landform and fragile ecosystem in addition to being permanently disturbed by human activities qinghai province china is located between 31 36 n 39 19 n 89 35 e 103 04 e fig 1 it has a plateau continental climate the region is faced with the contradiction between balancing economic development and environmental protection the terrain of qinghai province is generally high in the west and low in the east high in the north and south and low in the middle with complex terrain and diverse landforms the annual average temperature in the territory is 5 1 9 0 c the total distribution of annual precipitation in the province gradually decreases from southeast to northwest the annual precipitation in most areas in the territory is below 400 mm the rainy season is concentrated in july august and september during which the monthly average temperature is higher it is also the main growing season of vegetation in qinghai province 2 2 data collection in the study the et of qinghai province in china was estimated by using remote sensing images and meteorological data from 2001 to 2009 table 1 the meteorological station data including wind speed mm d 1 sunshine hours h daily maximum temperature c daily minimum temperature c relative humidity latitude longitude and altitude were provided by the china meteorological administration 2019 the meteorological data were interpolated using inverse distance weighting methods to obtain the spatial distribution of the study area eddy flux data were provided by chinaflux 2019 modis remote sensing products were widely used by global researchers due to their advantages of easily accessible wide spectral range high data quality and high update frequency and were important data sources for agricultural hydrological remote sensing research mu et al 2011 remote sensing data were provided by the us geological survey and the geospatial data cloud the average simulation value of the pixel window centered on haibei station was extracted to consider the influence of the remote sensing product resolution and minimize the error caused by pixel distortion 2 3 methods 2 3 1 y sebal model the sebal model is a physical model based on the principle of energy balance proposed by bastiaanssen et al 1998b the main advantage of this model is that only a small number of meteorological elements combined with remote sensing images can be used to retrieve regional evapotranspiration and the simulation performance of the model is stable therefore this model has achieved good simulation results in many countries and regions in the world the y sebal model proposed in this study was composed of a set of algorithms the model was also based on the complete surface energy balance equation bastiaanssen et al 1998b 1 λ e t r n g h where r n is the net radiation flux w m 2 g is the soil heat flux w m 2 h is sensible heat flux w m 2 2 r n 1 α k in s in s out 1 ε 0 s in where r n is the net radiation flux k in is the input shortwave radiation w m 2 α is the surface reflectance dimensionless s in is the input longwave radiation w m 2 s out is the output longwave radiation w m 2 and ε 0 is the surface thermal emissivity dimensionless in the y sebal model the surface thermal emissivity was calculated by the empirical formula of the normalized vegetation index 3 ε 0 1 0094 0 047 ln n d v i where ndvi 0 otherwise the emissivity is assumed to be zero van de griend and owe

temperature s out is calculated by the following equation 7 s out ε 0 s t s 4 where t s is the radiant surface temperature it is very difficult to calculate the soil heat flux directly so it is estimated by an empirical equation according to different land covers 8 g 0 3 1 0 98 ndvi 4 r n v e g e t a t i o n c o v e r r n 100 w a t e r 0 2 r n b a r e s o i l the sebal model calculates the soil heat flux using the radiation temperature short wave radiation reflectivity and the vegetation component estimated by the normalized vegetation index the regional effective momentum flux is estimated by using the surface radiation temperature and shortwave reflectivity and then the flux is used to obtain the regional average momentum roughness combined with the normalized vegetation index the spatial distribution of the regional average momentum roughness is obtained a coefficient representing the relationship between momentum roughness and thermodynamic roughness is introduced to obtain the spatial distribution of thermodynamic roughness the sebal model avoids the errors caused by spatial data interpolation and surface temperature correction the sebal model assumes that when the reference height of the air temperature is higher than the plant canopy and the air temperature changes slightly the temperature gradient between the aerodynamic surface and the air at the reference height is proportional to the increase in the surface radiation temperature because there is a linear relationship between the temperature gradient and the surface radiation temperature the linear coefficient can be solved by manually determining the cold and hot pixels if the temperature gradient is determined the sensible heat flux can be calculated however this result is only the first estimate and the determination of the sensible heat flux requires at least five iterations li and zhao 2010 the repeated calculation of h will lead to the problems of uncertainty and calculation difficulty in each scene image therefore in this study the calculation of h was improved in the sebal model and the y sebal model was proposed to reduce the error caused by iterative calculation and the accuracy of coefficient calibration the model assumed that the weather is clear and cloudless and the temperature gradient remains constant at all pixels with a linear relationship the research of wu et al 2013 show that there is a significant positive correlation between sensible heat flux and solar radiation the sebal model assumes that the net radiation flux is the only energy source mkhwanazi et al 2015 and the exponential relationship of et has a more reasonable explanation than the linear relationship nyambayo and potts 2010 therefore in this study a nonlinear exponential relationship was used to directly link the sensible heat flux and the net radiation flux 9 h a e b r n c where a b and c are constants taking values a 155 1 b 0 001629 c 171 4 respectively li 2022 the evaporative fraction ef is used to expand the instantaneous et to the daily et as follows 10 ef λ e t r n g the actual 24 hour et can be calculated as 11 e t 24 86400 e f r n 24 λ ρ where r n 24 is the average net radiation w m 2 in 24 h ρ is the density of water kg m 3 and λ is the latent heat of vaporization 2 3 2 sensitivity analysis o neill and gardner 1979 classifies the sources of uncertainty into three categories including model structure parameter estimation and natural variability here we focus on the driving variable the one at a time method is a commonly used local sensitivity analysis method this method involves changing model parameters one by one while keeping other parameters unchanged o neill et al 1980 under the condition that the change percentage of each parameter is the same sensitivity ranking can be assigned according to the change in model output to quickly identify sensitive parameters 12 vr 10 100 run base run 10 run base 13 vr 10 100 run base run 10 run base 14 vr 10 vr 10 vr 10 where vr 10 and vr 10 are the percentage changes of the simulated values when the selected parameters increase and decrease by 10 respectively vr 10 takes extremum and is considered to be the sensitivity of analog values to selected parameters dufrene et al 2005 in the paper the new y sebal model was developed by improving the calculation of sensible heat flux fewer input parameters were required by the model including meteorological data and remote sensing data first we used the inverse distance weighting method to apply meteorological data and interpolated point data into area data in order to obtain the same spatial resolution as remote sensing images second we used the y sebal model to estimate the actual et based on remote sensing images 3 results 3 1 model validation in this study the calculation of sensible heat flux was improved and a parameterized y sebal model was established the eddy covariance measurements of haibei station in qinghai province from 2003 to 2009 were used to verify the y sebal model overall the y sebal model successfully simulated the evapotranspiration at haibei station the r value between the measured and simulated evapotranspiration was approximately 0 82 which was better than the simulation results using the optimal parameters of the sebal model in 2003 2009 table 2 y sebal showed better performance the scatter diagram indicated that the slope of linear fitting of haibei station was approximately 0 73 fig 2 therefore the improved y sebal model for sensible heat flux calculation can improve the simulation performance however according to the slope and root mean square error rmse the model underestimated the daily evapotranspiration which was more prominent in large daily evapotranspiration in order to enhance the applicability of y sebal model additional verification station haibei marsh and the comparation with grid scale actual et products mod16 and ssebop were added in haibei marsh station the r value of y sebal was about 0 76 table 3 which also had a good improvement compared with other models changwu station which was located on the same loess plateau as haibei station was also considered by this paper comparing the et simulation value of changwu station with the flux station the result showed the r value of the simulation result was about 0 85 and the rmse was about 0 85 mm d 1 in conclusion y sebal showed better simulation performance compared with both sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model table 4 3 2 performance of the y sebal model in et simulation the results of et simulated using the y sebal model were shown in fig 3 the y sebal model simulated the et fluctuation of long time series in general the simulation results of the y sebal model were generally close to the measured values of vorticity flux stations and the simulated interannual et trend were basically consistent with the ec flux data showed similar distribution characteristics the vegetation community of the haibei alpine grassland flux observation station was composed of shrubs and herbs and the grazing time for winter pasture is approximately the first ten days of october to the last ten days of may of the following year yu et al 2006 the simulation results indicated that et starts to rise in february and reached a peak at the end of june when the vegetation at the observation station was growing well and then decreased because the local dominant species stipa aliena helictotrichon tibeticum aster flaccidus etc entered the flowering and fruiting stages resulting in the weakening of physiological activities and transpiration at the same time with the changes in climate factors et continued to decline although it fluctuated to a certain extent it generally showed a downward trend the same characteristics were reflected in the haibei alpine marsh flux observation and research station as far as the seasonal variation of et was concerned summer was the largest season of et and winter was the smallest indicating that this method was consistent with the climate change in northwest china and has certain applicability fig 3 also showed that the y sebal model will underestimate et as previously described and the possible reasons for the underestimation would be explained in the discussion section 3 3 spatiotemporal variation in et simulation clarifying the spatial and temporal variations in et in arid and semiarid regions was an important guide for studying regional hydrology agricultural water demand irrigation planning and water resource management in the region therefore in this study the y sebal model was used to quantify et in qinghai province from 2001 to 2009 fig 4 showed that in terms of spatial distribution there were significant regional differences in annual et in qinghai province in general the annual et value in the central northern and eastern regions was higher than that in other regions this distribution was contrary to the different altitudes in qinghai province the central and northern part was mainly the desert area of the qaidam basin which was the center of the high et value the larger et in this region was consistent with the fact that its climate was dry another high value center of et was located in the northeast which was the agricultural area of qinghai province it was the area with the most superior natural conditions in qinghai province the area had low altitude good light and heat conditions and sufficient sunshine there was a negative correlation between altitude and temperature that is the lower the altitude was the higher the temperature the faster wind speed was mainly located in high altitude areas which explained why there were high values in high altitude areas in the south to explore the spatial frequency distribution characteristics of the annual et in the study area the annual et in each period was grid averaged and the pixel frequency distribution of its simulation value was counted as shown in fig 5 the annual et range simulated by the y sebal model in the study area was 0 800 mm year and the frequency distribution was concentrated in a unimodal distribution that is a large number of pixels were gathered in the 590 610 mm year area however from the perspective of temporal evolution the annual et frequency distribution simulated by the y sebal model had obvious temporal heterogeneity specifically the frequency distribution statistics in 2001 were different from the simulation values in other years mainly in the range of 550 600 mm year the possible reason was that the interannual difference in meteorological factors was large which had a significant impact on the inversion results 4 discussion the accuracy of calculating sensible heat flux soil heat flux and net radiation flux determines the accuracy of modeling et based on surface energy balance and the quantification of sensible heat flux was the key process at present there are many models based on the balance of surface energy including some developed on the basis of the sebal model such as the m sebal sebali and other models taking the temperature of the bare soil and the dense vegetation cover in the study area as the anchor point the m sebal model changes the traditional feature space and connects the surface radiation temperature with the vegetation fraction to form a trapezoidal space fig 6 m sebal also assumes that the cold edge of the model is based on the air temperature it is worth noting that with the increase of vegetation coverage the warm edge temperature gradually decreases which is consistent with the negative correlation between surface temperature and vegetation index proposed by goward et al 1985 however due to the unclear understanding of the relevant mechanism the uniform change of warm edge temperature with vegetation fraction needs further exploration in addition the feature space needs to be controlled by the warm edge at the upper boundary and the cold edge at the lower boundary which requires that the two spaces have the same warm bare soil wet bare soil and wet vegetation pixels with sufficient water supply otherwise the system error will be accumulated although the regression empirical method is used to determine that most of the study results are linear they will still be disturbed by false warm and cold edges and have obvious spatial scale effect therefore using this method can only get the so called observation warm edge and cold edge and has no physical significance minacapilli et al 2016 s study in the determination of limit pixel also reflects the same situation the sebali model is mainly applied to the situation of lacking soil moisture data and ground measured data the model uses remote sensing data and reanalysis data combined with water pressure factor yuan et al 2007 to replace the missing soil related data sets fig 7 mhawej and faour 2020 coupled the sebali model with google earth engine to realize the inversion of evapotranspiration from big data cloud computing filling the gap of remote sensing calculation of evapotranspiration in the absence of ground data but does not change the principle of cold and hot pixel selection in addition the remote sensing product itself may have inevitable errors all data required by the model are from remote sensing data and reanalysis meteorological data the method may accumulate the original errors in the product thus affecting the accuracy of inversion therefore the ground measurement data is indispensable under the normal scenario and the parameter optimization based on the measured data is the basis for the good consistency between the model simulation results and the measured data zhao et al 2020 the ssebop model is a predefined simplified surface energy balance model proposed by senay et al 2013 the model requires predefined boundary conditions that is the temperature difference dt between the hot and cold reference temperature is determined in advance fig 7 in other words the cold and hot limit of the model does not depend on the pixel scale but uses a set of reference cold and hot temperatures for a limited and uniform hydrological climate area the key link of the model is the determination of the correction coefficient c which requires the calculation of the air temperature and the temperature of dense vegetation cover the principle is worthy of reference but there are problems of spatial heterogeneity and the same strict requirements for the underlying surface as m sebal it will lead to overestimation in areas with complex terrain and high reflectivity table 2 and 3 therefore to solve the problem the y sebal model was proposed the model did not distinguish between soil evaporation and plant transpiration but considered evapotranspiration as a whole since the evapotranspiration was regarded as a whole and the specific evapotranspiration forms were not subdivided the specific numerical distribution of simulated annual evapotranspiration might be more concentrated fig 5 the successful inversion of et by the y sebal model depended on sensible heat flux soil heat flux and net radiation flux however the accuracy of net radiation flux directly affected the two variables of sensible heat flux and soil heat flux therefore the y sebal model put forward higher requirements for the calculation accuracy and accuracy of net radiation flux the most difference between the y sebal sebal and other models that need to select cold and hot pixels was the calculation of sensible heat flux the y sebal model improved the aerodynamic resistance obtained through roughness which was a parameter required for sensible heat flux calculation it was worth noting that the study focused directly on the four variables of the surface energy balance without introducing the feature space the sensible heat flux was directly related to the net radiation flux and expressed by the equation thus a simplified simulation process was achieved at each image element to improve the simulation performance in the paper the y sebal model was constructed and successfully simulates et in qinghai province compared with the sebal model the performance indicators were improved to a certain extent at haibei station the r of the y sebal model was 0 82 and the rmse was 0 81 mm d 1 the y sebal model also performed better when compared to the raster scale actual evapotranspiration products mod16 and ssebop the simulation performance remained stable when extended to other stations the results showed that the principle of the assumption of y sbeal model was valid obviously it was feasible to connect the calculation of sensible heat flux and net radiation flux directly through empirical formula the success of y sebal model was that it simplified the limit selection in the feature space and effectively reduced the differences in simulation results caused by different limit selection the inverse distance weight method was used for meteorological interpolation the calculation method of sensible heat flux was improved and the error caused by iterative calculation was reduced it was the basis and advantage of the y sebal model to better study the advantages of this model four years of ec measurement data and simulation values were linearly fitted at haibei station as shown in fig 8 the multiyear average slope k 0 76 and r2 0 78 achieved good simulation performance in the aspect of trend simulation the overall trend of et simulated by the y sebal model was basically consistent with the measured value of the vorticity flux station with similar distribution characteristics however the measured data of simulated et compared with ec were generally underestimated which might be due to the following reasons the underlying surface of the study area was heterogeneous and the deviation and error were relatively high when applied in mountainous areas previous researchers had also found errors in the accuracy of non uniform underlying surfaces zhong et al 2020 this could also be explained by the model mechanism the y sebal model improved the calculation of sensible heat flux connecting the sensible heat flux with the net radiation flux reducing the systematic error caused by iterative calculation the same soil heat flux was closely related to the net radiation flux which increased the importance of the net radiation flux in the whole model in other words the accuracy of the net radiation flux calculation would directly determine the accuracy of et simulation so the deviation and error of net radiation flux would be directly substituted into the simulated et and the product quality of input parameters would directly determine the accuracy of et simulation future research needs to consider the problem of reducing the system error and heterogeneity of the underlying surface the model inversion et was susceptible to the sensitivity of the drivers and produces errors the sensitivity of the driving data of the y sebal model was also calculated in this paper as shown in fig 9 where the sensitivity of wind speed was the highest at haibei station reaching 0 714 the second was albedo with a sensitivity of 0 696 and the third was the normalized difference vegetation index with a sensitivity of approximately 0 662 however the sensitivities of air temperature and surface temperature were relatively low at 0 309 and 0 237 respectively similar results were also shown in haibei marsh station previous studies have shown that the main cause of et variation in central and western china is due to reduced wind speed ying et al 2010 in australia wind speed has been found to be a driver closely related to evaporation variation in evaporation dishes rayner 2007 roderick et al 2007 with wind accelerating the mobility of evaporating surface air which in turn affects evapotranspiration wind can accelerate the mobility of air on the evaporating surface and thus affect evaporation large scale changes in atmospheric circulation can affect wind speed chen et al 2006 incident solar radiation has also been found to be highly correlated with wind speed xu et al 2006 on the tibetan plateau researchers have found that wind speed is the most important factor affecting et0 chen et al 2006 zhang et al 2007 ruhoff et al 2012 compared the results of et simulated from modis satellite images with eddy correlation values in brazil and found that ndvi temperature gradient and net radiation are highly sensitive input parameters to the model it is worth noting that various meteorological factors including wind speed albedo downward solar radiation relative humidity and air temperature can affect et directly or indirectly shi et al 2017 tomer and schilling 2009 du et al 2016 mcvicar et al 2012 yang et al 2019 errors in these input parameters could lead to great uncertainty in et estimation distinguishing the main features that influence et variability in areas with complex topography and land use types was critical 5 conclusions the sebal model with improved sensible heat flux was proposed to address the problems of adequate selection of hot and cold pixels heterogeneity of the subsurface and instability of the lower atmosphere the simulation results showed that the et simulated by the y sebal model had good similarity with the ec values of the flux stations compared with the sebal model mod16 model and ssebop model the y sebal model had satisfactory performance in estimating et the spatial and temporal evolution of the study area was quantitatively assessed using the model proposed in this study and the results showed that the y sebal model could better capture the seasonal variation characteristics of et in arid and semi arid regions it was worth noting that wind speed albedo and vegetation index were the three most sensitive driving factors therefore y sebal model was an effective method to explore the spatiotemporal evolution of evapotranspiration and provided a reference for the assessment and management of agricultural water use in large scale arid and semi arid areas the most sensitive drivers might introduce uncertainty to et estimation although the model had been applied outside the research field and achieved good simulation results the applicability of the model was still insufficient future study would continue to focus on the simulation effect of y sebal model in different areas and evaluate the applicability of large scale areas credit authorship

2103,numerous studies found that the co2 fertilization effect can enhance vegetation growth however some recent studies showed that the increase of vapor pressure deficit vpd could reduce vegetation growth due to an increase in surface resistance it remains unclear to what extent vpd increases can offset the co2 fertilization effect here we examined the long term trends of terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp at the global scale using six products derived from satellite observations machine learning algorithms and dynamic vegetation model simulations while we found significant increases p less than 0 05 in gpp in most of the world we also found significant decreases in gpp over the amazon basin western north america eastern europe and central asia our attribution analysis showed that although the elevated co2 concentration dominated the long term trends of gpp vpd also played an important role the increasing vpd could explain the decreasing gpp over the arid and tropical regions the negative contribution of vpd to gpp trends appeared to become amplified with time leading to suppressed global vegetation growth in the last two decades the amplified contribution of vpd to gpp trends was directly related to the decrease in soil moisture indicating the soil moisture induced land atmosphere coupling lac and the vegetation growth stagnation since the year 2000 our results provide insight into the negative contribution of vpd to long term gpp trends which can partly offset 68 21 of the co2 fertilization effect and even stagnate the vegetation growth with time the possible mechanisms behind the effect of soil moisture vpd coupling on the vegetation dynamics at the global scale needs further investigation keywords co2 fertilization effects global gross primary productivity vapor pressure deficit vegetation growth stagnation land atmosphere coupling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp was the largest component of the global carbon cycle denoting the amount of assimilated carbon with plant photosynthesis beer et al 2010 huang et al 2019 an accurate gpp estimation could improve understanding the relationships between gpp and multiple aspects of human life such as food fiber and fossil fuel consumption norby et al 2010 quéré et al 2018 terrestrial gpp represented land carbon uptake and was closely related to atmospheric co2 concentrations schimel et al 2015 atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased significantly in recent decades and reached as high as 410 ppm by 2019 friedlingstein et al 2020 land carbon uptake could significantly regulate the inter annual variability of atmospheric co2 concentration piao et al 2020 he et al 2021 given the importance of land carbon uptake large scale afforestation has been considered as one of the main ways to achieve carbon neutralization hence the estimation of the accurate gpp dynamics was needed to improve our understanding of global land carbon sink mallapaty 2020 the long term changes of vegetation growth were determined by a number of different factors including co2 concentration zhu et al 2016 air temperature cox et al 2013 soil water content liu et al 2020 solar radiation mercado et al 2009 and vapor pressure deficit vpd yuan et al 2019 for instance zhu et al 2016 reported that co2 fertilization effects could regulate global vegetation growth song et al 2022 quantified the effects of co2 air temperature vpd precipitation and radiation on global annual growing season vegetation growth and concluded that co2 fertilization was the main contribution to widespread vegetation greening after 2000 however there were also other drivers that influenced vegetation growth some studies suggested that anomalous enso el niño southern oscillation events liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 and natural climatic and anthropogenic induced large fires could also significantly alter global vegetation growth reichstein et al 2013 there are still ongoing debates on how climatic drivers control vegetation growth liu et al 2020 found that decreasing soil moisture induced atmospheric stress in vegetated areas altering as high as 70 ecosystem productivity other studies also found the effect of water availability soil moisture on vegetation growth was relatively high in semi arid regions ahlstrom et al 2015 however in some studies atmospheric variables i e air temperature vpd were found to be more significant than the water availability for vegetation growth lu et al 2022 for example besnard et al 2021 pointed out that atmospheric variables e g air temperature vpd solar radiation would control forest carbon changes over 56 of global land while water related variables e g soil moisture and precipitation would dominate only 29 of the global land based on the correlation analysis between annual gpp and climatic variables the dominant factor controlling global gpp has been changed to vpd after 2000 s madani et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 reported that increased vpd significantly reduced global vegetation growth after the 1990 s these contradictory findings are partly due to uncertainties caused by differences in data sources attribution methods and temporal scales the importance of vpd on vegetation growth has been studied novick et al 2016 and sulman et al 2016 argued that vpd could show stronger effects on ecosystem carbon fluxes than soil moisture in the energy limited regions it has been widely argued that high vpd increases evapotranspiration li et al 2021 xu et al 2022 leading to stomatal closure to avoid water loss consequently limiting the photosynthesis novick et al 2016 mcadam and brodribb 2015 in fact it is very difficult to isolate the effects of soil moisture and vpd on vegetation growth and to determine which factor plays a dominant role in vegetation growth this is because global land vegetation is under an integrated and complex land atmosphere environment based on factorial climate model simulations humphrey et al 2021 found that soil moisture variability controlled up to 90 of inter annual land carbon uptake net biome production at the global scale the direct soil moisture effect was only 20 while the indirect soil moisture effect through air temperature vpd reached up to 69 of land carbon uptake variability lesk et al 2021 pointed out that stronger soil moisture air temperature coupling was exacerbating the effects of climate warming on global crop yields with the global eddy covariance flux observations fu et al 2022 indicated that the negative contribution of vpd to gpp existed across the entire soil moisture range and the magnitude of the negative contribution of vpd was greater if soil moisture was lower their studies concluded the relative contribution of soil moisture and vpd a coupling effect to vegetation growth should not be isolated there is a strong soil moisture vpd coupling mechanism when soil moisture decreases actual evapotranspiration decreases air temperature increases relative humidity decreases and consequently vpd increases zhou et al 2019b hence the soil moisture atmosphere feedback is thought to limit vegetation growth and reduce productivity the above discussions have indicated that co2 fertilization dominates vegetation growth however the effects of co2 on vegetation photosynthesis are decreasing across the globe wang et al 2020 rising co2 is also changing the sensitivity of vegetation growth to climatic variables for example the vegetation greenness s sensitivity to precipitation is decreasing due to rising co2 zhang et al 2022 until now the joint effects of rising co2 and lac on vegetation growth have not been quantified at the global scale in this study we used six multi source gpp products satellite machine learning and dynamic vegetation models based and era5 meteorological variables to conduct related analyses our research objectives are i to detect global gpp trends ii to assess the impacts of co2 concentration and other four variables i e soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd climatic factors on gpp trends during growing season iii to determine which driver dominates long term gpp trends at the global scale and iv to explain the slow and almost stagnant global vegetation growth after the 2000 s with time varying attribution of gpp changes 2 method and data 2 1 datasets gpp datasets used in this study include four satellite based products one machine learning algorithm based product fluxcom and ensemble outputs of trendy from ten global land surface or dynamic vegetation models the four satellite based gpp products included three optical nirv gimms and glass and one microwave vodca remote sensing datasets the detailed descriptions of these products were listed in table 1 the used climatic variables co2 concentration and ancillary data were introduced in the following sections table s1 all gpp datasets used in the study include effects of co2 but do so differently as shown in table s1 only glass and trendy use co2 concentration as a constraint factor in lue to consider the co2 effects in the vegetation physiological feedback for nirv gimms and vodca the impact of co2 on gpp was indirectly considered in vegetation indexes i e nirv fpar and vod respectively in table s1 for machine learning based fluxcom gpp was estimated with statistical relationships between gpp and meteorological variables machine learning methods were used to train the relationships with the gpp and meteorological variables form fluxnet site observations and the relationship includes co2 information by fluxnet gpp observation values indirectly 2 1 1 multi source global gpp products 1 nirv gpp near infrared reflectance vegetation the global gpp was estimated from the monthly reflectance of avhrrs land long term data record v4 ltdr wang et al 2021 the ltdr was an extensively quality controlled estimate of monthly reflectance at red and near infrared bands pedelty et al 2007 the nirv data production included 1 data screening for quality assured monthly median values 2 the nirv was calculated from the product of the ndvi and nir reflectance the bare soil signal of the ndvi data was eliminated by subtracting 0 08 from the original ndvi value before calculating nirv the global nirv gpp product was estimated with the statistical relationship between nirv and gpp which was trained by global 104 eddy covariance flux tower gpp observations and corresponding nirv estimations the nirv gpp has a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree and a period of 1982 2018 further details of the product can be obtained from wang et al 2021 2 two light use efficiency based gpp products global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms global land surface satellite glass long term gimms and glass global gpp products were estimated with a corrected light use efficiency based algorithms lue the parameters in lue of the two products were optimized using observations from global fluxnet sites compared to the original lue the modified lue took into account the constraints of air temperature and vpd on the lue for both gimms and glass madani et al 2020 in addition glass included atmospheric co2 concentration as a constraint on the lue algorithm compared to gimms zheng et al 2020 both products used the same meteorological variables from the second modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra2 as forcing gimms used gimms canopy fraction of photosynthetically active radiation par data while glass took direct par diffuse par from merra2 and glass lai co2 concentration in glass was from noaa s earth system research laboratory gimms with the span of 1982 2016 had 8 km spatial resolution monthly interval glass had spatial resolution of 0 05 degree and 8 day interval for the period 1982 2018 3 machine learning algorithm based product fluxcom gpp fluxcom gpp was estimated from statistical relationships between gpp and meteorological variables from era5 meteorological forcing data i e air temperature water availability and solar radiation jung et al 2020 the relationships were trained by three algorithms random forests artificial neural networks and multivariate adaptive regression splines with globally distributed fluxnet observations i e gpp and meteorological variables six sets of monthly gpp products from 1979 to 2018 were produced due to three fitting algorithms and two gpp partitioning methods in fluxnet observations the spatial resolution was 0 5 degree the ensemble gpp of these data sets was used here fluxcom gpp has been widely used to explore vegetation growth mechanism by many studies feng et al 2021 yang et al 2022 jung et al 2017 however it is noted that some studies found that the trend magnitudes of annul gpp are smaller compared to other gpp products e g glass and nirv zheng et al 2020 the trend underestimation is possibly due to fluxcom underestimating the sensitivity of gpp to inter annual climate variations anav et al 2015 4 trendyv8 multi model simulated gpp trendyv8 was the latest version of the simulated gpp from a model comparison project which used process based models to quantify the global carbon budget representing the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change le quéré et al 2018 the basic idea was to run dynamic global vegetation models dgvms with forced co2 concentration climatic variables and land use data each dgvm model was run under three simulation scenarios s1 varying co2 static climatic condition and land use change s2 varying co2 and climatic condition static land use change s3 varying co2 climatic condition and land use change this study used ten models of s3 simulation of monthly gpp with 0 5 degree spatial resolution and a span of 1700 2018 ten models were orchidee cnp ocn lpj guess jules jsbach clm5 0 class ctem cable pop visits and sdgvm the overview and detail of these model can refer to le quéré et al 2018 5 vodca gpp vegetation optical depth climate archive vodca gpp is the first microwave remote sensing based derived global long term 1988 2020 gpp product utilizing vegetation optical depth vod data wild et al 2022 the vod product used the land parameter retrieval model lprm to merge multi source vod datasets from different sensors with ku x c bands teubner et al 2021 proposed a new carbon sink driven gpp estimation model which described the tight theoretical relationship between gpp s components ecosystem net uptake of carbon maintenance respiration and growth respiration and vod vodca gpp was generated with this model driven by vod product and era5 land air temperature it had spatial resolution of 0 25 degree and monthly time interval 2 1 2 climatic variables and co2 concentration monthly 2 meter above the ground air temperature 2 meter dewpoint temperature surface downward solar radiation and three layers of soil moisture 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm were used for this study these data were obtained from era5 land with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree from 1950 to now the soil moisture between 0 and 1 m was weighted and averaged according to the thickness of each layer soil moisture between 0 and 1 m was used here the monthly vpd can be calculated using the air temperature and dew point temperature allen et al 1998 despite era5 land variables have widely used soil moisture and air temperature related variables in mountainous regions have some biases compared to observation values beck et al 2022 global monthly average co2 concentration 1980 present was obtained from the noaa s earth system research laboratory 2 1 3 ancillary data to study the global gpp mechanism for different land cover types we decided to use the modis land cover map from 2001 modis landcover data divides global land into 17 land cover classifications proposed by the international geosphere biosphere program friedl et al 2010 we aggregated evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest deciduous needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest and mixed forest into forests type closed shrublands and open shrublands into shrublands and woody savannas and savannas into savannas fig 1 shows the selected five land cover types 31 50 forests 31 71 shrublands 13 67 savannas 8 66 grasslands and 14 46 croplands respectively 2 1 4 data preprocessing the spatial resolutions of all datasets gpp and era5 land climatic variables were resampled to 0 5 degrees by the bicubic interpolation method monthly gpp products were aggregated into annual means while monthly era5 climatic variables were aggregated to values for the growing season how the growing seasons were determined is discussed in section 2 2 given the overlapping period of gimms nirv glass fluxcom and trendy the study period was 1982 2016 while vodca s study period was 1988 2016 all variables and gpp values were kept in their original values 2 2 attribution method we selected the months at the grid scale with mean surface air temperature 0 as the vegetation growth season based on the climatology for 1982 2016 from era5 feng et al 2021 this method is effective in reducing the effect of snow cover errors and large solar zenith angles on the length of the growing season the length of the growing season was consistent with an alternative method proposed by zhu et al 2016 for most of global land with the exception of some tropical regions they identified the growing season with daily gimms lai3g vegetation data in the tropics the duration of the growing season is overestimated one to two months resulting in a very limited average soil moisture and air temperature in the final growing season compared to the multi year average our growing season is one year in the tropics figure s1 the final attributed results are not also sensitive to the overestimation from the growing season definition with air temperature 0 figure s2 monthly values of climatic variables i e soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd are averaged to get corresponding growing season mean values with partial least square regression pls we can quantify the contribution of co2 vpd air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture to gpp changes during the growing season in each product like the multiple linear regression mls the basic idea of pls is building the regression linear relationship between independent and dependent variables the biggest difference between pls and mls is that pls projects latent independent and dependent variables into the new space with orthogonal decomposition method and builds the new linear regression according to the covariance maximization rule sijmen de jong 1993 given these pls has the better performances for multivariate analysis compared to the other regression methods especially for the existing autocorrelation between independent variables guan et al 2017 we use the plsregress function of matlab to conduct the analysis the figure s3 showed that the variance inflation factor vif between air temperature and vpd was less than 4 0 for most of global land and only the vif of sahara desert sparse vegetation in the north of africa was more than 6 0 fu et al 2020 and lu et al 2021 concluded that vif less than 6 indicated a weak degree of collinearity in the partial regression method the regression model was expressed as 1 gpp β c o 2 c o 2 β vpd v p d β tem t e m β rad r a d β sm s m b ε where β c o 2 β vpd β tem β rad β sm indicated regression slopes of co2 vpd air temperature tem solar radiation rad and soil moisture sm respectively b was the intercept ε was random error gppco2 gppvpd gpptem gpprad gppsm represented the contribution of co2 β c o 2 c o 2 vpd β vpd v p d tem β tem t e m rad β rad r a d and sm β sm s m respectively to facilitate comparison of the contributions of the driving factors we subtracted the contribution of each factor in the first year from its respective annual growing season contribution refer to as the change in the annual growing season contribution of gpp relative to the first year i e δ gpp i i m e a n s d r i v i n g f a c t o r hereafter gpp annual growing season changes indicated the change in gpp annual growing season relative to the first year gpp annual growing season changes relative to the first year was approximately equal to the sum of annual growing season contribution changes of all driving factors subscripts x y represented grid cell indexes and year respectively in addition we estimated correlation coefficients between gpp changes and the time varying contribution of each factor using the pearson correlation method the correlations can indicate the direction of the factor s contribution to gpp a positive correlation value means that the factor contributes to the increase in gpp while a negative correlation value means that the factor decreased gpp 2 3 trends in gpp and contributions from climatic variables the linear trend of long term gpp and the contribution of annual growing season trends in climatic variables for each product was calculated using the theil sen slope method compared to the linear regression this method is not sensitive to outliers and skewness of data and is the most robust non parametric technique to calculate linear trends wilcox 2010 we used the non parametric mann kendall test to determine the significance level of the linear trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 both methods have been widely used in hydrology and meteorology studies su et al 2015 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2016 to quantify the proportion of each driving factor s time varying contribution trends rci was defined 3 rc i trend δ g p p i trend δ g p p i 100 where i meant driving factor trend δ g p p i indicated the time varying contribution trend of driving factor i and trend δ g p p i was the sum of absolute values of contribution change trend of all driving factors 3 results 3 1 trends in long term gpp fig 2 describes spatial distribution of the trends in gpp estimated from the six products in the term of gpp trend magnitude fluxcom showed a moderate change with the rate of 4 0 4 0 g c m2 year compared to the other products in the term of gpp sign increasing or decreasing trend all products except vodca could detect consistently increasing trends in most of europe eastern north america eastern and northern asia and indian subcontinent while vodca showed abnormal decreasing trends in most of these regions for example except for vodca all products showed a significant increase in gpp with the rate of 0 8 0 g c m2 year in most northern hemisphere high latitude regions in contrast vodca showed an abnormal gpp decreasing trend with even less than 12 0 g c m2 year for some of these regions consistently decreasing trends for all products were found in western north america and part of europe and central asia except gimms with slightly increasing trends the divergence results in gpp trends among these products were found in africa australia and south america for example gimms glass fluxcom and vodca showed a clear decreasing trend in south america especially in the amazon basin while nirv and trendy showed an increasing trend in particular gimms and glass showed decreasing gpp rates 12 0 g c m2 year while nirv and trendy showed increasing rates of more than 8 0 g c m2 year 3 2 trend attribution of annual growing season gpp 3 2 1 trend attribution of annual growing season gpp fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of each climatic variable s contribution to long term trends of global gpp annual growing season due to the slight variation in gpp for fluxcom we reduced the color bar values in fig 3 by a factor of 10 to more visually show the pattern of contribution of each driver co2 concentration vpd and air temperature dominate gpp trends for all gpp products except fluxcom solar radiation and soil moisture directly influenced gpp trends with relatively smaller contributions the co2 and air temperature have shown a positive contribution to annual growing season gpp trends and vpd has shown negative contributions spatially more contributions from co2 vpd and air temperature to annual growing season gpp trends were found in most of the amazon basin central africa and europe the effect of solar radiation and soil moisture on the variation of gpp of fluxcom compared to other products should not be neglected either the global land averaged co2 vpd air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture contributions to gpp annual growing season trends for all products were shown in fig 4 a 1 5 different contributions were found among gpp products for nirv the contribution of co2 was more than 80 00 while vpd s contribution was only about 10 00 and the contributions from air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture were minimal compared to nirv trendy had similar results for fluxcom the contribution of vpd was about 47 93 while co2 had only little contribution gimms glass and vodca indicated that the contributions of co2 and vpd were similar in all gpp products excluding nirv the contributions of air temperature contribution to gpp were more than 12 00 in the forest the positive contribution of co2 to gimms glass and vodca tended to decrease and even changed to negative contributions with gimms and vodca the divergent results in the forest mainly resulted from co2 contributions in the broadleaf forests evergreen and deciduous figure s4 in broadleaf forests the co2 contributions of gimms glass and fluxcom were negative while the other three products contributions of co2 contribution were positive the patterns of remaining driving factors were consistent for other land cover types for shrublands savannas grasslands and croplands the general contribution of driving factors to all products were similar however there are some exceptions for example air temperature contributions were reduced in savannas for all products excluding fluxcom the negative contributions of soil moisture in grasslands were amplified for all products the positive contribution of co2 was the largest for all products excluding fluxcom besides the contributions of vpd and air temperature cannot be neglected in global land and different landcover types and even vpd absolute contributions for gimms and glass were more than co2 in forests 3 2 2 spatial distribution of dominant factors on long term trends of global gpp annual growing season further the spatial distribution of driving factors dominating long term trends of global gpp annual growing season was shown in fig 5 the factor with the largest contribution is identified as the dominant factor except for fluxcom the results in fig 5 indicated that co2 effect dominated gpp changes of most global land for all products the percentages of co2 were at least more than 53 as shown in table 2 especially 75 for nirv and trendy for fluxcome the impact of co2 effect on gpp was very limited and the percentage of co2 was 16 11 while the sum of the percentage of air temperature and vpd was more than 60 vpd as a dominant factor controlled some of tropical regions e g amazon basin and arid regions including eastern europe and north america middle part of asia in a range of 11 80 39 62 with all products for air temperature the dominant regions were mostly located in mid high latitudes in the northern hemisphere except vodca air temperature mostly controlled some regions of africa and south america for vodca the effects of soil moisture and solar radiation were limited and the sum of percentages of the both factors was less than 10 except fluxcom 3 3 time varying attribution of annual growing season gpp changes fig 6 showed the time varying contribution of driving factors to global average gpp annual growing season changes relative to the first year in terms of the global land scale annual growing season gpp for all products excluding fluxcom increased with different magnitudes black lines in fig 6 similar to the trend results in fig 2d annual growing season gpp for fluxcom did not vary significantly with a slightly decreasing trend based on the attribution results in each driving factor we found except fluxcom the contributions of co2 and air temperature for all products were increasing while the contributions from vpd were decreasing the effects of soil moisture and solar radiation did not change significantly for nirv and trendy the absolute values of contributions from co2 were more than the air temperature and vpd which indicated that the co2 effect dominates global gpp changes for gimms glass and vodca increasing gpp were attributed to the co2 and air temperature combined effects due to the negative contribution from vpd for fluxcom the contribution of vpd far exceeded the sum of the remaining factors contribution resulting in slightly decreasing changes in the global annual growing season gpp the contribution results showing at the global average scale were not always consistent with that over different landcover types figure s5 for forests the contributions of co2 to gimms glass and vodca were small and even the contribution of co2 to gimms and vodca was decreasing from the correlation coefficients between global gpp products and corresponding contributing factors shown in table 3 we found that co2 air temperature and solar radiation were generally positively correlated with the global gpp annual growing season changes fig 6 in contrast vpd showed a negative correlation with those contributing factors and most of these coefficients were significantly correlated alpha 5 however some exceptions might be due to the differences in algorithms and input data among gpp products for example the correlation coefficients of soil moisture for nirv and trendy were negative although nirv did not pass the significance test the directions of correlation coefficients of solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 with fluxcom were reversed similar results could be found in different landcover types table s2 we should note that compared to the other products coefficients of vpd for gimms fluxcom and vodca were positive in forests the positive correlation coefficients were due to the negative contribution in vpd dominating gpp annual growing season changes in forests in this study the contribution of soil moisture to global gpp changes was found to be very limited compared to co2 vpd and air temperature to quantify the indirect effect of soil moisture on gpp we calculated temporal contributions of co2 vpd and air temperature to gpp trends during increasing soil moisture a c e in fig 7 and during decreasing soil moisture b d f in fig 7 conditions the global trend map of soil moisture was presented in figure s6a it was found that global soil moisture changes did not affect the temporal contribution from co2 and air temperature to gpp while the negative contribution from vpd was found to be amplified as revealed by the gradual expansion of forest savannas grasslands and croplands worldwide for shrublands however the amplified contribution of vpd was found to be relatively small fig 7 there are evident differences in vpd contribution among gpp products the contribution of vpd to nirv did not capture the effect of soil moisture changes for all landcover types however vpd had the highest contribution to glass over global land average forests and savannas to further explain the relationship between the contribution of vpd to gpp trends and soil moisture we compared the median contribution of vpd to the trend of six gpp products with the coupling strength of soil moisture vpd fig 8 the sum of the area covered by the coupling strength less than 0 4 exceeded 80 as shown in figure s6 there was a strong relationship between global soil moisture and vpd during the growing season of 1982 2016 it was found in fig 8 that the soil moisture vpd coupling directly controlled the magnitude of the contribution of vpd to gpp trends this indicated that the greater the strength of the coupling the greater the contribution of vpd 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of results 4 1 1 gpp trend comparisons the spatial distribution of long term gpp trends for all products was shown in fig 2 compared to other products the trends in the magnitude of gpp with fluxcom was very small which was ranging from 4 0 to 4 0 g c m2 year similar results of gpp trends with fluxcom could be found in wang et al 2021 and zheng et al 2020 all products except vodca showed a significant increase in gpp in the northern hemisphere at mid to high latitudes i e tundra and boreal ecosystems however with vodca middle high latitude regions showed a significant decrease in gpp the difference in results between vodca and other gpp products might be due to the fact that microwave vod data contained confounding explanatory information on biomass and plant water content momen et al 2017 increasing gpp trends could also be found in most of europe eastern north america eastern asia and the indian subcontinent with all products excluding fluxcom previous studies suggested that the increasing gpp results were consistent with the greening trends observed by long term satellite records zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 there were divergences in gpp trends among those products over africa australia and south america for fluxcom and trendy australia showed a decline in overall gpp while other gpp products showed increase in australia the largest differences among gpp products were over south america especially for the amazon basin for example gimms and glass showed a clear decreasing trend of gpp over the amazon basin while a clear increasing trend could also be found for nirv and trendy fig 6 and figure s5 the divergence of gpp with different products was thought to be due to the underestimation of the sensitivity of gpp to vpd in the amazon basin yuan et al 2019 madani et al 2020 with multi source global gpp products relatively consistent gpp trends could be found in most regions of the global land however there were significant differences in gpp trends due to differences in estimation algorithms and model parameters between gpp products for example between nirv trendy and other products in the amazon basin and between vodca and other products in the mid high northern latitudes 4 1 2 trend attribution comparison of gpp based on the partial regression method we quantified the contribution of soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 to gpp trends in pixel scale fig 3 the positive contributions of co2 and air temperature and the negative contribution of vpd were found to control the global gpp trends while solar radiation and soil moisture impacts were found to be very limited similar results were found for all landcover types except co2 s contribution in forests with gimms and glass fig 4 further we identified the spatial distribution of land with dominating gpp trends fig 5 in which co2 effect was found to dominate gpp trends over most of the global land for all products excluding fluxcom while vpd effect was found to dominate gpp trends with fluxcom as discussed in the previous section fluxcom failed to capture the effect of co2 fertilization on gpp leading to the limited impact of co2 on gpp a negative contribution of vpd to gpp trends appeared to explain the decrease in fluxcom over most global land despite the co2 fertilization the impact of air temperature and vpd on gpp trends could not be ignored for all products table 2 air temperature and vpd were found to control some parts of the arid region for nirv and trendy while air temperature alone was found to control parts of boreal high latitude regions with gimms glass and fluxcom respectively vpd on the other hand dominated parts of the middle latitude region of the northern hemisphere and the tropical region with gimms and glass fig 5 the distribution of regions controlled by vpd was found to be similar with vodca gimms and glass while the effect of air temperature was found to be mostly located around parts of south america and africa for vodca fig 5 the influence of co2 fertilization on gpp which explained a large fraction of vegetation trends in the globe has been studied by zhu et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 from a leaf level perspective rising co2 accelerated carboxylation rate and enhanced photosynthesis farquhar and sharkey 1982 chen et al 2022 our study confirmed the importance of co2 fertilization effect on vegetation growth meanwhile climatic variables were also the major drivers of vegetation growth piao et al 2020 jung et al 2017 the sum of the percentages of climatic variables mainly air temperature and vpd had become a dominant factor and was more than 40 for gimms glass fluxcom and vodca respectively table 2 the results of the positive contribution of air temperature and negative contribution of vpd to gpp found in this study fig 3 were consistent with several other studies including jung et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 and dang et al 2022 as one of the essential factors of controlling vegetation growth increasing air temperature tended to increase photosynthesis through enhancing metabolism braswell et al 1997 and lengthening the growing season piao et al 2007 richardson et al 2010 especially in boreal and arctic regions co2 and air temperature were the major driving forces of the vegetation greening mainly over northern middle high latitudes the divergence of gpp trends over tropical zone among gpp products was due to vpd with negative contribution dominating gpp trends for gimms glass fluxcom and vodca while the positive contribution of co2 controlling gpp trends for nirv and trendy fig 2 fig 5 decreasing gpp trend as revealed by vpd effect over the tropical zone was consistent with that of the study by zheng et al 2020 based on cloud free observations data from microwave satellites liu et al 2015 and fan et al 2019 found that carbon loss in tropical forests suggested that nirv and trendy overestimated the sensitivity of co2 and underestimated the sensitivity of vpd moreover the lack of nutrient limitation and overestimation of lai might lead to an overestimation of the contribution of co2 madani et al 2020 murray tortarolo et al 2013 4 1 3 time varying attribution comparison of gpp changes if we only focused on the attribution of long term gpp trends our estimation could be biased as this could ignore the mechanism behind gpp trend due to the changes in time hence we quantified the time varying contribution of soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 to gpp changes at both global land scale and different landcover types fig 6 and figure s5 from the global land average scale the impacts of co2 on gpp for all products excluding fluxcom were increasing from 1982 to 2016 particularly for nirv and trendy products the impacts of co2 far exceeded the sum of the other driving factors resulting in the significant increase in gpp meanwhile it is noted that the negative contributions of vpd were increasing for all products negative contributions of vpd resulted in slower growth of gpp after the 2000 s and even the stagnation of growth with gimms glass and vodca fig 6 feng et al 2021 and yuan et al 2019 have verified the slower vegetation growth at the average global land scale for example yuan et al 2019 suggested that the negative contribution of vpd was more than the co2 fertilization effect leading to limited vegetation growth after the 1998 s similar results could be found in our study figure s5 in different landcover types excluding forests as shown in fig 4b1 the co2 fertilization effects on forests from gimms glass and vodca were limited and even seen as negative to identify which forest type dominates the results we divided the contributions of forests into two types evergreen broadleaf forest the other forests figure s7 the results showed that the divergences of co2 contribution for gimms glass vodca and nirv trendy were greater for forests due to the differences of the evergreen broadleaf forest the uncertainties of co2 fertilization effect on forests among those gpp products were also found by chen et al 2022 the mechanism of vpd affecting gpp was that increasing vpd decreased canopy conductance and further limited vegetation photosynthesis fu et al 2022 however liu et al 2020 indicated that the impact of vpd on vegetation growth was limited while soil moisture controlled vegetation growth in our study the impact of soil moisture on gpp was limited compared to vpd to study the effect of soil moisture on the contribution of remaining factors to gpp trends we divided the time varying contribution of co2 vpd and air temperature for different landcover into two types of soil moisture trends increasing soil moisture or decreasing soil moisture fig 7 it was found that soil moisture changes did not affect the results of co2 and air temperature contributions while vpd contribution was amplified for decreasing soil moisture compared to the increasing soil moisture trend furthermore we found that soil moisture vpd coupling controlled the contribution of vpd to gpp trends fig 8 when the strength of the soil moisture vpd coupling was maximum the contribution of vpd was also maximum the results implied that vegetation growth stagnation after the 2000 s might be related to changes in the soil moisture vpd coupling process decreasing soil moisture reduced actual evapotranspiration latent heat increased air temperature decreased humidity in the air and eventually increased vpd figure s6 increasing vpd tended to increase actual evapotranspiration which further reduced soil moisture caused vegetation stomatal closure to avoid water loss li et al 2022 zhou et al 2019a and finally reduced vegetation growth rigden et al 2020 this indicated that decreasing soil moisture induced soil moisture atmosphere feedback by vpd which indirectly dominated vegetation growth humphrey et al 2021 our results emphasized that soil moisture induced lac controlled vegetation growth in the context of climatic change at global land scale in addition the air temperature greater than 0 was selected as the criteria in this study to define the growing season in fact the optimal air temperature for vegetation growth was more than 10 for most biomes huang et al 2019 if this threshold was approached the photosynthesis of vegetation started to be restricted by the soil moisture deficit the air temperature greater than 0 criteria of defining growing season might reduce the contribution of soil moisture to gpp 4 2 validation of the attribution method 4 2 1 validation of attribution results this study selected six sets of state of the art multi source gpp products which have been widely used to understand the vegetation atmosphere interactions those products have been validated by various studies in the past with the observations from global fluxnet sites and inter comparisons with the other gpp products including gimms madani et al 2017 madani et al 2020 nirv wang et al 2021 glass zheng et al 2020 trendy le quéré et al 2018 vodca wild et al 2022 and fluxcom jung et al 2020 we validated the accuracy of the attribution method that we have used in this study the results were shown in fig 9 comparing the annual growing season gpp changes for each product with the accumulative contribution of five driving variables to annual growing season gpp changes the fitted lines for all products showed a strong 1 1 relationship red line in fig 9 with relatively high r2 coefficients 0 43 0 78 and low values of root mean square error rmse 15 82 149 5 g c m2 year fig 9 the comparison results indicated that our attribution method had relatively accurately captured the long term trends of annual growing season gpp 4 2 2 validation of the partial regression model linear models have become one of the common methods to quantify the contribution of climatic variables to interannual trends or changes in ecosystem production for example jung et al 2017 and humphrey et al 2021 used linear models to estimate the effects of soil moisture air temperature vpd and solar radiation on inter annual variability of global land carbon uptake wang et al 2021 used the linear regression method to estimate the sensitivity of global annual gpp changes to co2 similar studies with linear models could also be found in song et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and smith et al 2016 in fact non linear relationships existed between gpp and climatic variables although linear models have been widely used in related gpp studies therefore to validate the accuracy of partial regression method used in this study we used two non linear methods to calculate the temporal contribution of co2 and vpd to annual growing season gpp changes the co2 and vpd as taken as examples since these two variables controlled most of the global terrestrial gpp trends the two approaches were the revised lue model and the linear model that considered additional interactions between co2 and vpd and air temperature a detailed description could be found in the supplementary section here we only chose glass gpp as the dependent variable since glass was calculated using the revised ec lue model figure s8 showed the partial correlation of temporal contribution of co2 and vpd between partial regression and the other two non linear methods the results by partial regression had highest spatial consistency partial correlation greater than 0 8 with linear model of considering additional interaction between co2 and vpd air temperature the results of the partial regression also had good performances partial correlation greater than 0 8 for most land with the revised ec lue model except for co2 in the amazon region overall the results of the partial regressions captured the responses of gpp trends to climatic variables on a long term scale 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the response of gpp trends to soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 for different land cover types using the partial regression method we also estimated the time varying attribution of annual growing season gpp changes to those driving factors to study the time varying mechanism of gpp our conclusions were summarized as follows gpp trends were increasing for most lands globally while gpp was decreasing significantly in some areas of western north america eastern europe and central asia especially in the amazon basin it was found that co2 effects dominated the gpp annual growing season trends while the impacts of vpd and air temperature on gpp could not be ignored negative contribution of vpd controlled gpp trends over some arid and tropical regions while air temperature dominated gpp trends over some parts of northern mid and high latitude regions the long term gpp trend study has some limitations as it may ignore the time varying properties of gpp changes it was found that the fertilization effect of co2 contributed to the sustained increase in gpp while the effect of co2 did not result in a sustained increase in gpp after the 2000 s this was mainly due to the negative contribution of vpd to global land gpp trends declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

2103,numerous studies found that the co2 fertilization effect can enhance vegetation growth however some recent studies showed that the increase of vapor pressure deficit vpd could reduce vegetation growth due to an increase in surface resistance it remains unclear to what extent vpd increases can offset the co2 fertilization effect here we examined the long term trends of terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp at the global scale using six products derived from satellite observations machine learning algorithms and dynamic vegetation model simulations while we found significant increases p less than 0 05 in gpp in most of the world we also found significant decreases in gpp over the amazon basin western north america eastern europe and central asia our attribution analysis showed that although the elevated co2 concentration dominated the long term trends of gpp vpd also played an important role the increasing vpd could explain the decreasing gpp over the arid and tropical regions the negative contribution of vpd to gpp trends appeared to become amplified with time leading to suppressed global vegetation growth in the last two decades the amplified contribution of vpd to gpp trends was directly related to the decrease in soil moisture indicating the soil moisture induced land atmosphere coupling lac and the vegetation growth stagnation since the year 2000 our results provide insight into the negative contribution of vpd to long term gpp trends which can partly offset 68 21 of the co2 fertilization effect and even stagnate the vegetation growth with time the possible mechanisms behind the effect of soil moisture vpd coupling on the vegetation dynamics at the global scale needs further investigation keywords co2 fertilization effects global gross primary productivity vapor pressure deficit vegetation growth stagnation land atmosphere coupling data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the terrestrial gross primary productivity gpp was the largest component of the global carbon cycle denoting the amount of assimilated carbon with plant photosynthesis beer et al 2010 huang et al 2019 an accurate gpp estimation could improve understanding the relationships between gpp and multiple aspects of human life such as food fiber and fossil fuel consumption norby et al 2010 quéré et al 2018 terrestrial gpp represented land carbon uptake and was closely related to atmospheric co2 concentrations schimel et al 2015 atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased significantly in recent decades and reached as high as 410 ppm by 2019 friedlingstein et al 2020 land carbon uptake could significantly regulate the inter annual variability of atmospheric co2 concentration piao et al 2020 he et al 2021 given the importance of land carbon uptake large scale afforestation has been considered as one of the main ways to achieve carbon neutralization hence the estimation of the accurate gpp dynamics was needed to improve our understanding of global land carbon sink mallapaty 2020 the long term changes of vegetation growth were determined by a number of different factors including co2 concentration zhu et al 2016 air temperature cox et al 2013 soil water content liu et al 2020 solar radiation mercado et al 2009 and vapor pressure deficit vpd yuan et al 2019 for instance zhu et al 2016 reported that co2 fertilization effects could regulate global vegetation growth song et al 2022 quantified the effects of co2 air temperature vpd precipitation and radiation on global annual growing season vegetation growth and concluded that co2 fertilization was the main contribution to widespread vegetation greening after 2000 however there were also other drivers that influenced vegetation growth some studies suggested that anomalous enso el niño southern oscillation events liu et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 and natural climatic and anthropogenic induced large fires could also significantly alter global vegetation growth reichstein et al 2013 there are still ongoing debates on how climatic drivers control vegetation growth liu et al 2020 found that decreasing soil moisture induced atmospheric stress in vegetated areas altering as high as 70 ecosystem productivity other studies also found the effect of water availability soil moisture on vegetation growth was relatively high in semi arid regions ahlstrom et al 2015 however in some studies atmospheric variables i e air temperature vpd were found to be more significant than the water availability for vegetation growth lu et al 2022 for example besnard et al 2021 pointed out that atmospheric variables e g air temperature vpd solar radiation would control forest carbon changes over 56 of global land while water related variables e g soil moisture and precipitation would dominate only 29 of the global land based on the correlation analysis between annual gpp and climatic variables the dominant factor controlling global gpp has been changed to vpd after 2000 s madani et al 2020 yuan et al 2019 reported that increased vpd significantly reduced global vegetation growth after the 1990 s these contradictory findings are partly due to uncertainties caused by differences in data sources attribution methods and temporal scales the importance of vpd on vegetation growth has been studied novick et al 2016 and sulman et al 2016 argued that vpd could show stronger effects on ecosystem carbon fluxes than soil moisture in the energy limited regions it has been widely argued that high vpd increases evapotranspiration li et al 2021 xu et al 2022 leading to stomatal closure to avoid water loss consequently limiting the photosynthesis novick et al 2016 mcadam and brodribb 2015 in fact it is very difficult to isolate the effects of soil moisture and vpd on vegetation growth and to determine which factor plays a dominant role in vegetation growth this is because global land vegetation is under an integrated and complex land atmosphere environment based on factorial climate model simulations humphrey et al 2021 found that soil moisture variability controlled up to 90 of inter annual land carbon uptake net biome production at the global scale the direct soil moisture effect was only 20 while the indirect soil moisture effect through air temperature vpd reached up to 69 of land carbon uptake variability lesk et al 2021 pointed out that stronger soil moisture air temperature coupling was exacerbating the effects of climate warming on global crop yields with the global eddy covariance flux observations fu et al 2022 indicated that the negative contribution of vpd to gpp existed across the entire soil moisture range and the magnitude of the negative contribution of vpd was greater if soil moisture was lower their studies concluded the relative contribution of soil moisture and vpd a coupling effect to vegetation growth should not be isolated there is a strong soil moisture vpd coupling mechanism when soil moisture decreases actual evapotranspiration decreases air temperature increases relative humidity decreases and consequently vpd increases zhou et al 2019b hence the soil moisture atmosphere feedback is thought to limit vegetation growth and reduce productivity the above discussions have indicated that co2 fertilization dominates vegetation growth however the effects of co2 on vegetation photosynthesis are decreasing across the globe wang et al 2020 rising co2 is also changing the sensitivity of vegetation growth to climatic variables for example the vegetation greenness s sensitivity to precipitation is decreasing due to rising co2 zhang et al 2022 until now the joint effects of rising co2 and lac on vegetation growth have not been quantified at the global scale in this study we used six multi source gpp products satellite machine learning and dynamic vegetation models based and era5 meteorological variables to conduct related analyses our research objectives are i to detect global gpp trends ii to assess the impacts of co2 concentration and other four variables i e soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd climatic factors on gpp trends during growing season iii to determine which driver dominates long term gpp trends at the global scale and iv to explain the slow and almost stagnant global vegetation growth after the 2000 s with time varying attribution of gpp changes 2 method and data 2 1 datasets gpp datasets used in this study include four satellite based products one machine learning algorithm based product fluxcom and ensemble outputs of trendy from ten global land surface or dynamic vegetation models the four satellite based gpp products included three optical nirv gimms and glass and one microwave vodca remote sensing datasets the detailed descriptions of these products were listed in table 1 the used climatic variables co2 concentration and ancillary data were introduced in the following sections table s1 all gpp datasets used in the study include effects of co2 but do so differently as shown in table s1 only glass and trendy use co2 concentration as a constraint factor in lue to consider the co2 effects in the vegetation physiological feedback for nirv gimms and vodca the impact of co2 on gpp was indirectly considered in vegetation indexes i e nirv fpar and vod respectively in table s1 for machine learning based fluxcom gpp was estimated with statistical relationships between gpp and meteorological variables machine learning methods were used to train the relationships with the gpp and meteorological variables form fluxnet site observations and the relationship includes co2 information by fluxnet gpp observation values indirectly 2 1 1 multi source global gpp products 1 nirv gpp near infrared reflectance vegetation the global gpp was estimated from the monthly reflectance of avhrrs land long term data record v4 ltdr wang et al 2021 the ltdr was an extensively quality controlled estimate of monthly reflectance at red and near infrared bands pedelty et al 2007 the nirv data production included 1 data screening for quality assured monthly median values 2 the nirv was calculated from the product of the ndvi and nir reflectance the bare soil signal of the ndvi data was eliminated by subtracting 0 08 from the original ndvi value before calculating nirv the global nirv gpp product was estimated with the statistical relationship between nirv and gpp which was trained by global 104 eddy covariance flux tower gpp observations and corresponding nirv estimations the nirv gpp has a spatial resolution of 0 05 degree and a period of 1982 2018 further details of the product can be obtained from wang et al 2021 2 two light use efficiency based gpp products global inventory modeling and mapping studies gimms global land surface satellite glass long term gimms and glass global gpp products were estimated with a corrected light use efficiency based algorithms lue the parameters in lue of the two products were optimized using observations from global fluxnet sites compared to the original lue the modified lue took into account the constraints of air temperature and vpd on the lue for both gimms and glass madani et al 2020 in addition glass included atmospheric co2 concentration as a constraint on the lue algorithm compared to gimms zheng et al 2020 both products used the same meteorological variables from the second modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications merra2 as forcing gimms used gimms canopy fraction of photosynthetically active radiation par data while glass took direct par diffuse par from merra2 and glass lai co2 concentration in glass was from noaa s earth system research laboratory gimms with the span of 1982 2016 had 8 km spatial resolution monthly interval glass had spatial resolution of 0 05 degree and 8 day interval for the period 1982 2018 3 machine learning algorithm based product fluxcom gpp fluxcom gpp was estimated from statistical relationships between gpp and meteorological variables from era5 meteorological forcing data i e air temperature water availability and solar radiation jung et al 2020 the relationships were trained by three algorithms random forests artificial neural networks and multivariate adaptive regression splines with globally distributed fluxnet observations i e gpp and meteorological variables six sets of monthly gpp products from 1979 to 2018 were produced due to three fitting algorithms and two gpp partitioning methods in fluxnet observations the spatial resolution was 0 5 degree the ensemble gpp of these data sets was used here fluxcom gpp has been widely used to explore vegetation growth mechanism by many studies feng et al 2021 yang et al 2022 jung et al 2017 however it is noted that some studies found that the trend magnitudes of annul gpp are smaller compared to other gpp products e g glass and nirv zheng et al 2020 the trend underestimation is possibly due to fluxcom underestimating the sensitivity of gpp to inter annual climate variations anav et al 2015 4 trendyv8 multi model simulated gpp trendyv8 was the latest version of the simulated gpp from a model comparison project which used process based models to quantify the global carbon budget representing the response of the terrestrial carbon cycle to climate change le quéré

term 1988 2020 gpp product utilizing vegetation optical depth vod data wild et al 2022 the vod product used the land parameter retrieval model lprm to merge multi source vod datasets from different sensors with ku x c bands teubner et al 2021 proposed a new carbon sink driven gpp estimation model which described the tight theoretical relationship between gpp s components ecosystem net uptake of carbon maintenance respiration and growth respiration and vod vodca gpp was generated with this model driven by vod product and era5 land air temperature it had spatial resolution of 0 25 degree and monthly time interval 2 1 2 climatic variables and co2 concentration monthly 2 meter above the ground air temperature 2 meter dewpoint temperature surface downward solar radiation and three layers of soil moisture 0 7 cm 7 28 cm 28 100 cm were used for this study these data were obtained from era5 land with a spatial resolution of 0 1 degree from 1950 to now the soil moisture between 0 and 1 m was weighted and averaged according to the thickness of each layer soil moisture between 0 and 1 m was used here the monthly vpd can be calculated using the air temperature and dew point temperature allen et al 1998 despite era5 land variables have widely used soil moisture and air temperature related variables in mountainous regions have some biases compared to observation values beck et al 2022 global monthly average co2 concentration 1980 present was obtained from the noaa s earth system research laboratory 2 1 3 ancillary data to study the global gpp mechanism for different land cover types we decided to use the modis land cover map from 2001 modis landcover data divides global land into 17 land cover classifications proposed by the international geosphere biosphere program friedl et al 2010 we aggregated evergreen needleleaf forest evergreen broadleaf forest deciduous needleleaf forest deciduous broadleaf forest and mixed forest into forests type closed shrublands and open shrublands into shrublands and woody savannas and savannas into savannas fig 1 shows the selected five land cover types 31 50 forests 31 71 shrublands 13 67 savannas 8 66 grasslands and 14 46 croplands respectively 2 1 4 data preprocessing the spatial resolutions of all datasets gpp and era5 land climatic variables were resampled to 0 5 degrees by the bicubic interpolation method monthly gpp products were aggregated into annual means while monthly era5 climatic variables were aggregated to values for the growing season how the growing seasons were determined is discussed in section 2 2 given the overlapping period of gimms nirv glass fluxcom and trendy the study period was 1982 2016 while vodca s study period was 1988 2016 all variables and gpp values were kept in their original values 2 2 attribution method we selected the months at the grid scale with mean surface air temperature 0 as the vegetation growth season based on the climatology for 1982 2016 from era5 feng et al 2021 this method is effective in reducing the effect of snow cover errors and large solar zenith angles on the length of the growing season the length of the growing season was consistent with an alternative method proposed by zhu et al 2016 for most of global land with the exception of some tropical regions they identified the growing season with daily gimms lai3g vegetation data in the tropics the duration of the growing season is overestimated one to two months resulting in a very limited average soil moisture and air temperature in the final growing season compared to the multi year average our growing season is one year in the tropics figure s1 the final attributed results are not also sensitive to the overestimation from the growing season definition with air temperature 0 figure s2 monthly values of climatic variables i e soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd are averaged to get corresponding growing season mean values with partial least square regression pls we can quantify the contribution of co2 vpd air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture to gpp changes during the growing season in each product like the multiple linear regression mls the basic idea of pls is building the regression linear relationship between independent and dependent variables the biggest difference between pls and mls is that pls projects latent independent and dependent variables into the new space with orthogonal decomposition method and builds the new linear regression according to the covariance maximization rule sijmen de jong 1993 given these pls has the better performances for multivariate analysis compared to the other regression methods especially for the existing autocorrelation between independent variables guan et al 2017 we use the plsregress function of matlab to conduct the analysis the figure s3 showed that the variance inflation factor vif between air temperature and vpd was less than 4 0 for most of global land and only the vif of sahara desert sparse vegetation in the north of africa was more than 6 0 fu et al 2020 and lu et al 2021 concluded that vif less than 6 indicated a weak degree of collinearity in the partial regression method the regression model was expressed as 1 gpp β c o 2 c o 2 β vpd v p d β tem t e m β rad r a d β sm s m b ε where β c o 2 β vpd β tem β rad β sm indicated regression slopes of co2 vpd air temperature tem solar radiation rad and soil moisture sm respectively b was the intercept ε was random error gppco2 gppvpd gpptem gpprad gppsm represented the contribution of co2 β c o 2 c o 2 vpd β vpd v p d tem β tem t e m rad β rad r a d and sm β sm s m respectively to facilitate comparison of the contributions of the driving factors we subtracted the contribution of each factor in the first year from its respective annual growing season contribution refer to as the change in the annual growing season contribution of gpp relative to the first year i e δ gpp i i m e a n s d r i v i n g f a c t o r hereafter gpp annual growing season changes indicated the change in gpp annual growing season relative to the first year gpp annual growing season changes relative to the first year was approximately equal to the sum of annual growing season contribution changes of all driving factors subscripts x y represented grid cell indexes and year respectively in addition we estimated correlation coefficients between gpp changes and the time varying contribution of each factor using the pearson correlation method the correlations can indicate the direction of the factor s contribution to gpp a positive correlation value means that the factor contributes to the increase in gpp while a negative correlation value means that the factor decreased gpp 2 3 trends in gpp and contributions from climatic variables the linear trend of long term gpp and the contribution of annual growing season trends in climatic variables for each product was calculated using the theil sen slope method compared to the linear regression this method is not sensitive to outliers and skewness of data and is the most robust non parametric technique to calculate linear trends wilcox 2010 we used the non parametric mann kendall test to determine the significance level of the linear trends mann 1945 kendall 1975 both methods have been widely used in hydrology and meteorology studies su et al 2015 wang et al 2018 shi et al 2016 to quantify the proportion of each driving factor s time varying contribution trends rci was defined 3 rc i trend δ g p p i trend δ g p p i 100 where i meant driving factor trend δ g p p i indicated the time varying contribution trend of driving factor i and trend δ g p p i was the sum of absolute values of contribution change trend of all driving factors 3 results 3 1 trends in long term gpp fig 2 describes spatial distribution of the trends in gpp estimated from the six products in the term of gpp trend magnitude fluxcom showed a moderate change with the rate of 4 0 4 0 g c m2 year compared to the other products in the term of gpp sign increasing or decreasing trend all products except vodca could detect consistently increasing trends in most of europe eastern north america eastern and northern asia and indian subcontinent while vodca showed abnormal decreasing trends in most of these regions for example except for vodca all products showed a significant increase in gpp with the rate of 0 8 0 g c m2 year in most northern hemisphere high latitude regions in contrast vodca showed an abnormal gpp decreasing trend with even less than 12 0 g c m2 year for some of these regions consistently decreasing trends for all products were found in western north america and part of europe and central asia except gimms with slightly increasing trends the divergence results in gpp trends among these products were found in africa australia and south america for example gimms glass fluxcom and vodca showed a clear decreasing trend in south america especially in the amazon basin while nirv and trendy showed an increasing trend in particular gimms and glass showed decreasing gpp rates 12 0 g c m2 year while nirv and trendy showed increasing rates of more than 8 0 g c m2 year 3 2 trend attribution of annual growing season gpp 3 2 1 trend attribution of annual growing season gpp fig 3 showed the spatial distribution of each climatic variable s contribution to long term trends of global gpp annual growing season due to the slight variation in gpp for fluxcom we reduced the color bar values in fig 3 by a factor of 10 to more visually show the pattern of contribution of each driver co2 concentration vpd and air temperature dominate gpp trends for all gpp products except fluxcom solar radiation and soil moisture directly influenced gpp trends with relatively smaller contributions the co2 and air temperature have shown a positive contribution to annual growing season gpp trends and vpd has shown negative contributions spatially more contributions from co2 vpd and air temperature to annual growing season gpp trends were found in most of the amazon basin central africa and europe the effect of solar radiation and soil moisture on the variation of gpp of fluxcom compared to other products should not be neglected either the global land averaged co2 vpd air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture contributions to gpp annual growing season trends for all products were shown in fig 4 a 1 5 different contributions were found among gpp products for nirv the contribution of co2 was more than 80 00 while vpd s contribution was only about 10 00 and the contributions from air temperature solar radiation and soil moisture were minimal compared to nirv trendy had similar results for fluxcom the contribution of vpd was about 47 93 while co2 had only little contribution gimms glass and vodca indicated that the contributions of co2 and vpd were similar in all gpp products excluding nirv the contributions of air temperature contribution to gpp were more than 12 00 in the forest the positive contribution of co2 to gimms glass and vodca tended to decrease and even changed to negative contributions with gimms and vodca the divergent results in the forest mainly resulted from co2 contributions in the broadleaf forests evergreen and deciduous figure s4 in broadleaf forests the co2 contributions of gimms glass and fluxcom were negative while the other three products contributions of co2 contribution were positive the patterns of remaining driving factors were consistent for other land cover types for shrublands savannas grasslands and croplands the general contribution of driving factors to all products were similar however there are some exceptions for example air temperature contributions were reduced in savannas for all products excluding fluxcom the negative contributions of soil moisture in grasslands were amplified for all products the positive contribution of co2 was the largest for all products excluding fluxcom besides the contributions of vpd and air temperature cannot be neglected in global land and different landcover types and even vpd absolute contributions for gimms and glass were more than co2 in forests 3 2 2 spatial distribution of dominant factors on long term trends of global gpp annual growing season further the spatial distribution of driving factors dominating long term trends of global gpp annual growing season was shown in fig 5 the factor with the largest contribution is identified as the dominant factor except for fluxcom the results in fig 5 indicated that co2 effect dominated gpp changes of most global land for all products the percentages of co2 were at least more than 53 as shown in table 2 especially 75 for nirv and trendy for fluxcome the impact of co2 effect on gpp was very limited and the percentage of co2 was 16 11 while the sum of the percentage of air temperature and vpd was more than 60 vpd as a dominant factor controlled some of tropical regions e g amazon basin and arid regions including eastern europe and north america middle part of asia in a range of 11 80 39 62 with all products for air temperature the dominant regions were mostly located in mid high latitudes in the northern hemisphere except vodca air temperature mostly controlled some regions of africa and south america for vodca the effects of soil moisture and solar radiation were limited and the sum of percentages of the both factors was less than 10 except fluxcom 3 3 time varying attribution of annual growing season gpp changes fig 6 showed the time varying contribution of driving factors to global average gpp annual growing season changes relative to the first year in terms of the global land scale annual growing season gpp for all products excluding fluxcom increased with different magnitudes black lines in fig 6 similar to the trend results in fig 2d annual growing season gpp for fluxcom did not vary significantly with a slightly decreasing trend based on the attribution results in each driving factor we found except fluxcom the contributions of co2 and air temperature for all products were increasing while the contributions from vpd were decreasing the effects of soil moisture and solar radiation did not change significantly for nirv and trendy the absolute values of contributions from co2 were more than the air temperature and vpd which indicated that the co2 effect dominates global gpp changes for gimms glass and vodca increasing gpp were attributed to the co2 and air temperature combined effects due to the negative contribution from vpd for fluxcom the contribution of vpd far exceeded the sum of the remaining factors contribution resulting in slightly decreasing changes in the global annual growing season gpp the contribution results showing at the global average scale were not always consistent with that over different landcover types figure s5 for forests the contributions of co2 to gimms glass and vodca were small and even the contribution of co2 to gimms and vodca was decreasing from the correlation coefficients between global gpp products and corresponding contributing factors shown in table 3 we found that co2 air temperature and solar radiation were generally positively correlated with the global gpp annual growing season changes fig 6 in contrast vpd showed a negative correlation with those contributing factors and most of these coefficients were significantly correlated alpha 5 however some exceptions might be due to the differences in algorithms and input data among gpp products for example the correlation coefficients of soil moisture for nirv and trendy were negative although nirv did not pass the significance test the directions of correlation coefficients of solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 with fluxcom were reversed similar results could be found in different landcover types table s2 we should note that compared to the other products coefficients of vpd for gimms fluxcom and vodca were positive in forests the positive correlation coefficients were due to the negative contribution in vpd dominating gpp annual growing season changes in forests in this study the contribution of soil moisture to global gpp changes was found to be very limited compared to co2 vpd and air temperature to quantify the indirect effect of soil moisture on gpp we calculated temporal contributions of co2 vpd and air temperature to gpp trends during increasing soil moisture a c e in fig 7 and during decreasing soil moisture b d f in fig 7 conditions the global trend map of soil moisture was presented in figure s6a it was found that global soil moisture changes did not affect the temporal contribution from co2 and air temperature to gpp while the negative contribution from vpd was found to be amplified as revealed by the gradual expansion of forest savannas grasslands and croplands worldwide for shrublands however the amplified contribution of vpd was found to be relatively small fig 7 there are evident differences in vpd contribution among gpp products the contribution of vpd to nirv did not capture the effect of soil moisture changes for all landcover types however vpd had the highest contribution to glass over global land average forests and savannas to further explain the relationship between the contribution of vpd to gpp trends and soil moisture we compared the median contribution of vpd to the trend of six gpp products with the coupling strength of soil moisture vpd fig 8 the sum of the area covered by the coupling strength less than 0 4 exceeded 80 as shown in figure s6 there was a strong relationship between global soil moisture and vpd during the growing season of 1982 2016 it was found in fig 8 that the soil moisture vpd coupling directly controlled the magnitude of the contribution of vpd to gpp trends this indicated that the greater the strength of the coupling the greater the contribution of vpd 4 discussions 4 1 comparison of results 4 1 1 gpp trend comparisons the spatial distribution of long term gpp trends for all products was shown in fig 2 compared to other products the trends in the magnitude of gpp with fluxcom was very small which was ranging from 4 0 to 4 0 g c m2 year similar results of gpp trends with fluxcom could be found in wang et al 2021 and zheng et al 2020 all products except vodca showed a significant increase in gpp in the northern hemisphere at mid to high latitudes i e tundra and boreal ecosystems however with vodca middle high latitude regions showed a significant decrease in gpp the difference in results between vodca and other gpp products might be due to the fact that microwave vod data contained confounding explanatory information on biomass and plant water content momen et al 2017 increasing gpp trends could also be found in most of europe eastern north america eastern asia and the indian subcontinent with all products excluding fluxcom previous studies suggested that the increasing gpp results were consistent with the greening trends observed by long term satellite records zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019 there were divergences in gpp trends among those products over africa australia and south america for fluxcom and trendy australia showed a decline in overall gpp while other gpp products showed increase in australia the largest differences among gpp products were over south america especially for the amazon basin for example gimms and glass showed a clear decreasing trend of gpp over the amazon basin while a clear increasing trend could also be found for nirv and trendy fig 6 and figure s5 the divergence of gpp with different products was thought to be due to the underestimation of the sensitivity of gpp to vpd in the amazon basin yuan et al 2019 madani et al 2020 with multi source global gpp products relatively consistent gpp trends could be found in most regions of the global land however there were significant differences in gpp trends due to differences in estimation algorithms and model parameters between gpp products for example between nirv trendy and other products in the amazon basin and between vodca and other products in the mid high northern latitudes 4 1 2 trend attribution comparison of gpp based on the partial regression method we quantified the contribution of soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 to gpp trends in pixel scale fig 3 the positive contributions of co2 and air temperature and the negative contribution of vpd were found to control the global gpp trends while solar radiation and soil moisture impacts were found to be very limited similar results were found for all landcover types except co2 s contribution in forests with gimms and glass fig 4 further we identified the spatial distribution of land with dominating gpp trends fig 5 in which co2 effect was found to dominate gpp trends over most of the global land for all products excluding fluxcom while vpd effect was found to dominate gpp trends with fluxcom as discussed in the previous section fluxcom failed to capture the effect of co2 fertilization on gpp leading to the limited impact of co2 on gpp a negative contribution of vpd to gpp trends appeared to explain the decrease in fluxcom over most global land despite the co2 fertilization the impact of air temperature and vpd on gpp trends could not be ignored for all products table 2 air temperature and vpd were found to control some parts of the arid region for nirv and trendy while air temperature alone was found to control parts of boreal high latitude regions with gimms glass and fluxcom respectively vpd on the other hand dominated parts of the middle latitude region of the northern hemisphere and the tropical region with gimms and glass fig 5 the distribution of regions controlled by vpd was found to be similar with vodca gimms and glass while the effect of air temperature was found to be mostly located around parts of south america and africa for vodca fig 5 the influence of co2 fertilization on gpp which explained a large fraction of vegetation trends in the globe has been studied by zhu et al 2016 and wang et al 2020 from a leaf level perspective rising co2 accelerated carboxylation rate and enhanced photosynthesis farquhar and sharkey 1982 chen et al 2022 our study confirmed the importance of co2 fertilization effect on vegetation growth meanwhile climatic variables were also the major drivers of vegetation growth piao et al 2020 jung et al 2017 the sum of the percentages of climatic variables mainly air temperature and vpd had become a dominant factor and was more than 40 for gimms glass fluxcom and vodca respectively table 2 the results of the positive contribution of air temperature and negative contribution of vpd to gpp found in this study fig 3 were consistent with several other studies including jung et al 2017 yuan et al 2019 and dang et al 2022 as one of the essential factors of controlling vegetation growth increasing air temperature tended to increase photosynthesis through enhancing metabolism braswell et al 1997 and lengthening the growing season piao et al 2007 richardson et al 2010 especially in boreal and arctic regions co2 and air temperature were the major driving forces of the vegetation greening mainly over northern middle high latitudes the divergence of gpp trends over tropical zone among gpp products was due to vpd with negative contribution dominating gpp trends for gimms glass fluxcom and vodca while the positive contribution of co2 controlling gpp trends for nirv and trendy fig 2 fig 5 decreasing gpp trend as revealed by vpd effect over the tropical zone was consistent with that of the study by zheng et al 2020 based on cloud free observations data from microwave satellites liu et al 2015 and fan et al 2019 found that carbon loss in tropical forests suggested that nirv and trendy overestimated the sensitivity of co2 and underestimated the sensitivity of vpd moreover the lack of nutrient limitation and overestimation of lai might lead to an overestimation of the contribution of co2 madani et al 2020 murray tortarolo et al 2013 4 1 3 time varying attribution comparison of gpp changes if we only focused on the attribution of long term gpp trends our estimation could be biased as this could ignore the mechanism behind gpp trend due to the changes in time hence we quantified the time varying contribution of soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 to gpp changes at both global land scale and different landcover types fig 6 and figure s5 from the global land average scale the impacts of co2 on gpp for all products excluding fluxcom were increasing from 1982 to 2016 particularly for nirv and trendy products the impacts of co2 far exceeded the sum of the other driving factors resulting in the significant increase in gpp meanwhile it is noted that the negative contributions of vpd were increasing for all products negative contributions of vpd resulted in slower growth of gpp after the 2000 s and even the stagnation of growth with gimms glass and vodca fig 6 feng et al 2021 and yuan et al 2019 have verified the slower vegetation growth at the average global land scale for example yuan et al 2019 suggested that the negative contribution of vpd was more than the co2 fertilization effect leading to limited vegetation growth after the 1998 s similar results could be found in our study figure s5 in different landcover types excluding forests as shown in fig 4b1 the co2 fertilization effects on forests from gimms glass and vodca were limited and even seen as negative to identify which forest type dominates the results we divided the contributions of forests into two types evergreen broadleaf forest the other forests figure s7 the results showed that the divergences of co2 contribution for gimms glass vodca and nirv trendy were greater for forests due to the differences of the evergreen broadleaf forest the uncertainties of co2 fertilization effect on forests among those gpp products were also found by chen et al 2022 the mechanism of vpd affecting gpp was that increasing vpd decreased canopy conductance and further limited vegetation photosynthesis fu et al 2022 however liu et al 2020 indicated that the impact of vpd on vegetation growth was limited while soil moisture controlled vegetation growth in our study the impact of soil moisture on gpp was limited compared to vpd to study the effect of soil moisture on the contribution of remaining factors to gpp trends we divided the time varying contribution of co2 vpd and air temperature for different landcover into two types of soil moisture trends increasing soil moisture or decreasing soil moisture fig 7 it was found that soil moisture changes did not affect the results of co2 and air temperature contributions while vpd contribution was amplified for decreasing soil moisture compared to the increasing soil moisture trend furthermore we found that soil moisture vpd coupling controlled the contribution of vpd to gpp trends fig 8 when the strength of the soil moisture vpd coupling was maximum the contribution of vpd was also maximum the results implied that vegetation growth stagnation after the 2000 s might be related to changes in the soil moisture vpd coupling process decreasing soil moisture reduced actual evapotranspiration latent heat increased air temperature decreased humidity in the air and eventually increased vpd figure s6 increasing vpd tended to increase actual evapotranspiration which further reduced soil moisture caused vegetation stomatal closure to avoid water loss li et al 2022 zhou et al 2019a and finally reduced vegetation growth rigden et al 2020 this indicated that decreasing soil moisture induced soil moisture atmosphere feedback by vpd which indirectly dominated vegetation growth humphrey et al 2021 our results emphasized that soil moisture induced lac controlled vegetation growth in the context of climatic change at global land scale in addition the air temperature greater than 0 was selected as the criteria in this study to define the growing season in fact the optimal air temperature for vegetation growth was more than 10 for most biomes huang et al 2019 if this threshold was approached the photosynthesis of vegetation started to be restricted by the soil moisture deficit the air temperature greater than 0 criteria of defining growing season might reduce the contribution of soil moisture to gpp 4 2 validation of the attribution method 4 2 1 validation of attribution results this study selected six sets of state of the art multi source gpp products which have been widely used to understand the vegetation atmosphere interactions those products have been validated by various studies in the past with the observations from global fluxnet sites and inter comparisons with the other gpp products including gimms madani et al 2017 madani et al 2020 nirv wang et al 2021 glass zheng et al 2020 trendy le quéré et al 2018 vodca wild et al 2022 and fluxcom jung et al 2020 we validated the accuracy of the attribution method that we have used in this study the results were shown in fig 9 comparing the annual growing season gpp changes for each product with the accumulative contribution of five driving variables to annual growing season gpp changes the fitted lines for all products showed a strong 1 1 relationship red line in fig 9 with relatively high r2 coefficients 0 43 0 78 and low values of root mean square error rmse 15 82 149 5 g c m2 year fig 9 the comparison results indicated that our attribution method had relatively accurately captured the long term trends of annual growing season gpp 4 2 2 validation of the partial regression model linear models have become one of the common methods to quantify the contribution of climatic variables to interannual trends or changes in ecosystem production for example jung et al 2017 and humphrey et al 2021 used linear models to estimate the effects of soil moisture air temperature vpd and solar radiation on inter annual variability of global land carbon uptake wang et al 2021 used the linear regression method to estimate the sensitivity of global annual gpp changes to co2 similar studies with linear models could also be found in song et al 2020 zhang et al 2019 and smith et al 2016 in fact non linear relationships existed between gpp and climatic variables although linear models have been widely used in related gpp studies therefore to validate the accuracy of partial regression method used in this study we used two non linear methods to calculate the temporal contribution of co2 and vpd to annual growing season gpp changes the co2 and vpd as taken as examples since these two variables controlled most of the global terrestrial gpp trends the two approaches were the revised lue model and the linear model that considered additional interactions between co2 and vpd and air temperature a detailed description could be found in the supplementary section here we only chose glass gpp as the dependent variable since glass was calculated using the revised ec lue model figure s8 showed the partial correlation of temporal contribution of co2 and vpd between partial regression and the other two non linear methods the results by partial regression had highest spatial consistency partial correlation greater than 0 8 with linear model of considering additional interaction between co2 and vpd air temperature the results of the partial regression also had good performances partial correlation greater than 0 8 for most land with the revised ec lue model except for co2 in the amazon region overall the results of the partial regressions captured the responses of gpp trends to climatic variables on a long term scale 5 conclusions in this study we quantified the response of gpp trends to soil moisture solar radiation air temperature vpd and co2 for different land cover types using the partial regression method we also estimated the time varying attribution of annual growing season gpp changes to those driving factors to study the time varying mechanism of gpp our conclusions were summarized as follows gpp trends were increasing for most lands globally while gpp was decreasing significantly in some areas of western north america eastern europe and central asia especially in the amazon basin it was found that co2 effects dominated the gpp annual growing season trends while the impacts of vpd and air temperature on gpp could not be ignored negative contribution of vpd controlled gpp trends over some arid and tropical regions while air temperature dominated gpp trends over some parts of northern mid and high latitude regions the long term gpp trend study has some limitations as it may ignore the time varying properties of gpp changes it was found that the fertilization effect of co2 contributed to the sustained increase in gpp while the effect of co2 did not result in a sustained increase in gpp after the 2000 s this was mainly due to the negative contribution of vpd to global land gpp trends declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

corresponding authors three phase displacement events often occur in unsaturated porous media especially when immiscible contaminants e g non aqueous phase liquid napl inadvertently enter the subsurface in this study the influence of initial water saturation on the three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution during napl invasion into unsaturated porous media was experimentally investigated the low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technique was used to dynamically monitor the spatial distribution of water in unsaturated porous media during the invasion of napl the residual distributions e g volume fraction of napl water gas were quantitatively analyzed the results showed that both the initial water saturation and the napl injection rate had a significant influence on the three phase displacement we found that the displacement efficiency of water gas exhibited a non monotonic relationship with the initial water saturation in the unsaturated porous media at certain napl invasion rates a method was proposed to characterize the three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical two phase lenormand s diagram a significant increase in the volume fraction of residual napl after napl invasion was observed during the transition from the strong drainage region to the transitional displacement region however the initial water saturation was insensitive to the volume fraction of residual napl once the characterized three phase displacement regime transitioned to the stable displacement region this study not only highlighted the influence mechanism of initial water saturation and napl injection rate on the three phase displacement efficiency but also endowed the classical two phase lenormand s diagram with the three phase displacement regime keywords initial water saturation unsaturated porous media displacement efficiency residual distribution three phase flow low field nmr data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction groundwater contamination by non aqueous phase liquids napl is becoming increasingly common kalogerakis et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 since napl are typically immiscible in both water and gas the dynamic problem of multi phase flow associated with contamination by napl has attracted considerable interest in recent years in particular when the released napl invade into the unsaturated zone of the subsurface the coexistence of water gas and napl forms a complex three phase displacement system dou et al 2022a unfortunately these napl can seriously contaminate the groundwater even at concentrations as low as one part billion range due to the high toxicity and low solubility of napl in water farthing et al 2012 kokkinaki et al 2013a therefore insights into the characteristics e g displacement efficiency and residual distribution of this three phase displacement system are of great practical importance for risk assessment conceptual model definition active remediation and the fate of napl in the subsurface keller and chen 2003 in a three phase porous media system due to the inherent heterogeneity of pore structure and the different initial water saturation in the vadose zone both displacement efficiency and residual distribution are strongly dependent on the displacement regime hu et al 2018 lenormand et al 1988 trojer et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the capillary number ca mobility ratio m wettability saturation and pore size distribution of porous media have a significant influence on the displacement regime dehghanpour dicarlo 2013 alizadeh piri 2014 kianinejad et al 2015 iglauer et al 2013 blunt 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the pore scale characterization of the displacement regime is crucial this is because on one hand the complex pore structures in which flow through microporosity plays an important role and on the other hand the information from pore scale could provide direct insights into details of napl mobilization and displacement to study the complicated pore scale displacement regime empirical correlations alizadeh and piri 2014 blunt 2017 feali et al 2012 kokkinaki et al 2013b and physically based pore scale models gao et al 2020 lan et al 2022 are developed because of the complex pore structures and the interface tracking numerical issues direct dynamic simulations are computationally expensive and have not yet been fully achieved a popular approach is to simplify the pore space geometry eliminate the viscous and gravity forces and characterize three phase systems using pore network models although many advances have been made to improve our understanding of the displacement regime and to describe and fully explain the physics of displacement processes the three phase system has not received much attention over the years as the two phase system few experimental investigations have been performed in a three phase system akbarabadi and piri 2013 alizadeh and piri 2014 carroll et al 2015 feali et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 however traditional laboratory measurements are almost prohibitively complicated expensive and time consuming a pore scale experimental attempt to characterize three phase systems involves complicated pore scale displacement physics as well as fluid fluid and solid fluid interactions and characteristics are rather limited alternatively some promising pore scale experimental studies are currently being conducted for three phase systems with non destructive non invasive laboratory techniques such as microfluidic visualization hu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 microfocused x ray computed tomography micro ct hilpert et al 2000 magnetic resonance imaging chu et al 2004 light reflection

2017 alazaiza et al 2018 alazaiza et al 2019 carroll et al 2015 performed synchrotron x ray microtomography studies of residual three phase fluid configurations after performing a gas invasion they observed that gas contacted completely or partly a significant number of the oil ganglia initially trapped by water in the previous two phase water flood li et al 2017 combined the ct scanning and image processing techniques to investigate the six natural water wet sandstone cores of different permeability and porosity visually and quantitatively although advancements in microtomographic image acquisition and processing methods based on micro ct over the past two decades have provided the means to accurately characterize multiphase flow behavior in three dimensional porous media systems micro ct technique is generally unavailable that accurate identification of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific phase of a fluid requires sufficient x ray contrast between the different phases however as a non destructive technique low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology is capable of providing a promising and high accuracy testing for investigating three phase displacement behaviors at the pore scale in addition lf nmr technology has also the unique capability of calculating the pore size distribution dou et al 2022b hertzog et al 2007 liu et al 2021 the minimal sample preparation requirements and rapid testing are remarkable advantages of the nmr technique in this study we investigated the influence of initial water saturation on three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution during napl invasion into unsaturated porous media lf nmr technology was used to monitor the pore scale distribution of water during the napl invasion the napl water gas displacement efficiencies under different initial water saturations and napl injection rates were determined based on both lf nmr measurements and mass balance method the displacement efficiency of napl water gas were quantitatively analyzed we theoretically and methodologically discussed the three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical phase diagram 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials in this study the quartz sand was used as a porous medium for the displacement experiments the main component of quartz sand is silicon dioxide which has no signal characteristics in lf nmr measurements the particle size of the quartz sand for the displacement experiments is 0 280 0 355 mm and the average particle size is 0 3175 mm a hollow cylinder made of polytetrafluoroethylene teflon was designed as a sample container for filling the quartz sand as shown in fig 1 teflon materials do not produce lf nmr signal the outer dimensions of the cylindrical container are 100 mm long and have a diameter of 45 mm the inner chamber of the cylindrical container has a length of 60 mm and a diameter of 25 mm the prepared quartz sand was filled into the inner chamber of the cylindrical container the mass of the filled quartz sand is 46 00 g the corresponding dry density and porosity are 1 53 g cm3 and 0 39 respectively the pore volume pv of the filled quartz sand is 11 50 0 40 ml it should be noted that all the filled quartz sand was compacted and both the corresponding dry density and porosity were the same this ensures that the filled quartz sand has a nearly consistent pore structure the tetrachloroethene pce was selected as non wetting phase as a typical dense napl pce has no signal characteristics in lf nmr measurements therefore the influence of pce on the lf nmr measurements can be neglected ultrapure water is used as the wetting phase 2 2 experimental devices and setups the lf nmr analysis system macromr12 150h i manufactured by suzhou niumag co ltd china with a magnetic field induction intensity of 0 3 t and a constant temperature of the magnet of 32 0 was used for the lf nmr measurements as shown in fig 2 a this system provided a promising and highly accurate measurement of the transverse relaxation time t2 the three phase displacement system see fig 2 b was designed to conduct the displacement experiment the invading pce was filled into the syringe and injected into the quartz sand with the different initial water saturations using the injection pump wh sp 01 the displacement experiment was carried out in the fume hood at a room temperature of 25 to obtain the quartz sand with the different initial water saturations the water saturated quartz sand was prepared first and then the oven hn101 2 was used to dry the water saturated quartz sand at a temperature of 110 the electronic balance wt5003gh with an accuracy of 10 4 g was used to measure the mass of quartz sand samples in this study a total of 12 quartz sand samples were prepared to investigate the influence of initial water saturation on three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution for this purpose four different initial water saturations were set to 41 68 86 and 100 respectively and three injection rates of pce were set to 0 1 ml min 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively according to the three injection rates 12 samples were divided into three groups e g g1 g2 and g3 in each group there are four samples with the four different initial water saturations to prepare the samples in each group the quartz sand with a mass of 46 00 g is compacted layer by layer in a teflon container in ultrapure water environment thus four samples saturated with water were prepared in each group since the dry density and porosity of the quartz sand in the teflon container were the same the prepared water saturated samples have a consistent pore size distribution see the supporting information then for each group one of the prepared water saturated samples was selected as the saturated sample the other three samples were dried in the oven at 110 until the initial water saturation of the samples was 41 68 and 86 respectively physical properties and initial water saturation of all prepared samples were showed in table 1 after a total of 12 quartz sand samples were prepared in three groups with the same four initial water saturations the pce was injected into each sample by the displacement experiment for the sample groups g1 g2 and g3 the injection rates of the pce were 0 1 ml min 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively the corresponding amounts of pce injection were 1 pv 3 pv and 5 pv respectively the lf nmr measurements were performed for each sample before and after the displacement experiment in addition the mass of each sample was also measured before and after the displacement experiment 2 3 lf nmr measurement and principle lf nmr measurement is a testing technique that interacts with the hydrogen nucleus inside the sample with the support of an external magnetic field to obtain the feedback information from the hydrogen nucleus condition of the sample in this study the lf nmr measurement employed the lf nmr transverse relaxation spectrum technology to measure the t2 of the quartz sand samples it should be noted that the lf nmr measurement is unavailable for the pce teflon container and the gas due to the absent of the hydrogen nucleus the measured t2 was only capable of monitoring the water content and spatial distribution of the quartz sand samples the standard carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used in the lf nmr measurement to measure t2 specifically t2 is the time required for the hydrogen nucleus to return from the unbalanced state to the equilibrium state this standard cpmg pulse sequence provided 200 data points in one echo acquisition time and the number of echoes obtained by each cpmg sequence is 15000 other parameters are set as follows an echo time te of 0 23 ms a waiting time tw of 5000 ms and the scanning numbers ns of 16 in the relaxation process there are three mechanisms e g bulk relaxation surface relaxation and diffusion relaxation the corresponding relaxation time is expressed as t 2 b t 2 s a n d t 2 d respectively and described as follows 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 d 2 t 2 b 3 t k 298 μ 1 t 2 s ρ 2 s v pore 1 t 2 d d γ g t e 2 12 where t k is the temperature k μ is the viscosity of fluid ρ 2 is the surface relaxation rate s v is the surface area to volume ratio d is the molecular diffusion coefficient of fluid γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton g is the field strength gradient g c m and t e is the echo time used in the cpmg sequence the t 2 b is inversely proportional to the viscosity of fluid in this study ultrapure water is used as the wetting fluid and the corresponding viscosity is very low so the value of 1 t 2 b is sufficient to be neglected xu et al 2020 t 2 s is the transverse relaxation time caused by the surface relaxation of the liquid and is inversely proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of the fluid and the te t 2 d is related to the diffusion coefficient of water since the te is small and the diffusion of water molecules is very fast at this time it is so small that it can be neglected tian et al 2014 therefore t2 is mainly determined by t 2 s in this study we consider the pore structure of the quartz sand to be spherical in this case the surface area to volume ratio s v is 3 r eq 2 can be further simplified as hun et al 2021 dou et al 2022a dou et al 2022b chen et al 2021 3 1 t 2 ρ 2 s v pore ρ 2 3 r where ρ 2 is the surface relaxation rate and r is the pore radius eq 3 defines the relationship between t2 measured by lf nmr and the volume and surface area of the pores according to eq 3 the signal intensity of t2 is proportional to the pore radius the larger the pore radius the larger the t2 and the stronger the characterization of the nmr signal liu et al 2021 rao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 lai et al 2018 therefore the pore size distribution could be determined based on the t2 distribution curves in this study the t2 distribution curves of the water saturated samples were first determined the pore volume and pore size of the water saturated samples can be calculated based on the peak area and t2 value in the t2 distribution curve of the water saturated samples meanwhile the volume and distribution of pore water for the unsaturated samples were also determined after the displacement experiment the volume and residual distribution of pore water can be monitored and recorded by the lf nmr measurement the displacement efficiency of water can be determined by both the mass balance method and the t2 subtraction method while the displacement efficiency of pce and gas can be determined by the mass balance method it should be mentioned that the pore structure of all samples was approximately the same and remained unchanged during the experiments this ensured that the t2 subtraction method was available to characterize the volume and redistribution of pore water after pce invasion the details of the calculation based on the mass balance method and the t2 subtraction method can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 analysis of t2 distribution curves in this study a total of 12 displacement experiments were carried out under different initial water saturation and pce injection rates the sample with an initial water saturation of 68 at a pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min fig 3 is analyzed here in section 3 1 and similar phenomenon can also be found in the other 11 samples the detailed representation of all t2 spectrums of 12 samples can be found in the supporting information it can be found in fig 3 that the t2 signals of both saturated and unsaturated samples have the shape of double peak the water in the small pore has a t2 time of 20 to 100 ms and the water in the large pore has a t2 time of 100 to 1000 ms for saturated sample the signal peak of the water in the small pore is about 300p u and the signal peak of the water in the large pore is about 4000p u since the t2 time is proportional to the pore size the observed similarity of the t2 distribution curves indicates that the pore structure of the saturated samples is similar in fig 3 it can be seen that when the injection amount of pce reaches 1 pv a considerable amount of water is displaced from the sample and therefore the measured t2 signal is significantly lower than the t2 signal of the saturated sample however when the injection amount of pce further increases to 3 pv and 5 pv the t2 signal changes slightly compared to that after injection of 1 pv that is when the injection amount of pce reaches 1 pv during the experiments a fixed channel for water migration by pce displacement has formed in the sample when pce is injected continuously it continues to migrate along the previously formed channel and basically no new channel is formed as a result water is not further displaced after injection of 1 pv and the t2 distribution curves do not change significantly as shown in fig 3 the t2 spectrum of the sample in the unsaturated state is significantly lower than the t2 spectrum in the saturated state it can be inferred from the distribution of t2 spectrum that during the drying process the water in the macropores obviously disappears while the water in the micropores does not change significantly similar phenomenon can also be found after pce is injected into the sample after the invasion of pce larger amount of the pore water is displaced out from the macropore while relatively small amount of pore water is displaced out from the micropore this phenomenon can be attributed to the difference of capillary force in the macropore and micropore due to the smaller capillary force in macropores it is easier for the pce to displace the water in the macropore than in the micropore so the water displacement mainly takes place in the large pores as mentioned earlier the displacement process has stabilized within the sample after the pce injection reaches 1 pv and the continuous injection of pce does not lead to further discharge of water therefore the samples are grouped according to the initial water saturation the t2 results after pce injection of 5 pv are respectively selected to draw a diagram to investigate the influence mechanism of injection rate on water discharge under the conditions of different initial water saturation see fig 4 in fig 4 it can be seen that the amount of discharged water increases and the t2 spectrum decreases significantly when the injection rate increases according to fig 4 for the samples with an initial water saturation of 100 the amount of water displaced from the sample is much higher at injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min than at 0 1 ml min indicating that the influence of the pce injection rate on displacement is absolutely dominant however for the sample with an initial water saturation of 41 at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min the pce continues to displace the water in the pore after it has entered the sample creating new migration channels in the sample at injection rates of 0 1 ml min and 1 0 ml min there is little displacement of water in the pore after the pce is injected into the sample this means that the pce after entering the sample migrates directly along the pre existing interconnected empty pore channels while the water is hardly displaced by new migration channels figs 3 and 4 clearly show that both the initial water saturation and the pce injection rate have a significant influence on the three phase displacement e g pce and water migration meanwhile the dominant mechanisms during the displacement processes are strongly dependent on the pce injection rate and the initial water saturation 3 2 three phase displacement efficiency under different injection rate and initial water saturation water displacement efficiency ew and gas displacement efficiency eg are introduced in this study to further quantitatively analyze the three phase displacement process e g water and pce 4 e w w i w s 5 e g g i g s where wi is the mass of displaced water ws is the mass of water stored in the sample before pce injection gi is the pore volume occupied by the displaced gas and gs is the pore volume occupied by the initial gas in the sample before pce injection table 2 shows the mass of water in the samples after pce injection of 5 pv and the water stored in the samples before pce injection under the conditions of different injection rates and initial water saturation combining eq 6 and table 2 the mass of displaced water and the displacement efficiency of water under different conditions are obtained as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that for the same initial water saturation both the displacement mass fig 5 a and the displacement efficiency fig 5 b of the water improve significantly with increasing injection rate in fig 5 b it can be seen that the displacement efficiency of water reaches the maximum at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min and an initial water saturation of 86 at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min and 1 0 ml min the displacement efficiency of water initially increases and then decreases as the initial water saturation decreases however at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min both the mass of water discharge and the displacement efficiency of the water showed a similar and non monotonic relationship with initial water saturation both the mass of water discharge and the displacement efficiency of water reach their maximum at an initial water saturation of 68 in unsaturated samples the injected pce displaces not only the water but also the gas due to the coexistence of water and gas therefore we also performed a correlation analysis of the displacement efficiency of the gas the displacement efficiency of the gas under the different conditions can be derived from eq 7 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the displacement efficiency of the gas under the different conditions in fig 6 it can be seen that at the initial water saturation of 100 there is no gas in the samples so the displacement efficiency of the gas is zero for unsaturated samples the highest displacement efficiency of the gas can be observed at a pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min at a pce injection rate of 0 1 ml min the displacement efficiency of the gas gradually increases as the initial water saturation of the sample decreases reaching a maximum at an initial water saturation of 41 however at pce injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min the displacement efficiency of the gas shows a similar and non monotonic relationship with initial water saturation at the pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min the gas displacement efficiency reaches the maximum when the initial water saturation of the sample is 86 while at the pce injection rate of 2 0 ml min the maximum gas displacement efficiency is observed at an initial water saturation of the sample is 68 the volume fraction of water gas and pce was introduced to investigate the influence of pce injection rate on the residual distribution fig 7 shows the volume fraction of water gas and pce in the samples before and after pce injection from fig 7 it can be seen that as the pce injection rate increases the volume fraction of water in the sample decreases and the volume fraction of pce increases significantly at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min the volume fraction of pce and gas increases as the initial water saturation decreases however at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min the volume fraction of pce is close to each other at different initial water saturations this means that the volume fraction of injected pce is insensitive to the initial water saturation moreover the volume fraction of gas increases with the decrease of initial water saturation in general the displacement efficiency and volume fraction of pce water gas phase varied with both initial water saturation and injection rates the underlying displacement mechanisms should be further explained therefore the following section discussed the three phase displacement regime at different injection rates and initial water saturation in terms of the classical phase diagram 3 3 three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical phase diagram from the above analysis it is clear that the three phase displacement mechanism in unsaturated porous media has different characteristics at different initial water saturation and pce injection rate in this study the classical phase diagram of fluid displacement in porous media proposed by lenormand et al 1988 was used to characterize the three phase displacement regimes this diagram suggests that the character of the flow is controlled by two dimensionless parameters the capillary number ca and the mobility ratio m the capillary number ca can be calculated using the following equation 6 c a μ i μ γ where μ i is the dynamic viscosities of the invading fluids μ is the characteristic velocity and γ is the interfacial tension in this study the fluid of the invading phase is pce and the corresponding μ i is equal to 0 9 μ is determined by the injection rate of pce and the value of γ is different for the samples with the initial water saturation for saturated samples since all the pore space is occupied by water γ between pce and water is equal to 44 4 mj m 2 however for unsaturated samples γ is not the interfacial tension between pce and water due to the coexistence of water and gas for unsaturated samples therefore the average interfacial tension was introduced instead of the interfacial tension between pce and water the average interfacial tension was determined by combining the interfacial tension between pce gas and pce water according to the volume fraction of water and gas before pce injection for the three phase displacement condition i e invasion of pce into unsaturated gas water samples γ is calculated as follows 7 γ σ p g g σ p w w where σ p g is the interfacial tension between pce and gas σ p w is the interfacial tension between pce and water g is the pore volume fraction of gas before injection of pce into the sample and w is the pore volume fraction of water before injection of pce into the sample here σ p g is equal to 31 3 mj m 2 and σ p w is equal to 44 4 mj m 2 the mobility ratio m can be calculated using the following equation 8 m μ i μ d where μ i and μ d are the dynamic viscosities of the invading and defending phases respectively in this study the fluid of the invading phase is pce and the corresponding μ i is equal to 0 9 the fluid of the defending phases are water and gas for saturated samples μ d 1 009 i e the viscosity of water for three phase displacement μ d is the average viscosity calculated from the pore volume ratio of water and gas in the sample 9 μ d 1 009 w 0 000181 g where w is the pore volume fraction of water in the sample before pce injection the viscosity of gas is 0 000181 and g is the pore volume fraction of gas in the sample before pce injection both ca and m for 12 samples under different experimental conditions are listed in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the values of ca and m vary with both the injection rates and the initial water saturation if we plot the points of the cases ca m on the phase diagram of fluid displacement 12 cases of the displacement regimes under different conditions are obtained as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min i e cases a b c and d in group 1 the volume fraction of pce after injection increased significantly with decreasing initial water saturation at an initial saturation of 100 the volume fraction of pce after injection is 0 04 while at an initial saturation of 41 the fraction of pce after injection increases significantly to 0 43 this significant increase in the volume fraction of pce can be attributed to the transition to the displacement regime in fig 8 it can be seen that the location of case points ca m gradually shifts from the strong drainage region to the transition region when the initial water saturation is reduced from 100 to 41 i e from case a b c and d in group 1 this change in displacement regime means that the pce invasion front transits from a capillary dominated front to a transitional displacement front when the initial water saturation decreases to 41 at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min this transition of invasion front significantly suppresses the capillary induced preferential pce migration pathways in the samples once the displacement front becomes stable the preferential pathways of pce are suppressed as a result a large amount of water and gas would be displaced from the sample after the injection of pce however things are different under the injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min i e cases e f g and h of group 2 in fig 8 the volume fraction of pce after injection remains at about 0 50 at an injection rate of 2 ml min i e cases i j k and l of group 3 in fig 8 the volume fraction of pce after injection remains around 0 60 the stable value of the volume fraction of pce at different initial water saturations can also be explained by the displacement regime in fig 8 it can be seen that all case points ca m are located in the stable displacement region at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min regardless of the initial water saturation thus the volume fraction of pce hardly changes as the initial water saturation decreases the volume fraction of pce remains stable at high values e g 0 5 and 0 6 since the displacement front remains stable at the injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min under different initial water saturations in general the experimentally measured volume fraction of pce under different conditions agrees well with the change of displacement regimes described by the classical phase diagram this means that the classical phase diagram has the potential to be applicable to the condition of three phase displacement processes similar to two phase displacement conditions the regimes of three phase displacement processes are also controlled by two dimensionless parameters the capillary number and the viscosity ratio this finding provides a simple framework to capture the characteristics of the three phase displacement regime under different conditions and the dynamics of three phase displacement in porous medium can be predicted using this framework 4 conclusions this manuscript mainly focuses on the regime of three phase napl water gas displacement process under different initial water saturations and pce injection rates the low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technique was used to analyze the residual distributions e g volume fraction of napl water gas quantitatively and the findings are as follows 1 as a non destructive and non invasive laboratory technique lf nmr technology is capable of analyzing the three phase displacement efficiency during napl invasion the volume and distribution of the water phase can be directly measured by lf nmr the volume and distribution of pce and gas phase can be determined by combining the method of both lf nmr and mass balance 2 although the displacement efficiency of water improves significantly with increasing pce injection rate no obvious relationship was found between gas displacement efficiency and pce injection rate both water and gas displacement efficiencies changed nonmonotonically with initial water saturation at specific pce injection rates both initial water saturation and pce injection rate were found to have a significant influence on the three phase displacement e g the migration of pce and water 3 the three phase displacement regimes vary at different initial water saturations and different pce injection rates it is found that the classical phase diagram has the potential to be applicable to capture the characteristics of the three phase displacement regime this finding provides a simple framework that captures the dynamics of three phase displacement in porous medium under different conditions it should be mentioned that the particle size of quartz sand has a significant effect on the result of water displacement after napl invasion in this paper only a single coarse quartz sand is studied thus the effect of adsorption and desorption during pce injection was completely ignored in this study however things can be completely different in the porous medium of finer particles i e fine sand silt clay and clay where the transport and displacement of pce can be affected quite seriously by the adsorption and desorption of the medium particles on the other hand as the medium particle becomes finer the effect of capillary forces should be more dominant during pce injection which means that the capillary induced preferential pce migration pathways can be observed more frequently in the experiments it should also be mentioned that the experiments carried out in this study are quite limited and the three phase displacement process can be quite complex under practical conditions thus further studies are needed to verify the applicability of the classical phase diagram in three phase displacement processes under the conditions of different displacement rate fluid viscosity and initial water saturation

corresponding authors three phase displacement events often occur in unsaturated porous media especially when immiscible contaminants e g non aqueous phase liquid napl inadvertently enter the subsurface in this study the influence of initial water saturation on the three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution during napl invasion into unsaturated porous media was experimentally investigated the low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technique was used to dynamically monitor the spatial distribution of water in unsaturated porous media during the invasion of napl the residual distributions e g volume fraction of napl water gas were quantitatively analyzed the results showed that both the initial water saturation and the napl injection rate had a significant influence on the three phase displacement we found that the displacement efficiency of water gas exhibited a non monotonic relationship with the initial water saturation in the unsaturated porous media at certain napl invasion rates a method was proposed to characterize the three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical two phase lenormand s diagram a significant increase in the volume fraction of residual napl after napl invasion was observed during the transition from the strong drainage region to the transitional displacement region however the initial water saturation was insensitive to the volume fraction of residual napl once the characterized three phase displacement regime transitioned to the stable displacement region this study not only highlighted the influence mechanism of initial water saturation and napl injection rate on the three phase displacement efficiency but also endowed the classical two phase lenormand s diagram with the three phase displacement regime keywords initial water saturation unsaturated porous media displacement efficiency residual distribution three phase flow low field nmr data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction groundwater contamination by non aqueous phase liquids napl is becoming increasingly common kalogerakis et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 since napl are typically immiscible in both water and gas the dynamic problem of multi phase flow associated with contamination by napl has attracted considerable interest in recent years in particular when the released napl invade into the unsaturated zone of the subsurface the coexistence of water gas and napl forms a complex three phase displacement system dou et al 2022a unfortunately these napl can seriously contaminate the groundwater even at concentrations as low as one part billion range due to the high toxicity and low solubility of napl in water farthing et al 2012 kokkinaki et al 2013a therefore insights into the characteristics e g displacement efficiency and residual distribution of this three phase displacement system are of great practical importance for risk assessment conceptual model definition active remediation and the fate of napl in the subsurface keller and chen 2003 in a three phase porous media system due to the inherent heterogeneity of pore structure and the different initial water saturation in the vadose zone both displacement efficiency and residual distribution are strongly dependent on the displacement regime hu et al 2018 lenormand et al 1988 trojer et al 2015 previous studies have shown that the capillary number ca mobility ratio m wettability saturation and pore size distribution of porous media have a significant influence on the displacement regime dehghanpour dicarlo 2013 alizadeh piri 2014 kianinejad et al 2015 iglauer et al 2013 blunt 2017 liu et al 2015 wang et al 2019 hu et al 2017 zhang et al 2011 the pore scale characterization of the displacement regime is crucial this is because on one hand the complex pore structures in which flow through microporosity plays an important role and on the other hand the information from pore scale could provide direct insights into details of napl mobilization and displacement to study the complicated pore scale displacement regime empirical correlations alizadeh and piri 2014 blunt 2017 feali et al 2012 kokkinaki et al 2013b and physically based pore scale models gao et al 2020 lan et al 2022 are developed because of the complex pore structures and the interface tracking numerical issues direct dynamic simulations are computationally expensive and have not yet been fully achieved a popular approach is to simplify the pore space geometry eliminate the viscous and gravity forces and characterize three phase systems using pore network models although many advances have been made to improve our understanding of the displacement regime and to describe and fully explain the physics of displacement processes the three phase system has not received much attention over the years as the two phase system few experimental investigations have been performed in a three phase system akbarabadi and piri 2013 alizadeh and piri 2014 carroll et al 2015 feali et al 2012 zhang et al 2021 however traditional laboratory measurements are almost prohibitively complicated expensive and time consuming a pore scale experimental attempt to characterize three phase systems involves complicated pore scale displacement physics as well as fluid fluid and solid fluid interactions and characteristics are rather limited alternatively some promising pore scale experimental studies are currently being conducted for three phase systems with non destructive non invasive laboratory techniques such as microfluidic visualization hu et al 2019 wu et al 2021 microfocused x ray computed tomography micro ct hilpert et al 2000 magnetic resonance imaging chu et al 2004 light reflection

2017 alazaiza et al 2018 alazaiza et al 2019 carroll et al 2015 performed synchrotron x ray microtomography studies of residual three phase fluid configurations after performing a gas invasion they observed that gas contacted completely or partly a significant number of the oil ganglia initially trapped by water in the previous two phase water flood li et al 2017 combined the ct scanning and image processing techniques to investigate the six natural water wet sandstone cores of different permeability and porosity visually and quantitatively although advancements in microtomographic image acquisition and processing methods based on micro ct over the past two decades have provided the means to accurately characterize multiphase flow behavior in three dimensional porous media systems micro ct technique is generally unavailable that accurate identification of the spatial and temporal characteristics of a specific phase of a fluid requires sufficient x ray contrast between the different phases however as a non destructive technique low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technology is capable of providing a promising and high accuracy testing for investigating three phase displacement behaviors at the pore scale in addition lf nmr technology has also the unique capability of calculating the pore size distribution dou et al 2022b hertzog et al 2007 liu et al 2021 the minimal sample preparation requirements and rapid testing are remarkable advantages of the nmr technique in this study we investigated the influence of initial water saturation on three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution during napl invasion into unsaturated porous media lf nmr technology was used to monitor the pore scale distribution of water during the napl invasion the napl water gas displacement efficiencies under different initial water saturations and napl injection rates were determined based on both lf nmr measurements and mass balance method the displacement efficiency of napl water gas were quantitatively analyzed we theoretically and methodologically discussed the three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical phase diagram 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental materials in this study the quartz sand was used as a porous medium for the displacement experiments the main component of quartz sand is silicon dioxide which has no signal characteristics in lf nmr measurements the particle size of the quartz sand for the displacement experiments is 0 280 0 355 mm and the average particle size is 0 3175 mm a hollow cylinder made of polytetrafluoroethylene teflon was designed as a sample container for filling the quartz sand as shown in fig 1 teflon materials do not produce lf nmr signal the outer dimensions of the cylindrical container are 100 mm long and have a diameter of 45 mm the inner chamber of the cylindrical container has a length of 60 mm and a diameter of 25 mm the prepared quartz sand was filled into the inner chamber of the cylindrical container the mass of the filled quartz sand is 46 00 g the corresponding dry density and porosity are 1 53 g cm3 and 0 39 respectively the pore volume pv of the filled quartz sand is 11 50 0 40 ml it should be noted that all the filled quartz sand was compacted and both the corresponding dry density and porosity were the same this ensures that the filled quartz sand has a nearly consistent pore structure the tetrachloroethene pce was selected as non wetting phase as a typical dense napl pce has no signal characteristics in lf nmr measurements therefore the influence of pce on the lf nmr measurements can be neglected ultrapure water is used as the wetting phase 2 2 experimental devices and setups the lf nmr analysis system macromr12 150h i manufactured by suzhou niumag co ltd china with a magnetic field induction intensity of 0 3 t and a constant temperature of the magnet of 32 0 was used for the lf nmr measurements as shown in fig 2 a this system provided a promising and highly accurate measurement of the transverse relaxation time t2 the three phase displacement system see fig 2 b was designed to conduct the displacement experiment the invading pce was filled into the syringe and injected into the quartz sand with the different initial water saturations using the injection pump wh sp 01 the displacement experiment was carried out in the fume hood at a room temperature of 25 to obtain the quartz sand with the different initial water saturations the water saturated quartz sand was prepared first and then the oven hn101 2 was used to dry the water saturated quartz sand at a temperature of 110 the electronic balance wt5003gh with an accuracy of 10 4 g was used to measure the mass of quartz sand samples in this study a total of 12 quartz sand samples were prepared to investigate the influence of initial water saturation on three phase displacement efficiency and residual distribution for this purpose four different initial water saturations were set to 41 68 86 and 100 respectively and three injection rates of pce were set to 0 1 ml min 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively according to the three injection rates 12 samples were divided into three groups e g g1 g2 and g3 in each group there are four samples with the four different initial water saturations to prepare the samples in each group the quartz sand with a mass of 46 00 g is compacted layer by layer in a teflon container in ultrapure water environment thus four samples saturated with water were prepared in each group since the dry density and porosity of the quartz sand in the teflon container were the same the prepared water saturated samples have a consistent pore size distribution see the supporting information then for each group one of the prepared water saturated samples was selected as the saturated sample the other three samples were dried in the oven at 110 until the initial water saturation of the samples was 41 68 and 86 respectively physical properties and initial water saturation of all prepared samples were showed in table 1 after a total of 12 quartz sand samples were prepared in three groups with the same four initial water saturations the pce was injected into each sample by the displacement experiment for the sample groups g1 g2 and g3 the injection rates of the pce were 0 1 ml min 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min respectively the corresponding amounts of pce injection were 1 pv 3 pv and 5 pv respectively the lf nmr measurements were performed for each sample before and after the displacement experiment in addition the mass of each sample was also measured before and after the displacement experiment 2 3 lf nmr measurement and principle lf nmr measurement is a testing technique that interacts with the hydrogen nucleus inside the sample with the support of an external magnetic field to obtain the feedback information from the hydrogen nucleus condition of the sample in this study the lf nmr measurement employed the lf nmr transverse relaxation spectrum technology to measure the t2 of the quartz sand samples it should be noted that the lf nmr measurement is unavailable for the pce teflon container and the gas due to the absent of the hydrogen nucleus the measured t2 was only capable of monitoring the water content and spatial distribution of the quartz sand samples the standard carr purcell meiboom gill cpmg pulse sequence was used in the lf nmr measurement to measure t2 specifically t2 is the time required for the hydrogen nucleus to return from the unbalanced state to the equilibrium state this standard cpmg pulse sequence provided 200 data points in one echo acquisition time and the number of echoes obtained by each cpmg sequence is 15000 other parameters are set as follows an echo time te of 0 23 ms a waiting time tw of 5000 ms and the scanning numbers ns of 16 in the relaxation process there are three mechanisms e g bulk relaxation surface relaxation and diffusion relaxation the corresponding relaxation time is expressed as t 2 b t 2 s a n d t 2 d respectively and described as follows 1 1 t 2 1 t 2 b 1 t 2 s 1 t 2 d 2 t 2 b 3 t k 298 μ 1 t 2 s ρ 2 s v pore 1 t 2 d d γ g t e 2 12 where t k is the temperature k μ is the viscosity of fluid ρ 2 is the surface relaxation rate s v is the surface area to volume ratio d is the molecular diffusion coefficient of fluid γ is the gyromagnetic ratio of a proton g is the field strength gradient g c m and t e is the echo time used in the cpmg sequence the t 2 b is inversely proportional to the viscosity of fluid in this study ultrapure water is used as the wetting fluid and the corresponding viscosity is very low so the value of 1 t 2 b is sufficient to be neglected xu et al 2020 t 2 s is the transverse relaxation time caused by the surface relaxation of the liquid and is inversely proportional to the self diffusion coefficient of the fluid and the te t 2 d is related to the diffusion coefficient of water since the te is small and the diffusion of water molecules is very fast at this time it is so small that it can be neglected tian et al 2014 therefore t2 is mainly determined by t 2 s in this study we consider the pore structure of the quartz sand to be spherical in this case the surface area to volume ratio s v is 3 r eq 2 can be further simplified as hun et al 2021 dou et al 2022a dou et al 2022b chen et al 2021 3 1 t 2 ρ 2 s v pore ρ 2 3 r where ρ 2 is the surface relaxation rate and r is the pore radius eq 3 defines the relationship between t2 measured by lf nmr and the volume and surface area of the pores according to eq 3 the signal intensity of t2 is proportional to the pore radius the larger the pore radius the larger the t2 and the stronger the characterization of the nmr signal liu et al 2021 rao et al 2019 sun et al 2021 lai et al 2018 therefore the pore size distribution could be determined based on the t2 distribution curves in this study the t2 distribution curves of the water saturated samples were first determined the pore volume and pore size of the water saturated samples can be calculated based on the peak area and t2 value in the t2 distribution curve of the water saturated samples meanwhile the volume and distribution of pore water for the unsaturated samples were also determined after the displacement experiment the volume and residual distribution of pore water can be monitored and recorded by the lf nmr measurement the displacement efficiency of water can be determined by both the mass balance method and the t2 subtraction method while the displacement efficiency of pce and gas can be determined by the mass balance method it should be mentioned that the pore structure of all samples was approximately the same and remained unchanged during the experiments this ensured that the t2 subtraction method was available to characterize the volume and redistribution of pore water after pce invasion the details of the calculation based on the mass balance method and the t2 subtraction method can be found in the supporting information 3 results and discussions 3 1 analysis of t2 distribution curves in this study a total of 12 displacement experiments were carried out under different initial water saturation and pce injection rates the sample with an initial water saturation of 68 at a pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min fig 3 is analyzed here in section 3 1 and similar phenomenon can also be found in the other 11 samples the detailed representation of all t2 spectrums of 12 samples can be found in the supporting information it can be found in fig 3 that the t2 signals of both saturated and unsaturated samples have the shape of double peak the water in the small pore has a t2 time of 20 to 100 ms and the water in the large pore has a t2 time of 100 to 1000 ms for saturated sample the signal peak of the water in the small pore is about 300p u and the signal peak of the water in the large pore is about 4000p u since the t2 time is proportional to the pore size the observed similarity of the t2 distribution curves indicates that the pore structure of the saturated samples is similar in fig 3 it can be seen that when the injection amount of pce reaches 1 pv a considerable amount of water is displaced from the sample and therefore the measured t2 signal is significantly lower than the t2 signal of the saturated sample however when the injection amount of pce further increases to 3 pv and 5 pv the t2 signal changes slightly compared to that after injection of 1 pv that is when the injection amount of pce reaches 1 pv during the experiments a fixed channel for water migration by pce displacement has formed in the sample when pce is injected continuously it continues to migrate along the previously formed channel and basically no new channel is formed as a result water is not further displaced after injection of 1 pv and the t2 distribution curves do not change significantly as shown in fig 3 the t2 spectrum of the sample in the unsaturated state is significantly lower than the t2 spectrum in the saturated state it can be inferred from the distribution of t2 spectrum that during the drying process the water in the macropores obviously disappears while the water in the micropores does not change significantly similar phenomenon can also be found after pce is injected into the sample after the invasion of pce larger amount of the pore water is displaced out from the macropore while relatively small amount of pore water is displaced out from the micropore this phenomenon can be attributed to the difference of capillary force in the macropore and micropore due to the smaller capillary force in macropores it is easier for the pce to displace the water in the macropore than in the micropore so the water displacement mainly takes place in the large pores as mentioned earlier the displacement process has stabilized within the sample after the pce injection reaches 1 pv and the continuous injection of pce does not lead to further discharge of water therefore the samples are grouped according to the initial water saturation the t2 results after pce injection of 5 pv are respectively selected to draw a diagram to investigate the influence mechanism of injection rate on water discharge under the conditions of different initial water saturation see fig 4 in fig 4 it can be seen that the amount of discharged water increases and the t2 spectrum decreases significantly when the injection rate increases according to fig 4 for the samples with an initial water saturation of 100 the amount of water displaced from the sample is much higher at injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min than at 0 1 ml min indicating that the influence of the pce injection rate on displacement is absolutely dominant however for the sample with an initial water saturation of 41 at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min the pce continues to displace the water in the pore after it has entered the sample creating new migration channels in the sample at injection rates of 0 1 ml min and 1 0 ml min there is little displacement of water in the pore after the pce is injected into the sample this means that the pce after entering the sample migrates directly along the pre existing interconnected empty pore channels while the water is hardly displaced by new migration channels figs 3 and 4 clearly show that both the initial water saturation and the pce injection rate have a significant influence on the three phase displacement e g pce and water migration meanwhile the dominant mechanisms during the displacement processes are strongly dependent on the pce injection rate and the initial water saturation 3 2 three phase displacement efficiency under different injection rate and initial water saturation water displacement efficiency ew and gas displacement efficiency eg are introduced in this study to further quantitatively analyze the three phase displacement process e g water and pce 4 e w w i w s 5 e g g i g s where wi is the mass of displaced water ws is the mass of water stored in the sample before pce injection gi is the pore volume occupied by the displaced gas and gs is the pore volume occupied by the initial gas in the sample before pce injection table 2 shows the mass of water in the samples after pce injection of 5 pv and the water stored in the samples before pce injection under the conditions of different injection rates and initial water saturation combining eq 6 and table 2 the mass of displaced water and the displacement efficiency of water under different conditions are obtained as shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that for the same initial water saturation both the displacement mass fig 5 a and the displacement efficiency fig 5 b of the water improve significantly with increasing injection rate in fig 5 b it can be seen that the displacement efficiency of water reaches the maximum at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min and an initial water saturation of 86 at an injection rate of 2 0 ml min and 1 0 ml min the displacement efficiency of water initially increases and then decreases as the initial water saturation decreases however at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min both the mass of water discharge and the displacement efficiency of the water showed a similar and non monotonic relationship with initial water saturation both the mass of water discharge and the displacement efficiency of water reach their maximum at an initial water saturation of 68 in unsaturated samples the injected pce displaces not only the water but also the gas due to the coexistence of water and gas therefore we also performed a correlation analysis of the displacement efficiency of the gas the displacement efficiency of the gas under the different conditions can be derived from eq 7 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the displacement efficiency of the gas under the different conditions in fig 6 it can be seen that at the initial water saturation of 100 there is no gas in the samples so the displacement efficiency of the gas is zero for unsaturated samples the highest displacement efficiency of the gas can be observed at a pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min at a pce injection rate of 0 1 ml min the displacement efficiency of the gas gradually increases as the initial water saturation of the sample decreases reaching a maximum at an initial water saturation of 41 however at pce injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min the displacement efficiency of the gas shows a similar and non monotonic relationship with initial water saturation at the pce injection rate of 1 0 ml min the gas displacement efficiency reaches the maximum when the initial water saturation of the sample is 86 while at the pce injection rate of 2 0 ml min the maximum gas displacement efficiency is observed at an initial water saturation of the sample is 68 the volume fraction of water gas and pce was introduced to investigate the influence of pce injection rate on the residual distribution fig 7 shows the volume fraction of water gas and pce in the samples before and after pce injection from fig 7 it can be seen that as the pce injection rate increases the volume fraction of water in the sample decreases and the volume fraction of pce increases significantly at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min the volume fraction of pce and gas increases as the initial water saturation decreases however at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min the volume fraction of pce is close to each other at different initial water saturations this means that the volume fraction of injected pce is insensitive to the initial water saturation moreover the volume fraction of gas increases with the decrease of initial water saturation in general the displacement efficiency and volume fraction of pce water gas phase varied with both initial water saturation and injection rates the underlying displacement mechanisms should be further explained therefore the following section discussed the three phase displacement regime at different injection rates and initial water saturation in terms of the classical phase diagram 3 3 three phase displacement regime in terms of the classical phase diagram from the above analysis it is clear that the three phase displacement mechanism in unsaturated porous media has different characteristics at different initial water saturation and pce injection rate in this study the classical phase diagram of fluid displacement in porous media proposed by lenormand et al 1988 was used to characterize the three phase displacement regimes this diagram suggests that the character of the flow is controlled by two dimensionless parameters the capillary number ca and the mobility ratio m the capillary number ca can be calculated using the following equation 6 c a μ i μ γ where μ i is the dynamic viscosities of the invading fluids μ is the characteristic velocity and γ is the interfacial tension in this study the fluid of the invading phase is pce and the corresponding μ i is equal to 0 9 μ is determined by the injection rate of pce and the value of γ is different for the samples with the initial water saturation for saturated samples since all the pore space is occupied by water γ between pce and water is equal to 44 4 mj m 2 however for unsaturated samples γ is not the interfacial tension between pce and water due to the coexistence of water and gas for unsaturated samples therefore the average interfacial tension was introduced instead of the interfacial tension between pce and water the average interfacial tension was determined by combining the interfacial tension between pce gas and pce water according to the volume fraction of water and gas before pce injection for the three phase displacement condition i e invasion of pce into unsaturated gas water samples γ is calculated as follows 7 γ σ p g g σ p w w where σ p g is the interfacial tension between pce and gas σ p w is the interfacial tension between pce and water g is the pore volume fraction of gas before injection of pce into the sample and w is the pore volume fraction of water before injection of pce into the sample here σ p g is equal to 31 3 mj m 2 and σ p w is equal to 44 4 mj m 2 the mobility ratio m can be calculated using the following equation 8 m μ i μ d where μ i and μ d are the dynamic viscosities of the invading and defending phases respectively in this study the fluid of the invading phase is pce and the corresponding μ i is equal to 0 9 the fluid of the defending phases are water and gas for saturated samples μ d 1 009 i e the viscosity of water for three phase displacement μ d is the average viscosity calculated from the pore volume ratio of water and gas in the sample 9 μ d 1 009 w 0 000181 g where w is the pore volume fraction of water in the sample before pce injection the viscosity of gas is 0 000181 and g is the pore volume fraction of gas in the sample before pce injection both ca and m for 12 samples under different experimental conditions are listed in table 3 from table 3 it can be seen that the values of ca and m vary with both the injection rates and the initial water saturation if we plot the points of the cases ca m on the phase diagram of fluid displacement 12 cases of the displacement regimes under different conditions are obtained as shown in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min i e cases a b c and d in group 1 the volume fraction of pce after injection increased significantly with decreasing initial water saturation at an initial saturation of 100 the volume fraction of pce after injection is 0 04 while at an initial saturation of 41 the fraction of pce after injection increases significantly to 0 43 this significant increase in the volume fraction of pce can be attributed to the transition to the displacement regime in fig 8 it can be seen that the location of case points ca m gradually shifts from the strong drainage region to the transition region when the initial water saturation is reduced from 100 to 41 i e from case a b c and d in group 1 this change in displacement regime means that the pce invasion front transits from a capillary dominated front to a transitional displacement front when the initial water saturation decreases to 41 at an injection rate of 0 1 ml min this transition of invasion front significantly suppresses the capillary induced preferential pce migration pathways in the samples once the displacement front becomes stable the preferential pathways of pce are suppressed as a result a large amount of water and gas would be displaced from the sample after the injection of pce however things are different under the injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min i e cases e f g and h of group 2 in fig 8 the volume fraction of pce after injection remains at about 0 50 at an injection rate of 2 ml min i e cases i j k and l of group 3 in fig 8 the volume fraction of pce after injection remains around 0 60 the stable value of the volume fraction of pce at different initial water saturations can also be explained by the displacement regime in fig 8 it can be seen that all case points ca m are located in the stable displacement region at an injection rate of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min regardless of the initial water saturation thus the volume fraction of pce hardly changes as the initial water saturation decreases the volume fraction of pce remains stable at high values e g 0 5 and 0 6 since the displacement front remains stable at the injection rates of 1 0 ml min and 2 0 ml min under different initial water saturations in general the experimentally measured volume fraction of pce under different conditions agrees well with the change of displacement regimes described by the classical phase diagram this means that the classical phase diagram has the potential to be applicable to the condition of three phase displacement processes similar to two phase displacement conditions the regimes of three phase displacement processes are also controlled by two dimensionless parameters the capillary number and the viscosity ratio this finding provides a simple framework to capture the characteristics of the three phase displacement regime under different conditions and the dynamics of three phase displacement in porous medium can be predicted using this framework 4 conclusions this manuscript mainly focuses on the regime of three phase napl water gas displacement process under different initial water saturations and pce injection rates the low field nuclear magnetic resonance lf nmr technique was used to analyze the residual distributions e g volume fraction of napl water gas quantitatively and the findings are as follows 1 as a non destructive and non invasive laboratory technique lf nmr technology is capable of analyzing the three phase displacement efficiency during napl invasion the volume and distribution of the water phase can be directly measured by lf nmr the volume and distribution of pce and gas phase can be determined by combining the method of both lf nmr and mass balance 2 although the displacement efficiency of water improves significantly with increasing pce injection rate no obvious relationship was found between gas displacement efficiency and pce injection rate both water and gas displacement efficiencies changed nonmonotonically with initial water saturation at specific pce injection rates both initial water saturation and pce injection rate were found to have a significant influence on the three phase displacement e g the migration of pce and water 3 the three phase displacement regimes vary at different initial water saturations and different pce injection rates it is found that the classical phase diagram has the potential to be applicable to capture the characteristics of the three phase displacement regime this finding provides a simple framework that captures the dynamics of three phase displacement in porous medium under different conditions it should be mentioned that the particle size of quartz sand has a significant effect on the result of water displacement after napl invasion in this paper only a single coarse quartz sand is studied thus the effect of adsorption and desorption during pce injection was completely ignored in this study however things can be completely different in the porous medium of finer particles i e fine sand silt clay and clay where the transport and displacement of pce can be affected quite seriously by the adsorption and desorption of the medium particles on the other hand as the medium particle becomes finer the effect of capillary forces should be more dominant during pce injection which means that the capillary induced preferential pce migration pathways can be observed more frequently in the experiments it should also be mentioned that the experiments carried out in this study are quite limited and the three phase displacement process can be quite complex under practical conditions thus further studies are needed to verify the applicability of the classical phase diagram in three phase displacement processes under the conditions of different displacement rate fluid viscosity and initial water saturation
