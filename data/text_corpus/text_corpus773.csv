3865,rural regions which are commonly reliant on groundwater for water supply often face groundwater quality challenges related to agricultural activity to sustainably manage and protect groundwater resources it is necessary to have a clear understanding of inherent groundwater vulnerability and the contamination risk posed by pollutant loading index based methods typically assess groundwater contamination risk in a static manner and commonly represent agricultural land as a single land use class despite the complexity of land management practices that may be present this paper illustrates modification of the conventional drastic lu methodology through a newly developed drastic aglu cc approach to better understand how groundwater contamination risk may change by mid century while simultaneously examining the potential influence of land use scheme complexity on model performance and prediction recharge depth to water table and land use are treated as dynamic factors through the integration of downscaled global climate model data empirically estimated water table fluctuation and recharge and trend based land change modelling the upper parkhill watershed in southwestern ontario canada serves as a case study for method application study results indicate that more detailed agricultural land use representation specifically the inclusion of crop rotation and tile drainage data has the potential to improve model predictive ability furthermore predicted future changes in groundwater contamination risk may vary depending on the manner in which land use is represented within the upper parkhill watershed mid century land use and climate conditions may increase groundwater contamination risk although minimal change is anticipated the presented approach provides a valuable screening tool to better understand the potential for changing groundwater contamination risk in rural regions and can be used to guide groundwater monitoring programs and water supply development keywords groundwater vulnerability drastic aglu cc land use change climate change crop rotations tile drainage 1 introduction groundwater resources in many rural regions face substantial pressure from agricultural activities and associated pollution threats to sustainably manage these resources it is important to understand the intrinsic vulnerability of the setting in question which controls the likelihood of contamination by an imposed pollutant source there are a number of methods available to assess groundwater vulnerability including statistical methods process based models and index based methods e g huan et al 2016 stevenazzi et al 2017 rizka 2018 index based methods are a popular technique for vulnerability assessment since they are generally not limited by computational challenges or inadequate data availability kumar et al 2015 these methods involve the overlay of indexed physiographic attribute maps which are used to generate a scored vulnerability range national research council 1993 the drastic method aller et al 1987 is one such widely used index based approach this method was developed by the united states environment protection agency aller et al 1987 as a systematic approach for evaluating groundwater pollution potential in a given hydrogeologic setting although this method was originally developed for application in the united states it has since been extensively applied at many locations around the world with modifications made where appropriate for example to account for differences in geologic setting or to incorporate specific aspects of concern such as aquifer thickness or fractured media e g lee 2003 mendoza and barmen 2006 wang et al 2007 awawdeh et al 2015 kazakis and voudouris 2015 hamza et al 2017 salek et al 2018 it is possible for an area of high intrinsic groundwater vulnerability to lack a pollutant source therefore in order to determine overall groundwater contamination risk and better support groundwater management practices assessment of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability must be combined with some assessment of pollutant loading the drastic lu method e g alam et al 2014 sinha et al 2016 noori et al 2018 kumar and krishna 2019 examines pollutant loading through the incorporation of regional land use data whereby human activities are linked to contaminant threat however in this approach agricultural land is commonly represented as a single land use class with only a small proportion of previous investigations using classes that are further refined for example on the basis of crop type and irrigation patterns e g martínez bastida et al 2010 hamza et al 2010 li and merchant 2013 al rawabdeh et al 2014 saha and alam 2014 kazakis and voudouris 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ncibi et al 2020 no precedence exists for the explicit incorporation of crop rotations and the multi year perspective these rotations provide or tile drainage within rural agricultural regions both of which may substantially influence groundwater contamination risk the risks of groundwater contamination are typically assessed in a static manner assuming reference or present day conditions however environmental change in the form of both climate and land use change may lead to modifications in contamination potential both changing climate and land cover patterns have the potential to alter groundwater recharge and subsequent groundwater elevations for example due to increased precipitation or intensified irrigation meixner et al 2016 smerdon 2017 brewington et al 2019 erler et al 2019 while these factors may influence contaminant transport capacity land use patterns can also directly affect pollutant loading and groundwater quality for example due to nutrient application practices e g mishra et al 2014 narany et al 2017 salman et al 2018 he and wu 2019 despite the increasing prevalence of hydrologic climate change investigations it has been noted that climate change vulnerability assessments considering multiple stressors e g not just temperature precipitation change are still limited aslam et al 2018 this highlights the importance of both climate and land use consideration when assessing future groundwater contamination risk in rural regions the inclusion of recharge water table depth and land use in the drastic lu approach provides the opportunity to explore potential future conditions variations of the drastic and drastic lu approach have been successfully used in previous studies to investigate potential changes in groundwater vulnerability and contamination risk in response to changing climate and or land use conditions e g li and merchant 2013 seeboonruang 2016 huang et al 2017 nistor 2019 however to the authors knowledge studies of this nature are absent in the great lakes basin of ontario canada and furthermore have not been completed in a manner that concurrently investigates the influence of land use representation index based groundwater vulnerability assessment methods recommended by source water protection legislation in this region namely the intrinsic susceptibility index isi and aquifer vulnerability index avi give primary consideration to the type and thickness of overburden materials government of ontario 2019 these methods therefore lack adaptability to be applied as useful indicators of future environmental change moreover the isi and avi methods rely primarily on point data derived from well records which are known to have varying degrees of reliability and may be problematic where well density and distribution are limited dillon consulting limited 2008 for example in rural regions the primary objective of this research is to propose a modified drastic lu approach referred to herein as drastic aglu cc for assessing future groundwater contamination risk due to changing land use recharge and water table depth while simultaneously examining the potential influence of agricultural land use scheme complexity on model performance and prediction this new methodology emphasizes the inclusion of agricultural land management practices and climate change the upper parkhill watershed in southwestern ontario canada serves as case study for method application given its agricultural nature this watershed provides an ideal setting for investigating the importance of crop rotations and tile drainage in land use class discrimination moreover the upper parkhill watershed was previously identified as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change macritchie et al 2010 macritchie 2011 therefore highlighting this area as an important region of study it is anticipated that results from this study may be used to refine groundwater contamination risk assessments in rural regions of the great lakes basin and other geographic locations with similar data availability the drastic aglu cc method functions as a screening tool to gain insight on possible future changes in groundwater contamination risk which may inform groundwater and land management strategies 2 methods 2 1 study area the upper parkhill watershed fig 1 is a headwater catchment draining an area of approximately 130 km2 and is located within the jurisdiction of the ausable bayfield conservation authority abca the area is overlain by st joseph till clayey silt to silty clay diamicton which was deposited during the late wisconsinan glaciation land use within this rural watershed is dominated by agricultural activity which as of 2018 comprised approximately 77 of the watershed area fig 1 the watershed is relatively flat with surface elevation ranging between 189 and 266 m above sea level given relatively low permeability overburden materials this watershed features extensive artificial tributaries i e surface and subsurface agricultural drains outlet flows from this watershed are controlled by a dam maintained by the abca which was constructed in 1969 with the primary purpose of flood prevention and protection of agricultural land downstream of the watershed the upper parkhill watershed faces water management challenges due to inherent agricultural land modifications and non point source nutrient pollution mackie et al 2021 persaud et al 2020 rixon et al 2020 2 2 groundwater vulnerability and contamination risk the original drastic method aller et al 1987 is based on seven important hydrogeological factors controlling subsurface flow these factors which make up the acronym drastic include depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography slope t impact of vadose zone media i and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer c to account for a potential pollutant source and thereby consider risk of contamination a land use parameter lu may be included as an additional drastic factor secunda et al 1998 forming the drastic lu method for the proposed drastic aglu cc approach this land use parameter has been renamed aglu to reflect specific attention given to agricultural conditions the drastic method was developed assuming the following generalizations 1 the study area is at least 0 4 km2 2 the contaminant is conservative 3 the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface and 4 the contaminant is transported towards groundwater via recharge implicit to the current investigation is the additional assumption that groundwater contamination risk has the potential to change due to changing watershed conditions for this reason climate change cc has been included as an additional factor in the drastic aglu cc approach note that this factor does not represent a specific variable but rather the overarching premise that variables influenced by climate should be treated as dynamic where possible to implement the drastic aglu cc method each of the factors is reclassified based on a defined rating scheme and weighted table 1 according to the procedures outlined in aller et al 1987 the factors are divided into ranges material classes and assigned a rating between 1 and 10 depending on the relative impact on pollution potential in a similar manner weights between 1 and 5 have been assigned based on overall factor importance with the factor of greatest relative importance receiving a weight of 5 aller et al 1987 a numerical drastic aglu cc index diaglu cc was determined using eqn 1 where r and w correspond to the factor rating and weight respectively 1 di aglu c c d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w aglu r aglu w the greater the index value the greater the potential for groundwater contamination this method was implemented using weighted overlay analysis in arcgis a general workflow for this approach is illustrated in fig 2 with core drastic inputs displayed in fig 3 it is acknowledged that this analysis represents an approximation of contaminant risk given the absence of specific contaminant information e g source loading transport properties etc and protective measures that may be in place to prevent groundwater contamination for example agricultural best management practices may limit groundwater contamination in areas that would otherwise be targeted as likely pollutant sources based on land use alone nonetheless this baseline approach provides a conservative estimate of groundwater contamination risk throughout the watershed 2 3 static watershed conditions five of the eight drastic aglu cc input factors were held constant in this investigation for both reference and future conditions including aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 2 these factors and the data used to inform them are described herein the drastic aglu cc method considers three zones of subsurface material soil media vadose zone and aquifer media which are defined here in accordance with aller et al 1987 the characteristics of these units control vertical contaminant movement travel times from surface to groundwater as well as attenuation processes and capacity the soil media refers to the uppermost portion of the vadose zone which features substantial biological activity textural information for this factor was derived from the ontario soil survey complex ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2015 the vadose zone refers to unsaturated or discontinuously saturated media that lies between the aquifer and soil while the aquifer media refers to consolidated or unconsolidated saturated media that underlies the vadose zone the intention of this study was to focus on shallow subsurface conditions therefore both aquifer media and vadose zone model inputs were informed by existing mapped surficial geology ontario geological survey 2010 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material was derived from literature values freeze and cherry 1979 domenico and schwartz 1990 the final static component of the drastic aglu cc model was the topography factor which refers to the slope of the land surface the higher the slope the greater the likelihood that a contaminant will run off the land surface rather than remain in an area long enough to infiltrate percent slope was calculated using a hydrologically conditioned digital elevation model from the ontario integrated hydrology data package with a spatial resolution of 30 m ontario ministry of natural resources 2013 2 4 dynamic watershed conditions in contrast to the static drastic aglu cc factors discussed previously this investigation examined variability in depth to water table net recharge and land use as described in detail herein the inclusion of dynamic variables resulted in three reference period scenarios and five future scenarios for comparison of groundwater contamination risk which are summarized schematically in fig 4 2 4 1 land use 2 4 1 1 reference conditions three land use schemes were developed to assess the importance of land use complexity in model performance i e the ability of the model to correctly predict groundwater contamination risk with specific consideration given to crop rotations and tile drainage a 1990 land use map obtained from agriculture and agri food canada aafc at a spatial resolution of 30 m agriculture and agri food canada 2015 was used to represent reference period conditions this data which is part of a three map series 1990 2000 2010 follows the protocol of the intergovernmental panel on climate change for land use classes and includes for example settlement roads water forest cropland and wetland these maps were developed in response to a need for unambiguous high accuracy high resolution land use data to meet the aafc s international reporting commitments and provide a valuable foundation for assessing land use change through time however given the relatively coarse land use differentiation the classification scheme used in the aforementioned 1990 land use map forms the basis of what will be referred to as the simple land use scheme throughout the remainder of the study a second land use scheme referred to as complex i was developed to incorporate specific crop rotations and the associated implications in terms of groundwater contamination potential crop rotations were superimposed on aafc s 1990 cropland class taking rotations from the last four complete growing seasons 2016 2019 which are derived from aafc s publicly available annual crop inventory agriculture and agri food canada 2020 crop rotations in the conventional sense are defined as the practice of growing different crops in succession on the same land it is acknowledged that while a period of four years was considered in this study the majority of crop successions examined are likely to represent two or three year rotations e g corn soybeans or corn soybeans winter wheat within the last four complete growing seasons only 3 of cropland within the abca jurisdiction featured four unique crops in succession nonetheless consideration of a four year period allows for a comprehensive examination of present day cropping patterns crop rotations were reclassified into four categories based on the frequency and types of crops within the examined four year period table 2 with the intention to reflect differences in nutrient management and associated groundwater contamination potential the presence of corn in a rotation was used as a primary distinguishing trait given the tendency for higher nitrogen requirements in southern ontario ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020b bagg et al 2002 and greater nutrient leaching potential e g blesh and drinkwater 2013 khanal et al 2014 king et al 2016 hussain et al 2019 saleem et al 2020 finally a third land use scheme complex ii was developed to incorporate the presence of tile drainage tile drain data obtained from the ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs omafra ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a was superimposed on the complex i scenario within ontario licensed agricultural tile drainage contractors must report to omafra areas where tile drainage has been installed ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a these areas are then represented as polygon features in the database which is updated on an ongoing basis data incorporated in this study reflects tile drainage as of august 2020 which covers approximately 61 of the abca area tile drains intercept water percolating from the ground surface towards the water table thus potentially reducing the risk of aquifer contamination via leaching note that the influence of tiles in re routing agricultural contaminants to surface water is dependent on the water table location which for example may vary seasonally tiles will only flow if intersected by the water table a lack of available crop rotation and tile drain data for 1990 necessitated the assumption of present day conditions in this study which implies consistency in agricultural land management land use classes were assigned rating values for incorporation in the drastic aglu cc model table 1 land uses within the aafc 1990 map i e simple scenario were grouped into five general classes for rating purposes development i e settlement and roads water forest i e forest and trees wetland i e forest wetland treed wetland wetland and wetland shrub and cropland this rating scheme represents the foundation of all other land use scenarios and was informed in part by previous drastic lu investigations e g sinha et al 2016 singha et al 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 open water i e parkhill dam reservoir and wetlands are assumed to have the lowest groundwater contamination potential these ratings reflect the likelihood of groundwater contamination upon application of a pollutant source e g nonpoint source pollution from agricultural runoff and account for both natural wetland attenuation capacity e g hefting et al 2013 tanner and kadlec 2013 yang et al 2016 uuemaa et al 2018 and presumed low permeability materials at base of the parkhill dam reservoir in this investigation agricultural practices were assumed to have the greatest groundwater contamination potential the simple scenario which features a single cropland category was intended to capture a worst case condition of possible nutrient leaching for the complex i scenario rating values are varied according to crop rotation category as discussed previously crop rotation a is assumed to have the greatest nutrient leaching potential and is therefore given the highest rating followed by crop rotation b c and d ratings for agricultural land within the complex ii scenario were reduced relative to complex i where tile drainage is present for a given crop rotation the rating amount in excess of crop rotation d which is assumed to be never tiled was decreased by 50 for example the rating of crop rotation a 8 exceeds crop rotation d 5 by a value of 3 a 50 reduction of this excess results in a rating value of 6 5 for the case where crop rotation a land is also tiled nutrient losses through tiles to surface water features are more commonly examined in the literature e g kokulan et al 2019 michaud et al 2019 than nutrient persistence below tiles therefore the appropriateness of this rating reduction is difficult to assess nonetheless the proposed rating scale is based on the general idea that while tile drainage intercepts percolating water substantial amounts of nutrients may still leach through the root zone below tile drains e g cambardella et al 1999 mehnert et al 2007 nila rekha et al 2011 consequently groundwater contamination risk is reduced but not completely eliminated where tile drains are present 2 4 1 2 land change modeller the terrset land change modeler lcm eastman 2016 was used to predict future land use conditions in the upper parkhill watershed application of this tool which has been used successfully in a number of previous studies e g mas et al 2014 reddy et al 2017 hamad et al 2018 tiné et al 2019 involved three major tasks analysis of past land use change modelling the potential for land transitions and predicting the course of change into the future in this manner historical change from time 1 to time 2 is used to project future scenarios this assumes that previous rates of change will remain constant in the simulated future period using the aafc map series discussed previously the 1990 and 2000 maps were used for time 1 and time 2 respectively while the 2010 map was used for model validation change analysis of the historic maps was used to identify transitions from one land use to another these changes were identified based on a threshold size of change ignored transitions less than 10 ha from this analysis six transitions were identified including transitions from settlement roads and forest to cropland and vice versa for the purposes of this assessment transitions from roads to cropland cropland to roads and settlement to cropland were ignored these transitions are believed to be attributed to classification error in the time 1 and 2 land use maps transition potential maps i e suitability maps were created taking into consideration a specified set of driver variables driving variables within the lcm may be either static or dynamic static variables describe aspects of basic suitability for the transition under consideration and are unchanging over time while dynamic variables are time dependent and are recalculated over the course of a prediction eastman 2016 transition potentials were calculated using a multi layer perceptron neural network the model is trained and tested through the extraction of samples from the two land cover maps of areas that underwent the transitions being modelled as well as areas that were eligible to change but did not eastman 2016 this process also examines the sensitivity of the model to the driving variables to identify which variables have the greatest effect on model skill eastman 2016 table 3 summarizes the driving variables included in this exercise transitions were predicted with an accuracy rate ranging from approximately 84 95 ultimately four driving variables were used to explain the modelled transitions several other static environmental driving variables were examined e g elevation slope proximity to streams but were found to have a negligible impact on the prediction quality once calibrated the lcm uses the markov chain prediction process to calculate transition probabilities eastman 2016 this process determines how much land would be expected to transition from the later date i e 2000 to a specified prediction date based on a projection of the transition potentials into the future eastman 2016 future scenario predictions were further constrained through the incorporation of zoning bylaw maps for the upper parkhill watershed municipality of north middlesex 2018 muncipality of south huron and county of huron planning and development department 2020 transitions to cropland were permitted in areas presently zoned for agricultural activity e g general agriculture restricted agriculture and agricultural small holdings transitions to forest were permitted in areas presently zoned for general and restricted agriculture natural environment environmental protection zones as well as parks and recreation areas transitions to settlement were permitted in areas zoned for general and small holding agricultural areas commercial activity community facilities future development residential zones and industrial zones the lcm model was used to produce both hard and soft predictions for 2010 land use whereby a hard prediction represents a commitment to a specific scenario while the soft prediction represents a continuous surface of vulnerability to change eastman 2016 the quality of the lcm prediction was assessed through a comparison of modelled 2010 land use to observed land use conditions at this time the lcm validation process identifies hits model predicted land use change and change occurred misses model predicted land use persistence and it changed and false alarms model predicted land use change and it persisted a comparison of the number of false alarms relative to the number of hits i e to evaluate the quality of areas that the model indicated would change revealed a success rate of approximately 43 while this indicates room for improvement it is important to remember that the examined scenario represents one hard prediction from many equally plausible scenarios if more eligible locations for change exist than the actual amount of change it will be difficult to obtain an accurate hard prediction to better evaluate the quality of the lcm prediction the roc statistic i e area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated this metric determines how well the continuous soft prediction surface predicts the locations of change relative to a boolean image of all actual changes a roc value of 1 indicates that there is perfect spatial agreement between the reference image and suitability map for this analysis a roc value of 0 84 was obtained which is considered an excellent level of discrimination hosmer and lemeshow 2005 the calibrated and validated lcm was used to generate a prediction of 2050 land use simple within the upper parkhill watershed fig 5 a this prediction based on the transitions noted in table 3 generated notable changes in cropland 2 and development 41 as shown in table 4 however the simulated transitions correspond to a total of only 3 8 km2 of land change or approximately 3 of the watershed area indicating relatively little change to land use by mid century this perhaps suggests that in rural agricultural regions such as the upper parkhill watershed land use change simulations may not be crucial for assessing future changes in groundwater contamination risk depending on the circumstances and time frame under consideration the municipalities of north middlesex and south huron within which the upper parkhill watershed is located emphasize protection of the existing land base to promote the long term future of agriculture municipality of north middlesex 2014 county of huron planning department 2018 while this appears to have been accomplished in the lcm projection it is recognized that the simulated increase in settlement areas may be an overestimation population projections within north middlesex and south huron which currently extend to 2026 and 2031 respectively indicate minimal growth roughly 2 every 5 years middlesex county 2006 county of huron planning and development department 2015 however in both municipalities existing settlement areas i e towns villages and hamlets are intended to be the focus for future growth in comparison this investigation permitted development around the outer perimeter of agricultural fields i e adjacent to existing road infrastructure to allow for evaluation of more dynamic circumstances 2 4 1 3 future conditions the 2050 simple land use scenario generated from the lcm exercise was expanded upon to develop mid century complex i and complex ii scenarios fig 5b and 5c again assuming present day crop rotations and tile drain coverage in addition to these three scenarios two additional resilient scenarios resilient i and resilient ii were developed to evaluate a possible alternative to the status quo fig 5d and 5e this alternative reflects potential crop rotation modifications that may occur as a result of variable mid century agro climatic conditions increases in extreme high temperatures as well as changes in the amount frequency and intensity of precipitation qian et al 2013 li et al 2018 may result in the need for diversified and more resilient crop rotations to protect crop yield gaudin et al 2015 teixeira et al 2018 bowles et al 2020 to account for this possible adaptation the resilient i scenario features all crop rotation a land converted to crop rotation b representing the transition away from high frequency corn cropping the resilient ii scenario features the incorporation of tile drainage in the same manner as the complex ii scenario 2 4 2 climate this investigation applied an empirical approach to net recharge and water table depth estimation to maintain simplistic and minimal data requirements thereby enabling method application in areas that may be data poor 2 4 2 1 net recharge net recharge represents the amount of water that infiltrates from the ground surface to the water table and therefore plays an important role in the vertical transport of contaminants to groundwater aller et al 1987 it is acknowledged that out of all drastic factors net recharge is often the most difficult value to obtain estimate as a result the ranges for recharge rating set by aller et al 1987 shown in table 1 are intentionally wide to account for this uncertainty in this investigation reference and mid century recharge was approximated using the williams and kissel equations williams and kissel 1991 which were informed by total precipitation data obtained from climatedata ca cannon et al 2015 this canadian climate portal is a collaboration between the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic ouranos inc the prairie climate centre pcc environment and climate change canada eccc centre de recherche informatique de montréal crim and habitat7 the incorporated data is available at a spatial resolution of 300 arcseconds and represents an ensemble of 24 climate models for the rcp8 5 emission scenario this data has been downscaled using the bccaqv2 method developed at the pcic which is a hybrid of bcca maurer et al 2010 and qmap gudmundsson et al 2012 approaches for this investigation an annual time series of 50th percentile total precipitation values was averaged over 1986 2005 and 2040 2059 to generate a representative reference period and mid century year respectively for examination this empirical approach to recharge estimation eqn 2 5 has been applied in a number for previous drastic investigations e g hamza et al 2007 hamza et al 2010 al hallaq and elaish 2012 feumba and ngounou 2014 kumar and krishna 2019 including those with the use of projected precipitation data e g li and merchant 2013 these equations rely on the pre existing classification of hydrologic soil groups this information available from the ontario soil survey complex ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2015 classifies soils according to their saturated infiltration capacity for example soil group a describes soils having a high infiltration rate when wet low runoff potential while soil group d represents soils having a very slow infiltration rate when wet high runoff potential with groups b and c representing intermediate conditions between these two extremes 2 pi p 10 29 2 p 15 43 h y d r o l o g i c s o i l g r o u p a 3 pi p 15 05 2 p 22 57

percolation i e average recharge in inches and p is the average precipitation inches application of this method within the upper parkhill watershed resulted in an average annual recharge change of 25 mm year from the reference period to mid century 2 4 2 2 depth to water table depth to groundwater indicates the thickness of material a potential contaminant may travel through to reach the water table greater depth may indicate longer travel and more opportunity for natural contaminant degradation while water table depth typically fluctuates seasonally e g in accordance with recharge patterns the drastic approach uses a static water table assumed to represent average conditions in this study long term average water table conditions derived from a previous regional groundwater modelling project waterloo hydrogeologic 2007 were used to represent reference conditions changes in water table depth from this reference condition to mid century were estimated using the water table fluctuation method eqn 6 rasmussen and andreasen 1959 6 r t s y δ h t where r is the recharge cm occurring in time t i e difference between reference period and mid century sy is the specific yield of the aquifer and h is the water level rise cm attributed to the recharge period specific yield for aquifer materials in the study area was approximated from literature values morris and johnson 1967 a mean water table change of 0 36 m was predicted based on the examined annual average reference period and mid century conditions 2 5 validation a preliminary drastic aglu cc model was created for the entire abca area for the purposes of model validation drastic model validation is commonly completed through a comparison of index values to observed groundwater quality parameters due to sparse available monitoring records within the upper parkhill watershed a region larger than the intended study area was examined to incorporate a greater number of comparison points in terms of the dynamic watershed factors outlined previously the validated model was informed by 1990 reference period land use conditions simple complex i and complex ii long term average water table conditions simulated in a previous regional modelling investigation waterloo hydrogeologic 2007 and net recharge calculated using an annual average of 1970 2000 daily gridded precipitation data from the nrcan anusplin dataset mckenney et al 2011 given the assumptions of the drastic model contaminants that are generally viewed as conservative are most appropriate for use in model validation in a perfectly performing model areas with a high drastic aglu cc index should align with areas that have high observed values of contamination for this investigation index values from the three generated risk maps i e one for each land use scenario were compared against values of no3 n no2 n from 28 overburden monitoring points measured as part of ontario s ambient groundwater geochemistry program hamilton 2015 fig 6 records from this monitoring program span a multi year period however only those records collected within a single year 2008 were incorporated in this study under certain circumstances nitrate and or nitrite may disobey the definition of conservative nonreactive transport i e through microbial mediated denitrification however numerous past investigations have shown successful application of this groundwater quality parameter in model validation e g sinha et al 2016 hamza et al 2017 noori et al 2018 singha et al 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 furthermore given the dominance of agricultural land use within the study area nitrate and nitrite represent particularly relevant contaminants of concern although nitrate is expected to be the major form of n present based on anticipated redox conditions correlation between observed groundwater quality and drastic aglu cc model results for each land use scenario was assessed using pearson s correlation coefficient pearson 1896 coefficient values may range from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect negative relationship 0 indicates no relationship and 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship 2 6 sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of the individual parameters used in the drastic aglu cc analysis both single parameter sensitivity and map removal senstivity were examined the former was used to determine the effective weight w e eqn 7 of each input parameter in comparison to the assigned theoretical weight w t eqn 8 this popular metric introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 has been used in many past drastic investigations e g babiker et al 2005 sinha et al 2016 hamza et al 2017 huang et al 2017 machiwal et al 2018 noori et al 2018 salek et al 2018 jesiya and gopinath 2019 single parameter sensitivity provides useful insight regarding the effect of factor rating and weighting values 7 w e p r p w r 100 8 w t p w i 1 n p w i 100 where pr and pw are the ratings and weight for parameter p respectively and r is the risk index map removal sensitivity introduced by lodwick et al 1990 identifies the sensitivity associated with removing one or more map layers eqn 9 e g dibi et al 2012 edet 2014 umar kura et al 2015 jesiya and gopinath 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 this measurement focuses on understanding the interdependency of related parameters and may help to identify drastic aglu cc parameters that are essential for inclusion in this study area versus those with little effect 9 s r n r x n 1 where s is the sensitivity associated with the removal of one map parameter x r is the original risk index value computed based on eqn 1 using n map layers and rx is the risk index computed excluding one map layer 2 7 assessment of model predictions to evaluate potential future changes in groundwater contamination risk drastic aglu cc index values calculated for the reference 1986 2005 and mid century 2040 2059 periods were compared for each examined land use scheme statistical differences in mean index values were assessed using a student s t test with α 0 05 a one way anova and tukey s post hoc test were also performed to assess possible differences among reference period and mid century scenarios the aforementioned statistical analyses were completed in python 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and assessment of land use schemes results of model validation table 5 and fig 7 a reveal a moderate positive correlation between observed groundwater quality and predicted contamination risk for all land use schemes it is also evident that correlations are slightly improved in the complex i and complex ii scenarios relative to the simple scenario this suggests that refinement of land use classifications to incorporate crop rotation and tile drainage data has the potential to improve model performance generated risk index values for the three examined land use configurations were grouped according to the quantile classification scheme proposed by hamza et al 2015 quantile classes of vey low low medium high and very high risk were obtained by dividing the percentage range for each drastic aglu cc map into five equal divisions for example a map with minimum and maximum index values 86 and 256 respectively i e 34 and 100 would have risk intervals spanning 13 by applying a classification scheme of this nature differences in areas of very low to very high groundwater contamination can be more easily quantified vs visual assessment of groundwater contamination risk maps alone as can be observed in fig 7b the percentage of study area identified as having low groundwater contamination risk increases with increasing land use complexity this is unsurprising given the reduced land use rating values applied in the complex i and complex ii scenarios nonetheless these results highlight the importance of crop rotation and tile drainage data inclusion of this supplemental data is believed to better account for spatial differences in land management and associated contamination potential as well as reduce the likelihood for overestimating groundwater contamination risk despite these insightful model validation results it is recognized that in all land use scenarios there is room for model improvement this possibly highlights a disconnect between the drastic aglu cc conceptualization which emphasizes contaminant transport to the water table and monitoring well records the focus on shallow subsurface conditions in this study which ignores potential vertical stratification at depth may inherently limit the ability to obtain optimized validation results 3 2 sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity were evaluated for the simple and complex ii scenarios i e the two examined extremes in agricultural class refinement to assess any potential differences in factor sensitivity as a function of land use scheme complexity this analysis was completed using the same extent as that used for validation i e the entire abca area for the sake of consistency in preliminary model evaluation effective weights determined from the single parameter sensitivity analysis generally follow the same trend as the theoretical weights assigned to each factor i e higher for those factors assigned a high theoretical weight and vice versa however it is evident that the effective weights consistently deviate in magnitude from the theoretical weights for all factors in each scenario fig 8 a of notable importance the effective weight exceeds the theoretical weight for depth to water table topography and land use these factors have the top three highest mean rating values indicating the prevalence of study area dominated by conditions associated with a high contamination potential e g shallow water table low slope and agricultural land use effective weight in exceedance of theoretical weight indicates that these parameters have a greater influence on the resulting index values than that which would be inferred from the assigned weights alone with the opposite being true for those factors whose effective weights are less than the theoretical weights it is also evident that effective weights in the simple scenario are less than those in the complex ii scenario for all factors except land use this is believed to be attributed to the lower land use ratings used in the complex ii scenario relative to the simple scenario the completed map removal sensitivity analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the interdependency of related factors relative to the single parameter sensitivity analysis this analysis indicates that both the simple and complex ii models are most sensitive to the removal of the depth to water table soil media topography and land use and less sensitive to the removal of net recharge aquifer media impact of vadose zone and aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 8b this highlights that even factors with a low assigned weight e g soil media and topography may have a substantial influence on the model when factor interactions are considered from fig 8b it is also evident that the simple model is more sensitive to the land use factor than the complex ii model similar to that described previously this is likely due to the lower rating values used in the complex ii land use layer these sensitivity analyses provide valuable insight regarding model functioning and emphasize the importance of factors that are commonly assumed static notably the depth to water table and land use conversely the model demonstrates lower relative sensitivity to the remaining dynamic variable net recharge it is possible that in other regions where there is greater variability in net recharge this will not hold true however this suggests that for this study area greater uncertainty in this input factor may be acceptable given a lesser influence on the resulting risk index values 3 3 predicted change in groundwater contamination risk to assess potential changes in mid century groundwater contamination risk relative to the reference period drastic aglu cc index values were compared both qualitatively and statistically between scenario pairs e g simple land use scheme reference period vs simple land use scheme mid century given that the resilient i and resilient ii land use scenarios were explored for the mid century only these scenarios were compared to the complex i and complex ii reference period scenarios respectively while validation showed improved model performance for the complex ii land use representation all scenarios were included in the future analysis to enable a more comprehensive investigation according to the implemented student s t test table 6 the simple complex i and complex ii scenarios revealed a statistically significant increase in mean drastic aglu cc index values relative to their reference period counterpart in contrast the resilient i scenario revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean drastic aglu cc values and the resilient ii scenario showed insignificant change based on the completed one way anova α 0 05 and tukey s post hoc test all scenarios were found to be significantly different from each other both between and within a given time period with the exception of the complex ii reference and resilient ii mid century scenarios differences in mean index values for all examined scenarios regardless of the direction of change are relatively small nevertheless several observations can be made scenarios showing an increase in mean index values i e simple complex i and complex ii differ by similar magnitudes between reference and mid century periods with a slightly greater difference observed for the complex ii scenario the resilient i scenario also exhibits a comparable magnitude of change albeit opposite in direction the boxplots presented in fig 9 highlight a small upward shift in the range of mid century index values relative to the reference period for the simple complex i and complex ii scenarios in contrast to the resilient i scenario which shows an downward shift amongst the mid century scenarios the resilient ii scenario has the lowest mean risk index while the simple scenario has the greatest mean risk index overall these finding suggest that the adoption of resilient crop rotations has the potential to negate changes in future groundwater contamination risk however even if current cropping practices are to persist changes in groundwater contamination risk are likely to be minimal in this region it is also evident that in agricultural regions disregard for tile drainage in the absence of resilient rotations has the potential to underestimate the amount of change in groundwater contamination risk between the reference period and mid century finally scenarios with both crop rotations and tile drainage included complex ii and resilient ii exhibit the lowest overall mid century index values irrespective of the amount of change between reference and mid century periods this further emphasizes the importance of more detailed agricultural land use representation the presented predictions of groundwater contamination risk require a relatively comprehensive understanding of historic and future watershed conditions which despite best efforts may be unknown and or affected by data uncertainty for example the complex scenarios examined in this study rely on the assumption of present day crop rotations throughout the reference and future periods while these assumptions were deemed reasonable given the historical tendency for similar crops to be grown in this region e g statistics canada 1987 and plausible future perpetuity uncertainty still exists along similar lines it is also acknowledged that this study does not account for potential future policy changes that may encourage naturalization and or reforestation of agricultural land nonetheless the complex and associated resilient scenarios provide constructive insight that would be unattainable without some acceptance of the data limitations shortcomings in the implemented lcm approach are also recognized especially pertaining to the relatively short calibration and validation periods used to generate a 2050 prediction this reflects the difficulty in obtaining appropriate land use maps for trend based analysis e g with a consistent classification approach it is recognized that the accuracy of future predictions may improve with longer model training periods however it is believed that the overall approach for land change modelling is still appropriate and applicable for studies of this nature tile drain coverage is also assumed to be constant throughout the examined reference and future periods the majority of drained areas within the upper parkhill watershed lack a recorded year of tile installation through consultation with omafra it is believed that these areas were tiled prior to the mid 1990 s therefore indicating an extensive history of tile drainage within the watershed and validating the use of present day tile coverage for reference conditions ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a b steiss personal communication october 15 2020 furthermore given the nature of low permeability soils in the region and the fact that 71 of the watershed is presently tiled it is unlikely that these drainage conditions will change substantially in the future therefore while still a potential study limitation it was deemed worthwhile to investigate the utility of tile drainage incorporation 4 conclusion rural regions are commonly reliant on groundwater resources making it increasingly important to understand the contamination risk associated with agricultural activity and potential nutrient leaching this paper illustrates application of a newly proposed drastic aglu cc approach to better understand how groundwater contamination risk may change through time especially under the influence of climate change and assess the impact of land use representation in contrast to existing drastic methodologies this approach emphasizes the incorporation of agricultural land management practices and advocates for the treatment of recharge depth to water table and land use as dynamic factors this has been accomplished through the integration of downscaled global climate model data to empirically estimate water table fluctuation and recharge and trend based land change modelling land use schemes typically used in groundwater contamination risk assessments do not consider unique crop rotations or the presence of subsurface drainage drastic aglu cc validation results presented in this paper suggest that more detailed land use representation has the potential to improve model predictive ability analysis of factor sensitivity for two extremes of agricultural land use representation i e simple vs complex ii indicated variability in factor effective weight and map removal sensitivity notably land use was found to have a greater influence on the calculated risk index values if cropland was represented as a single class sensitivity analysis results also stressed the importance of model factors that are commonly treated as stationary in time especially land use and water table depth this study revealed the potential for predicted future changes in groundwater contamination risk to vary depending on the manner in which land use is represented the methodology implemented for incorporating crop rotations in this study also provides a possible approach for addressing changes in future agricultural land management while it is difficult to know with certainty if and how crop rotations will change in the future due changing climate conditions investigation of possible resilient scenarios has proven to be a meaningful endeavour especially where little guidance currently exists in the literature overall these findings provide valuable insight for the design of future groundwater contamination risk assessments in rural regions despite the useful information that has been provided by this study the implemented approach is not without its shortcomings subjective rating schemes are a limitation inherent to all drastic studies and it is recognized that the ratings used in this study for land use in particular have a direct influence on the observed results equipped with knowledge concerning the potential benefits of improved agricultural land use representation future studies may wish to adjust the proposed rating schemes for example if field based observations of nutrient leaching are available for given crop rotations and or tile drainage conditions future work may also wish to explore the assumptions made surrounding temporal consistency in present day crop rotations and tile drain coverage for example by testing varied spatial arrangements finally it is recognized that future predictions of recharge and subsequent water table estimates may vary depending on the considered climate data nonetheless results from this study provide a possibility of what mid century groundwater contamination risk may look like in the upper parkhill watershed based on the incorporated climate model ensemble it is important to revisit risk analyses as climate model predictions evolve furthermore the implications of these predictions e g changes in irrigation or precipitation intensity and associated recharge patterns should be considered ultimately the methods presented in this paper may be used as a screening tool to better understand the potential for changing shallow subsurface groundwater contamination risk in rural regions this study focuses on southwestern ontario within the great lakes basin however the approach may be easily adapted to other regions of interest it is possible that the importance of agricultural land use representation may differ in other areas depending on the unique combination of drastic aglu cc factors and factor variability study results may be used to guide groundwater monitoring programs i e targeting regions where groundwater

3865,rural regions which are commonly reliant on groundwater for water supply often face groundwater quality challenges related to agricultural activity to sustainably manage and protect groundwater resources it is necessary to have a clear understanding of inherent groundwater vulnerability and the contamination risk posed by pollutant loading index based methods typically assess groundwater contamination risk in a static manner and commonly represent agricultural land as a single land use class despite the complexity of land management practices that may be present this paper illustrates modification of the conventional drastic lu methodology through a newly developed drastic aglu cc approach to better understand how groundwater contamination risk may change by mid century while simultaneously examining the potential influence of land use scheme complexity on model performance and prediction recharge depth to water table and land use are treated as dynamic factors through the integration of downscaled global climate model data empirically estimated water table fluctuation and recharge and trend based land change modelling the upper parkhill watershed in southwestern ontario canada serves as a case study for method application study results indicate that more detailed agricultural land use representation specifically the inclusion of crop rotation and tile drainage data has the potential to improve model predictive ability furthermore predicted future changes in groundwater contamination risk may vary depending on the manner in which land use is represented within the upper parkhill watershed mid century land use and climate conditions may increase groundwater contamination risk although minimal change is anticipated the presented approach provides a valuable screening tool to better understand the potential for changing groundwater contamination risk in rural regions and can be used to guide groundwater monitoring programs and water supply development keywords groundwater vulnerability drastic aglu cc land use change climate change crop rotations tile drainage 1 introduction groundwater resources in many rural regions face substantial pressure from agricultural activities and associated pollution threats to sustainably manage these resources it is important to understand the intrinsic vulnerability of the setting in question which controls the likelihood of contamination by an imposed pollutant source there are a number of methods available to assess groundwater vulnerability including statistical methods process based models and index based methods e g huan et al 2016 stevenazzi et al 2017 rizka 2018 index based methods are a popular technique for vulnerability assessment since they are generally not limited by computational challenges or inadequate data availability kumar et al 2015 these methods involve the overlay of indexed physiographic attribute maps which are used to generate a scored vulnerability range national research council 1993 the drastic method aller et al 1987 is one such widely used index based approach this method was developed by the united states environment protection agency aller et al 1987 as a systematic approach for evaluating groundwater pollution potential in a given hydrogeologic setting although this method was originally developed for application in the united states it has since been extensively applied at many locations around the world with modifications made where appropriate for example to account for differences in geologic setting or to incorporate specific aspects of concern such as aquifer thickness or fractured media e g lee 2003 mendoza and barmen 2006 wang et al 2007 awawdeh et al 2015 kazakis and voudouris 2015 hamza et al 2017 salek et al 2018 it is possible for an area of high intrinsic groundwater vulnerability to lack a pollutant source therefore in order to determine overall groundwater contamination risk and better support groundwater management practices assessment of intrinsic groundwater vulnerability must be combined with some assessment of pollutant loading the drastic lu method e g alam et al 2014 sinha et al 2016 noori et al 2018 kumar and krishna 2019 examines pollutant loading through the incorporation of regional land use data whereby human activities are linked to contaminant threat however in this approach agricultural land is commonly represented as a single land use class with only a small proportion of previous investigations using classes that are further refined for example on the basis of crop type and irrigation patterns e g martínez bastida et al 2010 hamza et al 2010 li and merchant 2013 al rawabdeh et al 2014 saha and alam 2014 kazakis and voudouris 2015 baghapour et al 2016 ncibi et al 2020 no precedence exists for the explicit incorporation of crop rotations and the multi year perspective these rotations provide or tile drainage within rural agricultural regions both of which may substantially influence groundwater contamination risk the risks of groundwater contamination are typically assessed in a static manner assuming reference or present day conditions however environmental change in the form of both climate and land use change may lead to modifications in contamination potential both changing climate and land cover patterns have the potential to alter groundwater recharge and subsequent groundwater elevations for example due to increased precipitation or intensified irrigation meixner et al 2016 smerdon 2017 brewington et al 2019 erler et al 2019 while these factors may influence contaminant transport capacity land use patterns can also directly affect pollutant loading and groundwater quality for example due to nutrient application practices e g mishra et al 2014 narany et al 2017 salman et al 2018 he and wu 2019 despite the increasing prevalence of hydrologic climate change investigations it has been noted that climate change vulnerability assessments considering multiple stressors e g not just temperature precipitation change are still limited aslam et al 2018 this highlights the importance of both climate and land use consideration when assessing future groundwater contamination risk in rural regions the inclusion of recharge water table depth and land use in the drastic lu approach provides the opportunity to explore potential future conditions variations of the drastic and drastic lu approach have been successfully used in previous studies to investigate potential changes in groundwater vulnerability and contamination risk in response to changing climate and or land use conditions e g li and merchant 2013 seeboonruang 2016 huang et al 2017 nistor 2019 however to the authors knowledge studies of this nature are absent in the great lakes basin of ontario canada and furthermore have not been completed in a manner that concurrently investigates the influence of land use representation index based groundwater vulnerability assessment methods recommended by source water protection legislation in this region namely the intrinsic susceptibility index isi and aquifer vulnerability index avi give primary consideration to the type and thickness of overburden materials government of ontario 2019 these methods therefore lack adaptability to be applied as useful indicators of future environmental change moreover the isi and avi methods rely primarily on point data derived from well records which are known to have varying degrees of reliability and may be problematic where well density and distribution are limited dillon consulting limited 2008 for example in rural regions the primary objective of this research is to propose a modified drastic lu approach referred to herein as drastic aglu cc for assessing future groundwater contamination risk due to changing land use recharge and water table depth while simultaneously examining the potential influence of agricultural land use scheme complexity on model performance and prediction this new methodology emphasizes the inclusion of agricultural land management practices and climate change the upper parkhill watershed in southwestern ontario canada serves as case study for method application given its agricultural nature this watershed provides an ideal setting for investigating the importance of crop rotations and tile drainage in land use class discrimination moreover the upper parkhill watershed was previously identified as vulnerable to the impacts of climate change macritchie et al 2010 macritchie 2011 therefore highlighting this area as an important region of study it is anticipated that results from this study may be used to refine groundwater contamination risk assessments in rural regions of the great lakes basin and other geographic locations with similar data availability the drastic aglu cc method functions as a screening tool to gain insight on possible future changes in groundwater contamination risk which may inform groundwater and land management strategies 2 methods 2 1 study area the upper parkhill watershed fig 1 is a headwater catchment draining an area of approximately 130 km2 and is located within the jurisdiction of the ausable bayfield conservation authority abca the area is overlain by st joseph till clayey silt to silty clay diamicton which was deposited during the late wisconsinan glaciation land use within this rural watershed is dominated by agricultural activity which as of 2018 comprised approximately 77 of the watershed area fig 1 the watershed is relatively flat with surface elevation ranging between 189 and 266 m above sea level given relatively low permeability overburden materials this watershed features extensive artificial tributaries i e surface and subsurface agricultural drains outlet flows from this watershed are controlled by a dam maintained by the abca which was constructed in 1969 with the primary purpose of flood prevention and protection of agricultural land downstream of the watershed the upper parkhill watershed faces water management challenges due to inherent agricultural land modifications and non point source nutrient pollution mackie et al 2021 persaud et al 2020 rixon et al 2020 2 2 groundwater vulnerability and contamination risk the original drastic method aller et al 1987 is based on seven important hydrogeological factors controlling subsurface flow these factors which make up the acronym drastic include depth to groundwater d net recharge r aquifer media a soil media s topography slope t impact of vadose zone media i and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer c to account for a potential pollutant source and thereby consider risk of contamination a land use parameter lu may be included as an additional drastic factor secunda et al 1998 forming the drastic lu method for the proposed drastic aglu cc approach this land use parameter has been renamed aglu to reflect specific attention given to agricultural conditions the drastic method was developed assuming the following generalizations 1 the study area is at least 0 4 km2 2 the contaminant is conservative 3 the contaminant is introduced at the ground surface and 4 the contaminant is transported towards groundwater via recharge implicit to the current investigation is the additional assumption that groundwater contamination risk has the potential to change due to changing watershed conditions for this reason climate change cc has been included as an additional factor in the drastic aglu cc approach note that this factor does not represent a specific variable but rather the overarching premise that variables influenced by climate should be treated as dynamic where possible to implement the drastic aglu cc method each of the factors is reclassified based on a defined rating scheme and weighted table 1 according to the procedures outlined in aller et al 1987 the factors are divided into ranges material classes and assigned a rating between 1 and 10 depending on the relative impact on pollution potential in a similar manner weights between 1 and 5 have been assigned based on overall factor importance with the factor of greatest relative importance receiving a weight of 5 aller et al 1987 a numerical drastic aglu cc index diaglu cc was determined using eqn 1 where r and w correspond to the factor rating and weight respectively 1 di aglu c c d r d w r r r w a r a w s r s w t r t w i r i w c r c w aglu r aglu w the greater the index value the greater the potential for groundwater contamination this method was implemented using weighted overlay analysis in arcgis a general workflow for this approach is illustrated in fig 2 with core drastic inputs displayed in fig 3 it is acknowledged that this analysis represents an approximation of contaminant risk given the absence of specific contaminant information e g source loading transport properties etc and protective measures that may be in place to prevent groundwater contamination for example agricultural best management practices may limit groundwater contamination in areas that would otherwise be targeted as likely pollutant sources based on land use alone nonetheless this baseline approach provides a conservative estimate of groundwater contamination risk throughout the watershed 2 3 static watershed conditions five of the eight drastic aglu cc input factors were held constant in this investigation for both reference and future conditions including aquifer media soil media topography impact of vadose zone and aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 2 these factors and the data used to inform them are described herein the drastic aglu cc method considers three zones of subsurface material soil media vadose zone and aquifer media which are defined here in accordance with aller et al 1987 the characteristics of these units control vertical contaminant movement travel times from surface to groundwater as well as attenuation processes and capacity the soil media refers to the uppermost portion of the vadose zone which features substantial biological activity textural information for this factor was derived from the ontario soil survey complex ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2015 the vadose zone refers to unsaturated or discontinuously saturated media that lies between the aquifer and soil while the aquifer media refers to consolidated or unconsolidated saturated media that underlies the vadose zone the intention of this study was to focus on shallow subsurface conditions therefore both aquifer media and vadose zone model inputs were informed by existing mapped surficial geology ontario geological survey 2010 the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer material was derived from literature values freeze and cherry 1979 domenico and schwartz 1990 the final static component of the drastic aglu cc model was the topography factor which refers to the slope of the land surface the higher the slope the greater the likelihood that a contaminant will run off the land surface rather than remain in an area long enough to infiltrate percent slope was calculated using a hydrologically conditioned digital elevation model from the ontario integrated hydrology data package with a spatial resolution of 30 m ontario ministry of natural resources 2013 2 4 dynamic watershed conditions in contrast to the static drastic aglu cc factors discussed previously this investigation examined variability in depth to water table net recharge and land use as described in detail herein the inclusion of dynamic variables resulted in three reference period scenarios and five future scenarios for comparison of groundwater contamination risk which are summarized schematically in fig 4 2 4 1 land use 2 4 1 1 reference conditions three land use schemes were developed to assess the importance of land use complexity in model performance i e the ability of the model to correctly predict groundwater contamination risk with specific consideration given to crop rotations and tile drainage a 1990 land use map obtained from agriculture and agri food canada aafc at a spatial resolution of 30 m agriculture and agri food canada 2015 was used to represent reference period conditions this data which is part of a three map series 1990 2000 2010 follows the protocol of the intergovernmental panel on climate change for land use classes and includes for example settlement roads water forest cropland and wetland these maps were developed in response to a need for unambiguous high accuracy high resolution land use data to meet the aafc s international reporting commitments and provide a valuable foundation for assessing land use change through time however given the relatively coarse land use differentiation the classification scheme used in the aforementioned 1990 land use map forms the basis of what will be referred to as the simple land use scheme throughout the remainder of the study a second land use scheme referred to as complex i was developed to incorporate specific crop rotations and the associated implications in terms of groundwater contamination potential crop rotations were superimposed on aafc s 1990 cropland class taking rotations from the last four complete growing seasons 2016 2019 which are derived from aafc s publicly available annual crop inventory agriculture and agri food canada 2020 crop rotations in the conventional sense are defined as the practice of growing different crops in succession on the same land it is acknowledged that while a period of four years was considered in this study the majority of crop successions examined are likely to represent two or three year rotations e g corn soybeans or corn soybeans winter wheat within the last four complete growing seasons only 3 of cropland within the abca jurisdiction featured four unique crops in succession nonetheless consideration of a four year period allows for a comprehensive examination of present day cropping patterns crop rotations were reclassified into four categories based on the frequency and types of crops within the examined four year period table 2 with the intention to reflect differences in nutrient management and associated groundwater contamination potential the presence of corn in a rotation was used as a primary distinguishing trait given the tendency for higher nitrogen requirements in southern ontario ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020b bagg et al 2002 and greater nutrient leaching potential e g blesh and drinkwater 2013 khanal et al 2014 king et al 2016 hussain et al 2019 saleem et al 2020 finally a third land use scheme complex ii was developed to incorporate the presence of tile drainage tile drain data obtained from the ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs omafra ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a was superimposed on the complex i scenario within ontario licensed agricultural tile drainage contractors must report to omafra areas where tile drainage has been installed ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a these areas are then represented as polygon features in the database which is updated on an ongoing basis data incorporated in this study reflects tile drainage as of august 2020 which covers approximately 61 of the abca area tile drains intercept water percolating from the ground surface towards the water table thus potentially reducing the risk of aquifer contamination via leaching note that the influence of tiles in re routing agricultural contaminants to surface water is dependent on the water table location which for example may vary seasonally tiles will only flow if intersected by the water table a lack of available crop rotation and tile drain data for 1990 necessitated the assumption of present day conditions in this study which implies consistency in agricultural land management land use classes were assigned rating values for incorporation in the drastic aglu cc model table 1 land uses within the aafc 1990 map i e simple scenario were grouped into five general classes for rating purposes development i e settlement and roads water forest i e forest and trees wetland i e forest wetland treed wetland wetland and wetland shrub and cropland this rating scheme represents the foundation of all other land use scenarios and was informed in part by previous drastic lu investigations e g sinha et al 2016 singha et al 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 open water i e parkhill dam reservoir and wetlands are assumed to have the lowest groundwater contamination potential these ratings reflect the likelihood of groundwater contamination upon application of a pollutant source e g nonpoint source pollution from agricultural runoff and account for both natural wetland attenuation capacity e g hefting et al 2013 tanner and kadlec 2013 yang et al 2016 uuemaa et al 2018 and presumed low permeability materials at base of the parkhill dam reservoir in this investigation agricultural practices were assumed to have the greatest groundwater contamination potential the simple scenario which features a single cropland category was intended to capture a worst case condition of possible nutrient leaching for the complex i scenario rating values are varied according to crop rotation category as discussed previously crop rotation a is assumed to have the greatest nutrient leaching potential and is therefore given the highest rating followed by crop rotation b c and d ratings for agricultural land within the complex ii scenario were reduced relative to complex i where tile drainage is present for a given crop rotation the rating amount in excess of crop rotation d which is assumed to be never tiled was decreased by 50 for example the rating of crop rotation a 8 exceeds crop rotation d 5 by a value of 3 a 50 reduction of this excess results in a rating value of 6 5 for the case where crop rotation a land is also tiled nutrient losses through tiles to surface water features are more commonly examined in the literature e g kokulan et al 2019 michaud et al 2019 than nutrient persistence below tiles therefore the appropriateness of this rating reduction is difficult to assess nonetheless the proposed rating scale is based on the general idea that while tile drainage intercepts percolating water substantial amounts of nutrients may still leach through the root zone below tile drains e g cambardella et al 1999 mehnert et al 2007 nila rekha et al 2011 consequently groundwater contamination risk is reduced but not completely eliminated where tile drains are present 2 4 1 2 land change modeller the terrset land change modeler lcm eastman 2016 was used to predict future land use conditions in the upper parkhill watershed application of this tool which has been used successfully in a number of previous studies e g mas et al 2014 reddy et al 2017 hamad et al 2018 tiné et al 2019 involved three major tasks analysis of past land use change modelling the potential for land transitions and predicting the course of change into the future in this manner historical change from time 1 to time 2 is used to project future scenarios this assumes that previous rates of change will remain constant in the simulated future period using the aafc map series discussed previously the 1990 and 2000 maps were used for time 1 and time 2 respectively while the 2010 map was used for model validation change analysis of the historic maps was used to identify transitions from one land use to another these changes were identified based on a threshold size of change ignored transitions less than 10 ha from this analysis six transitions were identified including transitions from settlement roads and forest to cropland and vice versa for the purposes of this assessment transitions from roads to cropland cropland to roads and settlement to cropland were ignored these transitions are believed to be attributed to classification error in the time 1 and 2 land use maps transition potential maps i e suitability maps were created taking into consideration a specified set of driver variables driving variables within the lcm may be either static or dynamic static variables describe aspects of basic suitability for the transition under consideration and are unchanging over time while dynamic variables are time dependent and are recalculated over the course of a prediction eastman 2016 transition potentials were calculated using a multi layer perceptron neural network the model is trained and tested through the extraction of samples from the two land cover maps of areas that underwent the transitions being modelled as well as areas that were eligible to change but did not eastman 2016 this process also examines the sensitivity of the model to the driving variables to identify which variables have the greatest effect on model skill eastman 2016 table 3 summarizes the driving variables included in this exercise transitions were predicted with an accuracy rate ranging from approximately 84 95 ultimately four driving variables were used to explain the modelled transitions several other static environmental driving variables were examined e g elevation slope proximity to streams but were found to have a negligible impact on the prediction quality once calibrated the lcm uses the markov chain prediction process to calculate transition probabilities eastman 2016 this process determines how much land would be expected to transition from the later date i e 2000 to a specified prediction date based on a projection of the transition potentials into the future eastman 2016 future scenario predictions were further constrained through the incorporation of zoning bylaw maps for the upper parkhill watershed municipality of north middlesex 2018 muncipality of south huron and county of huron planning and development department 2020 transitions to cropland were permitted in areas presently zoned for agricultural activity e g general agriculture restricted agriculture and agricultural small holdings transitions to forest were permitted in areas presently zoned for general and restricted agriculture natural environment environmental protection zones as well as parks and recreation areas transitions to settlement were permitted in areas zoned for general and small holding agricultural areas commercial activity community facilities future development residential zones and industrial zones the lcm model was used to produce both hard and soft predictions for 2010 land use whereby a hard prediction represents a commitment to a specific scenario while the soft prediction represents a continuous surface of vulnerability to change eastman 2016 the quality of the lcm prediction was assessed through a comparison of modelled 2010 land use to observed land use conditions at this time the lcm validation process identifies hits model predicted land use change and change occurred misses model predicted land use persistence and it changed and false alarms model predicted land use change and it persisted a comparison of the number of false alarms relative to the number of hits i e to evaluate the quality of areas that the model indicated would change revealed a success rate of approximately 43 while this indicates room for improvement it is important to remember that the examined scenario represents one hard prediction from many equally plausible scenarios if more eligible locations for change exist than the actual amount of change it will be difficult to obtain an accurate hard prediction to better evaluate the quality of the lcm prediction the roc statistic i e area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was calculated this metric determines how well the continuous soft prediction surface predicts the locations of change relative to a boolean image of all actual changes a roc value of 1 indicates that there is perfect spatial agreement between the reference image and suitability map for this analysis a roc value of 0 84 was obtained which is considered an excellent level of discrimination hosmer and lemeshow 2005 the calibrated and validated lcm was used to generate a prediction of 2050 land use simple within the upper parkhill watershed fig 5 a this prediction based on the transitions noted in table 3 generated notable changes in cropland 2 and development 41 as shown in table 4 however the simulated transitions correspond to a total of only 3 8 km2 of land change or approximately 3 of the watershed area indicating relatively little change to land use by mid century this perhaps suggests that in rural agricultural regions such as the upper parkhill watershed land use change simulations may not be crucial for assessing future changes in groundwater contamination risk depending on the circumstances and time frame under consideration the municipalities of north middlesex and south huron within which the upper parkhill watershed is located emphasize protection of the existing land base to promote the long term future of agriculture municipality of north middlesex 2014 county of huron planning department 2018 while this appears to have been accomplished in the lcm projection it is recognized that the simulated increase in settlement areas may be an overestimation population projections within north middlesex and south huron which currently extend to 2026 and 2031 respectively indicate minimal growth roughly 2 every 5 years middlesex county 2006 county of huron planning and development department 2015 however in both municipalities existing settlement areas i e towns villages and hamlets are intended to be the focus for future growth in comparison this investigation permitted development around the outer perimeter of agricultural fields i e adjacent to existing road infrastructure to allow for evaluation of more dynamic circumstances 2 4 1 3 future conditions the 2050 simple land use scenario generated from the lcm exercise was expanded upon to develop mid century complex i and complex ii scenarios fig 5b and 5c again assuming present day crop rotations and tile drain coverage in addition to these three scenarios two additional resilient scenarios resilient i and resilient ii were developed to evaluate a possible alternative to the status quo fig 5d and 5e this alternative reflects potential crop rotation modifications that may occur as a result of variable mid century agro climatic conditions increases in extreme high temperatures as well as changes in the amount frequency and intensity of precipitation qian et al 2013 li et al 2018 may result in the need for diversified and more resilient crop rotations to protect crop yield gaudin et al 2015 teixeira et al 2018 bowles et al 2020 to account for this possible adaptation the resilient i scenario features all crop rotation a land converted to crop rotation b representing the transition away from high frequency corn cropping the resilient ii scenario features the incorporation of tile drainage in the same manner as the complex ii scenario 2 4 2 climate this investigation applied an empirical approach to net recharge and water table depth estimation to maintain simplistic and minimal data requirements thereby enabling method application in areas that may be data poor 2 4 2 1 net recharge net recharge represents the amount of water that infiltrates from the ground surface to the water table and therefore plays an important role in the vertical transport of contaminants to groundwater aller et al 1987 it is acknowledged that out of all drastic factors net recharge is often the most difficult value to obtain estimate as a result the ranges for recharge rating set by aller et al 1987 shown in table 1 are intentionally wide to account for this uncertainty in this investigation reference and mid century recharge was approximated using the williams and kissel equations williams and kissel 1991 which were informed by total precipitation data obtained from climatedata ca cannon et al 2015 this canadian climate portal is a collaboration between the pacific climate impacts consortium pcic ouranos inc the prairie climate centre pcc environment and climate change canada eccc centre de recherche informatique de montréal crim and habitat7 the incorporated data is available at a spatial resolution of 300 arcseconds and represents an ensemble of 24 climate models for the rcp8 5 emission scenario this data has been downscaled using the bccaqv2 method developed at the pcic which is a hybrid of bcca maurer et al 2010 and qmap gudmundsson et al 2012 approaches for this investigation an annual time series of 50th percentile total precipitation values was averaged over 1986 2005 and 2040 2059 to generate a representative reference period and mid century year respectively for examination this empirical approach to recharge estimation eqn 2 5 has been applied in a number for previous drastic investigations e g hamza et al 2007 hamza et al 2010 al hallaq and elaish 2012 feumba and ngounou 2014 kumar and krishna 2019 including those with the use of projected precipitation data e g li and merchant 2013 these equations rely on the pre existing classification of hydrologic soil groups this information available from the ontario soil survey complex ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2015 classifies soils according to their saturated infiltration capacity for example soil group a describes soils having a high infiltration rate when wet low runoff potential while soil group d represents soils having a very slow infiltration rate when wet high runoff potential with groups b and c representing intermediate conditions between these two extremes 2 pi p 10 29 2 p 15 43 h y d r o l o g i c s o i l g r o u p a 3 pi p 15 05 2 p 22 57

percolation i e average recharge in inches and p is the average precipitation inches application of this method within the upper parkhill watershed resulted in an average annual recharge change of 25 mm year from the reference period to mid century 2 4 2 2 depth to water table depth to groundwater indicates the thickness of material a potential contaminant may travel through to reach the water table greater depth may indicate longer travel and more opportunity for natural contaminant degradation while water table depth typically fluctuates seasonally e g in accordance with recharge patterns the drastic approach uses a static water table assumed to represent average conditions in this study long term average water table conditions derived from a previous regional groundwater modelling project waterloo hydrogeologic 2007 were used to represent reference conditions changes in water table depth from this reference condition to mid century were estimated using the water table fluctuation method eqn 6 rasmussen and andreasen 1959 6 r t s y δ h t where r is the recharge cm occurring in time t i e difference between reference period and mid century sy is the specific yield of the aquifer and h is the water level rise cm attributed to the recharge period specific yield for aquifer materials in the study area was approximated from literature values morris and johnson 1967 a mean water table change of 0 36 m was predicted based on the examined annual average reference period and mid century conditions 2 5 validation a preliminary drastic aglu cc model was created for the entire abca area for the purposes of model validation drastic model validation is commonly completed through a comparison of index values to observed groundwater quality parameters due to sparse available monitoring records within the upper parkhill watershed a region larger than the intended study area was examined to incorporate a greater number of comparison points in terms of the dynamic watershed factors outlined previously the validated model was informed by 1990 reference period land use conditions simple complex i and complex ii long term average water table conditions simulated in a previous regional modelling investigation waterloo hydrogeologic 2007 and net recharge calculated using an annual average of 1970 2000 daily gridded precipitation data from the nrcan anusplin dataset mckenney et al 2011 given the assumptions of the drastic model contaminants that are generally viewed as conservative are most appropriate for use in model validation in a perfectly performing model areas with a high drastic aglu cc index should align with areas that have high observed values of contamination for this investigation index values from the three generated risk maps i e one for each land use scenario were compared against values of no3 n no2 n from 28 overburden monitoring points measured as part of ontario s ambient groundwater geochemistry program hamilton 2015 fig 6 records from this monitoring program span a multi year period however only those records collected within a single year 2008 were incorporated in this study under certain circumstances nitrate and or nitrite may disobey the definition of conservative nonreactive transport i e through microbial mediated denitrification however numerous past investigations have shown successful application of this groundwater quality parameter in model validation e g sinha et al 2016 hamza et al 2017 noori et al 2018 singha et al 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 furthermore given the dominance of agricultural land use within the study area nitrate and nitrite represent particularly relevant contaminants of concern although nitrate is expected to be the major form of n present based on anticipated redox conditions correlation between observed groundwater quality and drastic aglu cc model results for each land use scenario was assessed using pearson s correlation coefficient pearson 1896 coefficient values may range from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates a perfect negative relationship 0 indicates no relationship and 1 indicates a perfect positive relationship 2 6 sensitivity analysis to determine the influence of the individual parameters used in the drastic aglu cc analysis both single parameter sensitivity and map removal senstivity were examined the former was used to determine the effective weight w e eqn 7 of each input parameter in comparison to the assigned theoretical weight w t eqn 8 this popular metric introduced by napolitano and fabbri 1996 has been used in many past drastic investigations e g babiker et al 2005 sinha et al 2016 hamza et al 2017 huang et al 2017 machiwal et al 2018 noori et al 2018 salek et al 2018 jesiya and gopinath 2019 single parameter sensitivity provides useful insight regarding the effect of factor rating and weighting values 7 w e p r p w r 100 8 w t p w i 1 n p w i 100 where pr and pw are the ratings and weight for parameter p respectively and r is the risk index map removal sensitivity introduced by lodwick et al 1990 identifies the sensitivity associated with removing one or more map layers eqn 9 e g dibi et al 2012 edet 2014 umar kura et al 2015 jesiya and gopinath 2019 kumar and krishna 2019 this measurement focuses on understanding the interdependency of related parameters and may help to identify drastic aglu cc parameters that are essential for inclusion in this study area versus those with little effect 9 s r n r x n 1 where s is the sensitivity associated with the removal of one map parameter x r is the original risk index value computed based on eqn 1 using n map layers and rx is the risk index computed excluding one map layer 2 7 assessment of model predictions to evaluate potential future changes in groundwater contamination risk drastic aglu cc index values calculated for the reference 1986 2005 and mid century 2040 2059 periods were compared for each examined land use scheme statistical differences in mean index values were assessed using a student s t test with α 0 05 a one way anova and tukey s post hoc test were also performed to assess possible differences among reference period and mid century scenarios the aforementioned statistical analyses were completed in python 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation and assessment of land use schemes results of model validation table 5 and fig 7 a reveal a moderate positive correlation between observed groundwater quality and predicted contamination risk for all land use schemes it is also evident that correlations are slightly improved in the complex i and complex ii scenarios relative to the simple scenario this suggests that refinement of land use classifications to incorporate crop rotation and tile drainage data has the potential to improve model performance generated risk index values for the three examined land use configurations were grouped according to the quantile classification scheme proposed by hamza et al 2015 quantile classes of vey low low medium high and very high risk were obtained by dividing the percentage range for each drastic aglu cc map into five equal divisions for example a map with minimum and maximum index values 86 and 256 respectively i e 34 and 100 would have risk intervals spanning 13 by applying a classification scheme of this nature differences in areas of very low to very high groundwater contamination can be more easily quantified vs visual assessment of groundwater contamination risk maps alone as can be observed in fig 7b the percentage of study area identified as having low groundwater contamination risk increases with increasing land use complexity this is unsurprising given the reduced land use rating values applied in the complex i and complex ii scenarios nonetheless these results highlight the importance of crop rotation and tile drainage data inclusion of this supplemental data is believed to better account for spatial differences in land management and associated contamination potential as well as reduce the likelihood for overestimating groundwater contamination risk despite these insightful model validation results it is recognized that in all land use scenarios there is room for model improvement this possibly highlights a disconnect between the drastic aglu cc conceptualization which emphasizes contaminant transport to the water table and monitoring well records the focus on shallow subsurface conditions in this study which ignores potential vertical stratification at depth may inherently limit the ability to obtain optimized validation results 3 2 sensitivity analysis single parameter sensitivity and map removal sensitivity were evaluated for the simple and complex ii scenarios i e the two examined extremes in agricultural class refinement to assess any potential differences in factor sensitivity as a function of land use scheme complexity this analysis was completed using the same extent as that used for validation i e the entire abca area for the sake of consistency in preliminary model evaluation effective weights determined from the single parameter sensitivity analysis generally follow the same trend as the theoretical weights assigned to each factor i e higher for those factors assigned a high theoretical weight and vice versa however it is evident that the effective weights consistently deviate in magnitude from the theoretical weights for all factors in each scenario fig 8 a of notable importance the effective weight exceeds the theoretical weight for depth to water table topography and land use these factors have the top three highest mean rating values indicating the prevalence of study area dominated by conditions associated with a high contamination potential e g shallow water table low slope and agricultural land use effective weight in exceedance of theoretical weight indicates that these parameters have a greater influence on the resulting index values than that which would be inferred from the assigned weights alone with the opposite being true for those factors whose effective weights are less than the theoretical weights it is also evident that effective weights in the simple scenario are less than those in the complex ii scenario for all factors except land use this is believed to be attributed to the lower land use ratings used in the complex ii scenario relative to the simple scenario the completed map removal sensitivity analysis is intended to provide a better understanding of the interdependency of related factors relative to the single parameter sensitivity analysis this analysis indicates that both the simple and complex ii models are most sensitive to the removal of the depth to water table soil media topography and land use and less sensitive to the removal of net recharge aquifer media impact of vadose zone and aquifer hydraulic conductivity fig 8b this highlights that even factors with a low assigned weight e g soil media and topography may have a substantial influence on the model when factor interactions are considered from fig 8b it is also evident that the simple model is more sensitive to the land use factor than the complex ii model similar to that described previously this is likely due to the lower rating values used in the complex ii land use layer these sensitivity analyses provide valuable insight regarding model functioning and emphasize the importance of factors that are commonly assumed static notably the depth to water table and land use conversely the model demonstrates lower relative sensitivity to the remaining dynamic variable net recharge it is possible that in other regions where there is greater variability in net recharge this will not hold true however this suggests that for this study area greater uncertainty in this input factor may be acceptable given a lesser influence on the resulting risk index values 3 3 predicted change in groundwater contamination risk to assess potential changes in mid century groundwater contamination risk relative to the reference period drastic aglu cc index values were compared both qualitatively and statistically between scenario pairs e g simple land use scheme reference period vs simple land use scheme mid century given that the resilient i and resilient ii land use scenarios were explored for the mid century only these scenarios were compared to the complex i and complex ii reference period scenarios respectively while validation showed improved model performance for the complex ii land use representation all scenarios were included in the future analysis to enable a more comprehensive investigation according to the implemented student s t test table 6 the simple complex i and complex ii scenarios revealed a statistically significant increase in mean drastic aglu cc index values relative to their reference period counterpart in contrast the resilient i scenario revealed a statistically significant decrease in mean drastic aglu cc values and the resilient ii scenario showed insignificant change based on the completed one way anova α 0 05 and tukey s post hoc test all scenarios were found to be significantly different from each other both between and within a given time period with the exception of the complex ii reference and resilient ii mid century scenarios differences in mean index values for all examined scenarios regardless of the direction of change are relatively small nevertheless several observations can be made scenarios showing an increase in mean index values i e simple complex i and complex ii differ by similar magnitudes between reference and mid century periods with a slightly greater difference observed for the complex ii scenario the resilient i scenario also exhibits a comparable magnitude of change albeit opposite in direction the boxplots presented in fig 9 highlight a small upward shift in the range of mid century index values relative to the reference period for the simple complex i and complex ii scenarios in contrast to the resilient i scenario which shows an downward shift amongst the mid century scenarios the resilient ii scenario has the lowest mean risk index while the simple scenario has the greatest mean risk index overall these finding suggest that the adoption of resilient crop rotations has the potential to negate changes in future groundwater contamination risk however even if current cropping practices are to persist changes in groundwater contamination risk are likely to be minimal in this region it is also evident that in agricultural regions disregard for tile drainage in the absence of resilient rotations has the potential to underestimate the amount of change in groundwater contamination risk between the reference period and mid century finally scenarios with both crop rotations and tile drainage included complex ii and resilient ii exhibit the lowest overall mid century index values irrespective of the amount of change between reference and mid century periods this further emphasizes the importance of more detailed agricultural land use representation the presented predictions of groundwater contamination risk require a relatively comprehensive understanding of historic and future watershed conditions which despite best efforts may be unknown and or affected by data uncertainty for example the complex scenarios examined in this study rely on the assumption of present day crop rotations throughout the reference and future periods while these assumptions were deemed reasonable given the historical tendency for similar crops to be grown in this region e g statistics canada 1987 and plausible future perpetuity uncertainty still exists along similar lines it is also acknowledged that this study does not account for potential future policy changes that may encourage naturalization and or reforestation of agricultural land nonetheless the complex and associated resilient scenarios provide constructive insight that would be unattainable without some acceptance of the data limitations shortcomings in the implemented lcm approach are also recognized especially pertaining to the relatively short calibration and validation periods used to generate a 2050 prediction this reflects the difficulty in obtaining appropriate land use maps for trend based analysis e g with a consistent classification approach it is recognized that the accuracy of future predictions may improve with longer model training periods however it is believed that the overall approach for land change modelling is still appropriate and applicable for studies of this nature tile drain coverage is also assumed to be constant throughout the examined reference and future periods the majority of drained areas within the upper parkhill watershed lack a recorded year of tile installation through consultation with omafra it is believed that these areas were tiled prior to the mid 1990 s therefore indicating an extensive history of tile drainage within the watershed and validating the use of present day tile coverage for reference conditions ontario ministry of agriculture food and rural affairs 2020a b steiss personal communication october 15 2020 furthermore given the nature of low permeability soils in the region and the fact that 71 of the watershed is presently tiled it is unlikely that these drainage conditions will change substantially in the future therefore while still a potential study limitation it was deemed worthwhile to investigate the utility of tile drainage incorporation 4 conclusion rural regions are commonly reliant on groundwater resources making it increasingly important to understand the contamination risk associated with agricultural activity and potential nutrient leaching this paper illustrates application of a newly proposed drastic aglu cc approach to better understand how groundwater contamination risk may change through time especially under the influence of climate change and assess the impact of land use representation in contrast to existing drastic methodologies this approach emphasizes the incorporation of agricultural land management practices and advocates for the treatment of recharge depth to water table and land use as dynamic factors this has been accomplished through the integration of downscaled global climate model data to empirically estimate water table fluctuation and recharge and trend based land change modelling land use schemes typically used in groundwater contamination risk assessments do not consider unique crop rotations or the presence of subsurface drainage drastic aglu cc validation results presented in this paper suggest that more detailed land use representation has the potential to improve model predictive ability analysis of factor sensitivity for two extremes of agricultural land use representation i e simple vs complex ii indicated variability in factor effective weight and map removal sensitivity notably land use was found to have a greater influence on the calculated risk index values if cropland was represented as a single class sensitivity analysis results also stressed the importance of model factors that are commonly treated as stationary in time especially land use and water table depth this study revealed the potential for predicted future changes in groundwater contamination risk to vary depending on the manner in which land use is represented the methodology implemented for incorporating crop rotations in this study also provides a possible approach for addressing changes in future agricultural land management while it is difficult to know with certainty if and how crop rotations will change in the future due changing climate conditions investigation of possible resilient scenarios has proven to be a meaningful endeavour especially where little guidance currently exists in the literature overall these findings provide valuable insight for the design of future groundwater contamination risk assessments in rural regions despite the useful information that has been provided by this study the implemented approach is not without its shortcomings subjective rating schemes are a limitation inherent to all drastic studies and it is recognized that the ratings used in this study for land use in particular have a direct influence on the observed results equipped with knowledge concerning the potential benefits of improved agricultural land use representation future studies may wish to adjust the proposed rating schemes for example if field based observations of nutrient leaching are available for given crop rotations and or tile drainage conditions future work may also wish to explore the assumptions made surrounding temporal consistency in present day crop rotations and tile drain coverage for example by testing varied spatial arrangements finally it is recognized that future predictions of recharge and subsequent water table estimates may vary depending on the considered climate data nonetheless results from this study provide a possibility of what mid century groundwater contamination risk may look like in the upper parkhill watershed based on the incorporated climate model ensemble it is important to revisit risk analyses as climate model predictions evolve furthermore the implications of these predictions e g changes in irrigation or precipitation intensity and associated recharge patterns should be considered ultimately the methods presented in this paper may be used as a screening tool to better understand the potential for changing shallow subsurface groundwater contamination risk in rural regions this study focuses on southwestern ontario within the great lakes basin however the approach may be easily adapted to other regions of interest it is possible that the importance of agricultural land use representation may differ in other areas depending on the unique combination of drastic aglu cc factors and factor variability study results may be used to guide groundwater monitoring programs i e targeting regions where groundwater contamination risk is expected to change and may also aid private well users when selecting potential sites for drinking water development declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

3866,freshwater lenses fwl underneath islands are often unique freshwater resources constructing cut off walls in coastal islands to increase the fwl size has been proposed and tested effective meanwhile seawater inundation induced by ocean surges on low lying islands can cause the vertical intrusion of saltwater and salinization of fwl constructing cut off walls can influence the post inundation recovery once the fwl is salinized during the inundation this influence has not been investigated and considered when discussing the feasibility of cut off walls in this study we numerically simulated an ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented island constructed with a cut off wall using a coupled surface subsurface approach we varied the aquifer permeability and the depth of the cut off wall the effect of the cut off wall on fwl was quantitatively assessed in terms of fwl volume and flushing time the results show that the cut off wall can significantly increase the volume of fwl confirming previous studies especially when it is constructed in high permeability 10 10 5 m2 islands and deeper in addition the cut off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40 during the inundation therefore the recovery tends to be accelerated in the early stage and in islands of low intermediate permeability however the average recovery in high permeability islands can be slowed down because the cut off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is harder for flushing as a first attempt to assess the feasibility of the cut off wall construction from the perspective of fwl recovery our study is important for the management of freshwater on islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation keywords freshwater lens seawater intrusion cut off wall ocean surge inundation coupled surface subsurface modelling 1 introduction freshwater lenses fwls underneath coastal aquifers and low lying islands such as atolls and artificial islands are often the only freshwater resources for domestic agricultural or industrial purposes however fwls are vulnerable to the threat of seawater intrusion either laterally due to the presence of surrounding higher density seawater or vertically from the surface after an ocean surge inundation or seawater overwash thereby degrading the fresh groundwater resources ocean surges are a global feature and are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change werner et al 2013 ipcc 2014 anthropogenic structures have been frequently proposed to prevent coastal island aquifers from salinization such as constructing a vertically oriented semi impermeable cut off wall in the subsurface parallel to and near the shoreline of an island lu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 these anthropogenic structures can maintain or considerably increase the size of the fwl but it is still unclear whether they can really withstand the effects of a possible surficial ocean surge inundation it is therefore important to understand the response of fwls to the construction of cut off walls under the influence of surficial ocean surge inundation which is the scope of the present study ocean surges lead to seawater overwash if the waves are high enough to wash seawater over protective coastal infrastructures e g dams onto the surface of islands or coastal areas which usually have a few meters elevation above sea level gingerich et al 2017 the overwashed seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and percolates towards the fwl of the island aquifer anderson jr and lauer 2008 giambastiani et al 2007 illangasekare et al 2006 kooi et al 2000 terry and falkland 2010 violette et al 2009 post and houben 2017 yang et al 2013 the infiltration and salinization processes can take up to years even if the inundation only occurs for a few hours yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 natural desalinization occurs by seaward transport of moving freshwater and dilution of saltwater chui and terry 2012 possibly taking up to decades these salt flushing processes have been proved to be significantly affected by the physical characteristics of coastal aquifers such as land topography yu et al 2016 and hydrogeological factors including hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and recharge rates bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 fresh groundwater of islands is recharged through precipitation and forms the less dense fwl floating on top of surrounding denser saltwater fig 1 a the size of a fwl depends on various factors such as island geometry geological and hydrological conditions climate human activities e g pumping and anthropogenic structures bryan et al 2016 dose et al 2014 post and houben 2017 wallace and bailey 2017 lu et al 2019 on low lying islands the fwl may only be a few meters thick gingerich et al 2017 various methods have been proposed to reduce the salinization of the fwl by seawater intrusion some methods were introduced originally for coastal areas which can potentially be applied to islands these methods include creating hydraulic barriers normally by optimizing the pumping strategies saeed et al 2002 saeed et al 2003 or constructing physical barriers hydraulic barriers change the hydraulic equilibrium between the freshwater zone and the saltwater zone either by increasing the pressure of the freshwater zone positive barrier or by reducing the pressure of the saltwater zone negative barrier both measures potentially reduce the landward movement of the seawater freshwater interface mahesha 2001 land et al 2004 park et al 2012 and can significantly upgrade the fwl lu et al 2017 however the hydraulic barriers often require extraction recharge with long term cost of energy or freshwater resources alternatively physical barriers have been proposed and frequently used in field applications such as weirs yang et al 2019 subsurface dams luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a chang et al 2019 and cut off walls sugio et al 1987 luyun et al 2011 kaleris and ziogas 2013 strack et al 2016 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b lu et al 2019 a cut off wall is a vertically oriented structure of low permeability that is embedded in the upper part of a coastal aquifer parallel to the shoreline of an island with an opening at the lower part to allow for groundwater discharge fig 1b a subsurface dam is similar but with an opening upper part a cut off wall creates impermeable or semi permeable zones near the shoreline such that the rise of the inland hydraulic head pushes the saltwater freshwater interface towards the sea a number of studies have reported the positive effect of a cut off wall on controlling seawater intrusion luyun et al 2011 carried out laboratory experiments and numerical simulations indicating that cut off walls deeper and closer to the shoreline have high efficiency abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b examined the performance of a cut off wall in stratified heterogeneous aquifers proving that the cut off wall effectively inhibits seawater intrusion especially for islands lu et al 2019 introduced a semi permeable vertical slice underneath the shoreline of a homogenous island aquifer an analytical solution for calculating the location of the freshwater seawater interface was developed and validated in sand tank experiments sensitivity analyses based on the analytical solution suggested that a low conductivity of the cut off wall can increase the volume of the fwl however these studies focused on the proof of concept and the effects of the cut off wall on lateral saltwater intrusion affecting the shape of the fwl with a constant seaside boundary condition no ocean surge therefore the effect of cut off walls on the quality of a fwl during extreme events such as ocean surges remains unknown constructing cut off walls along a shoreline can potentially increase the overwashed saltwater travel time from the land surface through the fwl and back to the sea lu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 this means that flushing of potential contaminants and of overwashed saltwater can require a long time this issue may become significant when the fwl of the island is salinized during an ocean surge inundation from the island top as a potential effect of the cut off wall the recovery time of the fwl likely increases due to the increase of travel times to date a number of studies have investigated the effect of seawater inundation on this salinization and recovery processes on islands for a 3 hour seawater inundation event on an atoll island in the tropical pacific ocean chui and terry 2012 found that salinization occurred immediately after the surface was inundated and that the recovery of the fwl lasted two months holding and allen 2015 reported for islands of various types that depending on recharge rates the post inundation recovery lasted 1 19 years likewise terry and falkland 2010 and bailey 2015 reported that up to 12 months were required for the recovery of fwls on regarded islands in the south and western pacific ocean gingerich et al 2017 assessed the effect of recharge on post inundation recovery of the fwl of the roi namur island in the central pacific they indicated that temporal variability of recharge was an important factor affecting recovery they also suggested that artificial recharge of freshwater captured during a wet season can significantly shorten the recovery time these studies have focused on the influences of island size and of hydrogeological factors including permeability and recharge rate on post inundation recovery however the influence of cut off walls on the salinization and post inundation recovery of fwls remains to be investigated a cut off wall can potentially lead to a gain of freshwater storage increased water storage in a fwl which can be used later to reduce the recovery time when a seawater inundation occurs it is still necessary to understand how large the gained freshwater volume needs to be and how significant the subsequent change in recovery time is therefore in the present study we use a fully coupled numerical surface subsurface model to represent an island allowing numerically constructing the cut off wall and simulating the dynamic inundation process causing overland flow and saltwater infiltration we consider island aquifers of various permeability and different depths of the cut off wall we investigate the influence of constructing a cut off wall on a fwl of different island scenarios by assessing i the change of the fwl volume and ii the change of post inundation recovery of the fwl results of this study supply guidelines for designing cut off walls for oceanic islands and are potentially important for the management of freshwater resources on islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation 2 methodology 2 1 hydrogeosphere numerically investigating the impact of cut off walls and seawater inundation on the fwl of islands involves simulating density dependent flow and solute transport on the island surface and in the unsaturated saturated island subsurface these processes can be successfully simulated with hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 which is a 3d numerical model that simulates fully coupled surface subsurface flow and solute transport it uses richards equation and darcy s law to simulate variably saturated variable density flow in the subsurface domain including saturated and unsaturated zones and solves manning s equation manning 1891 and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation for flow in the 2d overland domain solute transport is simulated with the advection dispersion diffusion equation in both domains vanderkwaak 1999 the dual node approach therrien et al 2010 is used in hydrogeosphere to numerically couple the surface and subsurface domains this approach assumes the surface and surface domains are separated by a thin layer of porous media between which the water and solute exchange fluxes are implicitly calculated this feature of surface subsurface coupling has made hydrogeosphere a useful tool to investigate seawater intrusion and ocean surge inundation overwash on coastal aquifers and islands werner et al 2013 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 readers may refer to therrien et al 2010 and yang et al 2013 for a full description of the governing equations and the coupled surface subsurface approach 2 2 conceptual model a 2d vertically oriented cross section was selected to represent a typical unconfined island aquifer fig 2 a only half of the aquifer was considered by assuming a symmetric island geometry the model domain has a length of 2500 m and consists of a beach zone and a land zone a constant topographic slope was assumed on the beach zone 0 m x 500 m extending to an elevation of 5 masl in the sea whereas a flat horizontal surface of 2 masl elevation was assumed on the land zone 500 m x 2500 m a horizontal aquifer bottom was considered at the elevation of 30 masl the selected island size low lying topography and aquifer depth are representative for many small islands across the pacific and indian oceans bailey 2015 bailey et al 2009 chui and terry 2012 2013 gingerich et al 2017 spennemann 2006 where seawater inundation is naturally occurring and seawater overwash is frequently reported the subsurface of the cross sectional aquifer was discretized into a 3d mesh of 1500 100 1 15 block elements with unit length in the y direction making the 3d mesh an actual 2d representation the grid has the constant resolution of 25 m in x direction and a variable resolution in z direction from 3 m near the aquifer bottom to 0 15 m near the land surface to better represent the unsaturated zone the 100 2d rectangular element faces on the top surface of the 3d mesh represent the land surface to simulate overland flow during and after an ocean surge 2 2 1 cut off wall a vertically oriented cut off wall was placed parallel to and near the coastline at x 500 m fig 2a the cut off wall was constructed from the land surface to the depth d below land surface this depth d was subject to a sensitivity test described later the cut off wall was numerically represented by assigning a low permeability value 10 14 m2 to those 3d elements that represent the wall tests indicated that decreasing this permeability value had no significant effect on the model results the described implementation of the cut off wall in the 2d cross sectional aquifer assumes that the cut off wall is actually located along the entire length of the coastline meaning that the island is completely surrounded by the cut off wall a uniform isotropic permeability value k described later was assigned to the aquifer other parameters of the subsurface and surface were selected uniformly for the simulated domains according to typical literature values listed in table 1 these other parameters were kept constant for all simulations and are not the focus of this study 2 2 2 ocean surge inundation time variable specific heads h f and time constant seawater concentration were prescribed along the seaside boundary of the subsurface and surface fig 2a the nodal h f values along the vertical seaside boundary were computed based on the sealevel position from the surge height variation curve fig 2b yang et al 2018 the considered ocean surge event lasted for 8 h with a maximum surge height of 3 88 masl yang et al 2015a it induced a complete inundation of the low laying horizontal island surface in this study we neglected the potential effect caused by topography yu et al 2016 such that the amount of infiltrated seawater was only a function of the hydrogeological conditions of the subsurface hydraulic gradient and permeability k the impact of the inundation on the island aquifer was simulated with a constant freshwater recharge of 800 mm year this recharge rate is selected according to holding and allen 2015 where representative recharge rates were reported after survey and literature review of the hydrogeology of small islands across the pacific and indian oceans the recharge eventually leads to recovery after inundation only a single surge event was considered ignoring the possibility that further ocean surge events may occur during the recovery phase 2 3 scenario definition two hydrogeologically relevant parameters were varied to investigate the impact of the cut off wall on the fwl on a given island aquifer permeability k and depth of the cut off wall below land surface d the behavior of freshwater storage under the described island systems can potentially be sensitive to these two parameters we considered a realistic range of permeability k for the aquifer the selected k values 10 13 10 12 5 10 12 10 11 5 10 11 10 10 5 10 10 m2 cover the material permeability from silt to gravel note that other parameter e g porosity α and β remained unchanged even the k varied by up to 3 orders of magnitude the effect of these parameters on the fwl is considered to be negligible comparing with that of k because k is the key parameter determining the general flow pattern and water balances during the ocean surge inundation event for an island with a selected permeability we first considered a scenario in the absence of a cut off wall d 0 m providing the pre construction state without cut off wall for comparative analysis with post construction states with cut off wall then we considered 5 different depths of the cut off wall with d values of 7 12 17 22 27 m respectively with these d values the opening lower part underneath the cut off wall had lengths z direction of 25 20 15 10 and 5 m respectively therefore 42 scenarios were generated combining the selected k and d values especially the scenario with d 0 m and k 10 11 m2 being consistent with yang et al 2018 was selected as the base case we did not consider the extreme case that the cut off wall reaches the aquifer bottom where d 32 m in which there would be no subsurface flowpaths connecting the inland with the sea and all the groundwater would be forced to discharge via land surface for each of the 42 scenarios the simulation of the ocean surge was carried out in two phases 1 the spin up phase where the flow and transport reached an equilibrium under a constant sea level and 2 the phase of the ocean surge where the sea level varied according to the surge height phase 1 provided initial conditions for phase 2 both phases must be simulated for a sufficiently long time using transient simulations until an equilibrium was reached for phase 1 and until complete recovery from the ocean surge event was reached for phase 2 2 4 assessment indicators 2 4 1 fwl volume the main function of a cut off wall is to increase the volume of stored freshwater in the fwl we used the threshold concentration of 0 68 g l 1 which is 2 seawater concentration michael et al 2013 as the critical concentration above which the water is regarded as salinized the fwl volume is defined here as the summed volume of those aquifer parts where the salt concentration is below 0 68 g l 1 2 4 2 flushing time existing salinization of an aquifer by natural seawater intrusion prior to an ocean surge is exacerbated by additional salinization induced by the ocean surge after the surge this additionally salinized aquifer undergoes a recovery to initial state due to i seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow and 2 dilution by fresh groundwater through flow and recharge for a specific point in the salinized aquifer the term recovery is defined here as the situation where the salt concentration at that point has dropped below 0 68 g l 1 we were not looking at true recovery to initial pre storm salt concentrations because that situation can only be reached asymptotically following yu et al 2016 we used the concept of flushing time ft to quantify the recovery speed the ft for a specific point in the aquifer is defined as the duration from the start of the ocean surge inundation to the recovery at that point therefore ft is a spatially distributed variable but a ft value does not exist at points that were either always or never salinized counting the incidences of ft in the aquifer volume fraction associated to each possible ft value allowed to generate a flushing time pdf probability density function the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles ft 25 ft 50 ft 75 of the flushing time pdf were extracted to quantify early recovery time average recovery time and late recovery time respectively the above described indicators will change by constructing a cut off wall these changes can be quantified by computing the relative changes of these indicators to the pre construction state no wall using 1 δ f w l v o l u m e f w l v o l u m e f w l v o l u m e n o w a l l 1 2 δ f t 25 50 75 f t 25 50 75 f t 25 50 75 n o w a l l 1 in some extreme cases these indicators should be interpreted with caution for example in the scenario with high permeability and in the absence of the cut off wall the aquifer can be completely salinized in that case the fwl volume as well as the flushing time do not exist and these indicators are not valid 3 results for all the scenarios the simulation period was 100 years for both the spin up phase and the ocean surge phase ensuring equilibrium of the fwl and recovery of the fwl respectively and the maximum cpu time of each simulation was about 5 h the response of the aquifer to cut off wall construction and ocean surge inundation depends on the parameter values of each simulation scenario fig 3 shows the salt distribution at different times after the ocean surge inundation results at t 0 left column are at the onset of the surge such that these results can be viewed as the steady state fwl in the absence of a surge those simulations demonstrate how the steady state fwl without surge reacts to construction of a cut off wall without the cut off wall no 1 11 21 subsurficial seawater intrusion and thus the spatial distribution of fwl depend on island permeability clearly the fwl volume decreases with increasing aquifer permeability this is because landward movement of the subsurficial saltwater freshwater interface increases with increasing permeability according to darcy s law the fwl of the base case fig 3 no 11 reaches the aquifer bottom and does not show the classic shape of floating freshwater over saltwater due to the relatively low aquifer permeability with the cut off wall of d 22 m numbers 6 16 26 the shape of the fwl is practically independent of aquifer permeability this is because the cut off wall of d 22 m hydraulically separates the island zone from the sea zone even for high permeability for t 0 fig 3 no 1 5 11 15 21 25 demonstrates the transient effect of the storm surge inundation on the spatial salt distribution for islands of varying permeability in the absence of a cut off wall for all permeability values the salt concentration in the island aquifer is large at early time after the surge and continuously decreases to return to the initial state shown in the left column no 1 11 21 the presence of a cut off wall in these three transient systems does not qualitatively change the evolution of the salt plume from high concentrations after the surge to the initial state after some time however the presence of a cut off wall overall reduces the amount of salt in the island aquifer compared to the corresponding cases without a wall this difference is larger for islands of high permeability while the impact of the wall is not apparent for islands of low permeability for high k islands the amount of salt in the aquifer without a wall is much greater than that in the aquifer with a wall this is because the initial state is significantly different where the presence of a wall practically removes all the salt in the island aquifer at t 0 for all permeability values 3 1 response of the fwl volume the simulated steady state fwl volume in response to various cut off wall depths d and island permeability k are plotted in fig 4 fig 4a shows that the minimum fwl volume 0 09 106 m3 was found in the aquifer with the highest k and in the absence of a cut off wall where the island is almost fully salinized in contrast the maximum fwl volume 1 67 106 m3 was found in the aquifer with the lowest k and longest cut off wall depth d relative changes of the fwl volume compared with pre construction states without the wall fig 4b show that in most scenarios the cut off wall increases the fwl volume by 10 factor 0 1 however constructing a cut off wall of a large depth d in island aquifers with a high k increases the fwl volume by up to 1500 factor 15 the fwl volume with d 22 m generally decreases with increasing permeability regardless whether a cut off wall is placed or not fig 4c to explain this trend the mean groundwater levels were computed by averaging the groundwater levels over the land zone fig 4d results suggest that larger k causes lower inland groundwater level this can promote subsurficial seawater intrusion according to ghyben herzberg formula bear 1972 in which the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface linearly increases with the inland groundwater level comparing the post construction states with pre construction states fig 4c the increasing effect of a cut off wall on the fwl volume is significant when the k value is 10 12 m2 and is most pronounced for the highest k the inland groundwater water level can be significantly elevated by constructing a cut off wall fig 4d the increase of the fwl volume after constructing a cut off wall has two reasons i the elevated inland groundwater level results in seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow thereby increasing the fwl volume compare fig 3 no 21 with fig 3 no 26 and ii as the inland groundwater level rises the void pores of the unsaturated zone are filled with freshwater for example constructing a wall with d 22 m on an island with k 10 11 m2 causes 0 19 106 m3 increase of the fwl about 10 of which was obtained by rising the groundwater level based on the performance of the cut off wall on islands of different k three island groups can be identified i the low permeability islands with k 10 12 m2 for this island group the groundwater flow is predominantly controlled by the low permeability before the cutoff wall construction the inland groundwater level is already high with the fwl having the maximum size fig 4c d therefore constructing a cut off wall has almost no effect on the fwl volume ii the intermediate permeability islands where the k value ranges between 10 12 and 10 10 5 m2 for this island group both the fwl volume and the inland groundwater level are sensitive to k regardless whether the cut off wall is present or not constructing a cut off wall significantly increases the fwl volume iii the high permeability islands with k 10 10 5 m2 for that island group the inland groundwater level is low prior to constructing the cut off wall and the fwl volume has a minimum size in that case constructing a cut off wall has the most significant effect on increasing the fwl volume once the cut off wall is constructed the groundwater flow system is more likely to be controlled by the wall evidenced by the stable mean groundwater level in these high permeability islands fig 4d the increasing effect of a cut off wall on the fwl volume is more pronounced when the wall depth d is large however this is only valid for islands of intermediate and high k where the effect of increasing fwl volume is apparent clearly the cut off wall has the ability to prevent the lateral seawater intrusion in the subsurface which increases the fwl volume this finding from our numerical simulations confirms previous results by luyun et al 2009 lu et al 2019 and abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b who used analytical solutions numerical simulations and sand tank experiments respectively 3 2 response of the flushing time ocean surge simulations reveal how fast the fwl recovers from the surge inundation in the numerical simulations carried out here the water fluxes across the shoreline on the land surface x 500 m are used to compute the amount of seawater that has surficially entered the island as a consequence of the surge for the base case the ocean surge delivered 190 cm seawater volume divided by the island surface area of seawater to the land during the surge 0 t 4 4 hr fig 5 155 cm of that amount flows back to the ocean within 24 h after the onset of the surge the remaining 35 cm of seawater infiltrated into the subsurface other studies have shown that the topography type has a significant influence on the amount of infiltrating seawater for example land surfaces with depressions promote infiltration while a seaward land slope promotes seaward flow yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 by using a flat topography a given magnitude of the ocean surge and using unchanged boundary conditions for our simulations the amount of infiltrated seawater is only a function of the hydrogeological conditions in the subsurface i e hydraulic gradient and permeability k post surge infiltration of seawater leads to the development of a salt plume which impacts the fwl in the base case a salt plume has developed one month after the surge near the aquifer top fig 3 no 12 thereby salinizing an increased volume of the aquifer as the salt plume is moving downward its size is continuously reduced by natural remediation due to seaward groundwater flow and dilution by recharged freshwater fig 3 no 13 14 15 the recovery of the fwl to the initial state takes 10 years after the onset of the ocean surge the simulated pattern of salt plume development is similar to many previous studies of coastal aquifers or islands yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 holding and allen 2015 fig 6 illustrates the spatial flushing time distribution for various cases along with the salinized regions and associated recovery times note that fig 6 does not represent the actual salt plume fig 6a shows that the flushing time increases from 1 year near the top center of the island to 15 years near the shore of the pre inundation fwl this indicates that the fwl recovers from center to shore and from top to bottom the computed pdf of the flushing time suggests that 2 6 3 6 and 5 2 years are required to recover 25 50 and 75 respectively of the salinized region caused by seawater inundation fig 6a similar recovery times have been reported in previous studies ranging from 1 year to 20 years terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 our simulated recovery time is within that range however detailed comparison to previous studies is not possible because of differing boundary conditions e g recharge rate and aquifer properties here we focus on the change of the recovery speed by constructing the cut off wall constructing a cut off wall changes the recovery of the fwl described by a changed spatial flushing time distribution a cut off wall extends the salinized region that needs to be flushed further seaward compared to the pre construction state compare fig 6b with 6a and compare 6d with 6c also a higher flushing time region is formed behind the cut off wall landside indicating that salinization can prevail behind the wall during significantly longer times fig 6b the characteristic values ft 25 ft 50 and ft 75 and their relative changes to pre construction states δft 25 δft 50 and δft 75 were computed for all scenarios to quantitatively evaluate changes in fwl recovery after placing a cut off wall fig 7 the simulated mean flushing time ft50 ranges from 2 5 to 8 years and it generally decreases with increasing k fig 7c flushing low k islands is relatively fast during early times fig 7a but slower during later times fig 7e salt can persist in low k islands with a very long time once the aquifer was salinized during ocean surge the responses of flushing times to the construction of cut off wall vary for different d and k values and for different stages negative or positive relative change δft 25 δft 50 and δft 75 indicates that flushing speeds up or slows down after placing a cut off wall for the early stage of recovery fig 8 b flushing in most cases speeds up while it moderately slows down in some cases 0 δft 25 10 significant slowing down δft 50 75 10 becomes more frequent when recovery transitions into median fig 7d and late stages fig 7f these results suggest that the cut off wall tends to speed up the early stage flushing widely blue markers fig 7b however it tends to slow down late stage flushing widely red markers fig 7f note that this observation only indicates a generally high possibility for such effects to be caused by constructing a cut off wall rather being conclusive for each specific scenario δft 50 represents the average performance of a cut off wall on flushing and it shows a k dependent pattern fig 8 plots the simulated ft 50 δft50 and infiltrated seawater amount versus the aquifer permeability for pre construction states no wall and post construction states cut off wall of 22 m depth the cut off wall tends to speed up flushing in low and intermediate k islands k 10 10 5 m2 thereby reducing the ft 50 by up to 50 relative to pre construction fig 8a b this result corresponds to the development of the salt plume fig 3a b where the salinized regions caused by seawater inundation vanish faster when a cut off wall is present this suggests that the vertical seawater intrusion during an ocean surge is likely to be weakened by a cut off wall simulation results suggest that the amount of infiltrated seawater was reduced up to 40 after constructing the cut off wall fig 8c this is because the elevated inland groundwater level by cut off walls reduce the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient preventing seawater infiltration into aquifer from the land surface this reduction of infiltrated seawater by a cut off wall leads to speeding up of fwl recovery for high k islands k 10 10 5 m2 the cut off wall tends to slow down flushing indicated by higher ft 50 relative to pre construction state fig 8a b even though the cut off wall reduced the infiltrated seawater amount during inundation explaining this pattern requires a closer look at the spatial distribution of salt plumes and flushing time in the high k aquifer prior to placing the cut off wall the aquifer was almost completely salinized before ocean surge fig 3 no 21 the fwl is situated close to the land surface after placing a cut off wall a large fwl volume was reclaimed extending the fwl significantly deeper and seaward fig 3 no 26 the sharp change in the spatial distribution of fwl changes the recovery speed once the fwl is salinized during an ocean surge the pre construction fwl can recover faster because it is closer to the land surface where the fresh groundwater recharge begins fig 6c while the complete recovery of the post construction fwl is slower fig 6d in conclusion the slowing down of fwl recovery by a cut off wall in high k islands is attributed to that the reclaimed fwl was significantly harder to recover this slowing down effect dominates over the speeding up effect caused by reduced seawater infiltration 4 discussion 4 1 effects on freshwater storage the function of cut off wall to reduce seawater intrusion from the subsurface has been examined and proved in previous study using laboratory experiments luyun et al 2009 analytical solution lu et al 2019 and numerical simulations abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b lu et al 2019 our study for a cross sectional aquifer has consistent results with previous studies additionally the present study has gone beyond previous studies by investigating the cut off wall effect in island scale aquifers where the saltwater freshwater mixing is significantly stronger than that in lab scale aquifers with thin freshwater saltwater interfaces it should be noted that we did not consider the time scale within which the increase can be fully realized after the construction luyun et al 2009 reported a cleanup process after placing the wall the toe of the saltwater wedge initially advances and then gradually retreats from the aquifer behind the wall the speed of that cleanup process was a function of the wall depth and aquifer heterogeneity abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a zheng et al 2021 showed that the cleanup process for their subsurface dam may take up to 50 years depending on the height and position of the dam therefore the fwl volume and flushing time of this study were estimated under the assumption that the new salt equilibrium after the cut off wall construction was completely reached in this sense the discussed increase of fwl volume was a maximum potential for a cut off wall to induce and the flushing time referred to the recovery to this maximum potential 4 2 effects on recovery giving that a cut off wall can significantly increase the travel time of groundwater lu et al 2019 our intuition was that a cut off wall could slow down the recovery once the fwl was salinized during seawater inundation however our study suggested that the recovery tends to speed up in the early stage for shallow and more landward aquifer region but to slow down in the late stage for deeper and more seaward aquifer region the main explanation for such behavior was that under the same seawater inundation event the cut off wall can reduce the amount of infiltrated seawater by up to 40 in this sense the cut off wall can not only prevent lateral seawater intrusion from the subsurface but also prevent the vertical seawater intrusion from the island surface during a seawater inundation event our study quantified the average recovery speed using a medium flushing time ft50 suggesting that a cut off wall can generally speed up at least not slow down the recovery in low intermediate permeability islands but slow down the recovery in high permeability islands as the cut off wall generated significant larger and deeper space that is even harder for flushing these phenomena have not been reported before it should be noted that these conclusions are made based on that we considered the salt from ocean as the only contaminant causing damage to the fwl the speed up of flushing by a cut off wall was accomplished via reducing the salt mass load in aquifers during a certain ocean surge event rather than really speeding up the travel time when considering other sources of contaminants e g contaminants from human activity and nitrate sun et al 2019 the recovery of the fwl from contamination may still inhabited by cut off walls requiring further investigation 4 3 feasibility of constructing cut off wall previous studies mostly focused only on the function of cut off walls to increase freshwater storage in coastal aquifers ignoring their effect on the recovery of the freshwater from salinization by extreme events the feasibility of constructing cut off walls requires an integrated consideration of both the freshwater storage and the recovery speed especially for these low lying islands where seawater overtopping was frequently reported gingerich et al 2017 terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 our study suggested that i for low permeability islands k 10 12 m2 constructing cut off walls cannot increase the freshwater storage as the freshwater storage is already large but it can speed up recovery in this sense the construction is not encouraged ii for intermediate permeability islands k range 10 12 10 10 5 m2 constructing cut off walls reclaims a considerable large volume of freshwater storage and also tends to speed up recovery the construction is therefore encouraged iii for high permeability islands k 10 10 5 m2 constructing cut off walls has a high possibility to slows down the average recovery however it increases the freshwater storage from almost zero to a significantly large volume in this sense the construction requires special caution 4 4 limitations and outlook cross comparisons between scenarios with different aquifer permeability and cut off wall depth provides insights into the sensitivity of fwl size and recovery time to these factors however the scope of this study is limited because it neglects other factors that may have important impact on the function of cut off walls and flushing processes we neglected aquifer heterogeneity which has been shown to significantly affect the flow paths and velocities near the saltwater wedge lu et al 2013 simmons et al 2001 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b and to affect the migration of the salt plumes developed from aquifer top during seawater inundation vithanage et al 2012 yang et al 2015b preferential groundwater flow pathways such as macropores and fractures sebben et al 2015 would very likely to change the cut off wall efficiency and cause more rapid flushing we considered only a simplified island with horizontal topography and constant climate variations of these factors have been proved to change the seawater intrusion from subsurface hanson and nilsson 1986 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and from surface yu et al 2016 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 for example the hydraulic gradient influenced by recharge rate on islands can affect the function of subsurface barriers chang et al 2019 and the recovery time in coastal aquifer holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 the hydro geologic patterns in real field applications can be more complex our study provides nonetheless for the first time a perspective of the recovery processes from extreme climate events in the assessment of cut off wall construction these limitations discussed above need to be explored in further research while the numerical model provides general trends it should be pointed out that there are some limitations in the numerical implementation firstly the selecting of dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the computed fwl size and the flushing time yang et al 2018 due to the twofold effect i for the saltwater wedge the width of transition zone between saltwater and freshwater can vary with dispersivity ii for the salt plume developed from aquifer top the dilution effect can be reduced as the dispersive transport of salt becomes weaker secondly defining the salinization with a criteria concentration can lead to discontinuity of the spatially flushing time distribution as one cell can be suddenly counted as salinized fresh when its concentration passes that criteria this basically introduced an uncertain feature behind the algorithm of the characteristic flushing times ft25 ft50 ft75 because their values can be dominated by flushing time of specific cells we believed that this uncertain feature explains the non smooth pattern for the computed ft50 e g curves in fig 8a lastly we used a 2d representation for the island aquifer which assumes that groundwater flows only longitudinally along the 2d slice this 2d representation simplifies the radial flow pattern and ignores potential alongshore flow that may occur in a real world island with irregular island geometry sea boundary and hydro geologic conditions subsequently the fwl size may be overestimated or underestimated additionally the salt fingering process differs between 2d and 3d representations knorr et al 2016 influencing the estimated flushing time while these limitations in the numerical implementation did not alter the general trends found in this study they may need more careful assessment with regard to the accuracy of the computed fwl size and the flushing time in further research using a 3d representation for the island aquifer 5 summary and conclusions the function of cut off walls to increase freshwater storage in coastal aquifers has been widely tested and proved however for low lying islands where seawater inundation induced by ocean surge can occur constructing cut off walls can influence the recovery speed once the aquifer is salinized during the inundation investigation to this influence was still missing when discussing the feasibility of cut off walls in this study we numerically simulated the ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented island constructed with a cut off wall we considered various aquifer permeability and depths of cut off wall the effect of cut off wall on freshwater storage and post inundation recovery was assessed in terms of fwl volume and flushing time the main key conclusions are 1 constructing a cut off wall in island increases the volume of fwl by preventing the lateral seawater intrusion from the subsurface confirming previous studies the largest increase was accomplished in high permeability islands with k 10 10 5 m2 while almost zero increase for low permeability islands with k 10 12 m2 deeper cut off walls tend to have more pronounced effect in increasing the fwl volume 2 constructing a cut off wall can reduce the amount of infiltrated seawater by up to 40 during a seawater inundation event in this sense the cut off wall can also prevent the vertical seawater intrusion from the island surface the cut off wall tends to speed up the post inundation recovery in the early stage but to slow down in the late stage considering the island permeability the cut off wall tends to speed up the average recovery in low intermediate permeability islands but to slow down in high permeability islands as the cut off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is even harder for flushing 3 considering both the increase of freshwater storage and the recovery speed the feasibility of constructing a cut off wall may significantly depend on the island permeability generally constructing a cut off wall i is not recommended on low permeability islands as the freshwater storage is already large ii is encouraged on intermediate permeability islands as the cut off wall increases freshwater storage and also tends to speed up recovery and iii requires special caution on high permeability islands because the cut off wall has a high possibility to slows down the average recovery however it increases the freshwater storage from almost zero to a significantly large volume overall this study improves the understanding of the impact of cut off walls on controlling seawater intrusion this study provides a new perspective to assess the feasibility of constructing a cut off wall through fully coupled numerical modeling given that the intensity of extreme events such as ocean surge is expected to increase due to climate change the key findings are extremely useful for designing the cut off wall and for the management of freshwater on oceanic islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation as certain assumptions and limitations imposed future work on the effects of cut off wall should consider the combined impacts of other factors including heterogeneity topography and climate e g recharges under

3866,freshwater lenses fwl underneath islands are often unique freshwater resources constructing cut off walls in coastal islands to increase the fwl size has been proposed and tested effective meanwhile seawater inundation induced by ocean surges on low lying islands can cause the vertical intrusion of saltwater and salinization of fwl constructing cut off walls can influence the post inundation recovery once the fwl is salinized during the inundation this influence has not been investigated and considered when discussing the feasibility of cut off walls in this study we numerically simulated an ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented island constructed with a cut off wall using a coupled surface subsurface approach we varied the aquifer permeability and the depth of the cut off wall the effect of the cut off wall on fwl was quantitatively assessed in terms of fwl volume and flushing time the results show that the cut off wall can significantly increase the volume of fwl confirming previous studies especially when it is constructed in high permeability 10 10 5 m2 islands and deeper in addition the cut off wall can significantly reduce seawater infiltration by up to 40 during the inundation therefore the recovery tends to be accelerated in the early stage and in islands of low intermediate permeability however the average recovery in high permeability islands can be slowed down because the cut off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is harder for flushing as a first attempt to assess the feasibility of the cut off wall construction from the perspective of fwl recovery our study is important for the management of freshwater on islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation keywords freshwater lens seawater intrusion cut off wall ocean surge inundation coupled surface subsurface modelling 1 introduction freshwater lenses fwls underneath coastal aquifers and low lying islands such as atolls and artificial islands are often the only freshwater resources for domestic agricultural or industrial purposes however fwls are vulnerable to the threat of seawater intrusion either laterally due to the presence of surrounding higher density seawater or vertically from the surface after an ocean surge inundation or seawater overwash thereby degrading the fresh groundwater resources ocean surges are a global feature and are expected to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change werner et al 2013 ipcc 2014 anthropogenic structures have been frequently proposed to prevent coastal island aquifers from salinization such as constructing a vertically oriented semi impermeable cut off wall in the subsurface parallel to and near the shoreline of an island lu et al 2019 yang et al 2019 these anthropogenic structures can maintain or considerably increase the size of the fwl but it is still unclear whether they can really withstand the effects of a possible surficial ocean surge inundation it is therefore important to understand the response of fwls to the construction of cut off walls under the influence of surficial ocean surge inundation which is the scope of the present study ocean surges lead to seawater overwash if the waves are high enough to wash seawater over protective coastal infrastructures e g dams onto the surface of islands or coastal areas which usually have a few meters elevation above sea level gingerich et al 2017 the overwashed seawater infiltrates into the subsurface and percolates towards the fwl of the island aquifer anderson jr and lauer 2008 giambastiani et al 2007 illangasekare et al 2006 kooi et al 2000 terry and falkland 2010 violette et al 2009 post and houben 2017 yang et al 2013 the infiltration and salinization processes can take up to years even if the inundation only occurs for a few hours yang et al 2018 yu et al 2016 natural desalinization occurs by seaward transport of moving freshwater and dilution of saltwater chui and terry 2012 possibly taking up to decades these salt flushing processes have been proved to be significantly affected by the physical characteristics of coastal aquifers such as land topography yu et al 2016 and hydrogeological factors including hydraulic conductivity hydraulic gradient and recharge rates bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 fresh groundwater of islands is recharged through precipitation and forms the less dense fwl floating on top of surrounding denser saltwater fig 1 a the size of a fwl depends on various factors such as island geometry geological and hydrological conditions climate human activities e g pumping and anthropogenic structures bryan et al 2016 dose et al 2014 post and houben 2017 wallace and bailey 2017 lu et al 2019 on low lying islands the fwl may only be a few meters thick gingerich et al 2017 various methods have been proposed to reduce the salinization of the fwl by seawater intrusion some methods were introduced originally for coastal areas which can potentially be applied to islands these methods include creating hydraulic barriers normally by optimizing the pumping strategies saeed et al 2002 saeed et al 2003 or constructing physical barriers hydraulic barriers change the hydraulic equilibrium between the freshwater zone and the saltwater zone either by increasing the pressure of the freshwater zone positive barrier or by reducing the pressure of the saltwater zone negative barrier both measures potentially reduce the landward movement of the seawater freshwater interface mahesha 2001 land et al 2004 park et al 2012 and can significantly upgrade the fwl lu et al 2017 however the hydraulic barriers often require extraction recharge with long term cost of energy or freshwater resources alternatively physical barriers have been proposed and frequently used in field applications such as weirs yang et al 2019 subsurface dams luyun et al 2009 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a chang et al 2019 and cut off walls sugio et al 1987 luyun et al 2011 kaleris and ziogas 2013 strack et al 2016 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b lu et al 2019 a cut off wall is a vertically oriented structure of low permeability that is embedded in the upper part of a coastal aquifer parallel to the shoreline of an island with an opening at the lower part to allow for groundwater discharge fig 1b a subsurface dam is similar but with an opening upper part a cut off wall creates impermeable or semi permeable zones near the shoreline such that the rise of the inland hydraulic head pushes the saltwater freshwater interface towards the sea a number of studies have reported the positive effect of a cut off wall on controlling seawater intrusion luyun et al 2011 carried out laboratory experiments and numerical simulations indicating that cut off walls deeper and closer to the shoreline have high efficiency abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b examined the performance of a cut off wall in stratified heterogeneous aquifers proving that the cut off wall effectively inhibits seawater intrusion especially for islands lu et al 2019 introduced a semi permeable vertical slice underneath the shoreline of a homogenous island aquifer an analytical solution for calculating the location of the freshwater seawater interface was developed and validated in sand tank experiments sensitivity analyses based on the analytical solution suggested that a low conductivity of the cut off wall can increase the volume of the fwl however these studies focused on the proof of concept and the effects of the cut off wall on lateral saltwater intrusion affecting the shape of the fwl with a constant seaside boundary condition no ocean surge therefore the effect of cut off walls on the quality of a fwl during extreme events such as ocean surges remains unknown constructing cut off walls along a shoreline can potentially increase the overwashed saltwater travel time from the land surface through the fwl and back to the sea lu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 this means that flushing of potential contaminants and of overwashed saltwater can require a long time this issue may become significant when the fwl of the island is salinized during an ocean surge inundation from the island top as a potential effect of the cut off wall the recovery time of the fwl likely increases due to the increase of travel times to date a number of studies have investigated the effect of seawater inundation on this salinization and recovery processes on islands for a 3 hour seawater inundation event on an atoll island in the tropical pacific ocean chui and terry 2012 found that salinization occurred immediately after the surface was inundated and that the recovery of the fwl lasted two months holding and allen 2015 reported for islands of various types that depending on recharge rates the post inundation recovery lasted 1 19 years likewise terry and falkland 2010 and bailey 2015 reported that up to 12 months were required for the recovery of fwls on regarded islands in the south and western pacific ocean gingerich et al 2017 assessed the effect of recharge on post inundation recovery of the fwl of the roi namur island in the central pacific they indicated that temporal variability of recharge was an important factor affecting recovery they also suggested that artificial recharge of freshwater captured during a wet season can significantly shorten the recovery time these studies have focused on the influences of island size and of hydrogeological factors including permeability and recharge rate on post inundation recovery however the influence of cut off walls on the salinization and post inundation recovery of fwls remains to be investigated a cut off wall can potentially lead to a gain of freshwater storage increased water storage in a fwl which can be used later to reduce the recovery time when a seawater inundation occurs it is still necessary to understand how large the gained freshwater volume needs to be and how significant the subsequent change in recovery time is therefore in the present study we use a fully coupled numerical surface subsurface model to represent an island allowing numerically constructing the cut off wall and simulating the dynamic inundation process causing overland flow and saltwater infiltration we consider island aquifers of various permeability and different depths of the cut off wall we investigate the influence of constructing a cut off wall on a fwl of different island scenarios by assessing i the change of the fwl volume and ii the change of post inundation recovery of the fwl results of this study supply guidelines for designing cut off walls for oceanic islands and are potentially important for the management of freshwater resources on islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation 2 methodology 2 1 hydrogeosphere numerically investigating the impact of cut off walls and seawater inundation on the fwl of islands involves simulating density dependent flow and solute transport on the island surface and in the unsaturated saturated island subsurface these processes can be successfully simulated with hydrogeosphere therrien et al 2010 which is a 3d numerical model that simulates fully coupled surface subsurface flow and solute transport it uses richards equation and darcy s law to simulate variably saturated variable density flow in the subsurface domain including saturated and unsaturated zones and solves manning s equation manning 1891 and the diffusive wave approximation of the st venant equation for flow in the 2d overland domain solute transport is simulated with the advection dispersion diffusion equation in both domains vanderkwaak 1999 the dual node approach therrien et al 2010 is used in hydrogeosphere to numerically couple the surface and subsurface domains this approach assumes the surface and surface domains are separated by a thin layer of porous media between which the water and solute exchange fluxes are implicitly calculated this feature of surface subsurface coupling has made hydrogeosphere a useful tool to investigate seawater intrusion and ocean surge inundation overwash on coastal aquifers and islands werner et al 2013 yang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 yang et al 2019 holding and allen 2015 yu et al 2016 readers may refer to therrien et al 2010 and yang et al 2013 for a full description of the governing equations and the coupled surface subsurface approach 2 2 conceptual model a 2d vertically oriented cross section was selected to represent a typical unconfined island aquifer fig 2 a only half of the aquifer was considered by assuming a symmetric island geometry the model domain has a length of 2500 m and consists of a beach zone and a land zone a constant topographic slope was assumed on the beach zone 0 m x 500 m extending to an elevation of 5 masl in the sea whereas a flat horizontal surface of 2 masl elevation was assumed on the land zone 500 m x 2500 m a horizontal aquifer bottom was considered at the elevation of 30 masl the selected island size low lying topography and aquifer depth are representative for many small islands across the pacific and indian oceans bailey 2015 bailey et al 2009 chui and terry 2012 2013 gingerich et al 2017 spennemann 2006 where seawater inundation is naturally occurring and seawater overwash is frequently reported the subsurface of the cross sectional aquifer was discretized into a 3d mesh of 1500 100 1 15 block elements with unit length in the y direction making the 3d mesh an actual 2d representation the grid has the constant resolution of 25 m in x direction and a variable resolution in z direction from 3 m near the aquifer bottom to 0 15 m near the land surface to better represent the unsaturated zone the 100 2d rectangular element faces on the top surface of the 3d mesh represent the land surface to simulate overland flow during and after an ocean surge 2 2 1 cut off wall a vertically oriented cut off wall was placed parallel to and near the coastline at x 500 m fig 2a the cut off wall was constructed from the land surface to the depth d below land surface this depth d was subject to a sensitivity test described later the cut off wall was numerically represented by assigning a low permeability value 10 14 m2 to those 3d elements that represent the wall tests indicated that decreasing this permeability value had no significant effect on the model results the described implementation of the cut off wall in the 2d cross sectional aquifer assumes that the cut off wall is actually located along the entire length of the coastline meaning that the island is completely surrounded by the cut off wall a uniform isotropic permeability value k described later was assigned to the aquifer other parameters of the subsurface and surface were selected uniformly for the simulated domains according to typical literature values listed in table 1 these other parameters were kept constant for all simulations and are not the focus of this study 2 2 2 ocean surge inundation time variable specific heads h f and time constant seawater concentration were prescribed along the seaside boundary of the subsurface and surface fig 2a the nodal h f values along the vertical seaside boundary were computed based on the sealevel position from the surge height variation curve fig 2b yang et al 2018 the considered ocean surge event lasted for 8 h with a maximum surge height of 3 88 masl yang et al 2015a it induced a complete inundation of the low laying horizontal island surface in this study we neglected the potential effect caused by topography yu et al 2016 such that the amount of infiltrated seawater was only a function of the hydrogeological conditions of the subsurface hydraulic gradient and permeability k the impact of the inundation on the island aquifer was simulated with a constant freshwater recharge of 800 mm year this recharge rate is selected according to holding and allen 2015 where representative recharge rates were reported after survey and literature review of the hydrogeology of small islands across the pacific and indian oceans the recharge eventually leads to recovery after inundation only a single surge event was considered ignoring the possibility that further ocean surge events may occur during the recovery phase 2 3 scenario definition two hydrogeologically relevant parameters were varied to investigate the impact of the cut off wall on the fwl on a given island aquifer permeability k and depth of the cut off wall below land surface d the behavior of freshwater storage under the described island systems can potentially be sensitive to these two parameters we considered a realistic range of permeability k for the aquifer the selected k values 10 13 10 12 5 10 12 10 11 5 10 11 10 10 5 10 10 m2 cover the material permeability from silt to gravel note that other parameter e g porosity α and β remained unchanged even the k varied by up to 3 orders of magnitude the effect of these parameters on the fwl is considered to be negligible comparing with that of k because k is the key parameter determining the general flow pattern and water balances during the ocean surge inundation event for an island with a selected permeability we first considered a scenario in the absence of a cut off wall d 0 m providing the pre construction state without cut off wall for comparative analysis with post construction states with cut off wall then we considered 5 different depths of the cut off wall with d values of 7 12 17 22 27 m respectively with these d values the opening lower part underneath the cut off wall had lengths z direction of 25 20 15 10 and 5 m respectively therefore 42 scenarios were generated combining the selected k and d values especially the scenario with d 0 m and k 10 11 m2 being consistent with yang et al 2018 was selected as the base case we did not consider the extreme case that the cut off wall reaches the aquifer bottom where d 32 m in which there would be no subsurface flowpaths connecting the inland with the sea and all the groundwater would be forced to discharge via land surface for each of the 42 scenarios the simulation of the ocean surge was carried out in two phases 1 the spin up phase where the flow and transport reached an equilibrium under a constant sea level and 2 the phase of the ocean surge where the sea level varied according to the surge height phase 1 provided initial conditions for phase 2 both phases must be simulated for a sufficiently long time using transient simulations until an equilibrium was reached for phase 1 and until complete recovery from the ocean surge event was reached for phase 2 2 4 assessment indicators 2 4 1 fwl volume the main function of a cut off wall is to increase the volume of stored freshwater in the fwl we used the threshold concentration of 0 68 g l 1 which is 2 seawater concentration michael et al 2013 as the critical concentration above which the water is regarded as salinized the fwl volume is defined here as the summed volume of those aquifer parts where the salt concentration is below 0 68 g l 1 2 4 2 flushing time existing salinization of an aquifer by natural seawater intrusion prior to an ocean surge is exacerbated by additional salinization induced by the ocean surge after the surge this additionally salinized aquifer undergoes a recovery to initial state due to i seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow and 2 dilution by fresh groundwater through flow and recharge for a specific point in the salinized aquifer the term recovery is defined here as the situation where the salt concentration at that point has dropped below 0 68 g l 1 we were not looking at true recovery to initial pre storm salt concentrations because that situation can only be reached asymptotically following yu et al 2016 we used the concept of flushing time ft to quantify the recovery speed the ft for a specific point in the aquifer is defined as the duration from the start of the ocean surge inundation to the recovery at that point therefore ft is a spatially distributed variable but a ft value does not exist at points that were either always or never salinized counting the incidences of ft in the aquifer volume fraction associated to each possible ft value allowed to generate a flushing time pdf probability density function the 25th 50th and 75th percentiles ft 25 ft 50 ft 75 of the flushing time pdf were extracted to quantify early recovery time average recovery time and late recovery time respectively the above described indicators will change by constructing a cut off wall these changes can be quantified by computing the relative changes of these indicators to the pre construction state no wall using 1 δ f w l v o l u m e f w l v o l u m e f w l v o l u m e n o w a l l 1 2 δ f t 25 50 75 f t 25 50 75 f t 25 50 75 n o w a l l 1 in some extreme cases these indicators should be interpreted with caution for example in the scenario with high permeability and in the absence of the cut off wall the aquifer can be completely salinized in that case the fwl volume as well as the flushing time do not exist and these indicators are not valid 3 results for all the scenarios the simulation period was 100 years for both the spin up phase and the ocean surge phase ensuring equilibrium of the fwl and recovery of the fwl respectively and the maximum cpu time of each simulation was about 5 h the response of the aquifer to cut off wall construction and ocean surge inundation depends on the parameter values of each simulation scenario fig 3 shows the salt distribution at different times after the ocean surge inundation results at t 0 left column are at the onset of the surge such that these results can be viewed as the steady state fwl in the absence of a surge those simulations demonstrate how the steady state fwl without surge reacts to construction of a cut off wall without the cut off wall no 1 11 21 subsurficial seawater intrusion and thus the spatial distribution of fwl depend on island permeability clearly the fwl volume decreases with increasing aquifer permeability this is because landward movement of the subsurficial saltwater freshwater interface increases with increasing permeability according to darcy s law the fwl of the base case fig 3 no 11 reaches the aquifer bottom and does not show the classic shape of floating freshwater over saltwater due to the relatively low aquifer permeability with the cut off wall of d 22 m numbers 6 16 26 the shape of the fwl is practically independent of aquifer permeability this is because the cut off wall of d 22 m hydraulically separates the island zone from the sea zone even for high permeability for t 0 fig 3 no 1 5 11 15 21 25 demonstrates the transient effect of the storm surge inundation on the spatial salt distribution for islands of varying permeability in the absence of a cut off wall for all permeability values the salt concentration in the island aquifer is large at early time after the surge and continuously decreases to return to the initial state shown in the left column no 1 11 21 the presence of a cut off wall in these three transient systems does not qualitatively change the evolution of the salt plume from high concentrations after the surge to the initial state after some time however the presence of a cut off wall overall reduces the amount of salt in the island aquifer compared to the corresponding cases without a wall this difference is larger for islands of high permeability while the impact of the wall is not apparent for islands of low permeability for high k islands the amount of salt in the aquifer without a wall is much greater than that in the aquifer with a wall this is because the initial state is significantly different where the presence of a wall practically removes all the salt in the island aquifer at t 0 for all permeability values 3 1 response of the fwl volume the simulated steady state fwl volume in response to various cut off wall depths d and island permeability k are plotted in fig 4 fig 4a shows that the minimum fwl volume 0 09 106 m3 was found in the aquifer with the highest k and in the absence of a cut off wall where the island is almost fully salinized in contrast the maximum fwl volume 1 67 106 m3 was found in the aquifer with the lowest k and longest cut off wall depth d relative changes of the fwl volume compared with pre construction states without the wall fig 4b show that in most scenarios the cut off wall increases the fwl volume by 10 factor 0 1 however constructing a cut off wall of a large depth d in island aquifers with a high k increases the fwl volume by up to 1500 factor 15 the fwl volume with d 22 m generally decreases with increasing permeability regardless whether a cut off wall is placed or not fig 4c to explain this trend the mean groundwater levels were computed by averaging the groundwater levels over the land zone fig 4d results suggest that larger k causes lower inland groundwater level this can promote subsurficial seawater intrusion according to ghyben herzberg formula bear 1972 in which the depth of the freshwater saltwater interface linearly increases with the inland groundwater level comparing the post construction states with pre construction states fig 4c the increasing effect of a cut off wall on the fwl volume is significant when the k value is 10 12 m2 and is most pronounced for the highest k the inland groundwater water level can be significantly elevated by constructing a cut off wall fig 4d the increase of the fwl volume after constructing a cut off wall has two reasons i the elevated inland groundwater level results in seaward flushing of salt by groundwater flow thereby increasing the fwl volume compare fig 3 no 21 with fig 3 no 26 and ii as the inland groundwater level rises the void pores of the unsaturated zone are filled with freshwater for example constructing a wall with d 22 m on an island with k 10 11 m2 causes 0 19 106 m3 increase of the fwl about 10 of which was obtained by rising the groundwater level based on the performance of the cut off wall on islands of different k three island groups can be identified i the low permeability islands with k 10 12 m2 for this island group the groundwater flow is predominantly controlled by the low permeability before the cutoff wall construction the inland groundwater level is already high with the fwl having the maximum size fig 4c d therefore constructing a cut off wall has almost no effect on the fwl volume ii the intermediate permeability islands where the k value ranges between 10 12 and 10 10 5 m2 for this island group both the fwl volume and the inland groundwater level are sensitive to k regardless whether the cut off wall is present or not constructing a cut off wall significantly increases the fwl volume iii the high permeability islands with k 10 10 5 m2 for that island group the inland groundwater level is low prior to constructing the cut off wall and the fwl volume has a minimum size in that case constructing a cut off wall has the most significant effect on increasing the fwl volume once the cut off wall is constructed the groundwater flow system is more likely to be controlled by the wall evidenced by the stable mean groundwater level in these high permeability islands fig 4d the increasing effect of a cut off wall on the fwl volume is more pronounced when the wall depth d is large however this is only valid for islands of intermediate and high k where the effect of increasing fwl volume is apparent clearly the cut off wall has the ability to prevent the lateral seawater intrusion in the subsurface which increases the fwl volume this finding from our numerical simulations confirms previous results by luyun et al 2009 lu et al 2019 and abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b who used analytical solutions numerical simulations and sand tank experiments respectively 3 2 response of the flushing time ocean surge simulations reveal how fast the fwl recovers from the surge inundation in the numerical simulations carried out here the water fluxes across the shoreline on the land surface x 500 m are used to compute the amount of seawater that has surficially entered the island as a consequence of the surge for the base case the ocean surge delivered 190 cm seawater volume divided by the island surface area of seawater to the land during the surge 0 t 4 4 hr fig 5 155 cm of that amount flows back to the ocean within 24 h after the onset of the surge the remaining 35 cm of seawater infiltrated into the subsurface other studies have shown that the topography type has a significant influence on the amount of infiltrating seawater for example land surfaces with depressions promote infiltration while a seaward land slope promotes seaward flow yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 by using a flat topography a given magnitude of the ocean surge and using unchanged boundary conditions for our simulations the amount of infiltrated seawater is only a function of the hydrogeological conditions in the subsurface i e hydraulic gradient and permeability k post surge infiltration of seawater leads to the development of a salt plume which impacts the fwl in the base case a salt plume has developed one month after the surge near the aquifer top fig 3 no 12 thereby salinizing an increased volume of the aquifer as the salt plume is moving downward its size is continuously reduced by natural remediation due to seaward groundwater flow and dilution by recharged freshwater fig 3 no 13 14 15 the recovery of the fwl to the initial state takes 10 years after the onset of the ocean surge the simulated pattern of salt plume development is similar to many previous studies of coastal aquifers or islands yu et al 2016 yang et al 2018 holding and allen 2015 fig 6 illustrates the spatial flushing time distribution for various cases along with the salinized regions and associated recovery times note that fig 6 does not represent the actual salt plume fig 6a shows that the flushing time increases from 1 year near the top center of the island to 15 years near the shore of the pre inundation fwl this indicates that the fwl recovers from center to shore and from top to bottom the computed pdf of the flushing time suggests that 2 6 3 6 and 5 2 years are required to recover 25 50 and 75 respectively of the salinized region caused by seawater inundation fig 6a similar recovery times have been reported in previous studies ranging from 1 year to 20 years terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 our simulated recovery time is within that range however detailed comparison to previous studies is not possible because of differing boundary conditions e g recharge rate and aquifer properties here we focus on the change of the recovery speed by constructing the cut off wall constructing a cut off wall changes the recovery of the fwl described by a changed spatial flushing time distribution a cut off wall extends the salinized region that needs to be flushed further seaward compared to the pre construction state compare fig 6b with 6a and compare 6d with 6c also a higher flushing time region is formed behind the cut off wall landside indicating that salinization can prevail behind the wall during significantly longer times fig 6b the characteristic values ft 25 ft 50 and ft 75 and their relative changes to pre construction states δft 25 δft 50 and δft 75 were computed for all scenarios to quantitatively evaluate changes in fwl recovery after placing a cut off wall fig 7 the simulated mean flushing time ft50 ranges from 2 5 to 8 years and it generally decreases with increasing k fig 7c flushing low k islands is relatively fast during early times fig 7a but slower during later times fig 7e salt can persist in low k islands with a very long time once the aquifer was salinized during ocean surge the responses of flushing times to the construction of cut off wall vary for different d and k values and for different stages negative or positive relative change δft 25 δft 50 and δft 75 indicates that flushing speeds up or slows down after placing a cut off wall for the early stage of recovery fig 8 b flushing in most cases speeds up while it moderately slows down in some cases 0 δft 25 10 significant slowing down δft 50 75 10 becomes more frequent when recovery transitions into median fig 7d and late stages fig 7f these results suggest that the cut off wall tends to speed up the early stage flushing widely blue markers fig 7b however it tends to slow down late stage flushing widely red markers fig 7f note that this observation only indicates a generally high possibility for such effects to be caused by constructing a cut off wall rather being conclusive for each specific scenario δft 50 represents the average performance of a cut off wall on flushing and it shows a k dependent pattern fig 8 plots the simulated ft 50 δft50 and infiltrated seawater amount versus the aquifer permeability for pre construction states no wall and post construction states cut off wall of 22 m depth the cut off wall tends to speed up flushing in low and intermediate k islands k 10 10 5 m2 thereby reducing the ft 50 by up to 50 relative to pre construction fig 8a b this result corresponds to the development of the salt plume fig 3a b where the salinized regions caused by seawater inundation vanish faster when a cut off wall is present this suggests that the vertical seawater intrusion during an ocean surge is likely to be weakened by a cut off wall simulation results suggest that the amount of infiltrated seawater was reduced up to 40 after constructing the cut off wall fig 8c this is because the elevated inland groundwater level by cut off walls reduce the vertical component of the hydraulic gradient preventing seawater infiltration into aquifer from the land surface this reduction of infiltrated seawater by a cut off wall leads to speeding up of fwl recovery for high k islands k 10 10 5 m2 the cut off wall tends to slow down flushing indicated by higher ft 50 relative to pre construction state fig 8a b even though the cut off wall reduced the infiltrated seawater amount during inundation explaining this pattern requires a closer look at the spatial distribution of salt plumes and flushing time in the high k aquifer prior to placing the cut off wall the aquifer was almost completely salinized before ocean surge fig 3 no 21 the fwl is situated close to the land surface after placing a cut off wall a large fwl volume was reclaimed extending the fwl significantly deeper and seaward fig 3 no 26 the sharp change in the spatial distribution of fwl changes the recovery speed once the fwl is salinized during an ocean surge the pre construction fwl can recover faster because it is closer to the land surface where the fresh groundwater recharge begins fig 6c while the complete recovery of the post construction fwl is slower fig 6d in conclusion the slowing down of fwl recovery by a cut off wall in high k islands is attributed to that the reclaimed fwl was significantly harder to recover this slowing down effect dominates over the speeding up effect caused by reduced seawater infiltration 4 discussion 4 1 effects on freshwater storage the function of cut off wall to reduce seawater intrusion from the subsurface has been examined and proved in previous study using laboratory experiments luyun et al 2009 analytical solution lu et al 2019 and numerical simulations abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b lu et al 2019 our study for a cross sectional aquifer has consistent results with previous studies additionally the present study has gone beyond previous studies by investigating the cut off wall effect in island scale aquifers where the saltwater freshwater mixing is significantly stronger than that in lab scale aquifers with thin freshwater saltwater interfaces it should be noted that we did not consider the time scale within which the increase can be fully realized after the construction luyun et al 2009 reported a cleanup process after placing the wall the toe of the saltwater wedge initially advances and then gradually retreats from the aquifer behind the wall the speed of that cleanup process was a function of the wall depth and aquifer heterogeneity abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017a zheng et al 2021 showed that the cleanup process for their subsurface dam may take up to 50 years depending on the height and position of the dam therefore the fwl volume and flushing time of this study were estimated under the assumption that the new salt equilibrium after the cut off wall construction was completely reached in this sense the discussed increase of fwl volume was a maximum potential for a cut off wall to induce and the flushing time referred to the recovery to this maximum potential 4 2 effects on recovery giving that a cut off wall can significantly increase the travel time of groundwater lu et al 2019 our intuition was that a cut off wall could slow down the recovery once the fwl was salinized during seawater inundation however our study suggested that the recovery tends to speed up in the early stage for shallow and more landward aquifer region but to slow down in the late stage for deeper and more seaward aquifer region the main explanation for such behavior was that under the same seawater inundation event the cut off wall can reduce the amount of infiltrated seawater by up to 40 in this sense the cut off wall can not only prevent lateral seawater intrusion from the subsurface but also prevent the vertical seawater intrusion from the island surface during a seawater inundation event our study quantified the average recovery speed using a medium flushing time ft50 suggesting that a cut off wall can generally speed up at least not slow down the recovery in low intermediate permeability islands but slow down the recovery in high permeability islands as the cut off wall generated significant larger and deeper space that is even harder for flushing these phenomena have not been reported before it should be noted that these conclusions are made based on that we considered the salt from ocean as the only contaminant causing damage to the fwl the speed up of flushing by a cut off wall was accomplished via reducing the salt mass load in aquifers during a certain ocean surge event rather than really speeding up the travel time when considering other sources of contaminants e g contaminants from human activity and nitrate sun et al 2019 the recovery of the fwl from contamination may still inhabited by cut off walls requiring further investigation 4 3 feasibility of constructing cut off wall previous studies mostly focused only on the function of cut off walls to increase freshwater storage in coastal aquifers ignoring their effect on the recovery of the freshwater from salinization by extreme events the feasibility of constructing cut off walls requires an integrated consideration of both the freshwater storage and the recovery speed especially for these low lying islands where seawater overtopping was frequently reported gingerich et al 2017 terry and falkland 2010 chui and terry 2012 chui and terry 2013 bailey 2015 our study suggested that i for low permeability islands k 10 12 m2 constructing cut off walls cannot increase the freshwater storage as the freshwater storage is already large but it can speed up recovery in this sense the construction is not encouraged ii for intermediate permeability islands k range 10 12 10 10 5 m2 constructing cut off walls reclaims a considerable large volume of freshwater storage and also tends to speed up recovery the construction is therefore encouraged iii for high permeability islands k 10 10 5 m2 constructing cut off walls has a high possibility to slows down the average recovery however it increases the freshwater storage from almost zero to a significantly large volume in this sense the construction requires special caution 4 4 limitations and outlook cross comparisons between scenarios with different aquifer permeability and cut off wall depth provides insights into the sensitivity of fwl size and recovery time to these factors however the scope of this study is limited because it neglects other factors that may have important impact on the function of cut off walls and flushing processes we neglected aquifer heterogeneity which has been shown to significantly affect the flow paths and velocities near the saltwater wedge lu et al 2013 simmons et al 2001 abdoulhalik and ahmed 2017b and to affect the migration of the salt plumes developed from aquifer top during seawater inundation vithanage et al 2012 yang et al 2015b preferential groundwater flow pathways such as macropores and fractures sebben et al 2015 would very likely to change the cut off wall efficiency and cause more rapid flushing we considered only a simplified island with horizontal topography and constant climate variations of these factors have been proved to change the seawater intrusion from subsurface hanson and nilsson 1986 michael et al 2013 werner et al 2013 and from surface yu et al 2016 holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 for example the hydraulic gradient influenced by recharge rate on islands can affect the function of subsurface barriers chang et al 2019 and the recovery time in coastal aquifer holding and allen 2015 yang et al 2018 the hydro geologic patterns in real field applications can be more complex our study provides nonetheless for the first time a perspective of the recovery processes from extreme climate events in the assessment of cut off wall construction these limitations discussed above need to be explored in further research while the numerical model provides general trends it should be pointed out that there are some limitations in the numerical implementation firstly the selecting of dispersivity can result in uncertainty in the computed fwl size and the flushing time yang et al 2018 due to the twofold effect i for the saltwater wedge the width of transition zone between saltwater and freshwater can vary with dispersivity ii for the salt plume developed from aquifer top the dilution effect can be reduced as the dispersive transport of salt becomes weaker secondly defining the salinization with a criteria concentration can lead to discontinuity of the spatially flushing time distribution as one cell can be suddenly counted as salinized fresh when its concentration passes that criteria this basically introduced an uncertain feature behind the algorithm of the characteristic flushing times ft25 ft50 ft75 because their values can be dominated by flushing time of specific cells we believed that this uncertain feature explains the non smooth pattern for the computed ft50 e g curves in fig 8a lastly we used a 2d representation for the island aquifer which assumes that groundwater flows only longitudinally along the 2d slice this 2d representation simplifies the radial flow pattern and ignores potential alongshore flow that may occur in a real world island with irregular island geometry sea boundary and hydro geologic conditions subsequently the fwl size may be overestimated or underestimated additionally the salt fingering process differs between 2d and 3d representations knorr et al 2016 influencing the estimated flushing time while these limitations in the numerical implementation did not alter the general trends found in this study they may need more careful assessment with regard to the accuracy of the computed fwl size and the flushing time in further research using a 3d representation for the island aquifer 5 summary and conclusions the function of cut off walls to increase freshwater storage in coastal aquifers has been widely tested and proved however for low lying islands where seawater inundation induced by ocean surge can occur constructing cut off walls can influence the recovery speed once the aquifer is salinized during the inundation investigation to this influence was still missing when discussing the feasibility of cut off walls in this study we numerically simulated the ocean surge inundation on a 2d vertically oriented island constructed with a cut off wall we considered various aquifer permeability and depths of cut off wall the effect of cut off wall on freshwater storage and post inundation recovery was assessed in terms of fwl volume and flushing time the main key conclusions are 1 constructing a cut off wall in island increases the volume of fwl by preventing the lateral seawater intrusion from the subsurface confirming previous studies the largest increase was accomplished in high permeability islands with k 10 10 5 m2 while almost zero increase for low permeability islands with k 10 12 m2 deeper cut off walls tend to have more pronounced effect in increasing the fwl volume 2 constructing a cut off wall can reduce the amount of infiltrated seawater by up to 40 during a seawater inundation event in this sense the cut off wall can also prevent the vertical seawater intrusion from the island surface the cut off wall tends to speed up the post inundation recovery in the early stage but to slow down in the late stage considering the island permeability the cut off wall tends to speed up the average recovery in low intermediate permeability islands but to slow down in high permeability islands as the cut off wall reclaims larger and deeper space that is even harder for flushing 3 considering both the increase of freshwater storage and the recovery speed the feasibility of constructing a cut off wall may significantly depend on the island permeability generally constructing a cut off wall i is not recommended on low permeability islands as the freshwater storage is already large ii is encouraged on intermediate permeability islands as the cut off wall increases freshwater storage and also tends to speed up recovery and iii requires special caution on high permeability islands because the cut off wall has a high possibility to slows down the average recovery however it increases the freshwater storage from almost zero to a significantly large volume overall this study improves the understanding of the impact of cut off walls on controlling seawater intrusion this study provides a new perspective to assess the feasibility of constructing a cut off wall through fully coupled numerical modeling given that the intensity of extreme events such as ocean surge is expected to increase due to climate change the key findings are extremely useful for designing the cut off wall and for the management of freshwater on oceanic islands facing the risk of ocean surge inundation as certain assumptions and limitations imposed future work on the effects of cut off wall should consider the combined impacts of other factors including heterogeneity topography and climate e g recharges under

3867,support funds from national or subnational public spending provide essential assistance for flash floods reduction all around the world however how to allocate support funds to different regions with various degrees of disaster is a challenge for decision makers in this paper we develop a universal and novel multi objective framework to solve the problem at multi space scales the framework is coupled with the concept of multiple vulnerability and the fund allocation optimization model faom developed taking fully into account the impact of vulnerability on funds allocation elite genetic algorithm technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and geographical detector are applied to solve the faom based on the case study in hainan island china and the model is compared with the other two fund allocation schemes results show that faom is able to find a better fund allocation program as such it offers a novel approach to solve the problem of funds allocation considering environmental social and economic factors in addition the further application of the model in progressive recognition and phased support is designed for long term funding decisions in a particular region considering the sustainable development of society keywords multi objective funds allocation flash flood vulnerability fund allocation optimization model 1 introduction flash flood is one of the most devastating disasters in the world causing substantial casualties and property losses lucía et al 2018 liu et al 2018 lian et al 2017 nielsen et al 2015 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 diakakis et al 2020 serious disaster areas often need to inject a large amount of financial funds from national or subnational public spending for the construction of engineering measures and non engineering measures which are conducive to the local disaster prevention and mitigation the support funds mentioned here focuses on a relatively long term planning project rather than emergency funding in china the government has prepared the implementation plan of national mountain flood disaster prevention project for three years and the support funds will be shared by the central and local governments with increasing tight resources the total amount of support funds available for different regions is often insufficient so decision makers should try their best to invest the funds accurately and realize the maximum benefit to make more scientific decisions two problems need to be solved firstly identify those areas requiring relative priority support and secondly give a more precise funding plan for those areas that need priority support about the first problem some recent literature has examined the determinants of identifying priority support regions it was often determined by the degree of historical flash floods or the situation of prevention and control tasks in the past bubeck et al 2013 xu et al 2018 nahiduzzaman et al 2015 kablan et al 2017 karmakar et al 2010 huang et al 2011 increasingly more comprehensive concept and factors have been considered to help identify priority support areas vulnerability or risk is often used as basis for priority funding area selection karim and noy 2020 examined that flood hazard risk and socio economic vulnerability are both positively correlated with the sub district fiscal allocations weiler et al 2018 explored the influence of the vulnerability good governance and donor interests on priority support regions for adapting to the impacts of climate change ahmad and ma 2020 suggested that gender membership farmer size and injured members are the determinants in aid programe through specific case studies over recent years the term risk and vulnerability have become buzz words in natural hazard on the definition of risk ipcc defined it as the product of probability and consequence in 2001 ipcc 2001 and then argued it as the collection of hazard exposure and vulnerability in 2014 ipcc 2014 the european environment agency adopted the flood risk as the product of probability and consequence unep 2004 shehata and mizunaga 2018 kim and choi 2011 some scholars also explained risk as the collection of external risk and internal risk of which the external risk mainly refers to the potential loss brought by extreme events and the internal risk refers to the decision maker s decision in response to the unexpected situation that may cause greater risk roos et al 2017 on the definition of vulnerability it has become a popular term in the study of natural disasters and climate change which refers to disasters social economic population and ecological fields ipcc defined vulnerability as a function of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which is adopted by etc cca etcsia and iucn iucn 2010 swart et al 2012 ipcc 2007 then vulnerability is argued as the tendency of the system to be adversely affected in 2014 ipcc 2014 some scholars also emphasized that the definition of vulnerability depends largely on the purpose or the interest of the analysis fuchs et al 2011 here we adopted the definition of vulnerability as a set of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which generalize the possible impacts from disasters on regions considering environmental social and economic factors synthetically chang and huang 2015 adger 2006 andrade and szlafsztein 2018 in this paper the concept of multiple vulnerability from one of our papers which has been published yang et al 2018a is adopted to identify priority support regions multiple vulnerability here was defined as six types potential disaster loss potential economic development potential defense defect potential self organizing capability potential disaster frequency potential resources waste considering the relationship between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which will give a more comprehensive basis for priority funding area selection multiple vulnerability assessment can identify priority support regions but how to allocate funds to different regions accurately has always been a challenge namely the second problem indeed there are some related researches on resource allocation most of which are based on the model of emergency dispatch balcik et al 2008 altay and green 2006 anaya arenas et al 2014 galindo and batta 2013 al theeb and murray 2017 developed a resource distribution model incorporating features of multi commodity multi depot and multi period huang et al 2015 presented an integrated decision support model coupling humanitarian principle like lifesaving human suffering and fairness to optimizes resource allocation balcik et al 2008 proposed a mixed integer programming model for optimizing resource allocation in last mile of relief chain based on literature review we found that previous researches on fund allocation were mostly on account of historical disasters or specific comprehensive concepts like vulnerability or risk miller and vela 2014 lis and nickel 2010 hochrainer stigler et al 2014 karim and noy 2020 examined the directly observable determinants of subnational central to local public spending allocation for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in bangladesh the authors set up a comprehensive indicator system with the primary focus on risk poverty and politics to explore the determinants of subnational public spending allocation for adaptive disaster risk reduction in the bangladeshi context meanwhile they established the links between social protection disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and a methodological framework to assess the determinants of public spending allocation which play an important role in subnational public spending allocation however the research on optimal allocation of disaster prevention funds is still not mature especially for different space scales this paper contributes to the literature by offering a novel multi objective method to determine the allocation of support funds for flash flood reduction in multi space scales catchment town and county a methodological framework coupling the concept of multiple vulnerability and fund allocation optimization model faom is proposed to give theresults of optimal allocation of funds from the space scales of catchment town and county which helps to maximize the benefit of limited disaster prevention funds and can be generalized heuristic algorithm is a popular approach to solve mathematical model with multiple objectives cao et al 2018 among them genetic algorithm ga has attracted more attention because of its many advantages including few parameters good convergence fine robust and wide extension zheng et al 2015 su et al 2016 soleimani and kannan 2015 the basic principles of ga are as follows first the initial solution of solved problems is generated in a random way obtaining initial population then each individual is evaluated by the fitness function to eliminate the individuals next the individuals with high fitness will be selected to participate in the genetic operation and the individual set after genetic operation forms the next generation of new population then the next round of the new population is carried out however in the course of evolution the adaptive individuals in the current population may be destroyed to solve the problem de 1975 put forward the elite selection strategy which saving the best individuals to date in the population evolution and copying them to the next generation with probability 1 the algorithm formed by combining elite retention strategy with ga is called elitist genetic algorithm ega in this study ega is designed to solve the faom then technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is applied to find the final optimal scheme generally this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce in detail the process of building the framework including multiple vulnerability assessment and the construction of fund allocation optimization model faom in section 3 the framework is applied to hainan island and the results of final fund allocation in different catchments towns and counties are obtained in section 4 the rationality and superiority of faom has been tested and explained meanwhile the further application of the model is discussed finally we give the conclusions and discuss the limitations of our work 2 framework development to solve the fund allocation problem in different areas a universal and novel multi objective framework for flash flood reduction based on the multiple vulnerability assessment and faom is developed here the framework consists of two modules like multiple vulnerability assessment and fund allocation optimization model in total of six steps fig 1 we will introduce the framework in detail next 2 1 multiple vulnerability assessment 2 1 1 step 1 establishment of index system in this study multiple vulnerability is defined as the interaction of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity lian et al 2017 exposure in this paper refers to the external pressure disturbance and related factors that may affect the magnitude of the pressure disturbance fuchs et al 2011 sensitivity is defined as the degree to which a system is likely to be affected by pressure or disturbance chang and huang 2015 adaptive capacity is regarded as the ability of a system to enhance its capability to adjust or respond by reducing potential impacts due to flash flood here yang et al 2018a based on literature summary carlo 2015 swart et al 2012 eea 2017 balica et al 2009 2012 koutroulis et al 2018 bălteanu 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 khazai et al 2013 karagiorgos et al 2016 terti et al 2015 ahmad and ma 2020 mahmood et al 2016 and the principles of being representative systematic measurable universal and operational the indicators to characterize the three components of vulnerability have been suggested as fig 2 exposure indicators here are suggested as maximum 10 minute rainfall maximum 1 hour rainfall maximum 6 hour rainfall maximum 24 hour rainfall maximum 6 hour rainfall annual rainfall elevation slope river density land use status soil type and vegetation type sensitivity indicators are selected as family economy housing value villages number population density and enterprise density the adaptive capacity index system includes engineering measures non engineering measures and financial state specifically the engineering measures are suggested as reservoir sluice culvert bridge embankment non engineering measures include automatic monitoring station simple water level station simple rainfall station wireless early warning station and the gross domestic product gdp is regarded as the financial state indicators 2 1 2 step 2 index weight determination the common methods of weight determination include subjective weighting delphi or analytic hierarchy process objective weighting entropy weight method and comprehensive weighting lee et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 all methods have their own advantages and disadvantages this paper proposes a new weighting method based on geographical detector the geographical detector is a novel statistical method proposed by wang et al 2010 the tool s core idea is based on the assumption that if one variable has a significant effect on a dependent variable then the two variables will have a similar spatial distribution the geographic detector is able to calculate the extent to which each indicator explains the spatial differentiation of a phenomenon the greater the interpretation force the closer the relationship between the index and the phenomenon and the greater weight of the corresponding index should be the geographical weighting method makes full use of the spatial distribution relationship between a certain phenomenon and each index avoiding the former subjectivity and simple objective but may not accord with the actual a detailed introduction to the principle of geographic detector is as follows define x as a categorical layer having impacts on the spatial distribution of y if the indicator layer x is not a categorical layer it needs to be classified based on specific principles such as natural breaks class equal interval class quantile class and so on in this study natural breaks class is adopted then the interpretation force if from x to y and the weight of each indicator are measured as 1 if 1 1 n σ 2 h 1 l n h σ h 2 2 σ h 2 1 n h 1 i 1 n h n h i n h 2 3 σ 2 1 n 1 j 1 n n j n 2 4 w j i f j j 1 m i f j where if represents the interpretation force from x to the distribution of y if is a value between 0 and 1 the larger the if the greater the explanatory power of x to y n is the number of samples in the study area σ2 means the global variance of y nh represents the samples number of y in zone h σ2 h is the variance of y in the zone h l is the number of zones nh i is the value of y in ith sample of zone h nh is the average value of y in zone h nj is the value of the jth sample unit in the whole study area n is the global average value of y in entire study area ifj is the interpretation force from the jth indicator to y m is the number of all the indicators selected and wj is the weight of the jth indicator 2 1 3 step 3 multiple vulnerability assessment vulnerability is regarded as a concept including three components like exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity they are characterized by a series of indicators respectively the specific quantification process is as follows 5 x ij z ij z ij min z ij max z ij min i 1 m 6 h i k j 1 n f ij ln f ij i 1 2 m 7 f ij w j x ij j 1 n w j x ij 8 k 1 ln n 9 u i 2 h i 10 e x i e x u i j 1 n w j x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 11 s e i s e u i j 1 n w j x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 k 12 a c i j 1 n w j x ij a c u i i 1 2 m j 1 2 p where zij is the characterization value of the jth index in ith unit xij is the standardized value of the jth index in ith unit zij max is the maximum value of the jth index in the ith unit zij min is the minimum value of the jth index in the ith unit hi is the entropy value of all indicators in the ith unit ui is inhomogeneity of the ith unit proposed by yang et al 2018b exui seui and acui is the exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity inhomogeneity of the ith unit respectively and exi sei and aci is exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity respectively here we adopt the concept of multiple vulnerability from one of our papers which has been published yang et al 2018a six vulnerability indices namely potential disaster loss pdl potential economic development ped potential defense defect pdd potential self organizing capability psc potential disaster frequency pdf and potential resources waste prw have been developed based on the situation of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity table 1 these six vulnerability indices can be classified into positive and negative types for actual disaster prevention and mitigation table 1 so far based on the above formula and the definition of multiple vulnerability we can identify the multiple vulnerability of all units in study area 2 2 fund allocation optimization model faom construction how to allocate support funds to regions with different or the same degree of disaster has always been a challenge for policy makers here a fund allocation optimization model faom has been developed to solve the problem according to the results of multiple vulnerability assessment above 2 2 1 step 4 priority support region determination the degree of disaster should be the criterion to identify priority support regions previous definitions of the extent of the disaster may limit to historical flash floods or unilateral natural factors there is rarely a comprehensive consideration of environmental social and economic factors while the multiple vulnerability assessment overcome the above defects vulnerability is considered as an important concept to reflect the disaster risk in an area based on the results of multiple vulnerability assessment results the number of negative types of multiple vulnerability of all analysis units ought to be counted first then the units with three negative multiple vulnerability will be identified as the priority support regions 2 2 2 step 5 determine the input measures and benefit coefficient from the concept of multiple vulnerability pdl and ped reveal the relationship between exposure and sensitivity improving pdl to ped is difficult as the exposure reveals the impacts from natural factors which is always out of our control on the contrary it is easier to improve pdd to psc or pdf to prw by building related engineering measures and non engineering measures to increase the local adaptive capacity then the input measures can be identified by analyzing the effect of existing disaster prevention measures based on the geographical detector the relationship between the distribution of historical flash floods and the existing measures can be quantized the results are used to characterize the benefit coefficient of all input measures in addition considering the different effects of various measures on the prevention and control of flash floods and being likely to complement each other this paper recommends the balanced principle for the investment proportion of all measures the fund allocation proportion is based on the cost ratio of various measures 2 2 3 step 6 quantization and solution of fund allocation optimization model to maximize the benefits of investment a multi objective fund allocation optimization model faom has been established the model consists of two objection function constraints decision variable and model solution methods the details are as follows first in terms of disaster prevention objects the best decision is to transform the negative type into the positive type as the table 1 defined contributing to reduce the number of objects for fund allocation at the same time when a region fails to convert all negative types into positive ones the support fund invested will also produce a certain benefit after investment the three negative types of analysis unit may be transformed into the following types three negative single positive and double positive when a single negative type is transformed into a positive type in the same analysis unit 1 3 of the benefit target is achieved when the two negative types turn to positive types the benefit target has been completed 2 3 when the input of funds fails to produce negative type transformation the corresponding benefit area will also be generated due to the input of funds but it is less than 1 3 of the target so we define it as paci 3min exi sei based on the above considerations the maximum benefit area and the maximum number of positive types are identified as the potential rule of thumb for optimal fund allocation the two objective functions are defined as follows object function 1 the sum benefit area of all units in study area reaches maximum value the quantization of benefit area is shown as follows 13 f b a m a x b a 15 ba i 1 q pa c i s i 3 m i n e x i s e i i q 1 l 1 3 s i i l

paci is the present adaptive capacity in the ith unit si is the area of the ith unit q is the number of units with none positive type vulnerability l q is the number of units with one positive type vulnerability n l is the number of units with two positive type vulnerability iaci is the added adaptive capacity due to the increase of non engineering measures the effect of index inhomogeneity on adaptive capacity should be positive and here we do not take into account it for safety considerations mij is the standardized value of the jth measure number in the ith unit wj is the benefit coefficient of the jth measure yij is the jth measure number in the ith unit pij is the investment of the jth measure in the ith unit and ij is the cost of the jth measure object function 2 the sum positive number of vulnerability of all units in study area achieves the maximum value the specific quantification formulas are as follows 19 f n u m m a x n u m 20 num i 1 n num p a c i e x i o r p a c i s e i i 1 2 n where num is the sum positive number of vulnerability of all units in study area max num is the maximum value of num constraints the model is subject to constraint like total funds constraints and is shown as follows 21 p i j 1 k p ij p i 1 n p i where pi is the investment in the ith unit pij is the investment of the jth measure in the ith unit and p is the total investment of all the study units decision variable results of allocation funds within each unit model solution the elitist genetic algorithm ega is applied to solve the model and the pareto optimal set will be obtained then the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis is used to identify the optimal solution the core thought of topsis is to attempts to choose scheme that simultaneously has the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution mao et al 2016 it offers a cardinal ranking of the alternatives khagram et al 2003 in this study topsis is applied to find the optimum solution from pareto optimal set the formulas are as follows 22 a i j h i j i 1 l h i j 2 23 a a 1 a 2 a a 1 a 2 24 l i j 1 2 a i

objective in all schemes a is the minimum ideal solution set a1 is the minimum value of the first objective in all schemes a2 is the minimum value of the second objective in all schemes li is the distance from the ith alternative to the positive ideal solution li is the distance from the ith alternative to the negative ideal solution and ci is the relative closeness from the ith scheme to the ideal solution the scheme with the maximum ci will be identified as the optimal one 3 framework applications 3 1 study area hainan island is a tropical island in southern china with an area of 33 900 square kilometers and a population of 9 25 million the location map and the boundary of counties towns and catchments of hainan island are shown in fig 3 it is located between latitudes 18 38 and 19 02 n and longitudes 109 19 and 109 44 e the overall topography of hainan island presents the phenomenon that the middle area is high and the surrounding area is in a low level it is composed of annular stratiform landforms and the cascade structure is obvious the seasonal distribution of precipitation in hainan island is very uneven with dry and wet season from november to april of each year there is less rain accounting for only 10 of the annual rainfall and drought often occurs in the less rainy season from may to october each year there is more rain with a total rainfall of about 1500 mm accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall the main sources of rain are frontal rain hot thunderstorm and taiwan storm during the rainy season flash floods often occur and cause numerous casualties and property losses therefore the government has prepared the implementation plan of national mountain flood disaster prevention project for three years then there will be a lot of investment here for the construction of disaster prevention measures especially non engineering measures the allocation of support funds for non engineering measures in different regions is always a difficult problem for decision makers consequently the framework developed above will be applied to the study area 3 2 input data and quantization based on the index system developed in the framework the input data of hainan island are collected the data sources are presented as table 2 and the quantification and characterization value of each indicator will be described in detail as follows all exposure indicators consist of type and numerical variable the relationship between them and flash floods is difficult to be expressed by single positive or negative correlation also the effect of the numerical variable within different ranges of the same index on flash floods is different based on above considerations the average flash flood intensity is counted in zones classified of all the exposure indicators and they are selected as the characterization value of different exposure indicators then the average characterization value of indicators in each catchment can be obtained to characterize flash flood intensity a concept of crowding level is defined the crowding level of flash flood is calculated by the getis ord s gi statistic of hot spot analysis in geographic information system gis 10 2 getis ord s gi can both express the presence of local clustering and indicate the clustering of locations and intensity ahmad et al 2015 kao et al 2017 based on the spatial distribution of recorded flash floods the average standardized value of z score from getis ord s gi can be obtained then the value is defined as the crowding level to characterize the flash flood intensity in a catchment in terms of sensitivity indicators the average value of family economy housing value and population density in each catchment is regarded as the characterization value the crowding levels of villages and enterprises are selected as the characterization value in each catchment similarly about adaptive capacity indicators all engineering and non engineering measures are quantized by the crowding levels basing on the spatial distribution of them the average gdp is characterized as the characterization value in each catchment 3 3 results 3 3 1 multiple vulnerability of flash flood results based on the method of multiple vulnerability assessment developed above the results of exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and the multiple vulnerability are obtained as fig 4 shows the overall distribution situation of exposure is that it is high in the northeastern part of the island and low in the southwest it indicates that flash floods erupt more frequently in the northeastern part of the island in terms of sensitivity it is easy to find that the coastal areas own higher sensitivity than that of inland areas the situation reflects the fact that the economy of coastal areas is more developed than that of inland areas the adaptive capacity of the whole island is gradually increasing from southwest to northeast which shows different attentions to flash flood prevention and control from the local people then the multiple vulnerability of flash flood can be obtained based on the results of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity from the relationship between exposure and sensitivity most areas in hainan island are in a negative type as pdl indicating that most regions own a high potential disaster frequency only a few of regions to the south of the island belong to positive type as ped in terms of the relationship between exposure and adaptive capacity the spatial distribution of positive and negative types is basically the same as that of exposure and sensitivity while about sensitivity and adaptive capacity it shows different spatial distribution laws of the positive and negative types from those of exposure and sensitivity coastal areas are negative type as pdd and the inland is positive type what needs to be emphasized is that all areas in negative type should be paid more attention for disaster prevention and mitigation 3 3 2 priority supported catchments determination to identify the priority supported catchments it should count the number of negative types vulnerability first fig 5 a shows the situation of negative types vulnerability in each catchment it is obvious to find that most catchments in coastal areas contain three negative types vulnerability which indicates that they should be supported first thus catchments with three negative types are selected as the priority support catchments and are shown in fig 5b it is obvious to find that counties like hk wc qh wn and ld owns the majority catchments for priority support 3 3 3 determine the input measures and benefit coefficient of them based on the availability of data this paper only considers the input of non engineering measures as a response to flash floods many non engineering measures like simple rainfall station simple water level station automatic monitoring station and wireless early warning station have been implemented in hainan island finished projects in years of 2010 to 2013 are mapped together with flash floods happened in 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014 fig 6 it is easy to find that the high concentration area of non engineering measures for 2010 2013 covers almost all of the high density areas of flash floods in 2009 2010 this shows that the layout of non engineering measures in 2010 2013 is reasonable after the implementation of non engineering measures the number of flash floods in areas with high intensity of non engineering is obviously reduced in 2013 to 2014 which further indicates that non engineering measures play an important role in reducing flash floods therefore the non engineering measures like simple rainfall station simple water level station automatic monitoring station and wireless early warning station should be determined as the planned input measures next year then the benefit coefficients of all measures input are determined by the geographical detector and the investment proportion of all measures are identified based on the cost of them the results are shown in the table 3 after all data has been prepared the faom can be calculated for finding the optimal solution in next stage 3 3 4 faom results statistically in the past three years the total support funds from national and subnational in non engineering measures including monitoring and early warning measures in hainan has reached 38 million yuan in general local government needs to allocate funds according to the current year s budget and disaster prevention requirements here based on the average investment over the past three years 12 million yuan is expected as the investment to hainan island next year it will be used as a capital entry condition for faom then the pareto optimal set can be obtained based on the faom the optimal allocation of funds for priority support regions can be obtained by topsis the results are shown in table 4 it is easy to find that the case 1 has the maximum c value so the allocation of funds of the case 1 should be selected as the final fund allocation scheme the two objectives of the scheme like number of active type and the benefit area are 672 and 4486 km2 respectively the spatial distribution of the two objectives are shown in fig 7 as a result of the investment the number of negative types in many small watersheds has decreased fig 7a while close to the coastal area the negative type of some small watersheds in qh wc and hk still do not decrease indicating that these areas need more financial input in terms of benefit area the disaster prevention ability of each catchment all has been improved in a certain degree due to the related financial support for disaster prevention the catchments with high benefit area are mainly concentrated in hk and ld the spatial distribution of fund allocation in catchments is shown in fig 8 based on ega and topsis the allocation funds of all catchments for priority support have been obtained it is not difficult to find that the gap of financial support in different catchments is large the catchment with minimum investment is only 2400 yuan while the maximum one has reached 336 600 yuan such funds allocation results are based on the previous situation of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity of each catchment which make the allocation more scientific and reasonable generally the state allocates the money to the provincial units the provincial units to the municipal and county level units and then to the town level step by step based on the allocation funds on a catchment scale we can count the total amount of funds allocated to each township and county which will provide a macro result from meso scale realizing a scientific decision in real sense the distribution of funds at the township level is shown in fig 8b and that of county level is shown fig 8c since some townships do not have catchment requiring priority support there is no funding in these towns the town with the least investment is only 6700 yuan and the largest is 366 500 yuan on county level there is a wide gap in allocated funds among all counties tc and qz have no supported fund while hk has been allocated the most funds reaching 1 93 million in addition counties along coast like wc ld qh wn and sy have been allocated more money as these districts own high vulnerability these results can give local decision makers necessary references to the allocation of funds from multiple spatial scales which will be helpful for a more scientific disaster prevention decision 4 discussions in order to show the rationality and superiority of faom two comparison schemes are established here in general one area with more flash floods or more control villages list of villages to be priority controlled by local government should be supported by more fund for disaster reduction therefore one comparison scheme is based on the history flash floods intensity ratio and the other one is based on the density of villages in control areas the two schemes are defined as flash flood intensity scheme ffis and control village intensity scheme cvis respectively in ffis and cvis schemes the quantification of the new adaptive capacity and the ultimate objective function of each catchment is the same as that of the faom scheme 4 1 model rationality explanation the situation of funds allocation through ffis cvis and faom are different in the catchment town and county scales here we count the funds allocation from county scale to compare the results of the three schemes the results are shown in fig 9 in ffis qh is the county obtaining most support funds and it has been nearly 4 million while hk the capital city of hainan province is the area with the most support funds in both cvis and faom from this point of view we can see that the different focus of the three schemes will lead to different funds allocation results though different counties are allocated different funds the trend of funds in all counties are basically consistent among the three schemes the results show that faom has internal consistency with the other two conventional allocation ideas in a certain degree in addition normally the state allocates funds generally to provincial units and then to the municipal and county level very few can allocate funds to a catchment scale faom allocates funds from catchment scale to county scale making more scientific decisions in a real sense 4 2 model superiority explanation based on the fund allocation results of the three schemes the two objectives results of them can be obtained and are shown in fig 10 as the fig 4a presents the two objectives of cvis are both better than those of ffis moreover the faom own maximum positive type number and benefit area meanwhile among the three schemes which indicates the superiority of faom further the optimization rates of faom to ffis and cvis are shown in fig 4b the positive type number optimization rate and benefit area optimization rate from faom to ffis are 34 4 and 13 those from faom to cvis are 15 7 and 12 1 these results fully demonstrate the superiority of faom now we give the reasons for that in the process of solving faom the relationship between the three components of flash flood vulnerability exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity is fully considered involving the comprehensive role of various factors natural social anthropic and economical consequently the optimal solution to the allocation of funds can be found through faom while in ffis the focus of the funds allocation only is on natural disaster data some man made factors have not been fully considered in the process of resource allocation including the state of sensitivity and adaptive capacity therefore the allocation of funds for this scheme is not optimal as for cvis the choice of control villages is basically based on the government s rough expert argumentation and then gives a general plan of prevention in this process many factors are taken into account from a more comprehensive perspective than that of ffis this also explains why the object results of cvis scheme are superior to those of ffis of course it is obvious to find that cvis is still not as good as faom in summary the faom is superior to the cvis and the cvis is superior to the ffis 4 3 model further application the further application of the model in progressive recognition and phased support is designed for long term funding decisions in a particular region considering the sustainable development of society the framework is shown in fig 11 the application process is as follows the number of catchments with three negative type vulnerability will change after the disbursement of funds in the first stage these catchments may still stay as three negative type ones or change to two negative type ones or directly become one negative type catchments these catchments staying as three negative types ones need to continue to be invested until they become new two negative type ones next the new two negative type catchments and the previous two negative type catchments will form the present two negative type catchments which needs to support new funds then new one negative type catchments transferred from the two negative type catchments and the previous ones will form the present one negative type catchments the whole process presents a decision idea of progressive recognition and phased support the application of the framework will provide a practical scheme for disaster prevention and disaster reduction in a region 4 4 limitations disaster prevention itself is an extremely complex problem and the allocation of funds for disaster prevention is more difficult to determine the framework also has its own limitations due to limitations of data collection the index system needs to be further improved for providing a more scientific basis for fund allocation the indicators will be added in our future work shown as table 5 in addition the interaction between adjacent regions is not considered in faom although the influence of various factors on the allocation of funds is considered for example if two regions are adjacent what is the impact on one of the regions after the other one increases the disaster prevention measures meanwhile this model only focuses on the specific allocation of funds while fails to give the location of all kinds of measures in a specific distribution unit some improvements to the model require further study in the future 5 conclusions a novel multi objective framework is developed to allocate support funds to different regions with various degrees of disaster key outcomes of the study are as follows firstly faom different from previous resource allocation research is the focus of this study and multiple vulnerability assessment is incorporated into support funds allocation from multi space scales secondly an integrated issue concerning support funds allocation is transformed into a multi objective optimization model applied to provide decisions for flash floods managers in practice thirdly the whole framework is applied to the fund allocation in hainan island and the results has proved that the faom has rationality and superiority than conventional fund allocation strategy finally the faom can be further applied in disaster prevention and mitigation about the progressive recognition and phased support also the findings we present have some policy implications in terms of implementing disaster risk reduction program the progressive recognition and phased support framework developed based on faom will provide a practical policy guidance for disaster prevention and disaster reduction in a region in our research the model developed focuses on the specific allocation of funds while fails to give the location of all kinds of measures in a specific distribution unit in addition the interaction between adjacent regions is not considered in faom we leave the determination of the location of measures and the interaction effect among adjacent regions for future work credit authorship contribution statement weichao yang conceptualization

3867,support funds from national or subnational public spending provide essential assistance for flash floods reduction all around the world however how to allocate support funds to different regions with various degrees of disaster is a challenge for decision makers in this paper we develop a universal and novel multi objective framework to solve the problem at multi space scales the framework is coupled with the concept of multiple vulnerability and the fund allocation optimization model faom developed taking fully into account the impact of vulnerability on funds allocation elite genetic algorithm technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution and geographical detector are applied to solve the faom based on the case study in hainan island china and the model is compared with the other two fund allocation schemes results show that faom is able to find a better fund allocation program as such it offers a novel approach to solve the problem of funds allocation considering environmental social and economic factors in addition the further application of the model in progressive recognition and phased support is designed for long term funding decisions in a particular region considering the sustainable development of society keywords multi objective funds allocation flash flood vulnerability fund allocation optimization model 1 introduction flash flood is one of the most devastating disasters in the world causing substantial casualties and property losses lucía et al 2018 liu et al 2018 lian et al 2017 nielsen et al 2015 ahmadalipour and moradkhani 2019 diakakis et al 2020 serious disaster areas often need to inject a large amount of financial funds from national or subnational public spending for the construction of engineering measures and non engineering measures which are conducive to the local disaster prevention and mitigation the support funds mentioned here focuses on a relatively long term planning project rather than emergency funding in china the government has prepared the implementation plan of national mountain flood disaster prevention project for three years and the support funds will be shared by the central and local governments with increasing tight resources the total amount of support funds available for different regions is often insufficient so decision makers should try their best to invest the funds accurately and realize the maximum benefit to make more scientific decisions two problems need to be solved firstly identify those areas requiring relative priority support and secondly give a more precise funding plan for those areas that need priority support about the first problem some recent literature has examined the determinants of identifying priority support regions it was often determined by the degree of historical flash floods or the situation of prevention and control tasks in the past bubeck et al 2013 xu et al 2018 nahiduzzaman et al 2015 kablan et al 2017 karmakar et al 2010 huang et al 2011 increasingly more comprehensive concept and factors have been considered to help identify priority support areas vulnerability or risk is often used as basis for priority funding area selection karim and noy 2020 examined that flood hazard risk and socio economic vulnerability are both positively correlated with the sub district fiscal allocations weiler et al 2018 explored the influence of the vulnerability good governance and donor interests on priority support regions for adapting to the impacts of climate change ahmad and ma 2020 suggested that gender membership farmer size and injured members are the determinants in aid programe through specific case studies over recent years the term risk and vulnerability have become buzz words in natural hazard on the definition of risk ipcc defined it as the product of probability and consequence in 2001 ipcc 2001 and then argued it as the collection of hazard exposure and vulnerability in 2014 ipcc 2014 the european environment agency adopted the flood risk as the product of probability and consequence unep 2004 shehata and mizunaga 2018 kim and choi 2011 some scholars also explained risk as the collection of external risk and internal risk of which the external risk mainly refers to the potential loss brought by extreme events and the internal risk refers to the decision maker s decision in response to the unexpected situation that may cause greater risk roos et al 2017 on the definition of vulnerability it has become a popular term in the study of natural disasters and climate change which refers to disasters social economic population and ecological fields ipcc defined vulnerability as a function of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which is adopted by etc cca etcsia and iucn iucn 2010 swart et al 2012 ipcc 2007 then vulnerability is argued as the tendency of the system to be adversely affected in 2014 ipcc 2014 some scholars also emphasized that the definition of vulnerability depends largely on the purpose or the interest of the analysis fuchs et al 2011 here we adopted the definition of vulnerability as a set of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which generalize the possible impacts from disasters on regions considering environmental social and economic factors synthetically chang and huang 2015 adger 2006 andrade and szlafsztein 2018 in this paper the concept of multiple vulnerability from one of our papers which has been published yang et al 2018a is adopted to identify priority support regions multiple vulnerability here was defined as six types potential disaster loss potential economic development potential defense defect potential self organizing capability potential disaster frequency potential resources waste considering the relationship between exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity which will give a more comprehensive basis for priority funding area selection multiple vulnerability assessment can identify priority support regions but how to allocate funds to different regions accurately has always been a challenge namely the second problem indeed there are some related researches on resource allocation most of which are based on the model of emergency dispatch balcik et al 2008 altay and green 2006 anaya arenas et al 2014 galindo and batta 2013 al theeb and murray 2017 developed a resource distribution model incorporating features of multi commodity multi depot and multi period huang et al 2015 presented an integrated decision support model coupling humanitarian principle like lifesaving human suffering and fairness to optimizes resource allocation balcik et al 2008 proposed a mixed integer programming model for optimizing resource allocation in last mile of relief chain based on literature review we found that previous researches on fund allocation were mostly on account of historical disasters or specific comprehensive concepts like vulnerability or risk miller and vela 2014 lis and nickel 2010 hochrainer stigler et al 2014 karim and noy 2020 examined the directly observable determinants of subnational central to local public spending allocation for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation in bangladesh the authors set up a comprehensive indicator system with the primary focus on risk poverty and politics to explore the determinants of subnational public spending allocation for adaptive disaster risk reduction in the bangladeshi context meanwhile they established the links between social protection disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation and a methodological framework to assess the determinants of public spending allocation which play an important role in subnational public spending allocation however the research on optimal allocation of disaster prevention funds is still not mature especially for different space scales this paper contributes to the literature by offering a novel multi objective method to determine the allocation of support funds for flash flood reduction in multi space scales catchment town and county a methodological framework coupling the concept of multiple vulnerability and fund allocation optimization model faom is proposed to give theresults of optimal allocation of funds from the space scales of catchment town and county which helps to maximize the benefit of limited disaster prevention funds and can be generalized heuristic algorithm is a popular approach to solve mathematical model with multiple objectives cao et al 2018 among them genetic algorithm ga has attracted more attention because of its many advantages including few parameters good convergence fine robust and wide extension zheng et al 2015 su et al 2016 soleimani and kannan 2015 the basic principles of ga are as follows first the initial solution of solved problems is generated in a random way obtaining initial population then each individual is evaluated by the fitness function to eliminate the individuals next the individuals with high fitness will be selected to participate in the genetic operation and the individual set after genetic operation forms the next generation of new population then the next round of the new population is carried out however in the course of evolution the adaptive individuals in the current population may be destroyed to solve the problem de 1975 put forward the elite selection strategy which saving the best individuals to date in the population evolution and copying them to the next generation with probability 1 the algorithm formed by combining elite retention strategy with ga is called elitist genetic algorithm ega in this study ega is designed to solve the faom then technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution topsis is applied to find the final optimal scheme generally this paper is organized as follows in section 2 we introduce in detail the process of building the framework including multiple vulnerability assessment and the construction of fund allocation optimization model faom in section 3 the framework is applied to hainan island and the results of final fund allocation in different catchments towns and counties are obtained in section 4 the rationality and superiority of faom has been tested and explained meanwhile the further application of the model is discussed finally we give the conclusions and discuss the limitations of our work 2 framework development to solve the fund allocation problem in different areas a universal and novel multi objective framework for flash flood reduction based on the multiple vulnerability assessment and faom is developed here the framework consists of two modules like multiple vulnerability assessment and fund allocation optimization model in total of six steps fig 1 we will introduce the framework in detail next 2 1 multiple vulnerability assessment 2 1 1 step 1 establishment of index system in this study multiple vulnerability is defined as the interaction of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity lian et al 2017 exposure in this paper refers to the external pressure disturbance and related factors that may affect the magnitude of the pressure disturbance fuchs et al 2011 sensitivity is defined as the degree to which a system is likely to be affected by pressure or disturbance chang and huang 2015 adaptive capacity is regarded as the ability of a system to enhance its capability to adjust or respond by reducing potential impacts due to flash flood here yang et al 2018a based on literature summary carlo 2015 swart et al 2012 eea 2017 balica et al 2009 2012 koutroulis et al 2018 bălteanu 2015 aroca jimenez et al 2017 khazai et al 2013 karagiorgos et al 2016 terti et al 2015 ahmad and ma 2020 mahmood et al 2016 and the principles of being representative systematic measurable universal and operational the indicators to characterize the three components of vulnerability have been suggested as fig 2 exposure indicators here are suggested as maximum 10 minute rainfall maximum 1 hour rainfall maximum 6 hour rainfall maximum 24 hour rainfall maximum 6 hour rainfall annual rainfall elevation slope river density land use status soil type and vegetation type sensitivity indicators are selected as family economy housing value villages number population density and enterprise density the adaptive capacity index system includes engineering measures non engineering measures and financial state specifically the engineering measures are suggested as reservoir sluice culvert bridge embankment non engineering measures include automatic monitoring station simple water level station simple rainfall station wireless early warning station and the gross domestic product gdp is regarded as the financial state indicators 2 1 2 step 2 index weight determination the common methods of weight determination include subjective weighting delphi or analytic hierarchy process objective weighting entropy weight method and comprehensive weighting lee et al 2013 zeng et al 2016 all methods have their own advantages and disadvantages this paper proposes a new weighting method based on geographical detector the geographical detector is a novel statistical method proposed by wang et al 2010 the tool s core idea is based on the assumption that if one variable has a significant effect on a dependent variable then the two variables will have a similar spatial distribution the geographic detector is able to calculate the extent to which each indicator explains the spatial differentiation of a phenomenon the greater the interpretation force the closer the relationship between the index and the phenomenon and the greater weight of the corresponding index should be the geographical weighting method makes full use of the spatial distribution relationship between a certain phenomenon and each index avoiding the former subjectivity and simple objective but may not accord with the actual a detailed introduction to the principle of geographic detector is as follows define x as a categorical layer having impacts on the spatial distribution of y if the indicator layer x is not a categorical layer it needs to be classified based on specific principles such as natural breaks class equal interval class quantile class and so on in this study natural breaks class is adopted then the interpretation force if from x to y and the weight of each indicator are measured as 1 if 1 1 n σ 2 h 1 l n h σ h 2 2 σ h 2 1 n h 1 i 1 n h n h i n h 2 3 σ 2 1 n 1 j 1 n n j n 2 4 w j i f j j 1 m i f j where if represents the interpretation force from x to the distribution of y if is a value between 0 and 1 the larger the if the greater the explanatory power of x to y n is the number of samples in the study area σ2 means the global variance of y nh represents the samples number of y in zone h σ2 h is the variance of y in the zone h l is the number of zones nh i is the value of y in ith sample of zone h nh is the average value of y in zone h nj is the value of the jth sample unit in the whole study area n is the global average value of y in entire study area ifj is the interpretation force from the jth indicator to y m is the number of all the indicators selected and wj is the weight of the jth indicator 2 1 3 step 3 multiple vulnerability assessment vulnerability is regarded as a concept including three components like exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity they are characterized by a series of indicators respectively the specific quantification process is as follows 5 x ij z ij z ij min z ij max z ij min i 1 m 6 h i k j 1 n f ij ln f ij i 1 2 m 7 f ij w j x ij j 1 n w j x ij 8 k 1 ln n 9 u i 2 h i 10 e x i e x u i j 1 n w j x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 n 11 s e i s e u i j 1 n w j x ij i 1 2 m j 1 2 k 12 a c i j 1 n w j x ij a c u i i 1 2 m j 1 2 p where zij is the characterization value of the jth index in ith unit xij is the standardized value of the jth index in ith unit zij max is the maximum value of the jth index in the ith unit zij min is the minimum value of the jth index in the ith unit hi is the entropy value of all indicators in the ith unit ui is inhomogeneity of the ith unit proposed by yang et al 2018b exui seui and acui is the exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity inhomogeneity of the ith unit respectively and exi sei and aci is exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity respectively here we adopt the concept of multiple vulnerability from one of our papers which has been published yang et al 2018a six vulnerability indices namely potential disaster loss pdl potential economic development ped potential defense defect pdd potential self organizing capability psc potential disaster frequency pdf and potential resources waste prw have been developed based on the situation of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity table 1 these six vulnerability indices can be classified into positive and negative types for actual disaster prevention and mitigation table 1 so far based on the above formula and the definition of multiple vulnerability we can identify the multiple vulnerability of all units in study area 2 2 fund allocation optimization model faom construction how to allocate support funds to regions with different or the same degree of disaster has always been a challenge for policy makers here a fund allocation optimization model faom has been developed to solve the problem according to the results of multiple vulnerability assessment above 2 2 1 step 4 priority support region determination the degree of disaster should be the criterion to identify priority support regions previous definitions of the extent of the disaster may limit to historical flash floods or unilateral natural factors there is rarely a comprehensive consideration of environmental social and economic factors while the multiple vulnerability assessment overcome the above defects vulnerability is considered as an important concept to reflect the disaster risk in an area based on the results of multiple vulnerability assessment results the number of negative types of multiple vulnerability of all analysis units ought to be counted first then the units with three negative multiple vulnerability will be identified as the priority support regions 2 2 2 step 5 determine the input measures and benefit coefficient from the concept of multiple vulnerability pdl and ped reveal the relationship between exposure and sensitivity improving pdl to ped is difficult as the exposure reveals the impacts from natural factors which is always out of our control on the contrary it is easier to improve pdd to psc or pdf to prw by building related engineering measures and non engineering measures to increase the local adaptive capacity then the input measures can be identified by analyzing the effect of existing disaster prevention measures based on the geographical detector the relationship between the distribution of historical flash floods and the existing measures can be quantized the results are used to characterize the benefit coefficient of all input measures in addition considering the different effects of various measures on the prevention and control of flash floods and being likely to complement each other this paper recommends the balanced principle for the investment proportion of all measures the fund allocation proportion is based on the cost ratio of various measures 2 2 3 step 6 quantization and solution of fund allocation optimization model to maximize the benefits of investment a multi objective fund allocation optimization model faom has been established the model consists of two objection function constraints decision variable and model solution methods the details are as follows first in terms of disaster prevention objects the best decision is to transform the negative type into the positive type as the table 1 defined contributing to reduce the number of objects for fund allocation at the same time when a region fails to convert all negative types into positive ones the support fund invested will also produce a certain benefit after investment the three negative types of analysis unit may be transformed into the following types three negative single positive and double positive when a single negative type is transformed into a positive type in the same analysis unit 1 3 of the benefit target is achieved when the two negative types turn to positive types the benefit target has been completed 2 3 when the input of funds fails to produce negative type transformation the corresponding benefit area will also be generated due to the input of funds but it is less than 1 3 of the target so we define it as paci 3min exi sei based on the above considerations the maximum benefit area and the maximum number of positive types are identified as the potential rule of thumb for optimal fund allocation the two objective functions are defined as follows object function 1 the sum benefit area of all units in study area reaches maximum value the quantization of benefit area is shown as follows 13 f b a m a x b a 15 ba i 1 q pa c i s i 3 m i n e x i s e i i q 1 l 1 3 s i i l 1 n 2 3 s i p a c i a c i i a c i i 1 2 n 16 ia c i j 1 k m ij ω j i 1 2 n j 1 2 k 17 m ij y ij y ij min y ij max y ij min 18 y ij p ij i j where ba is the sum benefit area of all units in study area paci is the present adaptive capacity in the ith unit si is the area of the ith unit q is the number of units with none positive type vulnerability l q is the number of units with one positive type vulnerability n l is the number of units with two positive type vulnerability iaci is the added adaptive capacity due to the increase of non engineering measures the effect of index inhomogeneity on adaptive capacity should be positive and here we do not take into account it for safety considerations mij is the standardized value of the jth measure number in the ith unit wj is the benefit coefficient of the jth measure yij is the jth measure number in the ith unit pij is the investment of the jth measure in the ith unit and ij is the cost of the jth measure object function 2 the sum positive number of vulnerability of all units in study area achieves the maximum value the specific quantification formulas are as follows 19 f n u m m a x n u m 20 num i 1 n num p a c i e x i o r p a c i s e i i 1 2 n where num is the sum positive number of vulnerability of all units in study area max num is the maximum value of num constraints the model is subject to constraint like total funds constraints and is shown as follows 21 p i j 1 k p ij p i 1 n p i where pi is the investment in the ith unit pij is the investment of the jth measure in the ith unit and p is the total investment of all the study units decision variable results of allocation funds within each unit model solution the elitist genetic algorithm ega is applied to solve the model and the pareto optimal set will be obtained then the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution topsis is used to identify the optimal solution the core thought of topsis is to attempts to choose scheme that simultaneously has the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution mao et al 2016 it offers a cardinal ranking of the alternatives khagram et al 2003 in this study topsis is applied to find the optimum solution from pareto optimal set the formulas are as follows 22 a i j h i j i 1 l h i j 2 23 a a 1 a 2 a a 1 a 2 24 l i j 1 2 a i j a j 2 25 l i j 1 2 a i j a j 2 26 c i l i l i l i where ai j is the standardized value of the jth objective in the ith fund allocation scheme hi j is the value of the jth objective in the ith fund allocation scheme l is the number of all fund allocation schemes a is the maximal ideal solution set a1 is the maximum value of the first objective in all schemes a2 is the maximum value of the second objective in all schemes a is the minimum ideal solution set a1 is the minimum value of the first objective in all schemes a2 is the minimum value of the second objective in all schemes li is the distance from the ith alternative to the positive ideal solution li is the distance from the ith alternative to the negative ideal solution and ci is the relative closeness from the ith scheme to the ideal solution the scheme with the maximum ci will be identified as the optimal one 3 framework applications 3 1 study area hainan island is a tropical island in southern china with an area of 33 900 square kilometers and a population of 9 25 million the location map and the boundary of counties towns and catchments of hainan island are shown in fig 3 it is located between latitudes 18 38 and 19 02 n and longitudes 109 19 and 109 44 e the overall topography of hainan island presents the phenomenon that the middle area is high and the surrounding area is in a low level it is composed of annular stratiform landforms and the cascade structure is obvious the seasonal distribution of precipitation in hainan island is very uneven with dry and wet season from november to april of each year there is less rain accounting for only 10 of the annual rainfall and drought often occurs in the less rainy season from may to october each year there is more rain with a total rainfall of about 1500 mm accounting for 70 of the annual rainfall the main sources of rain are frontal rain hot thunderstorm and taiwan storm during the rainy season flash floods often occur and cause numerous casualties and property losses therefore the government has prepared the implementation plan of national mountain flood disaster prevention project for three years then there will be a lot of investment here for the construction of disaster prevention measures especially non engineering measures the allocation of support funds for non engineering measures in different regions is always a difficult problem for decision makers consequently the framework developed above will be applied to the study area 3 2 input data and quantization based on the index system developed in the framework the input data of hainan island are collected the data sources are presented as table 2 and the quantification and characterization value of each indicator will be described in detail as follows all exposure indicators consist of type and numerical variable the relationship between them and flash floods is difficult to be expressed by single positive or negative correlation also the effect of the numerical variable within different ranges of the same index on flash floods is different based on above considerations the average flash flood intensity is counted in zones classified of all the exposure indicators and they are selected as the characterization value of different exposure indicators then the average characterization value of indicators in each catchment can be obtained to characterize flash flood intensity a concept of crowding level is defined the crowding level of flash flood is calculated by the getis ord s gi statistic of hot spot analysis in geographic information system gis 10 2 getis ord s gi can both express the presence of local clustering and indicate the clustering of locations and intensity ahmad et al 2015 kao et al 2017 based on the spatial distribution of recorded flash floods the average standardized value of z score from getis ord s gi can be obtained then the value is defined as the crowding level to characterize the flash flood intensity in a catchment in terms of sensitivity indicators the average value of family economy housing value and population density in each catchment is regarded as the characterization value the crowding levels of villages and enterprises are selected as the characterization value in each catchment similarly about adaptive capacity indicators all engineering and non engineering measures are quantized by the crowding levels basing on the spatial distribution of them the average gdp is characterized as the characterization value in each catchment 3 3 results 3 3 1 multiple vulnerability of flash flood results based on the method of multiple vulnerability assessment developed above the results of exposure sensitivity adaptive capacity and the multiple vulnerability are obtained as fig 4 shows the overall distribution situation of exposure is that it is high in the northeastern part of the island and low in the southwest it indicates that flash floods erupt more frequently in the northeastern part of the island in terms of sensitivity it is easy to find that the coastal areas own higher sensitivity than that of inland areas the situation reflects the fact that the economy of coastal areas is more developed than that of inland areas the adaptive capacity of the whole island is gradually increasing from southwest to northeast which shows different attentions to flash flood prevention and control from the local people then the multiple vulnerability of flash flood can be obtained based on the results of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity from the relationship between exposure and sensitivity most areas in hainan island are in a negative type as pdl indicating that most regions own a high potential disaster frequency only a few of regions to the south of the island belong to positive type as ped in terms of the relationship between exposure and adaptive capacity the spatial distribution of positive and negative types is basically the same as that of exposure and sensitivity while about sensitivity and adaptive capacity it shows different spatial distribution laws of the positive and negative types from those of exposure and sensitivity coastal areas are negative type as pdd and the inland is positive type what needs to be emphasized is that all areas in negative type should be paid more attention for disaster prevention and mitigation 3 3 2 priority supported catchments determination to identify the priority supported catchments it should count the number of negative types vulnerability first fig 5 a shows the situation of negative types vulnerability in each catchment it is obvious to find that most catchments in coastal areas contain three negative types vulnerability which indicates that they should be supported first thus catchments with three negative types are selected as the priority support catchments and are shown in fig 5b it is obvious to find that counties like hk wc qh wn and ld owns the majority catchments for priority support 3 3 3 determine the input measures and benefit coefficient of them based on the availability of data this paper only considers the input of non engineering measures as a response to flash floods many non engineering measures like simple rainfall station simple water level station automatic monitoring station and wireless early warning station have been implemented in hainan island finished projects in years of 2010 to 2013 are mapped together with flash floods happened in 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014 fig 6 it is easy to find that the high concentration area of non engineering measures for 2010 2013 covers almost all of the high density areas of flash floods in 2009 2010 this shows that the layout of non engineering measures in 2010 2013 is reasonable after the implementation of non engineering measures the number of flash floods in areas with high intensity of non engineering is obviously reduced in 2013 to 2014 which further indicates that non engineering measures play an important role in reducing flash floods therefore the non engineering measures like simple rainfall station simple water level station automatic monitoring station and wireless early warning station should be determined as the planned input measures next year then the benefit coefficients of all measures input are determined by the geographical detector and the investment proportion of all measures are identified based on the cost of them the results are shown in the table 3 after all data has been prepared the faom can be calculated for finding the optimal solution in next stage 3 3 4 faom results statistically in the past three years the total support funds from national and subnational in non engineering measures including monitoring and early warning measures in hainan has reached 38 million yuan in general local government needs to allocate funds according to the current year s budget and disaster prevention requirements here based on the average investment over the past three years 12 million yuan is expected as the investment to hainan island next year it will be used as a capital entry condition for faom then the pareto optimal set can be obtained based on the faom the optimal allocation of funds for priority support regions can be obtained by topsis the results are shown in table 4 it is easy to find that the case 1 has the maximum c value so the allocation of funds of the case 1 should be selected as the final fund allocation scheme the two objectives of the scheme like number of active type and the benefit area are 672 and 4486 km2 respectively the spatial distribution of the two objectives are shown in fig 7 as a result of the investment the number of negative types in many small watersheds has decreased fig 7a while close to the coastal area the negative type of some small watersheds in qh wc and hk still do not decrease indicating that these areas need more financial input in terms of benefit area the disaster prevention ability of each catchment all has been improved in a certain degree due to the related financial support for disaster prevention the catchments with high benefit area are mainly concentrated in hk and ld the spatial distribution of fund allocation in catchments is shown in fig 8 based on ega and topsis the allocation funds of all catchments for priority support have been obtained it is not difficult to find that the gap of financial support in different catchments is large the catchment with minimum investment is only 2400 yuan while the maximum one has reached 336 600 yuan such funds allocation results are based on the previous situation of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity of each catchment which make the allocation more scientific and reasonable generally the state allocates the money to the provincial units the provincial units to the municipal and county level units and then to the town level step by step based on the allocation funds on a catchment scale we can count the total amount of funds allocated to each township and county which will provide a macro result from meso scale realizing a scientific decision in real sense the distribution of funds at the township level is shown in fig 8b and that of county level is shown fig 8c since some townships do not have catchment requiring priority support there is no funding in these towns the town with the least investment is only 6700 yuan and the largest is 366 500 yuan on county level there is a wide gap in allocated funds among all counties tc and qz have no supported fund while hk has been allocated the most funds reaching 1 93 million in addition counties along coast like wc ld qh wn and sy have been allocated more money as these districts own high vulnerability these results can give local decision makers necessary references to the allocation of funds from multiple spatial scales which will be helpful for a more scientific disaster prevention decision 4 discussions in order to show the rationality and superiority of faom two comparison schemes are established here in general one area with more flash floods or more control villages list of villages to be priority controlled by local government should be supported by more fund for disaster reduction therefore one comparison scheme is based on the history flash floods intensity ratio and the other one is based on the density of villages in control areas the two schemes are defined as flash flood intensity scheme ffis and control village intensity scheme cvis respectively in ffis and cvis schemes the quantification of the new adaptive capacity and the ultimate objective function of each catchment is the same as that of the faom scheme 4 1 model rationality explanation the situation of funds allocation through ffis cvis and faom are different in the catchment town and county scales here we count the funds allocation from county scale to compare the results of the three schemes the results are shown in fig 9 in ffis qh is the county obtaining most support funds and it has been nearly 4 million while hk the capital city of hainan province is the area with the most support funds in both cvis and faom from this point of view we can see that the different focus of the three schemes will lead to different funds allocation results though different counties are allocated different funds the trend of funds in all counties are basically consistent among the three schemes the results show that faom has internal consistency with the other two conventional allocation ideas in a certain degree in addition normally the state allocates funds generally to provincial units and then to the municipal and county level very few can allocate funds to a catchment scale faom allocates funds from catchment scale to county scale making more scientific decisions in a real sense 4 2 model superiority explanation based on the fund allocation results of the three schemes the two objectives results of them can be obtained and are shown in fig 10 as the fig 4a presents the two objectives of cvis are both better than those of ffis moreover the faom own maximum positive type number and benefit area meanwhile among the three schemes which indicates the superiority of faom further the optimization rates of faom to ffis and cvis are shown in fig 4b the positive type number optimization rate and benefit area optimization rate from faom to ffis are 34 4 and 13 those from faom to cvis are 15 7 and 12 1 these results fully demonstrate the superiority of faom now we give the reasons for that in the process of solving faom the relationship between the three components of flash flood vulnerability exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity is fully considered involving the comprehensive role of various factors natural social anthropic and economical consequently the optimal solution to the allocation of funds can be found through faom while in ffis the focus of the funds allocation only is on natural disaster data some man made factors have not been fully considered in the process of resource allocation including the state of sensitivity and adaptive capacity therefore the allocation of funds for this scheme is not optimal as for cvis the choice of control villages is basically based on the government s rough expert argumentation and then gives a general plan of prevention in this process many factors are taken into account from a more comprehensive perspective than that of ffis this also explains why the object results of cvis scheme are superior to those of ffis of course it is obvious to find that cvis is still not as good as faom in summary the faom is superior to the cvis and the cvis is superior to the ffis 4 3 model further application the further application of the model in progressive recognition and phased support is designed for long term funding decisions in a particular region considering the sustainable development of society the framework is shown in fig 11 the application process is as follows the number of catchments with three negative type vulnerability will change after the disbursement of funds in the first stage these catchments may still stay as three negative type ones or change to two negative type ones or directly become one negative type catchments these catchments staying as three negative types ones need to continue to be invested until they become new two negative type ones next the new two negative type catchments and the previous two negative type catchments will form the present two negative type catchments which needs to support new funds then new one negative type catchments transferred from the two negative type catchments and the previous ones will form the present one negative type catchments the whole process presents a decision idea of progressive recognition and phased support the application of the framework will provide a practical scheme for disaster prevention and disaster reduction in a region 4 4 limitations disaster prevention itself is an extremely complex problem and the allocation of funds for disaster prevention is more difficult to determine the framework also has its own limitations due to limitations of data collection the index system needs to be further improved for providing a more scientific basis for fund allocation the indicators will be added in our future work shown as table 5 in addition the interaction between adjacent regions is not considered in faom although the influence of various factors on the allocation of funds is considered for example if two regions are adjacent what is the impact on one of the regions after the other one increases the disaster prevention measures meanwhile this model only focuses on the specific allocation of funds while fails to give the location of all kinds of measures in a specific distribution unit some improvements to the model require further study in the future 5 conclusions a novel multi objective framework is developed to allocate support funds to different regions with various degrees of disaster key outcomes of the study are as follows firstly faom different from previous resource allocation research is the focus of this study and multiple vulnerability assessment is incorporated into support funds allocation from multi space scales secondly an integrated issue concerning support funds allocation is transformed into a multi objective optimization model applied to provide decisions for flash floods managers in practice thirdly the whole framework is applied to the fund allocation in hainan island and the results has proved that the faom has rationality and superiority than conventional fund allocation strategy finally the faom can be further applied in disaster prevention and mitigation about the progressive recognition and phased support also the findings we present have some policy implications in terms of implementing disaster risk reduction program the progressive recognition and phased support framework developed based on faom will provide a practical policy guidance for disaster prevention and disaster reduction in a region in our research the model developed focuses on the specific allocation of funds while fails to give the location of all kinds of measures in a specific distribution unit in addition the interaction between adjacent regions is not considered in faom we leave the determination of the location of measures and the interaction effect among adjacent regions for future work credit authorship contribution statement weichao yang conceptualization

3868,evapotranspiration et is a key variable linking the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere the strong energy exchanges between the soil and vegetation in the soil vegetation system and the lack of reliable soil moisture products at fine spatial scales especially for root zone soil moisture to directly model the effects of water stress on et estimates make it difficult to estimate actual et and its components soil evaporation es vegetation transpiration tc and rainfall interception ei in this paper we presented a soil vegetation evapotranspiration framework svet by combining the dual source shuttleworth and wallace sw physical model and satellite soil moisture data assimilation procedure in the svet model net radiation for the soil vegetation system was first partitioned among soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and rainfall interception then soil moisture was simulated for different soil layers based on the water balance providing a first guess estimate of soil moisture after that simulated soil moisture was improved by assimilating remotely sensed surface soil moisture to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture finally es tc and ei estimates were obtained the et estimates by the svet were evaluated against in situ measurements at three stations in the heihe river basin with different vegetation cover types crop grassland and forest the overall correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias were 0 931 0 67 mm d 1 and 0 07 mm d 1 respectively for the et components the bias of the estimated ratio of tc es tc is 11 4 in addition the svet model showed outstanding performance especially over irrigated areas compared with the results from the original sw model without a soil moisture data assimilation scheme the svet model is very promising for applications of water use monitoring of ecosystem especially for irrigated areas keywords evapotranspiration soil and vegetation shuttleworth and wallace data assimilation irrigated area 1 introduction evapotranspiration et from the soil vegetation system including evaporation es from the soil surface transpiration tc from vegetation by pumping water from the deep soil and vegetation rainfall interception ei that is evaporated water from a wet vegetated surface is the main way of water returning to the atmosphere and plays a key role in the water energy carbon cycle jasechko et al 2013 wang and dickinson 2012 xu et al 2018 et is a widely used variable in water resources management allen et al 2007 drought monitoring anderson et al 2011 water accounting karimi et al 2013 water productivity assessments teixeira et al 2009 and global change pan et al 2015 separating the et components es tc and ei can enhance the understanding of the global interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere xu et al 2018 high quality daily et and its components with high spatial resolution i e 1 km has great significance for the applications mentioned above for the soil vegetation system water energy inter exchange between soil and vegetation is an important process that cannot be ignored in estimating et fisher et al 2008 jia 2004 norman et al 1995 rodell et al 2004 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 tang et al 2010 when the sensible heat flux from soil is larger than that from vegetation e g a few days after irrigation when the surface soil moisture is less than at the root zone the upward sensible heat flux from dry soil can be intercepted by vegetation to increase transpiration on the contrary when the sensible heat flux from vegetation is larger than that from soil e g the soil moisture at the surface is greater than at the root zone after an irrigation or precipitation event a temperature inversion may occur due to the vegetation transferring more energy to sensible heat flux increasing its temperature compared to the underlying soil so that the downward sensible heat flux from the vegetation can be transferred to the soil to increase evaporation argentine et al 2007 among several et models norman et al 1995 su 2002 tang et al 2010a the dual source shuttleworth wallace sw model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 considers such water energy inter exchange with a series resistances and has been shown to have a solid physical mechanism for estimating es and tc cui et al 2021b elfarkh et al 2020 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 in the sw model the soil and canopy resistances play a core role in determining evaporation and transpiration respectively according to previous studies the soil resistance mainly depends on the surface soil moisture while canopy resistance relies on several factors including solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and root zone soil moisture jarvis 1976 zhu et al 2014 reanalysis forcing data can provide solar radiation air temperature and vapor pressure with high quality thus the surface and root zone soil moisture play a leading role in the parametrization of soil and canopy resistances and then in the performance of the sw model unfortunately obtaining reliable root zone soil moisture at a fine resolution is still a grand challenge a water balance based simulation for example using a hydrological and land surface model is currently the only effective way to obtain root zone soil moisture at the regional scale data assimilation is widely adopted to reduce cumulative errors by combining the model simulated soil moisture and satellite observations to obtain high temporal resolution surface and root zone soil moisture and reduce the uncertainty in simulated surface root zone soil moisture there are several global root zone soil moisture datasets such as gldas global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 and gleam global land surface evaporation amsterdam methodology martens et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of these products is too coarse e g at 25 km to be applied in fragmented farmland in irrigated areas in which watering events tend to be asynchronous these products are designed mainly to study global change rather than high resolution et estimates and motivate us to obtain reliable root zone soil moisture and high quality surface soil moisture with fine resolution especially for irrigated areas for which we often do not have irrigation information in this paper we propose a soil vegetation system evapotranspiration svet framework with the core of the sw model in land surface water balance simulation and data assimilation using satellite observations with the aim of generating high resolution and spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components by accurately expressing soil moisture constraints on evaporation and transpiration this work is a continuation of etmonitor proposed by hu and jia 2015 and aims to obtain high quality surface and root zone soil moisture and then improve the soil and vegetation resistances parameterization using directly soil moisture rather than a surrogate in this study the first application objective of the svet model is to improve cropland et estimates in irrigated areas but without irrigation information its performance for grass and forest was also evaluated the svet model is expected to contribute valuable information on et for water resources management with high spatial and temporal resolutions 2 model description as a successor of the etmonitor hu and jia 2015 and sw tvi cui et al 2021a the proposed svet model is based on the sw model and adopts the jarvis scheme for canopy resistance which describes the stress of solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and root zone soil moisture on the canopy resistance among these factors the root zone soil moisture is difficult to obtain and has a controlling effect on the transpiration additionally temporal continuous surface soil moisture with high spatial resolution has a controlling effect on the evaporation to accurately express the water stress of surface and root zone soil moisture on evaporation and transpiration data assimilation is adopted in the svet to obtain high quality surface and root zone soil moisture with fine resolution and then contribute to the soil and canopy resistance respectively because our main aim is to improve cropland et estimates in irrigated areas to improve water resource management only the evaporation transpiration and rainfall interception were considered unvegetated lands and snow sublimation were not included in this study fig 1 displays the structure of the svet model there are four important parts in the svet model 1 partition of net radiation for the soil vegetation system among soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and rainfall interception 2 soil moisture simulation based on the water balance in different soil layers which provides a preliminary soil moisture 3 improvement of soil moisture simulation by assimilating the downscaled remotely sensed surface soil moisture when available to reduce the uncertainty of simulated soil moisture in step 2 4 es tc and ei estimation in this scheme the sw model was used to estimate es and tc the ei was estimated by the rs gash model we proposed in previous studies cui et al 2017 cui et al 2015 the core objective of the svet model is obtaining more accurate soil and canopy resistance with the help of improved soil moisture via data assimilation 2 1 net radiation partition at the daily scale the soil heat flux is assumed to be 0 hence the net radiation r n w m 2 is equal to the available energy for a rainy day the net radiation r n is first partitioned into two parts for vegetation r n v w m 2 and soil r n s w m 2 using the fraction of vegetation cover fvc 1 r n r n v r n s 2 r n v f v c r n 3 r n s 1 f v c r n then the energy used for ei i e r n i is deducted from r n v leaving the canopy net radiation for tc i e r n c 4 r n c r n v r n i the energy balance of r n i can be expressed as 5 r n i λ e i h where λ e i is the vegetation rainfall interception loss w m 2 because a wet leaf and air have similar temperature here we assume h to be negligible hence 6 r n i λ e i 2 2 soil moisture the soil is divided into three layers anadranistakis et al 2000 miralles et al 2011 mo et al 2004 sellers et al 1986 to describe the water stress for es and tc the surface layer the root zone layer and the deep layer the surface layer thickness d 1 0 05 m soil moisture θ 1 acts as a water source of es the root zone layer thickness d 2 0 r o o t max 0 05 m soil moisture θ 2 where r o o t max is the maximum length of roots supplies water for the root to extract and the thickness of this layer is dynamic and depends on root development for crops and grass the deep layer thickness d 3 0 2 m root max soil moisture θ 3 acts as a water pool for developing roots and drainage during a rainy day after removal of intercepted precipitation p i the rest of the rainfall in terms of net rainfall p n enters into the soil surface layer d1 root zone layer d2 until it reaches the deep layer d3 when the above two layers cannot hold much more water at each layer the soil moisture on a given day t can be expressed as follows 7 θ t 1 θ t 1 1 q t 1 q t 1 2 e s t 1 d 1 8 θ t 2 θ t 1 2 q t 1 2 q t 2 3 t c t 1 d 2 9 θ t 3 θ t 1 3 q t 2 3 q t 3 d 3 where θ t i is the soil moisture at the i th layer on begining of t th day q i i 1 m m d 1 i 1 2 is the water flow from the i th layer to the i 1 th layer q 1 and q 3 are water flows into the first layer and out of the third layer respectively they are

horizontal movements of water between the adjacent area are not considered in the water balance calculation and the error of this simplification could be reduced through data assimilation section 2 3 keeping the svet model practical 2 3 data assimilation to simplify the svet model the horizontal movement of water e g surface runoff is not considered to reduce the effect of accumulated errors on the soil moisture simulation caused by the lack of information on the amount of irrigated water an ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 is adopted to assimilate the available remotely sensed surface soil moisture into the svet model to improve the surface root zone soil moisture simulations the enkf has been widely used in data assimilation under the framework of process models to improve model estimates huang et al 2008 merlin et al 2006 miralles et al 2011 it includes two steps 1 the forecast step an ensemble of svet forecasts is obtained and propagated forward in time with perturbations added for state variables 2 the update step an ensemble of model predictions is generated to estimate the background covariance for updating model predictions with observations where the covariance of observations is calculated by an ensemble of perturbed observations implements of assimilation are only achieved when the observation is available here the state variable vector of soil moisture is noted as s θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 t the model forecast can be expressed as 17 s t f i svet s t 1 f i ω t i ω t i ñ 0 q t where the superscripts f refer to state variables of the forecast s t f i is

transpiration and interception 2 4 1 rainfall interception the rs gash analysis rainfall interception model cui and jia 2014 cui et al 2017 was adopted to calculate daily ei unlike the empirical method used by previous studies bastiaanssen et al 2012 mo et al 2004 mu et al 2011a the rs gash model was developed based on the gash analysis model and can be used to calculate the interception loss by the total vegetation including green leaves dead leaves branch and trunk stem field validation at two forest hydrological experiment stations has shown reasonable accuracy two stations averaged correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are 0 93 and 0 47 mm d 1 respectively cui and jia 2014 independent work to estimate regional vegetation all types of vegetation interception loss in the heihe river basin showed that the rmse is about 4 7 for the averaged monthly interception ratio compared with the field measurements cui et al 2015 hence the rs gash model was adopted to calculate ei in this study 2 4 2 soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration to overcome the drawback of a big leaf model in describing the energy partition and considering the heat fluxes inter exchange for the soil vegetation system shuttleworth and wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed a dual source model sw model based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 according to the sw model the es and tc can be calculated as follows 20 e s δ r n s g ρ c p d 0 r a s δ γ 1 r s s r a s λ 21 t c δ r n c ρ c p d 0 r a c δ γ 1 r s c r a c λ where g is the soil heat flux density w

the study area is the heihe river basin fig 2 which lies between latitude 37 7 42 7 n and longitude 97 1 102 e the heihe river basin can be divided into three sub basins i e the upper middle and lower reaches according to the variability in topography precipitation and land cover as shown in fig 2 the elevations of the upper reach range from 2000 m to 5000 m above mean sea level a s l and mean annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm yr grass shrub and forest represent the major vegetation types in this semi arid climate the elevations of the middle reach range from 1000 m to 2000 m a s l with annual precipitation approximately 150 mm yr grass and cropland artificial oasis irrigated agriculture are the major vegetation types under an arid climate in the middle reach there are three artificial oases surrounded by a vast desert in contrast to the upper and middle reaches the lower reach is mainly dominated by gobi desert under an extreme arid climate with precipitation of less than 100 mm yr the heihe river supplies water to only a few areas along the river thus only a small area is covered by vegetation along the heihe river with forest and the end of the river where a natural oasis exists vegetated by a few crops and low shrubs and trees as a typical arid and semi arid area irrigation water in the artificial oasis are the dominant controlling factors of regional et li et al 2013 li et al 2009 3 2 in situ measurements there are three eddy covariance ec flux stations fig 2 that were operating in the study area during 2009 2011 to observe the total et and an isotope instrument to observe the et components covering different land covers table 1 this dataset was collected from the watershed allied telemetry experimental research water li et al 2009 and is provided by the national tibetan plateau data center liu et al 2018 the quality controlled 30 minute latent heat flux was aggregated to daily for comparison with the estimated et the yingke hereafter named yk station is in an artificial oasis with spring maize as the major crop and no crop cover in the winter due to scarce precipitation regular irrigation with about five events per year is the major water supply to the crops to ensure sufficient water for next year s crop with high soil moisture in the winter and the following spring one winter irrigation takes place in october the arou hereafter named ar and guantan hereafter named gt stations are located in the upper reach with higher elevation and here transpiration mainly occurs in the spring summer autumn at the yk station an automatic weather station aws was built to measure wind speed 3 m air temperature 3 m relative humidity 3 m air pressure four components of radiation fluxes and the sm profile at the depths of 10 cm

the point scale the ratio of tv es tv from stable isotopic in the middle stream of the heihe river daman was obtained during may october in 2012 wen et al 2016 which was covered by the crop this dataset was used to validate the accuracy of the et components estimation 3 3 meteorological forcing data the meteorological forcing dataset used in this study is from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 we selected this dataset because it combines station observations from china and has a high spatio temporal resolution data from the china meteorological administration cma station wind air temperature relative humidity precipitation and surface pressure etc trmm precipitation 3b42 gewex surface radiation budget gewex srb downward shortwave radiation and gldas data wind air temperature specific humidity and precipitation were used to produce the cmfd dataset the spatial and temporal resolution of this dataset is 0 1 and 3 hours the spatial resolution was downscaled to 0 01 using a dem and the semi empirical relationship cui et al 2021b gao et al 2008 stahl et al 2006 except for the wind speed and precipitation which were downscaled using the bilinear resampling method finally daily forcing data with a spatial resolution of 0 01 were obtained 3 4 remote sensing data ndvi 1 km 16 day lai 500 m 8 day and albedo 500 m daily from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis were downloaded from the modis website they were used to describe the energy partition canopy resistance and plants root growth daily and gap free ndvi lai products were obtained using hants harmonic analysis of time series jia et al 2011 1 gap free ndvi lai products were obtained using hants and then 2 a linear interpolation method was employed to obtain daily value the albedo product was reconstructed using temporal filter algorithms to obtain gap free time series liu et al 2013a the ascat soil moisture product estimated using the ers scatterometer and soil data wagner et al 2013 wagner et al 1999 was used the ascat soil moisture product has the unit of degree of saturation so the volumetric soil moisture content is obtained using the soil data see section 3 5 a previously developed algorithm on improving soil moisture spatial and temporal resolution based on multi source remote sensing data and general regression neural network grnn model was used to increase the spatial resolution of ascat soil moisture from 0 25 to 0 01 cui et al 2020a cui et al 2020c in this algorithm four high spatial resolution and gap free input variables including lst ndvi albedo and dem were first gap filled to obtain high spatio temporal resolution inputs then the grnn was trained at a low spatio temporal resolution finally the trained grnn was driven by the high spatio temporal resolution input variables to obtain high spatio temporal resolution soil moisture for more details about this algorithm readers are kindly referred to cui et al 2020a cui et al 2020c note that only the spatial resolution improved ascat soil moisture was used in the data assimilation of the svet model to reduce the uncertainty in temporal reconstruction the spatio temporal resolution improved ascat soil moisture was used in the sw rzsm model see section 4 as a comparative example 3 5 static data the land cover product with the igpb classification scheme was used to specify several vegetation type parameters such as minimum stomatal resistance and others table 2 the land cover was the result of the combination of many years of land use data with the mod12q products ran et al 2012 the soil property datasets were provided by the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters dai et al 2013 derived from multi ptfs pedotranfer functions estimation and includes the parameters in the functions of van genuchten and mualem fgm the dataset includes the saturated water content θ sat residual water content θ res and water content at wilting point θ wilt the water content at field capacity θ fc was taken as 0 15 for desert and 0 75 θ sat for other land covers dai et al 2013 mo et al 2004 4 results the evaluation of the svet modeled results included two parts first the svet model was driven by the in situ measured meteorological forcing data and surface root zone soil moisture to show the true performance of the model this is to avoid the uncertainty brought by the inputs data at regional scale second the svet model was driven by the reanalysis meteorological forcing data and remote sensing observations to show the overall performance at regional scale at regional scale to comprehensively understand the model performance two additional schemes based on the shuttleworth wallace dual source model were designed as comparisons with the full svet model 1 the svet noda model which is the svet model without using the data assimilation module 2 the sw rzsm model which is the shuttleworth wallace model driven by the root zone soil moisture from gleam martens et al 2017 the common statistical error metrics including the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and bias were adopted to quantify the level of agreement between the et estimates from the full svet the svet noda the sw rzsm and the in situ measurements entekhabi et al 2010a besides the total et the proposed svet model can also calculate the components es tc and ei the adopted rs gash vegetation rainfall interception analysis model has been evaluated in previous studies e g cui et al 2017 cui et al 2015 hence only the total et es tc ei es and tc were evaluated against in situ measurements in this study 4 1 performance of the svet model driven by in situ data over an irrigated area in this study we designed a case study in which the svet model was driven by in situ data over an irrigated area this excluded the uncertainty of the input data to show whether the svet model could simulate soil moisture correctly and then accurately simulate et improving the performance of the svet model over irrigated area is the main objective of this study the temporal resolution of most remotely sensed soil moisture products is about 2 3 days hence at the point scale we created a similar scene in which every 3 days the measured surface soil moisture was assimilated into the svet model in the assimilation process the error of model and observation were set as q 0 0008 0 0004 0 0001 and r 0 0001 0 0 respectively as a comparison we designed a scene of the svet model without data assimilation svet noda the forcing data was from the aws and the vegetation data of ndvi and lai was from modis the growing season with doy day of year from 150 to 270 in 2009 was chosen limited by the discontinuity in in situ observations of meteorological and radiation data in all of these scenes es and tc were estimated by the sw model and the ei was calculated by the rs gash model total et surface sm and root zone sm were validated against the in situ measurements as shown in fig 3 the rmse bias and r of the et estimates from the svet model in the growing season are 0 965 mm d 1 0 624 mm d 1 and 0 84 respectively showing to be highly consistent with the measured et the svet showed better performance than the sw noda with rmse bias and r of 2 962 mm d 1 2 890 mm d 1 and 0 26 respectively the rmse bias r of the modeled surface and root zone soil moisture by the svet vs the svet noda models in the growing season are 0 029 cm3 cm 3 0 007 cm3 cm 3 0 91 vs 0 144 cm3 cm 3 0 127 cm3 cm 3 0 4 and 0 031 cm3 cm 3 0 004 cm3 cm 3 0 71 vs 0 186 cm3 cm 3 0 179 cm3 cm 3 0 122 respectively results showed the ability of the svet model in estimating surface and root zone soil moisture and et the estimated surface root zone soil moisture by the assimilation procedure in the svet can be considered as a weighted average of observed and simulated values according to the data assimilation technology hence the assimilation of the satellite observed surface soil moisture is very useful to improve the soil moisture simulation both at surface and root zone especially in case of serious deviation from reality of the simulated soil moisture when there is not enough input of water information such as irrigation these results indicate a good performance of the svet model and that the data assimilation is necessary and can greatly improve performance of the svet model especially over irrigated areas where modeling of water budget is impracticable due to lack of the irrigation information overall the svet can provide quantitative et estimates with the acceptable accuracy relative to the measured et laying a foundation for further analysis at the regional scale 4 2 overall performance of the svet model driven by reanalysis meteorological forcing data and remote sensing observations fig 4 shows the total et estimates from the svet the svet noda and the sw rzsm models against the in situ observed et at yk ar and gt stations the overall r rmse and bias of the svet are 0 931 0 670 mm d 1 and 0 071 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 a the svet model showed better performance than the sw rzsm model with r rmse and bias of 0 822 0 890 mm d 1 and 0 250 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 b this is partly because the coarse resolution 25 km of root zone soil moisture from gleam used in the sw rzsm cannot accurately describe the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture at finer resolution i e 1 km the svet model also showed better performance than the svet noda model with r rmse and bias of 0 635 1 294 mm d 1 and 0 545 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 c this indicates that the simulated soil moisture has an accumulation of errors when satellite observation is not assimilated to correct the bias in water balance simulation the internal water energy exchange of the soil vegetation system and the water energy exchange between different types of vegetation and atmosphere are quite different hence it is necessary to assess the performance of the svet model under different land covers fig 5 a c show the results by comparing et estimates from the svet model against in situ measurements at the three stations covered by different vegetation types the svet model explains more than 85 of et variability over all the three stations meaning that the model has good performance the svet model showed the highest r at the ar station r 0 949 with low natural vegetation grass fig 5 b followed by the yk station r 0 931 also with low vegetation crop with frequent irrigation fig 5 a and gt station r 0 864 with tall vegetation forest fig 5 c absolute bias of all these stations is less than 0 2 mm day showing the very low systematic deviation of the svet model the rmse is lower than 0 83 mm day which can be compared with other models performance such as liu et al liu et al 2013b obtained average rmse of 0 83 mm day at five stations grass crop and forest using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator model according to the coefficient r the svet model performed better for low vegetation yk and ar stations than tall vegetation gt station meaning that there is larger room for improving the scheme of parameterization and the energy balance equation for tall vegetation for example the heat storage in the canopy should be taken into account for low vegetation the svet model performs better for natural vegetation ar station than irrigated cropland yk station as expected compared with the sw rzsm and the svet noda schemes however the svet model at the yk station with irrigated crop shows the most improved performance than at the ar station with grass and gt station with forest this is because the svet model can properly deal with the water balance modeling through assimilation of satellite observations of the surface soil moisture when irrigation information is lacking often happens at regional scale study overall the svet model can significantly improve the total et estimates compared to the sw rzsm and the svet noda models especially over irrigated areas besides the total et the svet model can also generate daily soil evaporation es and vegetation transpiration tc here we further examined the accuracy of tc estimated by the svet model during the vegetation growing season from may to october in 2012 following previous studies song et al 2018 song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 the tc es tc was used to evaluate the svet model in this study the tc es tc estimated by the svet the sw rzsm and the svet noda model were compared with the in situ measurements fig 6 the svet model showed the best performance with the lowest rmse of 14 1 and bias of 11 4 for tc es tc the negative bias underestimation in tc es tc corresponds to the positive bias overestimation in es es tc with 11 4 the sw rzsm and the svet noda model showed large underestimation of tc es tc due to a lack of irrigation information to fulfil the simulation of water balance to be noted is that the svet model also underestimated the tc es tc possibly because it might be overestimating es due to underestimated soil resistance which has been reported by previous studies zhu et al 2014 spikes in the estimated tc es tc by the svet noda model high values in the early and late growing seasons fig 6 is probably attributed to the very fast decrease in surface soil moisture e g after irrigation or precipitation events making the es approaching 0 this draws attention to improve the parameterization of soil surface resistance in future study 4 3 spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration estimates the spatial patterns of annual et and precipitation are shown in fig 7 the annual et decreases from the upper reach of the heihe river basin to the lower reach from south to north except for the artificial oasis irrigated area in the middle reach having extremely large et due to irrigation the significant spatial heterogeneity is a consequence of joint influence of precipitation climate land cover vegetation condition and human activity the annual et in the upper reach is the highest about 300 mm yr 1 on average ranging from about 400 mm yr 1 in the eastern heihe river basin to about 200 mm yr 1 in the western heihe river basin more precipitation and dense vegetation in the eastern portion of the upper reach make the annual et higher than other areas the annual et in the middle reach varies from 100 to 700 mm yr 1 due to different vegetation types the highest et is from the artificial oasis about 500 mm yr 1 due to the frequent irrigation every year next is the forest along with the heihe river with about 400 mm yr 1 in contrast the annual et from the desert is lower than 100 mm yr 1 and here precipitation becomes the main water resource the annual et in the lower reach of the heihe river basin varies from 50 mm yr 1 in the gobi to 300 mm yr 1 in the oasis the main water supply in the downstream oasis is from the heihe river the nearby juyan lake and groundwater jia et al 2011 as an inland river basin precipitation and glacier melting water are the water resource of the upper reach of the heihe river basin while runoff originated from the upper reach is the water source of the oasis in the middle and lower reaches where havingscarce precipitation fig 7 b the human activity e g irrigation practice played the key role in redistributing the water resources the water regulation programs have made water redistribution in the artificial oasis in the middle reach via irrigation and the natural oasis in the lower reach via groundwater recharge this makes it difficult to simulate accurately water balance without satellite data assimilation in particular for the irrigated area four vegetation types forest shrub grass and crop were chosen to show the difference in et between different soil vegetation systems fig 8 all of these soil vegetation systems showed a similar variation of monthly et where the maximum value occurs in july and the minimum value occurs in january for these four soil vegetation systems crops have the highest et while other three vegetation types have comparable et this is because the evaporated water is mainly from precipitation for other three vegetation but crops have an additional water supply from irrigation this is consistent with the knowledge that soil moisture is the main controlling factor of et for arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2016 the seasonal variation of et at the basin scale is very significant as shown in fig 9 the increasing trend of et from winter to summer is consistent with vegetation growth in summer the total et showed very large spatial contrast that extreme high values are observed in oasis especially in the croplands vegetation in summer is dense accompanied by more water supply to crops with irrigation which leads to much higher vegetation transpiration in summer than in other seasons and dominates the water balance of the soil vegetation system the vegetation becomes sparse in other seasons the evaporation turns to be the key component of the total et evaporation is controlled by both surface soil moisture and net radiation lower net radiation and lower surface soil moisture due to fewer precipitation and less or no irrigations in these seasons make the et lower than in summer in winter there is almost no difference in the svet the svet rzsm and the svet noda models fig 9 d h l 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies in the heihe river basin many approaches have been developed to estimate the et of the soil vegetation system typically including the tseb model penman monteith equation based modis et products and p t model based gleam et products jia et al 2003 jia et al 2009 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011b su 2002 for example song et al found that the tseb model can obtain et es and tc with rmse from 0 8 to 1 3 mm day 1 over different regions for the heihe river basin song et al 2018 under clear sky condition but at least 37 uncertainty was introduced under cloudy conditions by filling the gaps using a clear sky neighboring pixel sun et al 2017 we further compared the et estimates of the svet model against modis 500 m 8 day and gleam 0 25 daily et products fig 10 and table 3 compared with the gleam products the svet model showed more detailed information in space attributed to much higher spatial resolution by the svet the significant difference between the svet and the products of the gleam and modis is in the irrigated area in the middle reach of the heihe river basin where the svet model can capture the spatial variation in the oasis and the contrast between oasis and the surrounding gobi desert area against the in situ measurements the svet has improved the accuracy of estimate compared to the modis and gleam products with r rmse of 8 18 and 26 47 respectively table 3 the largest improvement of the svet model was found at the yk station with improved r rmse of 12 35 and 72 63 over the modis and gleam products respectively modis et products used atmospheric vapor pressure deficit as a surrogate for root zone soil moisture constraint on transpiration this might introduce additional uncertainties in et estimation zhang et al 2016 the gleam et product has coarser spatial resolution i e 0 25 than the footprint of the ec observations introducing an uncertainty in the validation especially for irrigated areas with strong heterogeneity of surface and root zone soil moisture at the ar station with low and relatively homogeneous vegetation cover there is a small difference between et estimates from these three et models at the gt station the modis product showed slightly better performance in addition to the total et the svet model can also produce the et components of es and tc song et al estimated the tc es tc at the daman station using the tseb model song et al 2018 with bias of 10 which is comparable with our results bias of 11 4 5 2 advantages and limitations of this study compared with the lst based et models the svet model can obtain all sky et without gap filling under cloudy conditions another distinguishing advantage of the svet model is that the core of shuttleworth wallace model has a better mechanism in describing the water heat exchange between the soil vegetation system and the atmosphere making it more suitable for sparsely vegetated surface than single source models big leaf model such as the traditional penman monteith equation and two sources models without considering internal energy exchanges between soil and vegetation martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011b additionally the control of soil moisture on evaporation and transpiration can be well presented by building the soil water balance module to simulate surface and root zone soil moisture with the support of data assimilation of satellite observed surface soil moisture in the assimilation procedure the value setup of model error and observations error is important for the performance of the data assimilation in the svet model these errors should be varying according to the land cover for example the model error for an irrigated area should be larger than that for other areas when irrigation information is not available on the other hand the observation error in low vegetation areas e g grassland should be smaller than in tall vegetation areas e g shrub and forest this is because larger uncertainty is expected in the surface soil moisture retrieved from microwave remote sensing observations for tall vegetation due to less penetration of signal to the dense and tall vegetation canopy land cover based refined setting of model and observation errors in data assimilation procedure might improve the performance of the svet model the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration is underestimated by about 11 4 in this study it is reasonable to infer that this is due to the underestimated soil resistance and overestimated canopy resistance improving these key resistances e g correction using in situ observations will improve the accuracy of the separation of the et components the estimated et can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in et over the study area with generally comparable and even higher accuracy than the published products cui et al 2020b the proposed svet model can help enhance the application of water resources management especially for irrigated areas however the performance of the svet model was evaluated and analyzed only in the heihe river basin with arid and semi arid area evaluation of the svet model in other climate zones e g semi humid area will be performed in the future in particular in many other agricultural regions with irrigation practice 6 conclusions this paper presented a soil vegetation system evapotranspiration svet framework with the shuttleworth wallace model as the core scheme and data assimilation using satellite observations the purpose of svet is to generate spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components by overcoming the difficulties in simulating accurately the soil moisture constraint on es and tc and reducing the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture on et estimates the et of the soil vegetation system in 2009 2012 in the heihe river basin was estimated by applying the proposed svet model driven by regional weather data and multi source remote sensing data comparison with the in situ data from three ec flux sites with different vegetation types showed good agreement major conclusions are given as follows 1 the in situ driven svet model can accurately simulate et surface and root zone soil moisture over complex surface conditions 2 the svet model can accurately estimate cropland et in an irrigated area when irrigation information not available for grass and forest the svet model showed better performance than the original shuttleworth wallace model sw rzsm driven by the root zone soil moisture from the existing data product e g glaeam and the svet without data assimilation scheme svet noda the overall r rmse and bias between the et estimates from the svet model and the in situ measurements are 0 931 0 670 mm d 1 and 0 071 mm d 1 these are better than the results of the et estimates from either the sw rzsm and the svet noda which have overall r of 0 822 and 0 635 rmse of 0 890 mm d 1 and 1 294 mm d 1 and bias of 0 250 mm d 1 and 0 545 mm d 1 respectively 3 compared with the et estimates from the sw rzsm and svet noda model the et estimates from the svet model can better reflect the spatial and temporal variability at stations with different land covers especially for the irrigated area additionally the svet model can better separate the es and tc from the total et than the sw rzsm and svet noda schemes in summary this study successfully built the svet model to estimate soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and vegetation rainfall interception the svet model can significantly improve the accuracy of et estimates at daily step and with 0 01 spatial resolution especially over an irrigated area the svet model can meet the needs for daily et monitoring for water resources management particularly in an irrigated area more validation work at continental or global scales and at field scales 30 m 30 m in other agricultural regions will be carried out in the

3868,evapotranspiration et is a key variable linking the energy and water exchanges between the land surface and the atmosphere the strong energy exchanges between the soil and vegetation in the soil vegetation system and the lack of reliable soil moisture products at fine spatial scales especially for root zone soil moisture to directly model the effects of water stress on et estimates make it difficult to estimate actual et and its components soil evaporation es vegetation transpiration tc and rainfall interception ei in this paper we presented a soil vegetation evapotranspiration framework svet by combining the dual source shuttleworth and wallace sw physical model and satellite soil moisture data assimilation procedure in the svet model net radiation for the soil vegetation system was first partitioned among soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and rainfall interception then soil moisture was simulated for different soil layers based on the water balance providing a first guess estimate of soil moisture after that simulated soil moisture was improved by assimilating remotely sensed surface soil moisture to reduce the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture finally es tc and ei estimates were obtained the et estimates by the svet were evaluated against in situ measurements at three stations in the heihe river basin with different vegetation cover types crop grassland and forest the overall correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and bias were 0 931 0 67 mm d 1 and 0 07 mm d 1 respectively for the et components the bias of the estimated ratio of tc es tc is 11 4 in addition the svet model showed outstanding performance especially over irrigated areas compared with the results from the original sw model without a soil moisture data assimilation scheme the svet model is very promising for applications of water use monitoring of ecosystem especially for irrigated areas keywords evapotranspiration soil and vegetation shuttleworth and wallace data assimilation irrigated area 1 introduction evapotranspiration et from the soil vegetation system including evaporation es from the soil surface transpiration tc from vegetation by pumping water from the deep soil and vegetation rainfall interception ei that is evaporated water from a wet vegetated surface is the main way of water returning to the atmosphere and plays a key role in the water energy carbon cycle jasechko et al 2013 wang and dickinson 2012 xu et al 2018 et is a widely used variable in water resources management allen et al 2007 drought monitoring anderson et al 2011 water accounting karimi et al 2013 water productivity assessments teixeira et al 2009 and global change pan et al 2015 separating the et components es tc and ei can enhance the understanding of the global interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere xu et al 2018 high quality daily et and its components with high spatial resolution i e 1 km has great significance for the applications mentioned above for the soil vegetation system water energy inter exchange between soil and vegetation is an important process that cannot be ignored in estimating et fisher et al 2008 jia 2004 norman et al 1995 rodell et al 2004 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 tang et al 2010 when the sensible heat flux from soil is larger than that from vegetation e g a few days after irrigation when the surface soil moisture is less than at the root zone the upward sensible heat flux from dry soil can be intercepted by vegetation to increase transpiration on the contrary when the sensible heat flux from vegetation is larger than that from soil e g the soil moisture at the surface is greater than at the root zone after an irrigation or precipitation event a temperature inversion may occur due to the vegetation transferring more energy to sensible heat flux increasing its temperature compared to the underlying soil so that the downward sensible heat flux from the vegetation can be transferred to the soil to increase evaporation argentine et al 2007 among several et models norman et al 1995 su 2002 tang et al 2010a the dual source shuttleworth wallace sw model shuttleworth and wallace 1985 considers such water energy inter exchange with a series resistances and has been shown to have a solid physical mechanism for estimating es and tc cui et al 2021b elfarkh et al 2020 shuttleworth and wallace 1985 in the sw model the soil and canopy resistances play a core role in determining evaporation and transpiration respectively according to previous studies the soil resistance mainly depends on the surface soil moisture while canopy resistance relies on several factors including solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and root zone soil moisture jarvis 1976 zhu et al 2014 reanalysis forcing data can provide solar radiation air temperature and vapor pressure with high quality thus the surface and root zone soil moisture play a leading role in the parametrization of soil and canopy resistances and then in the performance of the sw model unfortunately obtaining reliable root zone soil moisture at a fine resolution is still a grand challenge a water balance based simulation for example using a hydrological and land surface model is currently the only effective way to obtain root zone soil moisture at the regional scale data assimilation is widely adopted to reduce cumulative errors by combining the model simulated soil moisture and satellite observations to obtain high temporal resolution surface and root zone soil moisture and reduce the uncertainty in simulated surface root zone soil moisture there are several global root zone soil moisture datasets such as gldas global land data assimilation system rodell et al 2004 and gleam global land surface evaporation amsterdam methodology martens et al 2017 however the spatial resolution of these products is too coarse e g at 25 km to be applied in fragmented farmland in irrigated areas in which watering events tend to be asynchronous these products are designed mainly to study global change rather than high resolution et estimates and motivate us to obtain reliable root zone soil moisture and high quality surface soil moisture with fine resolution especially for irrigated areas for which we often do not have irrigation information in this paper we propose a soil vegetation system evapotranspiration svet framework with the core of the sw model in land surface water balance simulation and data assimilation using satellite observations with the aim of generating high resolution and spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components by accurately expressing soil moisture constraints on evaporation and transpiration this work is a continuation of etmonitor proposed by hu and jia 2015 and aims to obtain high quality surface and root zone soil moisture and then improve the soil and vegetation resistances parameterization using directly soil moisture rather than a surrogate in this study the first application objective of the svet model is to improve cropland et estimates in irrigated areas but without irrigation information its performance for grass and forest was also evaluated the svet model is expected to contribute valuable information on et for water resources management with high spatial and temporal resolutions 2 model description as a successor of the etmonitor hu and jia 2015 and sw tvi cui et al 2021a the proposed svet model is based on the sw model and adopts the jarvis scheme for canopy resistance which describes the stress of solar radiation air temperature vapor pressure deficit and root zone soil moisture on the canopy resistance among these factors the root zone soil moisture is difficult to obtain and has a controlling effect on the transpiration additionally temporal continuous surface soil moisture with high spatial resolution has a controlling effect on the evaporation to accurately express the water stress of surface and root zone soil moisture on evaporation and transpiration data assimilation is adopted in the svet to obtain high quality surface and root zone soil moisture with fine resolution and then contribute to the soil and canopy resistance respectively because our main aim is to improve cropland et estimates in irrigated areas to improve water resource management only the evaporation transpiration and rainfall interception were considered unvegetated lands and snow sublimation were not included in this study fig 1 displays the structure of the svet model there are four important parts in the svet model 1 partition of net radiation for the soil vegetation system among soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and rainfall interception 2 soil moisture simulation based on the water balance in different soil layers which provides a preliminary soil moisture 3 improvement of soil moisture simulation by assimilating the downscaled remotely sensed surface soil moisture when available to reduce the uncertainty of simulated soil moisture in step 2 4 es tc and ei estimation in this scheme the sw model was used to estimate es and tc the ei was estimated by the rs gash model we proposed in previous studies cui et al 2017 cui et al 2015 the core objective of the svet model is obtaining more accurate soil and canopy resistance with the help of improved soil moisture via data assimilation 2 1 net radiation partition at the daily scale the soil heat flux is assumed to be 0 hence the net radiation r n w m 2 is equal to the available energy for a rainy day the net radiation r n is first partitioned into two parts for vegetation r n v w m 2 and soil r n s w m 2 using the fraction of vegetation cover fvc 1 r n r n v r n s 2 r n v f v c r n 3 r n s 1 f v c r n then the energy used for ei i e r n i is deducted from r n v leaving the canopy net radiation for tc i e r n c 4 r n c r n v r n i the energy balance of r n i can be expressed as 5 r n i λ e i h where λ e i is the vegetation rainfall interception loss w m 2 because a wet leaf and air have similar temperature here we assume h to be negligible hence 6 r n i λ e i 2 2 soil moisture the soil is divided into three layers anadranistakis et al 2000 miralles et al 2011 mo et al 2004 sellers et al 1986 to describe the water stress for es and tc the surface layer the root zone layer and the deep layer the surface layer thickness d 1 0 05 m soil moisture θ 1 acts as a water source of es the root zone layer thickness d 2 0 r o o t max 0 05 m soil moisture θ 2 where r o o t max is the maximum length of roots supplies water for the root to extract and the thickness of this layer is dynamic and depends on root development for crops and grass the deep layer thickness d 3 0 2 m root max soil moisture θ 3 acts as a water pool for developing roots and drainage during a rainy day after removal of intercepted precipitation p i the rest of the rainfall in terms of net rainfall p n enters into the soil surface layer d1 root zone layer d2 until it reaches the deep layer d3 when the above two layers cannot hold much more water at each layer the soil moisture on a given day t can be expressed as follows 7 θ t 1 θ t 1 1 q t 1 q t 1 2 e s t 1 d 1 8 θ t 2 θ t 1 2 q t 1 2 q t 2 3 t c t 1 d 2 9 θ t 3 θ t 1 3 q t 2 3 q t 3 d 3 where θ t i is the soil moisture at the i th layer on begining of t th day q i i 1 m m d 1 i 1 2 is the water flow from the i th layer to the i 1 th layer q 1 and q 3 are water flows into the first layer and out of the third layer respectively they are calculated by the following equations miralles et al 2011 mo et al 2004 sellers et al 1986 10 q t 1 p n t p m e l t i n g 11 q t i i 1 θ t i θ fc d i θ t i θ fc 0 θ t i θ fc 12 q t 3 θ t 3 θ fc d 3 θ

horizontal movements of water between the adjacent area are not considered in the water balance calculation and the error of this simplification could be reduced through data assimilation section 2 3 keeping the svet model practical 2 3 data assimilation to simplify the svet model the horizontal movement of water e g surface runoff is not considered to reduce the effect of accumulated errors on the soil moisture simulation caused by the lack of information on the amount of irrigated water an ensemble kalman filter enkf evensen 1994 is adopted to assimilate the available remotely sensed surface soil moisture into the svet model to improve the surface root zone soil moisture simulations the enkf has been widely used in data assimilation under the framework of process models to improve model estimates huang et al 2008 merlin et al 2006 miralles et al 2011 it includes two steps 1 the forecast step an ensemble of svet forecasts is obtained and propagated forward in time with perturbations added for state variables 2 the update step an ensemble of model predictions is generated to estimate the background covariance for updating model predictions with observations where the covariance of observations is calculated by an ensemble of perturbed observations implements of assimilation are only achieved when the observation is available here the state variable vector of soil moisture is noted as s θ 1 θ 2 θ 3 t the model forecast can be expressed as 17 s t f i svet s t 1 f i ω t i ω t i ñ 0 q t where the superscripts f refer to state variables of the forecast s t f i is

transpiration and interception 2 4 1 rainfall interception the rs gash analysis rainfall interception model cui and jia 2014 cui et al 2017 was adopted to calculate daily ei unlike the empirical method used by previous studies bastiaanssen et al 2012 mo et al 2004 mu et al 2011a the rs gash model was developed based on the gash analysis model and can be used to calculate the interception loss by the total vegetation including green leaves dead leaves branch and trunk stem field validation at two forest hydrological experiment stations has shown reasonable accuracy two stations averaged correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse are 0 93 and 0 47 mm d 1 respectively cui and jia 2014 independent work to estimate regional vegetation all types of vegetation interception loss in the heihe river basin showed that the rmse is about 4 7 for the averaged monthly interception ratio compared with the field measurements cui et al 2015 hence the rs gash model was adopted to calculate ei in this study 2 4 2 soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration to overcome the drawback of a big leaf model in describing the energy partition and considering the heat fluxes inter exchange for the soil vegetation system shuttleworth and wallace shuttleworth and wallace 1985 proposed a dual source model sw model based on the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 according to

the study area is the heihe river basin fig 2 which lies between latitude 37 7 42 7 n and longitude 97 1 102 e the heihe river basin can be divided into three sub basins i e the upper middle and lower reaches according to the variability in topography precipitation and land cover as shown in fig 2 the elevations of the upper reach range from 2000 m to 5000 m above mean sea level a s l and mean annual precipitation is approximately 400 mm yr grass shrub and forest represent the major vegetation types in this semi arid climate the elevations of the middle reach range from 1000 m to 2000 m a s l with annual precipitation approximately 150 mm yr grass and cropland artificial oasis irrigated agriculture are the major vegetation types under an arid climate in the middle reach there are three artificial oases surrounded by a vast desert in contrast to the upper and middle reaches the lower reach is mainly dominated by gobi desert under an extreme arid climate with precipitation of less than 100 mm yr the heihe river supplies water to only a few areas along the river thus only a small area is covered by vegetation along the heihe river with forest and the end of the river where a natural oasis exists vegetated by a few crops and low shrubs and trees as a typical arid and semi arid area irrigation water in the artificial oasis are the dominant controlling factors of regional et li et al 2013 li et al 2009 3 2 in situ measurements there are three eddy covariance ec flux stations fig 2 that were operating in the study area during 2009 2011 to observe the total et and an isotope instrument to observe the et components covering different land covers table 1 this dataset was collected from the watershed allied telemetry experimental research water li et al 2009 and is provided by the national tibetan plateau data center liu et al 2018 the quality controlled 30 minute latent heat flux was aggregated to daily for comparison with the estimated et the yingke hereafter named yk station is in an artificial oasis with spring maize as the major crop and no crop cover in the winter due to scarce precipitation regular irrigation with about five events per year is the major water supply to the crops to ensure sufficient water for next year s crop with high soil moisture in the winter and the following spring one winter irrigation takes place in october the arou hereafter named ar and guantan hereafter named gt stations are located in the upper reach with higher elevation and here transpiration mainly occurs in the spring summer autumn at the yk station an automatic weather station aws was built to measure wind speed 3 m air temperature 3 m relative humidity 3 m air pressure four components of radiation fluxes and the sm profile at the depths of 10 cm 20 cm 40 cm 80 cm 120 cm 160 cm the surface 5 cm and root zone 5 45 cm sm in 2009 was extracted from the sm profile using a quadratic polynomial fitting this dataset was used to validate our model at the point scale the ratio of tv es tv from stable isotopic in the middle stream of the heihe river daman was obtained during may october in 2012 wen et al 2016 which was covered by the crop this dataset was used to validate the accuracy of the et components estimation 3 3 meteorological forcing data the meteorological forcing dataset used in this study is from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd he et al 2020 we selected this dataset because it combines station observations from china and has a high spatio temporal resolution data from the china meteorological administration cma station wind air temperature relative humidity precipitation and surface pressure etc trmm precipitation 3b42 gewex surface radiation budget gewex srb downward shortwave radiation and gldas data wind air temperature specific humidity and precipitation were used to produce the cmfd dataset the spatial and temporal resolution of this dataset is 0 1 and 3 hours the spatial resolution was downscaled to 0 01 using a dem and the semi empirical relationship cui et al 2021b gao et al 2008 stahl et al 2006 except for the wind speed and precipitation which were downscaled using the bilinear resampling method finally daily forcing data with a spatial resolution of 0 01 were obtained 3 4 remote sensing data ndvi 1 km 16 day lai 500 m 8 day and albedo 500 m daily from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis were downloaded from the modis website they were used to describe the energy partition canopy resistance and plants root growth daily and gap free ndvi lai products were obtained using hants harmonic analysis of time series jia et al 2011 1 gap free ndvi lai products were obtained using hants and then 2 a linear interpolation method was employed to obtain daily value the albedo product was reconstructed using temporal filter algorithms to obtain gap free time series liu et al 2013a the ascat soil moisture product estimated using the ers scatterometer and soil data wagner et al 2013 wagner et al 1999 was used the ascat soil moisture product has the unit of degree of saturation so the volumetric soil moisture content is obtained using the soil data see section 3 5 a previously developed algorithm on improving soil moisture spatial and temporal resolution based on multi source remote sensing data and general regression neural network grnn model was used to increase the spatial resolution of ascat soil moisture from 0 25 to 0 01 cui et al 2020a cui et al 2020c in this algorithm four high spatial resolution and gap free input variables including lst ndvi albedo and dem were first gap filled to obtain high spatio temporal resolution inputs then the grnn was trained at a low spatio temporal resolution finally the trained grnn was driven by the high spatio temporal resolution input variables to obtain high spatio temporal resolution soil moisture for more details about this algorithm readers are kindly referred to cui et al 2020a cui et al 2020c note that only the spatial resolution improved ascat soil moisture was used in the data assimilation of the svet model to reduce the uncertainty in temporal reconstruction the spatio temporal resolution improved ascat soil moisture was used in the sw rzsm model see section 4 as a comparative example 3 5 static data the land cover product with the igpb classification scheme was used to specify several vegetation type parameters such as minimum stomatal resistance and others table 2 the land cover was the result of the combination of many years of land use data with the mod12q products ran et al 2012 the soil property datasets were provided by the china dataset of soil hydraulic parameters dai et al 2013 derived from multi ptfs pedotranfer functions estimation and includes the parameters in the functions of van genuchten and mualem fgm the dataset includes the saturated water content θ sat residual water content θ res and water content at wilting point θ wilt the water content at field capacity θ fc was taken as 0 15 for desert and 0 75 θ sat for other land covers dai et al 2013 mo et al 2004 4 results the evaluation of the svet modeled results included two parts first the svet model was driven by the in situ measured meteorological forcing data and surface root zone soil moisture to show the true performance of the model this is to avoid the uncertainty brought by the inputs data at regional scale second the svet model was driven by the reanalysis meteorological forcing data and remote sensing observations to show the overall performance at regional scale at regional scale to comprehensively understand the model performance two additional schemes based on the shuttleworth wallace dual source model were designed as comparisons with the full svet model 1 the svet noda model which is the svet model without using the data assimilation module 2 the sw rzsm model which is the shuttleworth wallace model driven by the root zone soil moisture from gleam martens et al 2017 the common statistical error metrics including the correlation coefficient r the root mean square error rmse and bias were adopted to quantify the level of agreement between the et estimates from the full svet the svet noda the sw rzsm and the in situ measurements entekhabi et al 2010a besides the total et the proposed svet model can also calculate the components es tc and ei the adopted rs gash vegetation rainfall interception analysis model has been evaluated in previous studies e g cui et al 2017 cui et al 2015 hence only the total et es tc ei es and tc were evaluated against in situ measurements in this study 4 1 performance of the svet model driven by in situ data over an irrigated area in this study we designed a case study in which the svet model was driven by in situ data over an irrigated area this excluded the uncertainty of the input data to show whether the svet model could simulate soil moisture correctly and then accurately simulate et improving the performance of the svet model over irrigated area is the main objective of this study the temporal resolution of most remotely sensed soil moisture products is about 2 3 days hence at the point scale we created a similar scene in which every 3 days the measured surface soil moisture was assimilated into the svet model in the assimilation process the error of model and observation were set as q 0 0008 0 0004 0 0001 and r 0 0001 0 0 respectively as a comparison we designed a scene of the svet model without data assimilation svet noda the forcing data was from the aws and the vegetation data of ndvi and lai was from modis the growing season with doy day of year from 150 to 270 in 2009 was chosen limited by the discontinuity in in situ observations of meteorological and radiation data in all of these scenes es and tc were estimated by the sw model and the ei was calculated by the rs gash model total et surface sm and root zone sm were validated against the in situ measurements as shown in fig 3 the rmse bias and r of the et estimates from the svet model in the growing season are 0 965 mm d 1 0 624 mm d 1 and 0 84 respectively showing to be highly consistent with the measured et the svet showed better performance than the sw noda with rmse bias and r of 2 962 mm d 1 2 890 mm d 1 and 0 26 respectively the rmse bias r of the modeled surface and root zone soil moisture by the svet vs the svet noda models in the growing season are 0 029 cm3 cm 3 0 007 cm3 cm 3 0 91 vs 0 144 cm3 cm 3 0 127 cm3 cm 3 0 4 and 0 031 cm3 cm 3 0 004 cm3 cm 3 0 71 vs 0 186 cm3 cm 3 0 179 cm3 cm 3 0 122 respectively results showed the ability of the svet model in estimating surface and root zone soil moisture and et the estimated surface root zone soil moisture by the assimilation procedure in the svet can be considered as a weighted average of observed and simulated values according to the data assimilation technology hence the assimilation of the satellite observed surface soil moisture is very useful to improve the soil moisture simulation both at surface and root zone especially in case of serious deviation from reality of the simulated soil moisture when there is not enough input of water information such as irrigation these results indicate a good performance of the svet model and that the data assimilation is necessary and can greatly improve performance of the svet model especially over irrigated areas where modeling of water budget is impracticable due to lack of the irrigation information overall the svet can provide quantitative et estimates with the acceptable accuracy relative to the measured et laying a foundation for further analysis at the regional scale 4 2 overall performance of the svet model driven by reanalysis meteorological forcing data and remote sensing observations fig 4 shows the total et estimates from the svet the svet noda and the sw rzsm models against the in situ observed et at yk ar and gt stations the overall r rmse and bias of the svet are 0 931 0 670 mm d 1 and 0 071 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 a the svet model showed better performance than the sw rzsm model with r rmse and bias of 0 822 0 890 mm d 1 and 0 250 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 b this is partly because the coarse resolution 25 km of root zone soil moisture from gleam used in the sw rzsm cannot accurately describe the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture at finer resolution i e 1 km the svet model also showed better performance than the svet noda model with r rmse and bias of 0 635 1 294 mm d 1 and 0 545 mm d 1 respectively fig 4 c this indicates that the simulated soil moisture has an accumulation of errors when satellite observation is not assimilated to correct the bias in water balance simulation the internal water energy exchange of the soil vegetation system and the water energy exchange between different types of vegetation and atmosphere are quite different hence it is necessary to assess the performance of the svet model under different land covers fig 5 a c show the results by comparing et estimates from the svet model against in situ measurements at the three stations covered by different vegetation types the svet model explains more than 85 of et variability over all the three stations meaning that the model has good performance the svet model showed the highest r at the ar station r 0 949 with low natural vegetation grass fig 5 b followed by the yk station r 0 931 also with low vegetation crop with frequent irrigation fig 5 a and gt station r 0 864 with tall vegetation forest fig 5 c absolute bias of all these stations is less than 0 2 mm day showing the very low systematic deviation of the svet model the rmse is lower than 0 83 mm day which can be compared with other models performance such as liu et al liu et al 2013b obtained average rmse of 0 83 mm day at five stations grass crop and forest using the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator model according to the coefficient r the svet model performed better for low vegetation yk and ar stations than tall vegetation gt station meaning that there is larger room for improving the scheme of parameterization and the energy balance equation for tall vegetation for example the heat storage in the canopy should be taken into account for low vegetation the svet model performs better for natural vegetation ar station than irrigated cropland yk station as expected compared with the sw rzsm and the svet noda schemes however the svet model at the yk station with irrigated crop shows the most improved performance than at the ar station with grass and gt station with forest this is because the svet model can properly deal with the water balance modeling through assimilation of satellite observations of the surface soil moisture when irrigation information is lacking often happens at regional scale study overall the svet model can significantly improve the total et estimates compared to the sw rzsm and the svet noda models especially over irrigated areas besides the total et the svet model can also generate daily soil evaporation es and vegetation transpiration tc here we further examined the accuracy of tc estimated by the svet model during the vegetation growing season from may to october in 2012 following previous studies song et al 2018 song et al 2016 wen et al 2016 the tc es tc was used to evaluate the svet model in this study the tc es tc estimated by the svet the sw rzsm and the svet noda model were compared with the in situ measurements fig 6 the svet model showed the best performance with the lowest rmse of 14 1 and bias of 11 4 for tc es tc the negative bias underestimation in tc es tc corresponds to the positive bias overestimation in es es tc with 11 4 the sw rzsm and the svet noda model showed large underestimation of tc es tc due to a lack of irrigation information to fulfil the simulation of water balance to be noted is that the svet model also underestimated the tc es tc possibly because it might be overestimating es due to underestimated soil resistance which has been reported by previous studies zhu et al 2014 spikes in the estimated tc es tc by the svet noda model high values in the early and late growing seasons fig 6 is probably attributed to the very fast decrease in surface soil moisture e g after irrigation or precipitation events making the es approaching 0 this draws attention to improve the parameterization of soil surface resistance in future study 4 3 spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration estimates the spatial patterns of annual et and precipitation are shown in fig 7 the annual et decreases from the upper reach of the heihe river basin to the lower reach from south to north except for the artificial oasis irrigated area in the middle reach having extremely large et due to irrigation the significant spatial heterogeneity is a consequence of joint influence of precipitation climate land cover vegetation condition and human activity the annual et in the upper reach is the highest about 300 mm yr 1 on average ranging from about 400 mm yr 1 in the eastern heihe river basin to about 200 mm yr 1 in the western heihe river basin more precipitation and dense vegetation in the eastern portion of the upper reach make the annual et higher than other areas the annual et in the middle reach varies from 100 to 700 mm yr 1 due to different vegetation types the highest et is from the artificial oasis about 500 mm yr 1 due to the frequent irrigation every year next is the forest along with the heihe river with about 400 mm yr 1 in contrast the annual et from the desert is lower than 100 mm yr 1 and here precipitation becomes the main water resource the annual et in the lower reach of the heihe river basin varies from 50 mm yr 1 in the gobi to 300 mm yr 1 in the oasis the main water supply in the downstream oasis is from the heihe river the nearby juyan lake and groundwater jia et al 2011 as an inland river basin precipitation and glacier melting water are the water resource of the upper reach of the heihe river basin while runoff originated from the upper reach is the water source of the oasis in the middle and lower reaches where havingscarce precipitation fig 7 b the human activity e g irrigation practice played the key role in redistributing the water resources the water regulation programs have made water redistribution in the artificial oasis in the middle reach via irrigation and the natural oasis in the lower reach via groundwater recharge this makes it difficult to simulate accurately water balance without satellite data assimilation in particular for the irrigated area four vegetation types forest shrub grass and crop were chosen to show the difference in et between different soil vegetation systems fig 8 all of these soil vegetation systems showed a similar variation of monthly et where the maximum value occurs in july and the minimum value occurs in january for these four soil vegetation systems crops have the highest et while other three vegetation types have comparable et this is because the evaporated water is mainly from precipitation for other three vegetation but crops have an additional water supply from irrigation this is consistent with the knowledge that soil moisture is the main controlling factor of et for arid and semi arid areas zhang et al 2016 the seasonal variation of et at the basin scale is very significant as shown in fig 9 the increasing trend of et from winter to summer is consistent with vegetation growth in summer the total et showed very large spatial contrast that extreme high values are observed in oasis especially in the croplands vegetation in summer is dense accompanied by more water supply to crops with irrigation which leads to much higher vegetation transpiration in summer than in other seasons and dominates the water balance of the soil vegetation system the vegetation becomes sparse in other seasons the evaporation turns to be the key component of the total et evaporation is controlled by both surface soil moisture and net radiation lower net radiation and lower surface soil moisture due to fewer precipitation and less or no irrigations in these seasons make the et lower than in summer in winter there is almost no difference in the svet the svet rzsm and the svet noda models fig 9 d h l 5 discussion 5 1 comparison with other studies in the heihe river basin many approaches have been developed to estimate the et of the soil vegetation system typically including the tseb model penman monteith equation based modis et products and p t model based gleam et products jia et al 2003 jia et al 2009 martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011b su 2002 for example song et al found that the tseb model can obtain et es and tc with rmse from 0 8 to 1 3 mm day 1 over different regions for the heihe river basin song et al 2018 under clear sky condition but at least 37 uncertainty was introduced under cloudy conditions by filling the gaps using a clear sky neighboring pixel sun et al 2017 we further compared the et estimates of the svet model against modis 500 m 8 day and gleam 0 25 daily et products fig 10 and table 3 compared with the gleam products the svet model showed more detailed information in space attributed to much higher spatial resolution by the svet the significant difference between the svet and the products of the gleam and modis is in the irrigated area in the middle reach of the heihe river basin where the svet model can capture the spatial variation in the oasis and the contrast between oasis and the surrounding gobi desert area against the in situ measurements the svet has improved the accuracy of estimate compared to the modis and gleam products with r rmse of 8 18 and 26 47 respectively table 3 the largest improvement of the svet model was found at the yk station with improved r rmse of 12 35 and 72 63 over the modis and gleam products respectively modis et products used atmospheric vapor pressure deficit as a surrogate for root zone soil moisture constraint on transpiration this might introduce additional uncertainties in et estimation zhang et al 2016 the gleam et product has coarser spatial resolution i e 0 25 than the footprint of the ec observations introducing an uncertainty in the validation especially for irrigated areas with strong heterogeneity of surface and root zone soil moisture at the ar station with low and relatively homogeneous vegetation cover there is a small difference between et estimates from these three et models at the gt station the modis product showed slightly better performance in addition to the total et the svet model can also produce the et components of es and tc song et al estimated the tc es tc at the daman station using the tseb model song et al 2018 with bias of 10 which is comparable with our results bias of 11 4 5 2 advantages and limitations of this study compared with the lst based et models the svet model can obtain all sky et without gap filling under cloudy conditions another distinguishing advantage of the svet model is that the core of shuttleworth wallace model has a better mechanism in describing the water heat exchange between the soil vegetation system and the atmosphere making it more suitable for sparsely vegetated surface than single source models big leaf model such as the traditional penman monteith equation and two sources models without considering internal energy exchanges between soil and vegetation martens et al 2017 mu et al 2011b additionally the control of soil moisture on evaporation and transpiration can be well presented by building the soil water balance module to simulate surface and root zone soil moisture with the support of data assimilation of satellite observed surface soil moisture in the assimilation procedure the value setup of model error and observations error is important for the performance of the data assimilation in the svet model these errors should be varying according to the land cover for example the model error for an irrigated area should be larger than that for other areas when irrigation information is not available on the other hand the observation error in low vegetation areas e g grassland should be smaller than in tall vegetation areas e g shrub and forest this is because larger uncertainty is expected in the surface soil moisture retrieved from microwave remote sensing observations for tall vegetation due to less penetration of signal to the dense and tall vegetation canopy land cover based refined setting of model and observation errors in data assimilation procedure might improve the performance of the svet model the ratio of evaporation to evapotranspiration is underestimated by about 11 4 in this study it is reasonable to infer that this is due to the underestimated soil resistance and overestimated canopy resistance improving these key resistances e g correction using in situ observations will improve the accuracy of the separation of the et components the estimated et can well reflect spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability in et over the study area with generally comparable and even higher accuracy than the published products cui et al 2020b the proposed svet model can help enhance the application of water resources management especially for irrigated areas however the performance of the svet model was evaluated and analyzed only in the heihe river basin with arid and semi arid area evaluation of the svet model in other climate zones e g semi humid area will be performed in the future in particular in many other agricultural regions with irrigation practice 6 conclusions this paper presented a soil vegetation system evapotranspiration svet framework with the shuttleworth wallace model as the core scheme and data assimilation using satellite observations the purpose of svet is to generate spatio temporally continuous daily et and its components by overcoming the difficulties in simulating accurately the soil moisture constraint on es and tc and reducing the uncertainty of the simulated soil moisture on et estimates the et of the soil vegetation system in 2009 2012 in the heihe river basin was estimated by applying the proposed svet model driven by regional weather data and multi source remote sensing data comparison with the in situ data from three ec flux sites with different vegetation types showed good agreement major conclusions are given as follows 1 the in situ driven svet model can accurately simulate et surface and root zone soil moisture over complex surface conditions 2 the svet model can accurately estimate cropland et in an irrigated area when irrigation information not available for grass and forest the svet model showed better performance than the original shuttleworth wallace model sw rzsm driven by the root zone soil moisture from the existing data product e g glaeam and the svet without data assimilation scheme svet noda the overall r rmse and bias between the et estimates from the svet model and the in situ measurements are 0 931 0 670 mm d 1 and 0 071 mm d 1 these are better than the results of the et estimates from either the sw rzsm and the svet noda which have overall r of 0 822 and 0 635 rmse of 0 890 mm d 1 and 1 294 mm d 1 and bias of 0 250 mm d 1 and 0 545 mm d 1 respectively 3 compared with the et estimates from the sw rzsm and svet noda model the et estimates from the svet model can better reflect the spatial and temporal variability at stations with different land covers especially for the irrigated area additionally the svet model can better separate the es and tc from the total et than the sw rzsm and svet noda schemes in summary this study successfully built the svet model to estimate soil evaporation vegetation transpiration and vegetation rainfall interception the svet model can significantly improve the accuracy of et estimates at daily step and with 0 01 spatial resolution especially over an irrigated area the svet model can meet the needs for daily et monitoring for water resources management particularly in an irrigated area more validation work at continental or global scales and at field scales 30 m 30 m in other agricultural regions will be carried out in the

3869,the yangtze river estuary and its surrounding seas have had the highest degree of eutrophication in china xiangshan bay located at the southern bank of the yangtze river is not immune from eutrophication leading to the water quality below the control requirements for marine functional zoning clarifying the nutrient criteria is essential to alleviate eutrophication in xiangshan bay we used a generalized pareto distribution based peaks over threshold model to analyze 2006 2018 survey data through calculation inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria in xiangshan bay at the five percentile are 0 443 mg l and 0 025 mg l respectively additionally we also obtained the corresponding confidence intervals rationality and sensitivity analyses of the calculation results proved the methods used in this study to be rational and reliable providing a basis for subsequent monitoring and assessment of nutrient salts in bays keywords generalized pareto distribution peaks over the threshold bay water quality confidence interval sensitivity analysis 1 introduction eutrophication resulting from human activities has become a major factor in deteriorating water quality and threatening marine ecosystems in near seas worldwide chislock et al 2013 karydis and kitsiou 2012 eutrophication may adversely impact the biological integrity in coastal seas resulting in a decrease in the population of fishes and shellfishes deegan et al 2012 diaz and rosenberg 2008 glasgow and burkholder 2000 public health may even be under threat barrera et al 2001 due to the proliferation of algae anderson et al 2002 tang et al 2019 and the water borne diseases transmission who 2003 during past decades of development the continuous input of nitrogen and phosphorus into coastal waters has caused severe eutrophication wang et al 2018 as a result the yangtze river estuary and nearby seas have been major regions suffering deteriorating water quality chai et al 2006 dai et al 2011 xiangshan bay is not immune from the problem due to its geological location the south bank of the yangtze river the key to alleviating the eutrophication in the bay area lies in the determination of nutrient criteria before controlling the nitrogen and phosphorus emitted into waters thus improving the environmental condition of seas schindler 2006 smith and schindler 2009 the u s environmental protection agency epa defined nutrient criteria as the maximum acceptable concentration without threatening the specific beneficial purpose of water bodies us epa 1998 based on the definition of meng et al 2006 2008 we defined the nutrient criteria of a bay as the maximum dose or concentration of an environmental nutrient parameter without adverse or harmful impact on the bay area our definition covers a broader content than the epa s definition as the specific beneficial purpose of water bodies in the latter is too vague and complicated to fulfill in practice the u s formulated regional nutrient criteria strategy at the national level in 1998 perciasepe 1998 following by a series of nutrient criteria technical guidelines for different water bodies huo et al 2017 the european union issued the european water framework directive in 2000 and established relevant research institutions to study nutrient criteria bouleau and pont 2015 pardo et al 2012 solheim 2005 the current compiling method of the nutrient criteria of bay waters mainly involves statistical analysis similar to the one applied to lake waters the method also uses historical and current data of the study site for analysis such as population distribution method yang et al 2019 and inflection point analysis huang et al 2015 kress et al 2019 which heavily relies on abundant historical data model prediction method studies continuous changes in site environmental parameters and achieves constant extreme evaluation through various models including the stressor response model us epa 2010 bayesian model ramin et al 2011 and system dynamics model zhang et al 2018 such models could help us obtain the expected nutrient criteria however it is not easy to stimulate the water ecosystem of bays since the geological area is a semi closed system involving complicated human activities and other factors moreover it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of data in such a large volume marine sedimentology could examine how human activities affect bay nutrients in a long time series in which the diatom based transfer function andrén et al 2017 weckström et al 2007 is commonly utilized the typical example includes using benthic foraminifera to monitor disturbances in bay background concentrations which has become a popular method in recent years hess et al 2020 in a bay that is greatly involved in human activities as xiangshan bay the nutrient concentration in the seawater is rarely lower than the nutrient reference value due to the perennial eutrophication status frequency analysis and other common statistical methods are not appropriate to determine the baseline value of high nutrient concentration in water bodies as these methods fail to give a confidence interval to assess the accuracy of the calculation results therefore it is worth trying to use extreme value models to analyze the water quality status of the observed values below a certain concentration in the determination of the nutrient reference value hua and wang 2013 hua et al 2014 given this the study adopted the 2006 2018 xiangshan bay survey data together with the peaks over threshold pot model to calculate the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria for xiangshan bay obtaining corresponding 95 confidence intervals china s coastal regions especially gulf areas have been suffering from eutrophication for a long time although the chinese government has carried out ecological restoration projects a clear nutrient criteria value for the restoration target is still absent therefore this article attempts to use the peaks over threshold model to establish appropriate nutrient criteria values for eutrophication ridden waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study site xiangshan bay is located in the northern sea area of zhejiang province south of the yangtze river delta xiangshan bay is connected to the east china sea by the niubishan and fodu fairway wu et al 2020 lying from the northeast to the southwest its geographical coordinates are 29 24 29 48 n and 121 23 122 03 e there are three secondary bays in xiangshan bay the xihu inlet huangdun inlet and tie inlet the centerline of the bay is approximately 60 km long the outer bay is trumpet shaped with the widest distance of the mouth at 20 km the average water depth is 10 m yang et al 2018 while the maximum depth reaches 55 m the coastlines of xiangshan bay are approximately 270 km in total mao et al 2013 covering a water body area of around 365 km2 xu et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the specific spatial location xiangshan bay is overwhelmed with human activities even possessing a mariculture history of more than 400 years even today the place is still full of commercial and fishing piers supported by two conventional power plants in the area huang et al 2018 2 2 data sources and preliminary analysis we obtained datasets of 433 stations collected in 25 voyages between april 2006 to august 2018 the spatial distribution of the sampling stations and the inorganic nitrogen active phosphate concentrations at each station are set out in the appendix data are divided into top middle and bottom layers at some stations we selected the lowest concentrations from the three layers as representative measurements for a relatively small criteria value among the 433 datasets the maximum minimum and average inorganic nitrogen concentrations were 1 585 mg l 0 032 mg l and 0 696 mg l respectively while the reactive phosphate concentration at the three levels was 0 969 mg l 0 014 mg l and 0 077 mg l respectively 2 3 study methods extreme value theory builds a model of abnormal data to process data that seriously deviate from the mean value the model also describes quantiles at the tail to predict the possibility of future events based on the random features of existing data according to the extreme value theory the classical models are the peaks over threshold pot model smith 1987 corresponding to generalized pareto distribution gpd hosking and wallis 1987 and the block maxima method bmm ferreira and de haan 2015 corresponding to generalized extreme value distribution gev bali 2003 though the two main methods are for the fitting of tail distribution based on sample data the main differences between the two are reflected in the sample data selection the pot model determines thresholds with the initial sample data and groups data exceeding the threshold into a new sample pack on the contrary the bmm model effectively arranges initial sample data into groups before obtaining the maximum value in each group after which the data will be organized into new sample data curceac et al 2020 the bmm model only extracts the lowest observed value in each group to calculate the criteria and corresponding confidence intervals thus discarding the remaining observation data as a result there could be a loss of observation data and information hua et al 2014 given the abovementioned analysis the pot model was selected for this work we adopted the evir package in the r 4 0 3 platform r core team 2020 to streamline the calculations pfaff 2016 in the method 2 3 1 theoretical foundation of the pot model 1 generalized pareto distribution curceac et al 2020 lechner et al 1993 1 g μ ξ β x 1 1 ξ x μ β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 e x μ β ξ 0 the equation satisfies x μ and 1 ξ x μ β 0 μ r is a position parameter î¾ r is a shape parameter and β r is a scale parameter generally the equation uses double parameters or where î¼ 0 the double parameter function is expressed as 2 g ξ β x 1 1 ξ x β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 e x β ξ 0 2 peaks over threshold loss distribution function zhao et al 2018 where the population distribution is f x x i i 1 2 n is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables and u represents threshold values then y i x i u i 1 2 n represents values exceeding the threshold termed as an excess loss the pot distribution f u y is expressed in the following equation 3 f u y p y y x u f y u f u 1 f u for a sufficiently large threshold value u the pot loss distribution function can be approximated using the generalized pareto distribution 4 lim u

conformance analysis 1 fat tail test the foundation of pot fitting is to ensure that data have sharp peaks and fat tails to be specific for the same sample data the probability of extreme value distribution is greater than that of normal distribution the quantile quantile plot q q plot is one of the main methods for fat tail test dhar et al 2014 utilizing x i i 1 2 3 n as sample data if the scatter plot is approximate to a straight line in the about formed by the horizontal axis of sample order and the vertical axis of normally distributed expected values in the sample data the graph obeys the linear normal variable quantile distribution upward tail deviation means faster growth of normal quantile and fat tail distribution otherwise there will be a thin tail distribution 2 pareto test the pareto test converted a function to conform to the pareto distribution to present a straight line the specific method utilizes x i i 1 2 3 n as sample data and goes through standardization i e y i x i μ σ if scattered plots are close to a straight line in the about structured by the horizontal axis of logarithmic coordinates and the vertical axis of 1 f x the sample data is considered compliant with pareto distribution wu et al 2017 2 3 3 threshold selection the reasonable selection of threshold values directly affects parameter estimation for the pot model langousis et al 2016 excess loss data will be reduced if the threshold is too high leading to an over high scale parameter estimation β if the threshold is too low there will be parameter bias making the fitting not available generally the mean excess function mef hill plot and residual fitting method liu 2014 are appropriate for the study in this paper thus we adopted the first two methods for calculations 1 mean excess function the principle of mef dierckx et al 2009 ghosh and resnick 2010 is to solve the excess random variables over the threshold for the calculation of the mean accordingly we plotted a function plot with u as the horizontal axis and e n u as the vertical axis if the function curve of certain sample data shows a linear trend then they can be considered a suitable threshold value u if the gradient of that threshold value is positive the shape parameter î¾ of the generalized pareto distribution followed by the sample data is positive the specific calculation formula is shown as below 7 e n u e x u x u i 1 n x i u n where x i i 1 2 3 n is sample data and n is the number of samples that exceed the threshold 2 hill plot the principle of the hill plot hill 1975 huisman et al 1998 wang et al 2012 is to arrange sample data in ascending order to obtain the corresponding order h k n subsequently we plotted a function plot with sample order k as the horizontal axis and h k n 1 as the vertical axis the x coordinate of the starting point for stable tail index region in the function is set as a suitable threshold assuming the statistic of the sample order is x 1 x 2 x n then the specific calculation method is 8 h k n 1 k i 1 k ln x i x k k 1 2 n 1 2 3 4 data calculation the parameter estimation of a small sample size adopts the maximum likelihood estimation method based on gpd distribution and the probability density function is as shown as below 9 f x 1 β 1 ξ x β 1 1 ξ ξ 0 e x β β ξ 0 for excess loss y i x i u i 1 2 n its maximum likelihood function is 10 l x i 1 k ln f x i n ln β 1 1 ξ i 1 n ln 1 ξ x i β the partial derivative for parameters î¾ and β is set as 0 to obtain the values of the double parameters 11 1 ξ i 1 k k i β ξ y i n i 1 n ln 1 ξ x i β ξ n 2 3 5 calculation of quantile and its confidence interval 1 calculation of top quantile the equation below produces the quantile z p with 0 q 1 12 z p u β î¾ n n u 1 q 1 2 confidence interval calculation we calculated the confidence interval with the delta method from the asymptotic normality of values to be estimated in the maximum likelihood function taylor expansion was used to obtain the confidence intervals for parameters in the distribution function hence the boundaries of the confidence interval can be expressed in the following equation 13 z u l z p â k î var z p z p â k î d p v d p t z u l represent the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval in î 1 p 2 we selected the 95 confidence interval or p 0 95 k î is the probability for a normally distributed î quantile in which k 0 025 1 96 var z p is the error at the p cumulative probability while v is the fisher information matrix which can be calculated based on the covariance matrix of the target likelihood function l x d p is the partial derivative vector of various parameters in the likelihood function 14 v var ξ cov ξ β cov β ξ var β 15 d p z p ξ z p β 3 results within a reasonable range smaller inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria mean better water quality however the pot model focuses on large values in sample data therefore the model selected the reciprocal values observed as sample data to adapt to this evaluation method 3 1 model conformance analysis 1 normal quantile quantile plot q q plot the q q plots reflecting the inorganic nitrogen reciprocal fig 2 a and reactive phosphate reciprocal fig 3 a deviate upwards from the normal straight line showing the rapid empirical quantiles increase and compliance with the fat tail characteristic 2 pareto plot the pareto plot demonstrating the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen fig 2b is basically distributed in a straight line indicating that normal distribution is not appropriate to fit loss data the generalized pareto distribution function requires fit analysis of sample data while the pareto plot illustrating the reactive phosphate reciprocal fig 3b shows a straight line distribution within the range of x axis 8 50 3 2 threshold selection for the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen in fig 4 a the function curve shows significant linearity and an increasing trend between the threshold value 1 and 2 according to fig 5 a the curve stabilizes in the sample sequences 114 135 generally the threshold value u 1 718 is the lowest point of the excess mean curve while the corresponding number of sample n u exceeding the threshold u would be 125 similar to the method used to determine the inorganic nitrogen criteria as showed in fig 4b and fig 5b the reciprocal threshold value u of reactive phosphate is 27 792 while the corresponding number of samples n u is 111 3 3 parameter calculation for the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen the calculation of the shape parameter î¾ based on the maximum likelihood estimation for generalized pareto distribution parameters as shown in eq 11 is 0 692 with 95 confidence interval in 0 680 0 704 the scale parameter β is 0 157 with 95 confidence interval in 0 155 0 160 moreover the distribution function can be expressed based on eq 6 as f x 1 125 433 1 0 692 x 1 718 0 157 1 0 692 x 1 718 the tail fitting plot fig 6 a and exceedance distribution plot fig 7 a are effectively fitted proving that the selected parameters are reasonable for reciprocal of reactive phosphate the shape parameter î¾ is 0 131 with 95 confidence intervals in 0 120 0 142 while the scale parameter β is 6 577 with 95 confidence intervals falling in 6 483 6 670 the distribution function is expressed as f x 1 111 433 1 0 131 x 27 792 6 577 1 0 131 x 27 792 the tail fitting plot fig 6b and exceedance distribution plot fig 7b has a reliable fitting effect 3 4 calculation of quantiles and their confidence intervals according to the lake methods the epa suggests using the 25th quantile gibson et al 2000 which however is applied to cases where lakes or seas are in good condition on the contrary xiangshan bay the selected study area of this paper has severe eutrophication additionally it is also necessary to adopt the 5th quantile value for evaluation for the purpose of marine environment conservation under regulatory requirements chen et al 2010 according to eq 12 the value of z p for inorganic nitrogen is 2 256 and eq 13 calculated that 95 confidence intervals fall in 2 097 2 415 thus the inorganic nitrogen concentration is the reciprocal of the above value at 0 443 mg l and corresponding 95 confidence intervals fall in 0 414 0 477 similar to the inorganic nitrogen criterion the criterion for reactive phosphate concentration is 0 025 mg l with a corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 024 0 027 4 discussion 4 1 rationality analysis of calculation results 4 1 1 comparative analysis of selected criteria and historical data xiangshan bay has been the focus of marine conservation accumulating abundant historical observation data in order to minimize the impact of human activities on seawater quality we selected the time period before large scale industrialization for comparative analysis thus including two sets of data 1981 1982 committee of china bay records 1992 and 1984 2005 zhang et al 2011 from 1981 to 1982 the maximum minimum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 500 mg l 0 119 mg l and 0 284 mg l respectively while for reactive phosphate concentration the data was 0 047 mg l 0 016 mg l and 0 025 mg l respectively as for the period of 1984 2005 the maximum minimum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 819 mg l 0 131 mg l and 0 515 mg l respectively and such data of phosphate concentration was 0 051 mg l 0 005 mg l and 0 024 mg l respectively in the two datasets 1984 2005 witnessed a significant increase in the maximum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration from 1981 to 1982 while the mean rose by 80 88 the reactive phosphate concentration was relatively stable and even decreased to some extent the inorganic nitrogen criteria were 0 443 mg l lower than the mean value in 2005 but far exceeded the minimum value the reactive phosphate criteria were 0 025 mg l exceeding the mean value in 1984 2005 according to the comparative analysis the inorganic nitrogen and active phosphate benchmark values in the paper are relatively reasonable and in line with the actual situation while the benchmark values are not unattainable through ecological restoration and other measures 4 1 2 comparative analysis of selected criteria and water quality requirements of marine functional zones marine functional zoning is the basis for marine environment management of the state oceanic administration accordingly we classified human activities in xiangshan bay into five types according to the zhejiang provincial marine functional zoning 2011 2020 2018 revised edition each type of sea use activity has different water quality control requirements zone 1 1 is an agriculture and fisher region where the seawater quality should be at least class 2 water quality at the sewage outlet should at least be class 3 being the same as the seawater quality in the ports area of zones 2 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 and the recreational area of zone 4 1 and 4 2 industrial and urban sea sue activities are frequently taking place in zones 3 1 2 2 3 3 and 3 4 where the seawater quality should be maintained at a high level zone 5 1 is reserved for coastal wetland conservation thus keeping the seawater quality at class 1 level fig 8 shows the specific distribution of zones the seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 clearly stipulates inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations in seas of different quality classes for instance the concentration standard of class 1 to 4 of inorganic nitrogen is required to be not higher than 0 20 mg l 0 30 mg l 0 40 mg l and 0 50 mg l respectively and the concentration standard of class 1 to 4 of reactive phosphate is required to be not higher than are required to be lower than 0 015 mg l 0 030 mg l 0 030 mg l 0 045 mg l respectively the inorganic nitrogen concentration in agriculture and fishery zones which account for the majority area of xiangshan bay is required to be lower than 0 30 mg l and coastal wetland reserve zones is required to be lower than 0 20 mg l however the actual mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 848 mg l august 2019 which means that the regulatory requirements for marine functional zoning could not be easily satisfied therefore our inorganic nitrogen criteria i e 0 443 mg l are more appropriate to be used as a short term target that is subject to adjustment as the water quality improves during the same period mean reactive phosphate concentration hit 0 030 mg l meeting the management requirements for agriculture and fishery zones and port zones despite this from the data of water quality provided in our supplementary many stations of them still exceeds the water quality standard continued management according to the original water quality standards can not achieve the expected objective proving the necessity to manage the area according to our criteria i e 0 025 mg l 4 2 sensitivity analysis of calculation results 4 2 1 effects of different quantile values on the reference status of inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate evidently different quantile values produce different quantiles z p and the selection of rational quantile values offers a reference for inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentration criteria to meet this end we need to understand the variation pattern of inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations under different p values and corresponding 95 confidence intervals if the threshold u remains unchanged the p values we selected are 0 75 0 80 0 85 0 90 and 0 99 and their variation patterns are shown in fig 9 as p value increases the concentration of din and po4 p presents an obvious downward trend and the downward trend was more and more obvious however their 95 confidence intervals gradually increased particularly p 0 99 indicating the data precision and accuracy gradually decreased 4 2 2 impact of different threshold values on inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria to explore the impact of different threshold values on inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria we conducted sensitivity analyses on the selected threshold values with fixed quantile values next we calculated the active phosphate reference value every 1 within the interval range from 95 to 105 in the gpd top quantile tail estimation plot p 0 95 fig 10 inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate reciprocals decrease significantly as threshold value increases raising the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria fig 11 a shows the variation pattern of inorganic nitrogen and its 95 confidence interval under different threshold values the threshold value ranges from 1 632 95 of selected threshold value to 1 804 105 of selected threshold value with a slight increase the lowest value was 0 424 mg l which is 4 45 lower than our selected criteria 0 443 mg l while the peak value reached 0 455 mg l 2 74 higher than our selected criteria fig 11b illustrates the variation patterns of reactive phosphate and its 95 confidence interval under different threshold values the threshold value ranges from 26 402 95 of selected threshold value to 29 182 105 of selected threshold value under a stable concentration the lowest value is 2 472 10 2 mg l 1 70 lower than our selected criterion 2 514 10 2 mg l while the peak value reaches 2 525 10 2 mg l 0 44 higher than our selected criteria overall inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations slightly change within a small range of the threshold values showing that the calculation results in this paper are representative 4 3 problems requiring further study 1 studies found that freshwater flowing from the yangtze river affects the nutrient salts in the xiangshan bay li et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 recently yang et al 2018 conducted isotope analysis and found that the nitrate the main constituent of inorganic nitrogen in xiangshan bay are mostly from yangtze river and qiantang river on the contrary our extreme value analysis was based on historical data without considering the yangtze river and qiantang river changes 2 as xiangshan bay is a semi closed narrow and long bay with complex terrain water exchange conditions in each region of the bay are different so is the nutrient salt exchange with the external water happening simultaneously in addition the duration of water exchange increases in the innermost regions of the bay yao et al 2014 analyze water exchange patterns in xiangshan bay with the water exchange matrix by dividing the entire bay area into seven marine regions according to water exchange features liang et al 2014 combined the lagrangian particle tracking and lagrangian coherent structures lcss models to identify four water masses with different transport characteristics in xiangshan bay these studies show that the subregions in xiangshan bay contain different nutrient salt concentrations moreover nutrient salt concentration increases as the marine function zones become deeper so our criteria would be difficult to achieve against such a background we recommend that when conditions permit the methods adopted by this paper could serve as an assistant to collect specific reference values for each marine function zones for the classification and monitoring of sea regions with similar water exchange features 3 although china has made a great effort in coastal water conservation and ecological protection systematical nutrient criteria measuring the impact of development are still absent china s vast seas cover three large sea areas with distinct natural features reflected in hydrology meteorology and ecological systems facing such a huge and complicated sea environment the seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 still manages the bay covering multiple areas with unique seas conditions with unified water quality standards exposing its limitations through the long series over threshold model calculation of the survey data in the study area in recent 12 years we can get the benchmark values of inorganic nitrogen and active phosphate under 95 guarantee rate although the calculation results are far from the water quality management objectives set in the study area especially inorganic nitrogen however we can consider that higher water quality management standards can effectively reduce the phenomenon of harmful algal blooms but the improvement effect of management standards still needs to be further studied based on the above considerations this article lays the foundation for the work of environmental management for key bays in other areas such as hainan province 5 conclusions reasonable nutrient criteria compiled through rational process provide a scientific basis for evaluating preventing and controlling seawater eutrophication hawkins et al 2010 meng et al 2008 this study employed the pot model to process 2006 2018 data to calculate the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria for xiangshan bay accordingly the inorganic nitrogen criteria under the 5th quantile are 0 443 mg l with the corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 414 0 477 while the reactive phosphate criteria are 0 025 mg l with the corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 024 0 027 rationality and sensitivity analyses confirmed the rationality of the methods used in this study nevertheless exogenous nutrient input and water body exchange patterns should be considered during the calculation due to the semi closed geographical features of bays credit authorship contribution statement xin fang conceptualization methodology software

3869,the yangtze river estuary and its surrounding seas have had the highest degree of eutrophication in china xiangshan bay located at the southern bank of the yangtze river is not immune from eutrophication leading to the water quality below the control requirements for marine functional zoning clarifying the nutrient criteria is essential to alleviate eutrophication in xiangshan bay we used a generalized pareto distribution based peaks over threshold model to analyze 2006 2018 survey data through calculation inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria in xiangshan bay at the five percentile are 0 443 mg l and 0 025 mg l respectively additionally we also obtained the corresponding confidence intervals rationality and sensitivity analyses of the calculation results proved the methods used in this study to be rational and reliable providing a basis for subsequent monitoring and assessment of nutrient salts in bays keywords generalized pareto distribution peaks over the threshold bay water quality confidence interval sensitivity analysis 1 introduction eutrophication resulting from human activities has become a major factor in deteriorating water quality and threatening marine ecosystems in near seas worldwide chislock et al 2013 karydis and kitsiou 2012 eutrophication may adversely impact the biological integrity in coastal seas resulting in a decrease in the population of fishes and shellfishes deegan et al 2012 diaz and rosenberg 2008 glasgow and burkholder 2000 public health may even be under threat barrera et al 2001 due to the proliferation of algae anderson et al 2002 tang et al 2019 and the water borne diseases transmission who 2003 during past decades of development the continuous input of nitrogen and phosphorus into coastal waters has caused severe eutrophication wang et al 2018 as a result the yangtze river estuary and nearby seas have been major regions suffering deteriorating water quality chai et al 2006 dai et al 2011 xiangshan bay is not immune from the problem due to its geological location the south bank of the yangtze river the key to alleviating the eutrophication in the bay area lies in the determination of nutrient criteria before controlling the nitrogen and phosphorus emitted into waters thus improving the environmental condition of seas schindler 2006 smith and schindler 2009 the u s environmental protection agency epa defined nutrient criteria as the maximum acceptable concentration without threatening the specific beneficial purpose of water bodies us epa 1998 based on the definition of meng et al 2006 2008 we defined the nutrient criteria of a bay as the maximum dose or concentration of an environmental nutrient parameter without adverse or harmful impact on the bay area our definition covers a broader content than the epa s definition as the specific beneficial purpose of water bodies in the latter is too vague and complicated to fulfill in practice the u s formulated regional nutrient criteria strategy at the national level in 1998 perciasepe 1998 following by a series of nutrient criteria technical guidelines for different water bodies huo et al 2017 the european union issued the european water framework directive in 2000 and established relevant research institutions to study nutrient criteria bouleau and pont 2015 pardo et al 2012 solheim 2005 the current compiling method of the nutrient criteria of bay waters mainly involves statistical analysis similar to the one applied to lake waters the method also uses historical and current data of the study site for analysis such as population distribution method yang et al 2019 and inflection point analysis huang et al 2015 kress et al 2019 which heavily relies on abundant historical data model prediction method studies continuous changes in site environmental parameters and achieves constant extreme evaluation through various models including the stressor response model us epa 2010 bayesian model ramin et al 2011 and system dynamics model zhang et al 2018 such models could help us obtain the expected nutrient criteria however it is not easy to stimulate the water ecosystem of bays since the geological area is a semi closed system involving complicated human activities and other factors moreover it is difficult to guarantee the accuracy of data in such a large volume marine sedimentology could examine how human activities affect bay nutrients in a long time series in which the diatom based transfer function andrén et al 2017 weckström et al 2007 is commonly utilized the typical example includes using benthic foraminifera to monitor disturbances in bay background concentrations which has become a popular method in recent years hess et al 2020 in a bay that is greatly involved in human activities as xiangshan bay the nutrient concentration in the seawater is rarely lower than the nutrient reference value due to the perennial eutrophication status frequency analysis and other common statistical methods are not appropriate to determine the baseline value of high nutrient concentration in water bodies as these methods fail to give a confidence interval to assess the accuracy of the calculation results therefore it is worth trying to use extreme value models to analyze the water quality status of the observed values below a certain concentration in the determination of the nutrient reference value hua and wang 2013 hua et al 2014 given this the study adopted the 2006 2018 xiangshan bay survey data together with the peaks over threshold pot model to calculate the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria for xiangshan bay obtaining corresponding 95 confidence intervals china s coastal regions especially gulf areas have been suffering from eutrophication for a long time although the chinese government has carried out ecological restoration projects a clear nutrient criteria value for the restoration target is still absent therefore this article attempts to use the peaks over threshold model to establish appropriate nutrient criteria values for eutrophication ridden waters 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of study site xiangshan bay is located in the northern sea area of zhejiang province south of the yangtze river delta xiangshan bay is connected to the east china sea by the niubishan and fodu fairway wu et al 2020 lying from the northeast to the southwest its geographical coordinates are 29 24 29 48 n and 121 23 122 03 e there are three secondary bays in xiangshan bay the xihu inlet huangdun inlet and tie inlet the centerline of the bay is approximately 60 km long the outer bay is trumpet shaped with the widest distance of the mouth at 20 km the average water depth is 10 m yang et al 2018 while the maximum depth reaches 55 m the coastlines of xiangshan bay are approximately 270 km in total mao et al 2013 covering a water body area of around 365 km2 xu et al 2016 fig 1 illustrates the specific spatial location xiangshan bay is overwhelmed with human activities even possessing a mariculture history of more than 400 years even today the place is still full of commercial and fishing piers supported by two conventional power plants in the area huang et al 2018 2 2 data sources and preliminary analysis we obtained datasets of 433 stations collected in 25 voyages between april 2006 to august 2018 the spatial distribution of the sampling stations and the inorganic nitrogen active phosphate concentrations at each station are set out in the appendix data are divided into top middle and bottom layers at some stations we selected the lowest concentrations from the three layers as representative measurements for a relatively small criteria value among the 433 datasets the maximum minimum and average inorganic nitrogen concentrations were 1 585 mg l 0 032 mg l and 0 696 mg l respectively while the reactive phosphate concentration at the three levels was 0 969 mg l 0 014 mg l and 0 077 mg l respectively 2 3 study methods extreme value theory builds a model of abnormal data to process data that seriously deviate from the mean value the model also describes quantiles at the tail to predict the possibility of future events based on the random features of existing data according to the extreme value theory the classical models are the peaks over threshold pot model smith 1987 corresponding to generalized pareto distribution gpd hosking and wallis 1987 and the block maxima method bmm ferreira and de haan 2015 corresponding to generalized extreme value distribution gev bali 2003 though the two main methods are for the fitting of tail distribution based on sample data the main differences between the two are reflected in the sample data selection the pot model determines thresholds with the initial sample data and groups data exceeding the threshold into a new sample pack on the contrary the bmm model effectively arranges initial sample data into groups before obtaining the maximum value in each group after which the data will be organized into new sample data curceac et al 2020 the bmm model only extracts the lowest observed value in each group to calculate the criteria and corresponding confidence intervals thus discarding the remaining observation data as a result there could be a loss of observation data and information hua et al 2014 given the abovementioned analysis the pot model was selected for this work we adopted the evir package in the r 4 0 3 platform r core team 2020 to streamline the calculations pfaff 2016 in the method 2 3 1 theoretical foundation of the pot model 1 generalized pareto distribution curceac et al 2020 lechner et al 1993 1 g μ ξ β x 1 1 ξ x μ β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 e x μ β ξ 0 the equation satisfies x μ and 1 ξ x μ β 0 μ r is a position parameter î¾ r is a shape parameter and β r is a scale parameter generally the equation uses double parameters or where î¼ 0 the double parameter function is expressed as 2 g ξ β x 1 1 ξ x β 1 ξ ξ 0 1 e x β ξ 0 2 peaks over threshold loss distribution function zhao et al 2018 where the population distribution is f x x i i 1 2 n is a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables and u represents threshold values then y i x i u i 1 2 n represents values exceeding the threshold termed as an excess loss the pot distribution f u y is expressed in the following equation 3 f u y p y y x u f y u f u 1 f u for a sufficiently large threshold value u the pot loss distribution function can be approximated using the generalized pareto distribution 4 lim u

conformance analysis 1 fat tail test the foundation of pot fitting is to ensure that data have sharp peaks and fat tails to be specific for the same sample data the probability of extreme value distribution is greater than that of normal distribution the quantile quantile plot q q plot is one of the main methods for fat tail test dhar et al 2014 utilizing x i i 1 2 3 n as sample data if the scatter plot is approximate to a straight line in the about formed by the horizontal axis of sample order and the vertical axis of normally distributed expected values in the sample data the graph obeys the linear normal variable quantile distribution upward tail deviation means faster growth of normal quantile and fat tail distribution otherwise there will be a thin tail distribution 2 pareto test the pareto test converted a function to conform to the pareto distribution to present a straight line the specific method utilizes x i i 1 2 3 n as sample data and goes through standardization i e y i x i μ σ if scattered plots are close to a straight line in the about structured by the horizontal axis of logarithmic coordinates and the vertical axis of 1 f x the sample data is considered compliant with pareto distribution wu et al 2017 2 3 3 threshold selection the reasonable selection of threshold values directly affects parameter estimation for the pot model langousis et al 2016 excess loss data will be reduced if the threshold is too high leading to an over high scale parameter estimation β if the threshold is too low there will be parameter bias making the fitting not available generally the mean excess function mef hill plot and residual fitting method liu 2014 are appropriate for the study in this paper thus we adopted the first two methods for calculations 1 mean excess function the principle of mef dierckx et al 2009 ghosh and resnick 2010 is to solve the excess random variables over the threshold for the calculation of the mean accordingly we plotted a function plot with u as the horizontal axis and e n u as the vertical axis if the function curve of certain sample data shows a linear trend then they can be considered a suitable threshold value u if the gradient of that threshold value is positive the shape parameter î¾ of the generalized pareto distribution followed by the sample data is positive the specific calculation formula is shown as below 7 e n u e x u x u i 1 n x i u n where x i i 1 2 3 n is sample data and n is the number of samples that exceed the threshold 2 hill plot the principle of the hill plot hill 1975 huisman et al 1998 wang et al 2012 is to arrange sample data in ascending order to obtain the corresponding order h k n subsequently we plotted a function plot with sample order k as the horizontal axis and h k n 1 as the vertical axis the x coordinate of the starting point for stable tail index region in the function is set as a suitable threshold assuming the statistic of the sample order is x 1 x 2 x n then the specific calculation method is 8 h k n 1 k i 1 k ln x i x k k 1 2 n 1 2 3 4 data calculation the parameter estimation of a small sample size adopts the maximum likelihood estimation method based on gpd distribution and the probability density function is as shown as below 9 f x 1 β 1 ξ x β 1 1 ξ ξ 0 e x β β ξ 0 for excess loss y i x i u i 1 2 n its maximum likelihood function is 10 l x i 1 k ln f x i n ln β 1 1 ξ i 1 n ln 1 ξ x i β the partial derivative for parameters î¾ and β is set as 0 to obtain the values of the double parameters 11 1 ξ i 1 k k i β ξ y i n i 1 n ln 1 ξ x i β ξ n 2 3 5 calculation of quantile and its confidence interval 1 calculation of top quantile the equation below produces the quantile z p with 0 q 1 12 z p u β î¾ n n u 1 q 1 2 confidence interval calculation we calculated the confidence interval with the delta method from the asymptotic normality of values to be estimated in the maximum likelihood function taylor expansion was used to obtain the confidence intervals for parameters in the distribution function hence the boundaries of the confidence interval can be expressed in the following equation 13 z u l z p â k î var z p z p â k î d p v d p t z u l represent the upper and lower limits of the confidence interval in î 1 p 2 we selected the 95 confidence interval or p 0 95 k î is the probability for a normally distributed î quantile in which k 0 025 1 96 var z p is the error at the p cumulative probability while v is the fisher information matrix which can be calculated based on the covariance matrix of the target likelihood function l x d p is the partial derivative vector of various parameters in the likelihood function 14 v var ξ cov ξ β cov β ξ var β 15 d p z p ξ z p β 3 results within a reasonable range smaller inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria mean better water quality however the pot model focuses on large values in sample data therefore the model selected the reciprocal values observed as sample data to adapt to this evaluation method 3 1 model conformance analysis 1 normal quantile quantile plot q q plot the q q plots reflecting the inorganic nitrogen reciprocal fig 2 a and reactive phosphate reciprocal fig 3 a deviate upwards from the normal straight line showing the rapid empirical quantiles increase and compliance with the fat tail characteristic 2 pareto plot the pareto plot demonstrating the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen fig 2b is basically distributed in a straight line indicating that normal distribution is not appropriate to fit loss data the generalized pareto distribution function requires fit analysis of sample data while the pareto plot illustrating the reactive phosphate reciprocal fig 3b shows a straight line distribution within the range of x axis 8 50 3 2 threshold selection for the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen in fig 4 a the function curve shows significant linearity and an increasing trend between the threshold value 1 and 2 according to fig 5 a the curve stabilizes in the sample sequences 114 135 generally the threshold value u 1 718 is the lowest point of the excess mean curve while the corresponding number of sample n u exceeding the threshold u would be 125 similar to the method used to determine the inorganic nitrogen criteria as showed in fig 4b and fig 5b the reciprocal threshold value u of reactive phosphate is 27 792 while the corresponding number of samples n u is 111 3 3 parameter calculation for the reciprocal of inorganic nitrogen the calculation of the shape parameter î¾ based on the maximum likelihood estimation for generalized pareto distribution parameters as shown in eq 11 is 0 692 with 95 confidence interval in 0 680 0 704 the scale parameter β is 0 157 with 95 confidence interval in 0 155 0 160 moreover the distribution function can be expressed based on eq 6 as f x 1 125 433 1 0 692 x 1 718 0 157 1 0 692 x 1 718 the tail fitting plot fig 6 a and exceedance distribution plot fig 7 a are effectively fitted proving that the selected parameters are reasonable for reciprocal of reactive phosphate the shape parameter î¾ is 0 131 with 95 confidence intervals in 0 120 0 142 while the scale parameter β is 6 577 with 95 confidence intervals falling in 6 483 6 670 the distribution function is expressed as f x 1 111 433 1 0 131 x 27 792 6 577 1 0 131 x 27 792 the tail fitting plot fig 6b and exceedance distribution plot fig 7b has a reliable fitting effect 3 4 calculation of quantiles and their confidence intervals according to the lake methods the epa suggests using the 25th quantile gibson et al 2000 which however is applied to cases where lakes or seas are in good condition on the contrary xiangshan bay the selected study area of this paper has severe eutrophication additionally it is also necessary to adopt the 5th quantile value for evaluation for the purpose of marine environment conservation under regulatory requirements chen et al 2010 according to eq 12 the value of z p for inorganic nitrogen is 2 256 and eq 13 calculated that 95 confidence intervals fall in 2 097 2 415 thus the inorganic nitrogen concentration is the reciprocal of the above value at 0 443 mg l and corresponding 95 confidence intervals fall in 0 414 0 477 similar to the inorganic nitrogen criterion the criterion for reactive phosphate concentration is 0 025 mg l with a corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 024 0 027 4 discussion 4 1 rationality analysis of calculation results 4 1 1 comparative analysis of selected criteria and historical data xiangshan bay has been the focus of marine conservation accumulating abundant historical observation data in order to minimize the impact of human activities on seawater quality we selected the time period before large scale industrialization for comparative analysis thus including two sets of data 1981 1982 committee of china bay records 1992 and 1984 2005 zhang et al 2011 from 1981 to 1982 the maximum minimum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 500 mg l 0 119 mg l and 0 284 mg l respectively while for reactive phosphate concentration the data was 0 047 mg l 0 016 mg l and 0 025 mg l respectively as for the period of 1984 2005 the maximum minimum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 819 mg l 0 131 mg l and 0 515 mg l respectively and such data of phosphate concentration was 0 051 mg l 0 005 mg l and 0 024 mg l respectively in the two datasets 1984 2005 witnessed a significant increase in the maximum and mean inorganic nitrogen concentration from 1981 to 1982 while the mean rose by 80 88 the reactive phosphate concentration was relatively stable and even decreased to some extent the inorganic nitrogen criteria were 0 443 mg l lower than the mean value in 2005 but far exceeded the minimum value the reactive phosphate criteria were 0 025 mg l exceeding the mean value in 1984 2005 according to the comparative analysis the inorganic nitrogen and active phosphate benchmark values in the paper are relatively reasonable and in line with the actual situation while the benchmark values are not unattainable through ecological restoration and other measures 4 1 2 comparative analysis of selected criteria and water quality requirements of marine functional zones marine functional zoning is the basis for marine environment management of the state oceanic administration accordingly we classified human activities in xiangshan bay into five types according to the zhejiang provincial marine functional zoning 2011 2020 2018 revised edition each type of sea use activity has different water quality control requirements zone 1 1 is an agriculture and fisher region where the seawater quality should be at least class 2 water quality at the sewage outlet should at least be class 3 being the same as the seawater quality in the ports area of zones 2 1 2 2 2 3 and 2 4 and the recreational area of zone 4 1 and 4 2 industrial and urban sea sue activities are frequently taking place in zones 3 1 2 2 3 3 and 3 4 where the seawater quality should be maintained at a high level zone 5 1 is reserved for coastal wetland conservation thus keeping the seawater quality at class 1 level fig 8 shows the specific distribution of zones the seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 clearly stipulates inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations in seas of different quality classes for instance the concentration standard of class 1 to 4 of inorganic nitrogen is required to be not higher than 0 20 mg l 0 30 mg l 0 40 mg l and 0 50 mg l respectively and the concentration standard of class 1 to 4 of reactive phosphate is required to be not higher than are required to be lower than 0 015 mg l 0 030 mg l 0 030 mg l 0 045 mg l respectively the inorganic nitrogen concentration in agriculture and fishery zones which account for the majority area of xiangshan bay is required to be lower than 0 30 mg l and coastal wetland reserve zones is required to be lower than 0 20 mg l however the actual mean inorganic nitrogen concentration was 0 848 mg l august 2019 which means that the regulatory requirements for marine functional zoning could not be easily satisfied therefore our inorganic nitrogen criteria i e 0 443 mg l are more appropriate to be used as a short term target that is subject to adjustment as the water quality improves during the same period mean reactive phosphate concentration hit 0 030 mg l meeting the management requirements for agriculture and fishery zones and port zones despite this from the data of water quality provided in our supplementary many stations of them still exceeds the water quality standard continued management according to the original water quality standards can not achieve the expected objective proving the necessity to manage the area according to our criteria i e 0 025 mg l 4 2 sensitivity analysis of calculation results 4 2 1 effects of different quantile values on the reference status of inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate evidently different quantile values produce different quantiles z p and the selection of rational quantile values offers a reference for inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentration criteria to meet this end we need to understand the variation pattern of inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations under different p values and corresponding 95 confidence intervals if the threshold u remains unchanged the p values we selected are 0 75 0 80 0 85 0 90 and 0 99 and their variation patterns are shown in fig 9 as p value increases the concentration of din and po4 p presents an obvious downward trend and the downward trend was more and more obvious however their 95 confidence intervals gradually increased particularly p 0 99 indicating the data precision and accuracy gradually decreased 4 2 2 impact of different threshold values on inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria to explore the impact of different threshold values on inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria we conducted sensitivity analyses on the selected threshold values with fixed quantile values next we calculated the active phosphate reference value every 1 within the interval range from 95 to 105 in the gpd top quantile tail estimation plot p 0 95 fig 10 inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate reciprocals decrease significantly as threshold value increases raising the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria fig 11 a shows the variation pattern of inorganic nitrogen and its 95 confidence interval under different threshold values the threshold value ranges from 1 632 95 of selected threshold value to 1 804 105 of selected threshold value with a slight increase the lowest value was 0 424 mg l which is 4 45 lower than our selected criteria 0 443 mg l while the peak value reached 0 455 mg l 2 74 higher than our selected criteria fig 11b illustrates the variation patterns of reactive phosphate and its 95 confidence interval under different threshold values the threshold value ranges from 26 402 95 of selected threshold value to 29 182 105 of selected threshold value under a stable concentration the lowest value is 2 472 10 2 mg l 1 70 lower than our selected criterion 2 514 10 2 mg l while the peak value reaches 2 525 10 2 mg l 0 44 higher than our selected criteria overall inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate concentrations slightly change within a small range of the threshold values showing that the calculation results in this paper are representative 4 3 problems requiring further study 1 studies found that freshwater flowing from the yangtze river affects the nutrient salts in the xiangshan bay li et al 2009 zhu et al 2008 recently yang et al 2018 conducted isotope analysis and found that the nitrate the main constituent of inorganic nitrogen in xiangshan bay are mostly from yangtze river and qiantang river on the contrary our extreme value analysis was based on historical data without considering the yangtze river and qiantang river changes 2 as xiangshan bay is a semi closed narrow and long bay with complex terrain water exchange conditions in each region of the bay are different so is the nutrient salt exchange with the external water happening simultaneously in addition the duration of water exchange increases in the innermost regions of the bay yao et al 2014 analyze water exchange patterns in xiangshan bay with the water exchange matrix by dividing the entire bay area into seven marine regions according to water exchange features liang et al 2014 combined the lagrangian particle tracking and lagrangian coherent structures lcss models to identify four water masses with different transport characteristics in xiangshan bay these studies show that the subregions in xiangshan bay contain different nutrient salt concentrations moreover nutrient salt concentration increases as the marine function zones become deeper so our criteria would be difficult to achieve against such a background we recommend that when conditions permit the methods adopted by this paper could serve as an assistant to collect specific reference values for each marine function zones for the classification and monitoring of sea regions with similar water exchange features 3 although china has made a great effort in coastal water conservation and ecological protection systematical nutrient criteria measuring the impact of development are still absent china s vast seas cover three large sea areas with distinct natural features reflected in hydrology meteorology and ecological systems facing such a huge and complicated sea environment the seawater quality standard gb 3097 1997 still manages the bay covering multiple areas with unique seas conditions with unified water quality standards exposing its limitations through the long series over threshold model calculation of the survey data in the study area in recent 12 years we can get the benchmark values of inorganic nitrogen and active phosphate under 95 guarantee rate although the calculation results are far from the water quality management objectives set in the study area especially inorganic nitrogen however we can consider that higher water quality management standards can effectively reduce the phenomenon of harmful algal blooms but the improvement effect of management standards still needs to be further studied based on the above considerations this article lays the foundation for the work of environmental management for key bays in other areas such as hainan province 5 conclusions reasonable nutrient criteria compiled through rational process provide a scientific basis for evaluating preventing and controlling seawater eutrophication hawkins et al 2010 meng et al 2008 this study employed the pot model to process 2006 2018 data to calculate the inorganic nitrogen and reactive phosphate criteria for xiangshan bay accordingly the inorganic nitrogen criteria under the 5th quantile are 0 443 mg l with the corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 414 0 477 while the reactive phosphate criteria are 0 025 mg l with the corresponding 95 confidence interval in 0 024 0 027 rationality and sensitivity analyses confirmed the rationality of the methods used in this study nevertheless exogenous nutrient input and water body exchange patterns should be considered during the calculation due to the semi closed geographical features of bays credit authorship contribution statement xin fang conceptualization methodology software
