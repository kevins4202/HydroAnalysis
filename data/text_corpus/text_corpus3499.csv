17495,phosphate is routinely dosed to ensure regulatory compliance for lead in drinking water distribution systems little is known about the impact of the phosphate dose on the microbial ecology in these systems and in particular the endemic biofilms disturbance of the biofilms and embedded material in distribution can cause regulatory failures for turbidity and metals to investigate the impact of phosphate on developing biofilms pipe wall material from four independent pipe sections was mobilised and collected using two twin flushing operations a year apart in a chlorinated uk network pre and post phosphate dosing intensive monitoring was undertaken including turbidity and water physico chemistry traditional microbial culture based indicators and microbial community structure via sequencing the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and the its2 gene for fungi whole metagenome sequencing was used to study shifts in functional characteristics following the addition of phosphate as an operational consequence turbidity responses from the phosphate enriched water were increased particularly from cast iron pipes differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were also observed emphasising a community shift towards microorganisms able to use or metabolise phosphate phosphate increased the relative abundance of bacteria such as pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter and the fungi cadophora rhizophagus and eupenicillium whole metagenome sequencing showed with phosphate a favouring of sequences related to gram negative bacterium type cell wall function virions and thylakoids but a reduction in the number of sequences associated to vitamin binding methanogenesis and toxin biosynthesis with current faecal indicator tests only providing risk detection in bulk water samples this work improves understanding of how network changes effect microbial ecology and highlights the potential for new approaches to inform future monitoring or control strategies to protect drinking water quality graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords biofilms drinking water metagenomics phosphate 1 introduction phosphate is routinely used as a corrosion inhibitor in drinking water distribution systems dwds in order to form highly insoluble phosphate scales that coat pipe walls preventing iron and lead corrosion products entering the water supply cardew 2008 lead is regarded as a health risk due to the way it can build up in the body affecting particularly infants and children where it can have an adverse impact on mental development lidsky and schneider 2003 verstraeten et al 2008 a reported 95 of water supplies in the uk phosphate enrich drinking water at concentrations of typically 1 mg p l hayes and hydes 2012 there is however a growing shift to try and reduce the use of chemical additives including phosphate to drinking supplies but this is currently constrained by historical and regulatory precedence and fears of potential consequences due to limited understanding even though phosphate is not considered harmful to humans elevated concentrations in aquatic ecosystems can promote microbial and algae growth leading to eutrophication glibert 2020 dwds are aquatic ecosystems with a diverse microbiota that colonises pipe walls forming biofilms flemming et al 2002 biofilm growth is affected by different parameters such as hydraulic regime disinfectant residuals temperature and available nutrients including organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus vrouwenvelder et al 2010 liu et al 2016 phosphate and chlorine can modify the composition of microbial communities batte et al 2003 thus influencing biofilm formation and the amount of available organic matter and rates of disinfectant decay that ultimately determine the formation of disinfection by products chandy et al 2001 besides disinfection the limiting of nutrients in particular organic carbon is considered beneficial for controlling microbial growth in drinking water systems van der kooij et al 2003 volk and lechevallier 1999 showed that microbial growth was inhibited in dwds by reducing the level of organic carbon but in the short term the impact was greater on planktonic microorganisms than biofilms although carbon is typically the principal limiting nutrient in dwds phosphorus can also limit microbial growth miettinen et al 1997 sathasivan et al 1997 the impact of phosphate on the drinking water microbiome has been studied using laboratory pipe systems yielding contradictory results about the effect of phosphate on microorganisms and or biofilms some studies have shown that the addition of phosphates may trigger bacterial growth miettinen et al 1997 sathasivan et al 1997 jang et al 2012 while other studies did not observe an increase in the growth or number of bacteria appenzeller et al 2001 frias et al 2001 gouider et al 2009 in some cases limiting phosphate has been shown to control biofouling of reverse osmosis membranes vrouwenvelder et al 2010 these contradictory results might be associated to different experimental conditions for example appenzeller et al 2001 found a decrease in heterotrophic bacteria growth when phosphate was added in highly corroded iron pipes but a moderate increase in slightly corroded pipes however the research reported was mainly limited to laboratory studies and characterised specific microorganisms using standard culturing methods the work presented here avoids these limitations by investigating the microbial impact of phosphate in an operational network using a holistic approach and includes advanced molecular techniques such as whole metagenome sequencing to study functional traits this information will help to understand the ecological impact of phosphate and to inform network dosing as part of lead or iron control in dwds in addition the results may assist utilities concerned about the potential impact of ceasing phosphate dosing in dwds which has associated benefits including reducing treatment complexities e g ph control chemical purchasing storage needs and critically as part of protecting the environment against eutrophication risks by removing the need for downstream phosphate removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and flushing scheme the studied site is from an operational dwds in the uk where high lead and iron concentrations were reported as part of routine network sampling phosphate dosing was installed to ensure regulatory compliance and prevent future health concerns ortho phosphoric acid phosphoric acid 75 pwg airedale chemical company ltd uk was dosed in order to achieve a final water concentration of 1 2 mg l sampling from 2018 to 2020 x 1 18 sd 0 11 mg l n 71 pre dosing orthophosphate as p showed all samples from 2017 0 03 mg l n 25 the new dosing regimen presented an opportunity to examine the impact of phosphate on developing biofilms including mix species microbial composition and potential functional traits in sections of different pipe materials both pre and post phosphate dosing to achieve this a detailed trial plan was proposed that required 4 controlled and extensively monitored flushing operations research has shown that particulate material in dwds accumulates on all boundary surfaces as part of a biofilm matrix with cohesive shear strength properties husband et al 2016 accumulation rates are a factor of background water quality with processes such as corrosion increasing asset deterioration rates with respect to discolouration and associated elevated metal concentrations husband et al 2008 by raising the shear stress the component of stress coplanar to the pipe surface a function of hydraulics pipe diameter and pipe roughness above daily peak values material is lifted from the pipe wall and entrained into the bulk flow this behaviour is commonly observed following network bursts or other interventions that result in modified hydraulic demands but is also utilised in flushing and flow conditioning exercises sunny et al 2020 due to the shear strength characteristics the amount of material mobilised is related to the imposed excess shear stress as a function of the additional flow and with each subsequent increase there is a further release of material as a particulate response the amount of material in the bulk flow can be measured by optical scattering as turbidity the material release responses have been shown to be predictable and repeatable including consistent patterns and magnitudes when given equal development periods and stable water quality husband et al 2008 vreeburg et al 2008 with this understanding of network and pipe wall material behaviour flushing trials were planned with an initial visit to condition test sections by removing material with shear strengths below that of a target flushing flow rate biofilm and associated material were then allowed to develop for three months before a second flushing trial was performed to mobilise the regenerated material that was collected for detailed analysis this twin flushing process was scheduled to occur prior to phosphate addition trials 1 and 2 and then repeated once dosing was established trials 3 and 4 with the aim to investigate the impact of phosphate dosing environmental factors such as temperature and seasonal daily demands were minimised by conducting the trials a year apart and using the same equipment and at the same time of the day the trial flow increases were monitored and controlled by purpose built langham hydrant standpipes with electromagnetic abb aquamaster 3 flow meters with 5 reading accuracy and maximum working pressure of 12 bar turbidity responses connected to the standpipes were measured using 2x ati nephnet loggers for data validity with infrared ir nephelometric measurement and functioning range limited to 0 4 000 ntu for high resolution in one unit and 0 40 00 ntu in the second unit both with an accuracy of 5 of reading in standard flushing operations it is normal to maintain a clean waterfront by ensuring all upstream pipe sections are flushed first this needs to be done otherwise when downstream flushing flows are imposed the extra demand may exceed upstream conditioned values causing material to be mobilised and hence consumer water quality issues yet any network interventions may also potentially disturb test sections whilst upstream flushing could also release material that could affect the composition community on downstream pipes to avoid this and minimise resource requirements to 1 day pipe test sections were connected directly to a larger supply pipe to safeguard against the risk that planned flushing trials would cause upstream impact through collaboration with the water company 4 trial sections were identified for field work with the added advantage that they were of different pipe compositions medium density polyethylene mdpe asbestos cement ac polyvinyl chloride upvc and cast iron ci although this study focusses on comparing independent pipe sections pre and post dosing by selecting trial sections in close proximity and supplied directly from a common trunk main water entering each pipe section was effectively comparable the first three sections mdpe ac upvc were all supplied directly from the single surface water treatment works via a 21 ac trunk main the fourth section 2 km further downstream or one hour extra transit time was via an extra 18 section of spun iron si trunk main both trunk mains were laid in 1987 so established biofilm and long term accumulated material could be assumed relatively consistent with all four trial sections linked directly to effectively the same trunk main i e no intermediary pipe lengths or different pipe materials it meant the bulk water entering each had the same source treatment and transmission experience thereby limiting the impact of bulk water as an experimental variable the high demands through the trunk main and the close proximity of all test sections meant water age and residual chlorine concentrations were also comparable trial sections had diameters in the small range of 75 mm to 125 mm 3 to 5 and were 300 m or more in length except the mdpe pipe pipe properties were mdpe 85 m of 125 mm laid 1995 ac 300 m of 4 100 mm laid 1962 upvc 420 m of 3 75 mm laid 1967 ci 300 m of 4 100 mm laid 1953 with the exception of the upvc which was a dead end each pipe supplied downstream networks and experienced daily demand patterns with peak flows of around 10 l s each pipe was over 20 years in service and water company records indicated no flushing or disturbance within the last 10 years allowing an assumption that pipe wall material and communities were well established and in equilibrium with the system site schematics and more details in douterelo et al 2020 with trial sections feeding downstream consumers flushing flows were selected using the podds prediction of discolouration in distribution systems model husband and boxall 2010 furnass et al 2014 this identified flows to exceed daily peak but limit material mobilisation to prevent the particulate turbidity response in the bulk water from producing customer observable discolouration uk regulatory limit at the customer s tap is 4 ntu whilst circa 10 ntu is required to start becoming visible to investigate differences in shear characteristics and to increase discrete sample numbers for analysis and comparison purposes flushing was planned initially to have three incremental steps with increases occurring once turbidity responses dropped however because time constrained to 1 day on site decisions based on tracking turbidity responses meant trials 2 4 were reduced to just two steps once equipment was installed on site a low flow through the standpipe was established and run for a minimum of 20 min to allow monitoring equipment to stabilise and ensure any stagnant water from the hydrant was removed this was confirmed by ensuring residual chlorine was present 2 2 water quality monitoring the sixteen flushing trials involved an adapted standpipe to control flushing discharge through selected hydrants at the end of each pipe section with visual displays and logging of flow and turbidity water samples prior to flush commencement and at each flushing stage were collected for physico chemical and microbiological analysis several parameters were measured in situ at the times of discrete sample collection prior and during flushing of the pipes free and total chlorine were measured with a palintest method using electrochemical sensors and a palintest cs 100 chlorosense chlorine metre fisher scientific uk temperature and ph were measured using a hanna portable metre and probe hi 991003 all other parameters were obtained by an accredited laboratory analysis of the discrete samples and using validated methods to meet uk drinking water regulations water samples were collected in designated containers and bacterial colony counts were determined by the pour plate method in which yeast extract agar was used following the uk environment agency recommendations environment agency 2012 cultures were incubated at 37 c for 48 h 2 day colony and 22 c for 72 h 3 day colony 2 3 microbial molecular analysis the molecular microbial approach used in this study is based on two different sequencing strategies to study the structure taxonomic composition of all the samples obtained before and after phosphate dosing n 78 two marker genes were sequenced 16s rrna for bacteria and the its2 for fungi in addition selected samples based on turbidity results from each type of material were pooled total number of final samples 8 4 pre and 4 post phosphate dosing and dna concentrated to perform a whole metagenomics sequencing analysis details of each of these analyses are described as follows 2 3 1 dna extraction three replicates of 2 l samples of bulk water were collected as discrete samples during the flushing trials for dna analysis from both pre and post phosphate dosing trials 2 and 4 including collecting background samples before flushing commenced for the mdpe pipe this meant 4 samples and 3 for the ac upvc and ci sections giving a total of 78 samples these samples were each filtered through 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters millipore corp filters were preserved in the dark and at 80 c for subsequent dna extraction dna extraction from filters was carried out by a method based on proteinase k digestion followed by a standard phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction douterelo et al 2013 the quantity and purity of the extracted dna were assessed using nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop wilmington usa 2 3 2 sequencing of marker genes 16s rrna for bacteria and its2 for fungi sequencing was performed at mr dna www mrdnalab com shallowater tx usa on a miseq following the manufacturer s guidelines the 16s rrna gene using primers 28f and 519r spanning the v1 to v3 hypervariable regions and primers targeting the its1 2 regions were used for bacterial and fungal analysis respectively the pcr conditions and illumina library preparation are explained in detail in douterelo et al 2020 sequencing data was processed using mr dna analysis pipeline mr dna shallowater tx usa in summary sequences were joined and depleted of barcodes then sequences with less than 150 bp and with ambiguous base calls were removed sequences were de noised and chimeras were detected using uchime edgar et al 2011 and removed from further analysis final operational taxonomic units otus were taxonomically classified using blastn altschul et al 1990 against a curated database derived from rdpii cole et al 2005 and ncbi to study alpha diversity diversity within samples the chao rich estimator shannon diversity analysis and dominance estimators were calculated at 95 sequence similarity cut off douterelo et al 2013 without rarefaction mcmurdie and holmes 2014 2 3 3 whole metagenome sequencing to obtain a fingerprint of functional traits selected samples based on peaks of turbidity during flushes were pooled and subjected to whole metagenome sequencing 50 ng of dna was used to prepare the libraries by nextera dna sample preparation illumina following the manufacturer s user guide and the sequencing was performed at mr dna www mrdnalab com shallowater tx usa on miseq following the manufacturer s guidelines as described by douterelo 2020 eight libraries mdpe ac upvc and ci all sampled before and after phosphate treatment were quality checked with fastqc https www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc and cross assembled with metaspades v 3 11 0 nurk et al 2017 comparative metagenomic analysis based on this cross assembly was performed with crass dutilh et al 2012 contig abundance was calculated by mapping the reads back to the contigs using bwa mem li and durbin 2009 and calculating the average depth with the jgi summarize bam contig depths script from metabat kang et al 2015 contigs were annotated with interproscan 5 36 75 0 with the parameters appl pfam goterms iprlookup pathways https github com ebi pf team interproscan jones et al 2014 and summarized using the metagenomics ontology of go slim http geneontology org docs download ontology abundance of the functional categories was calculated for each sample by summing the depth values of the contigs where it occurred and the values log 10 transformed pseudocount 0 0001 see supplementary table 1 because the crass cladograms indicated separation of the samples into groups before after phosphate treatment fig 5 overall enrichment scores per functional category due to the phosphate treatment were calculated by averaging the values across the four pipe materials 2 4 statistics to assess the similarity in microbial community structure amongst samples the relative sequence abundance at genus level 97 sequence similarity cut off for each sample was used to calculate pairwise similarities all data were transformed by square root calculations and bray curtis similarity matrixes were generated using the software primer v7 primer e plymouth uk bray curtis similarity matrixes were visualised using multiple dimensional scaling mds diagrams analysis of similarity statistics anosim was calculated using the same bray curtis distance matrix to test the significance of differences amongst samples based on pipe material for both bacteria and fungi the values for the anosim r statistic ranges from 1 to 1 where r 1 indicates that communities from different pipe materials are completely dissimilar principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate the distribution of microorganisms taking into account materials and phosphate dosing generated using the software primer v7 primer e plymouth uk to determine if the observed differences in the richness diversity and dominance indeces were significant pairwise comparisons between samples from different materials were made using the non parametric mann whitney u test using ibm spss 21 3 results 3 1 flushing flow and turbidity each investigative visit 4 over two years and flushing operations 4 per visit approximately 1 hour each including incremental increases were completed in one day with initial pre dosing conditioning trial 1 in march 2017 followed after 90 days biofilm material development by the sample collection analysis trial 2 phosphate dosing at the treatment works commenced 5 months later november 2017 following a field operative call out on the scheduled date the post dosing conditioning trial 3 was delayed a month until april 2018 with the sample collection trial 4 after biofilm development again exactly 90 days later prior to and during the investigative period no significant network events were recorded or changes in network demands or operation other than phosphate dosing coming on line sampling results including free chlorine water temperature and doc from the water treatment works highlight network supplied water quality and therefore likely particulate material loading to be consistent across both generation phases as shown in fig 1 although water temperature at the start is the same for both years during 2018 it does however rise quicker a cold spell just before the final flushing visit brings temperatures back in line flow and turbidity results from all four flushing trials for each pipe section are shown in fig 2 plots show times adjusted to create a common start time with a maximum 63 minute shift required to align all 16 trials in all cases imposed hydraulics were comparable for all flushes except the mdpe pipe where flush 2 4 had higher flows fig 2a with trials 1 and 3 however the same applied hydraulics are consistent for both phases of the trial and therefore results remain comparable in the ac pipe fig 2b during trial 4 the terminal step was 4 l s compared to 3 4 l s from trial 2 trials in both the upvc and ci pipes figs 2c and 2d respectively had consistent flow magnitudes but some variance in durations in particular the terminal flushing phase as a result of waiting for turbidity values to drop to agreed levels of 0 5 ntu before finishing these temporal differences however would be not expected to impact turbidity responses more details on the hydraulic properties and results from the first two trials can be found in douterelo et al 2020 initial inspection of the turbidity responses observed from all pipe sections suggests that the addition of phosphate considerably increases discolouration risk the mean turbidity results for each pipe and trial are reported in table 1 in every pipe a greater turbidity response is observed once phosphate dosing has commenced supporting the initial observation that phosphate enrichment increases discolouration risk comparison between materials of the pipe sections showed similar turbidity increases for mdpe and ac pipes where both sections were hydraulically similar 2 1x and 1 5x respectively the ci pipe showed by far the greatest increase in turbidity 4 7x suggesting changes in corrosion or corrosion legacy thus suggesting metallic corrosion remains an issue despite the presence of phosphate the dead end pipe where material accumulation can be considered predominantly a sedimentation process and not biofilm formation on walls showed almost no change 1 1x suggesting that the bulk water material loading background concentrations is largely unaffected 3 2 discrete sampling and physico chemical analysis results from the physico chemical analysis of discrete water samples are showed in table 2 given the common water source supply many physico chemical variables were similar amongst all the samples including ph 7 6 7 8 conductivity 240 250 μs cm nitrite 0 004 mg l and sulphate 8 6 9 5 mg l however changes were found in some physico chemical parameters between the first sample period in june 2017 and the second period a year later after phosphate dosing the quantification of orthophosphate confirms that water in the first sampling period had no little phosphate 0 03 mg l whilst one year later this had increased to 1 1 1 2 mg l which is the average uk standard water phosphate concentration toc and doc were higher and more variable going from 1 9 2 0 mg l to 2 4 2 7 mg l and 2 0 2 1 mg l to 2 4 3 2 mg l respectively post phosphate addition nitrate were 0 52 0 54 mg l in the first sampling period and decreased until not being detected 0 5 after phosphate dosing chlorine both free and total was higher under post phosphate dosing conditions in most of the samples analysed with the exception of mdpe samples where it was slightly higher pre phosphate 0 7 1 1 mg l temperature in the second sampling period was slightly higher and increased across the trial periods from an average of 18 c to 21 30 c in pre phosphate dosing water iron concentrations were significantly higher in the ci pipe and the upvc pipe samples when compared with other pipe materials post phosphate dosing higher iron concentrations were found in mdpe and ac pipes when compared with pre phosphate conditions in addition iron increased in the last flushing step in the ac pipe after phosphate dosing manganese concentration was stable in most of the conditions 0 012 0 053 mg l and it was slightly higher in the final flushing steps in both ci and ac pipes in post phosphate samples lead concentration was similar amongst all the samples except in the last flushing steps after phosphate dosing were increased in ac and ci pipes and decrease in the upvc pipe results from the colony counts are shown in table 3 colony counts values were only representative in samples from the ac pipe with up to 7 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days and 4 colonies at 22 c for 3 in pre phosphate samples however up to 21 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days and up to 3 colonies at 22 c for 3 days were found under phosphate concentrations also 42 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days were count in the ci pipe and 13 in the final flushing stage of mdpe pipe in post phosphate addition samples 3 2 effect of phosphate on microbial community composition before vs after taxonomic analysis based on marker genes 16s rrna and its2 for bacteria and fungi respectively differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were found in relation to phosphate dosing pipe material and flushing steps 3 2 1 bacterial relative abundance at genus level the relative abundance of the most abundant otus at genus level 95 similarity cut off has been analysed comparing the flushing steps in different materials and pre and post phosphate dosing figs 3 and 4 independently of pipe material or phosphate concentration the first flushing step generally resulted in samples with higher relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities the proceeding flushing steps were less microbial rich bacteria and fungi concerning phosphate dosing bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi the results observed from figs 3 and 4 were reinforced by the diversity indices data fig 7 the bacterial analysis fig 3 showed that the most represented genera in all the samples was pseudomonas with a relative abundance between 4 and 21 in pre phosphate samples and ranging from 4 to 32 under post phosphate dosing an increase in abundance of pseudomonas post phosphate was observed particularly in ac and ci pipe samples other genera well represented in pre phosphate samples were gloeobacter 2 14 and staphylococcus 3 14 however in post phosphate samples gloeobacter almost disappeared 0 2 and staphylococcus was mainly present in mdpe pipe samples 4 17 but noticeably diminished in ac upvc and ci pipe samples acinetobacter was relatively abundant in mdpe samples particularly in the last flushing steps under pre phosphate dosing 10 suggesting preference to deeper and more consolidated biofilm colonisation niche this genus had little representation in ac pvc and ci pipe pre phosphate but increased abundance in post phosphate samples especially in ci 13 24 other genus that had little representation 0 2 in all pre phosphate samples but increased post phosphate was paenibacillus paenibacillus post phosphate showed high relative abundance in mdpe samples in the first flushing steps 12 13 and in the first flushing step of other materials 2 5 but was then poorly represented suggesting a colonisation preference for outer layers of developing dwds biofilms when phosphate is prevalent brucella in pre phosphate upvc samples ranged from 1 in the first flushing step to 14 in the last one in ci samples brucella was also relatively abundant 7 21 in pre phosphate samples and decreased to 3 in the last flushing step post phosphate in pre phosphate samples and upvc streptococcus have higher abundance 5 to 12 when compared with samples from other materials after phosphate addition streptococcus was still present in ac 6 4 ci 2 0 and upvc samples 0 11 and mdpe samples 0 6 in the first flushing step to 7 in the last one 3 2 2 fungal relative abundance at genus level the analysis of fungal communities fig 4 showed that in pre phosphate samples cladosporium from 15 to 51 was present in all the samples remarkably pre phosphate ac samples showed relative abundances of 43 to 51 cryptococcus was the second most abundant genus in pre phosphate samples average 12 n 13 yet its presence decreased after phosphate dosing 1 6 and only showing a relative abundance of 10 in the last flushing step in ci samples under pre phosphate dosing conditions other abundant genera were saccharomyces in mdpe samples average 7 n 4 and in the first flushing steps of ac and upvc 4 and 32 respectively aureobasidium had a relative abundance of 3 4 in mdpe ac and ci samples penicillium in ci 30 in the first flush and alternaria in mdpe 25 in the third flushing stage under post phosphate conditions saccharomyces was also represented in mdpe average 4 n 4 and in ac changing from 22 to 4 as the flushing steps moved forward cadophora was represented in all samples ranging from 1 to 22 being more abundant in ac and ci and exophiala in mdpe average 4 n 4 and ac average 8 n 3 samples rhizophagus was a genus with no representation under pre phosphate conditions but it was found ranging from 1 to 11 in all water samples post phosphate 3 2 3 non metric multidimensional scaling mds analysis of bacteria and fungi and cross assembly analysis of whole metagenome sequencing with crass mds plots of the relative abundance of bacteria at 95 sequence similarity cut off showed a clear separation between pre and post phosphate dosing and all different pipe materials even though some outliers were found fig 5 a the analysis of similarities anosim confirmed the differences amongst bacterial community structures global r 0 654 p 0 1 differences also were found in fungal structure between phosphate conditions global r 0 56 p 0 1 but only between some pipe materials fig 5b pre phosphate fungal community structure was significantly different between mdpe and ac pipes r 0 258 p 0 3 mdpe and pvc pipes r 0 317 p 0 1 mdpe and ci pipes r 0 389 p 0 1 and ac and ci pipes r 0 275 p 0 3 post phosphate showed significant differences only between mdpe and ci pipes r 0 336 p 0 2 and ac and ci pipes r 0 408 p 0 1 the differences amongst microbial community structures were further supported by comparative metagenomics analysis i e similarities between metagenomes the cross assembly analysis with crass using whole metagenomics reads was represented using cladograms fig 5c these show many cross contigs that exclusively contain reads from pre or post phosphate metagenomes independently of the pipe material analysed notably the pre and post treatment phosphate samples were sequenced in separate batches so potential batch effects could not be ruled out leek et al 2010 3 2 4 principal component analysis pca pca analysis was performed in bacterial and fungal communities using data from relative abundance at 95 sequence similarity cut off fig 6 pca indicated that generally samples clustered together as function of phosphate dosing in both bacteria and fungi a clear separation between pre and post phosphate addition samples were observed and some genera had affinity for one or the other condition several bacterial genera fig 6a including pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter had a vector with tendency to appear after phosphate dosing p this trend was also observed for the fungi fig 6b rhizophagus eupenicillium cadophora and trechispora for bacteria samples also clustered with respect to pipe material yet this effect of pipe material was not clear for fungi after phosphate addition the results indicate that differences in microbial community arise following the addition of phosphate and this occurs irrespective of pipe material 3 2 5 bacterial and fungal alpha diversity shannon diversity index dominance and chao1 richness estimator at genus level for bacteria and fungi were performed fig 7 overall bacterial communities were more diverse and rich than fungal communities regarding bacteria significant differences were found in all indices shannon chao1 and dominance between pre and post phosphate conditions p 0 05 n 39 higher diversity and richness were obtained for bacteria under pre phosphate conditions compared to post phosphate samples ac samples presented more diversity average 3 76 n 18 and lower values for the dominance indicator average 0 07 n 18 lower values were found in pre phosphate samples for the dominance indicator in bacteria regarding this index significant differences were found between ac and ci in pre phosphate samples for bacteria p 0 05 and between mdpe and ac fungi pre phosphate samples p 0 05 fungal communities pre phosphate dosing were less rich and had higher values for the dominance index than fungi post phosphate conditions but no differences were found regarding diversity 3 3 effect of phosphate on microbial traits and functions results for the analysis of whole metagenomics sequencing are showed in fig 8 overall pre phosphate samples independently of the pipe material or flush step had higher relative abundance of functional traits associated to biosynthetic process nucleotidyl transferase activity and nucleic acid binding and transport activity when the results of the relative abundance of the functional traits were log transformed supplementary material table 1 some functional traits that were not present or not well represented in pre phosphate samples were distinguished for all types of pipe material including gram negative bacterium type cell wall virion thylakoid and extrachromosomal circular dna however other functional traits decreased in all samples including quorum sensing methanogenesis beta galactosidase complex vitamin binding 4 discussion 4 1 effect of phosphate dosing on turbidity and material accumulation on pipe materials independently of pipe material or phosphate regime results showed the first flushing step generally resulted in samples with higher microbial relative abundance this result could be expected as biofilm mobilised in the first flushing step can be considered as the outer layer that is exposed to the highest exchange with the bulk flow including nutrient and planktonic cell transfer donlan 2002 while the underlying biofilm layers with more consolidated conditions and lower transfer potential are less diverse and more resistant to detachment paul et al 2012 douterelo et al 2013 it is generally considered that diverse microbial communities are better at resisting and adapting to environmental changes due to functional redundancy allison and martiny 2008 the outer layers therefore provide a barrier helping to maintain conditions and protect against mobilisation of material consolidated in underlying zones in addition the metabolically active outer biofilm layers may prevent the immediate effectiveness of phosphate dosing by breaking up and slowing the formation of resilient and protective insoluble lead phosphates scales with the rapid increase of hydraulic forces during flushing deeper biofilm layers become exposed to new conditions as these communities adapt or break down material previously trapped can be released resulting in higher turbidity as observed table 1 the generally higher turbidity after flushing post phosphate dosing could also be attributable to the newly developing biofilm having an enhanced capability of cellular growth and or extracellular polymeric substance eps production this would enable greater material trapping and retention flemming et al 2016 however without cells or eps quantification this observation on more rapid biofilm growth and or increased eps production yielding enhanced material capture cannot be confirmed eps contains compounds that participate in biofilm adhesion and several studies in drinking water agree that when phosphate content increases the production of eps decreases fang et al 2010 kirisits et al 2013 noh et al 2019 if eps production is reduced by phosphate addition it could be argued biofilm capability to adhere to pipes will be reduced allowing easier removal and hence a reason for the higher turbidities observed the effect of phosphate on eps production could explain the increased turbidity response from the ci pipe post phosphate preventing the rapid action of phosphate forming protective scales and allowing high concentrations of corrosion by products historically phosphate addition is recognised as beneficial to reduce plumbosolvency of drinking water hence the higher turbidity response observed in this study could be linked to a transitional period that will recover once phosphate adapted microbial communities have been established further trials would be key to test this and are recommended especially with initial findings showing the addition of phosphate has not reduced iron or lead concentrations as expected a key recommendation to water utilities would be to ensure that where changes in the network are planned preceding maintenance or cleaning strategies are undertaken to minimise biofilm impact this would remove accumulated pipe wall material capable of causing both short and long term risk and in the case of preventative chemical remediation such as phosphate dosing to build protective scales allow more rapid penetration and greater effectiveness 4 2 phosphate dosing effect on microbial community structure considering the influence of phosphate on material mobilised from pipe walls clear differences were found between pre and post phosphate dosing samples particularly for bacterial communities bacteria were the main drivers of changes in biofilm community structure in terms of richness and diversity bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi previous studies have observed that bacterial communities were more affected by environmental fluctuations than fungi within biofilms in chlorinated dwds douterelo et al 2018 this study supports this trend and shows higher environmental influence on bacteria occurring in biofilms attached to a range of materials used in dwds the analysis of bacterial relative abundance showed clear taxonomic differences related to phosphate dosing in all type of materials higher diversity and richness were obtained pre phosphate for bacteria when compared with post phosphate conditions this study shows how phosphate acts as a selective force for microorganisms favouring those able to use or metabolise phosphate many microorganisms are able to transform phosphate in polyphosphates polyp and accumulate it in their cells boswell et al 2001 in fact there is a phenomenon called luxury uptake of phosphorous phosphate in which bacteria accumulate polyp under phosphate excess conditions even though it might not be favourable for their growth khoshmanesh et al 2002 hirota et al 2010 in this study higher abundance of acinetobacter members were found in post phosphate samples and it has been reported that acinetobacter are important in phosphorus removal strategies in wastewater treatment plants kim et al 1997 bunce et al 2018 similarly paenibacillus present in this study has been related to solubilisation of phosphate in soils arthurson et al 2011 the pca analysis fig 6 showed that some genera such as pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia and acinetobacter were clearly influenced by phosphate and these genera have been linked to solubilisation or accumulation of phosphate in previous studies van groenestijn et al 1988 boswell et al 2001 zheng et al 2017 fungi such as rhizophagus increased their abundance after phosphate dosing and this fungi is known to establish symbiotic interactions with plants to help phosphate uptake fiorilli et al 2013 rhizophagus and eupenicillium were clearly influenced by phosphate addition in this study and they have been previously related to phosphate solubilisation in a range of environments vyas et al 2007 garcia et al 2017 previous studies indicated that certain materials used to build drinking water infrastructure can leach out polymers that fungi can degrade belila et al 2017 a possible explanation for the high relative abundance of some organisms in this study for example penicillium and fusarium are known biodegraders of natural and synthetic polyethylene ojha et al 2017 and have great potential for removal of pharmaceutical compounds olicón hernández et al 2017 since biofilm formation on pipes is unavoidable further research is now needed to determine if the occurrence of specific inter kingdom interactions can promote beneficial biofilms and aid biodegradation of contaminants in these systems the most common group of microorganisms in all the samples but with different relative abundance depending on the pipe material and flushing step were pseudomonas acinetobacter and sphingomonas and in ci pipes brucella niquette et al 2000 examined the influence of pipe materials on densities of fixed bacterial biomass in dwds showing that biomass on plastic pvc and pe were lowest in comparison with iron and that cement based materials had intermediate values conversely other researchers have shown that plastic including pe can stimulate biofilm growth due to the release of biodegradable compounds that can promote microbial growth van der kooij et al 2005 yu et al 2010 the results from this study indicate that pipe material affects microbial communities in particular bacteria and those differences were mainly between corroding and non corroding materials 4 3 effect of phosphate dosing on functional traits and metagenomes most of the sequences analysed were related to biofilm development and resistant mechanisms overall three main functional traits were characterised biosynthetic process nucleic acid binding and nucleotide transferase activity fig 8 biosynthetic process in biofilms are mainly related with eps production and related to functions such as cell attachment formation and maintenance of biofilm structure and resistance to environmental stress including disinfectants hall stoodley and stoodley 2002 regarding nucleic acid binding these sequences are associated to proteins that bind to dna rna and include transcriptional factors which modulate protein expression hudson and ortlund 2014 nucleotidyltransferases are enzymes within the transferases group which are associated to an extensive class of bacterial enzymes that inhibit antibiotic target binding promoting its inactivation wright 2005 schroeder et al 2017 the analysis of interrelationships between metagenomes showed clear differences between pre and post phosphate treatments fig 5c mapping metagenomic sequences to a reference database is a useful approach to transfer taxonomical and functional annotations to sequence reads however it can limit the amount of data that can be analysed since most sequencing reads in difficult to annotate datasets e g viral metagenomes lack known homologs dutilh et al 2012 an alternative is using reference independent comparative metagenomics by cross assembly through crass the cross assembly analysis showed that the effect of the phosphate addition was stronger than the effect of the pipe material since the before and after samples clustered together phosphate dosing favoured the presence of sequences related to functional traits in particular gram negative bacterium type cell walls virions thylakoids and extrachromosal circular dna supplementary table 1 gram negative bacteria are predominant inhabitants of drinking water systems and include proteobacteria members and the phylum bacterioidetes vaz moreira et al 2017 gram negative bacteria have an outer membrane that makes them resistant to antibiotics detergents and disinfectants mckeon et al 1995 thus are of public health concern very high rate of resistance to antibiotics have been found amongst gram negative bacteria and within them enterobacteriaceae since they have a more fluid genome mediated by plasmids that carry antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity genes wellington et al 2013 hawkey 2015 this reinforces our results where higher abundance of sequences associated with extrachromosomal circular dna were observed after phosphate dosing extrachromosomal circular dna are a type of mobile genetic elements mge that facilitate dna transfer between cells and can provide host cells with advantages such as antibiotic resistance or adaptive metabolic pathways rankin et al 2011 it is known that mixed species biofilms in dwds can house antibiotic resistance bacteria gomez alvarez et al 2016 douterelo et al 2018 thus biofilm mobilisation may contribute to spreading environmental antimicrobial resistance additionally gram negative bacteria are known to have enhanced adhesion capabilities sommer et al 1999 promoting biofilm spread and colonisation taking into account these findings phosphate addition is shown to have potentially detrimental consequences that may be of concern to public health on the distribution system microbiome virions were more represented in all samples post phosphate dosing they are commonly transported in drinking water systems by amoebas atanasova et al 2018 where they are protected against the action of disinfectants flood and ashbolt 2000 have demonstrated the potential of model enteric virions and virion sized particles to accumulate and persist within biofilms in drinking water systems this study only analysed dna thus it is not known if the sequences associated to virions are a realistic representation of these type of microorganisms in biofilms the results obtained however support the need for more detailed microbial analysis in routine drinking water monitoring strategies with surveillance methods needing to take into consideration the accumulation of virions and other potential pathogens within water pipe biofilms sequences associated with thylakoids were also prevalent post phosphate dosing fig 8 thylakoids are organelles which contains pigments that absorb energy in photosynthetic organisms and have been used as a fast and effective screening test to detect herbicides in water euzet et al 2005 the presence of thylakoids can also indicate the increase of photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria in biofilms of dwds cyanobacteria have been found in this study however no significant increase was observed in post phosphate dosing samples cyanobacteria have been reported previously as important inhabitants of biofilms in dwds hwang et al 2012 lin et al 2013 douterelo et al 2016 and despite the lack of light it has been suggested that they have an alternative metabolism that allows them to survive in the absence of light sequences associated with functional traits that decreased in all samples after phosphate dosing include quorum sensing methanogenesis beta galactosidase complexes and vitamin binding fig 8 quorum sensing is a mechanism common in biofilms where cells regulate their cooperative activities and physiological processes by releasing sensing and responding to small diffusible signal molecules li and tian 2012 therefore phosphate dosing might influence the ability of bacteria to communicate and subsequently form biofilms and as discussed above phosphate can inhibit eps production if phosphate addition is involved or has an indirect role in quorum sensing mechanisms and their control this may open a new avenue for controlling biofilm formation in dwds beta galactosidase complexes are hydrolytic enzymes responsible for the degradation of a variety of natural and synthetic substrates asraf and gunasekaran 2010 thus biofilms may use them to degrade a range of compounds and thrive in dwds phosphate dosing also decreased methanogenesis which is the final step in anaerobic degradation of carbon and is used by microorganisms to degrade carbon when all alternative electron acceptors have been exhausted zeikus 1977 methanogens are amongst the most diverse groups of microbes and vary significantly in their environmental conditions and cell structure in the literature methanogens are well known bio degraders of micropollutants and most belong to the group of archaea harb et al 2019 archaea have been found in drinking water systems mainly in systems supplied from groundwater and associated to ammonia oxidation van der wielen et al 2009 although phosphate dosing decreased sequences associated to methanogenesis this study cannot directly associate this with a reduction in the number of archaea phosphate addition decreased functional sequences related to vitamin binding vitamins and other cofactors play a critical role in determining bacterial growth rates and microbiome dynamics sonnenburg and sonnenburg 2014 the importance of vitamin acquisition and the mechanisms that microbes use to acquire these vitamins have been reported in other environments putnam et al 2020 vitamins can play a critical role in driving microbiome dynamics and competition for vitamins can favour bacteria that are better at capturing those studies based on single species biofilms showed vitamin related processes can influence biofilm formation and development pandit et al 2017 studying pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms suggested that non lethal concentrations of vitamin c can inhibit bacterial quorum sensing and other regulatory mechanisms involved in biofilm development as a result eps biosynthesis is reduced and once content is below a critical point cells get exposed and are more susceptible to antimicrobials or treatments considering these previous studies a reduction of vitamin binding function in a dwds context could be translated as selection for certain type of microorganisms supporting reduced diversity observed post phosphate and or influence eps structure and microbiome susceptibility to environmental conditions further studies are needed to understand how vitamin acquisition shapes competition and community structure under dwds environmental conditions and appreciate vitamin binding implications at an operational and management level 5 conclusions this innovative research investigates the effect of phosphate dosing on the microbial ecology within an operational dwds the detailed study plan facilitated investigation of the impact of pipe material and hydraulics on developing biofilms following changes in water chemistry due to phosphate enrichment the work highlights differences in microbial diversity and functional traits and demonstrates clear operational impact with respect to discolouration risk key findings include differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were found in relation to phosphate dosing pipe material and flushing steps bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance diversity and richness in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi cast iron pipe samples had less diverse communities with dominant representatives compared to other non corroding pipes first flushing steps resulted in samples with higher relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities post phosphate dosing a community shift towards microorganisms able to use or metabolise phosphate was observed including the bacteria pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter and the fungi cadophora rhizophagus and eupenicillium addition of phosphate favoured the appearance of gram negative bacterium type cell wall virion and thylakoid function sequences but decreased functional sequences associated to vitamin binding methanogenesis and toxin biosynthesis operationally turbidity responses discolouration and elevated metal concentration risk from the phosphate enriched water was increased particularly from cast iron pipes with current faecal indicator tests only providing risk detection this work improves understanding and highlights the potential

17495,phosphate is routinely dosed to ensure regulatory compliance for lead in drinking water distribution systems little is known about the impact of the phosphate dose on the microbial ecology in these systems and in particular the endemic biofilms disturbance of the biofilms and embedded material in distribution can cause regulatory failures for turbidity and metals to investigate the impact of phosphate on developing biofilms pipe wall material from four independent pipe sections was mobilised and collected using two twin flushing operations a year apart in a chlorinated uk network pre and post phosphate dosing intensive monitoring was undertaken including turbidity and water physico chemistry traditional microbial culture based indicators and microbial community structure via sequencing the 16s rrna gene for bacteria and the its2 gene for fungi whole metagenome sequencing was used to study shifts in functional characteristics following the addition of phosphate as an operational consequence turbidity responses from the phosphate enriched water were increased particularly from cast iron pipes differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were also observed emphasising a community shift towards microorganisms able to use or metabolise phosphate phosphate increased the relative abundance of bacteria such as pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter and the fungi cadophora rhizophagus and eupenicillium whole metagenome sequencing showed with phosphate a favouring of sequences related to gram negative bacterium type cell wall function virions and thylakoids but a reduction in the number of sequences associated to vitamin binding methanogenesis and toxin biosynthesis with current faecal indicator tests only providing risk detection in bulk water samples this work improves understanding of how network changes effect microbial ecology and highlights the potential for new approaches to inform future monitoring or control

corrosion inhibitor in drinking water distribution systems dwds in order to form highly insoluble phosphate scales that coat pipe walls preventing iron and lead corrosion products entering the water

lidsky and schneider 2003 verstraeten et al 2008 a reported 95 of water supplies in the uk phosphate enrich drinking water at concentrations of typically 1 mg p l hayes and hydes 2012 there is however a growing shift to try and reduce the use of chemical additives including phosphate to drinking supplies but this is currently constrained by historical and regulatory precedence and fears of potential consequences due to limited understanding even though phosphate is not considered harmful to humans elevated concentrations in aquatic ecosystems can promote microbial and algae growth leading to eutrophication glibert 2020 dwds are aquatic ecosystems with a diverse microbiota that colonises pipe walls forming biofilms flemming et al 2002 biofilm growth is affected by different parameters such as hydraulic regime disinfectant residuals temperature and available nutrients including organic carbon nitrogen and phosphorus vrouwenvelder et al 2010 liu et al 2016 phosphate and chlorine can modify the composition of microbial communities batte et al 2003 thus influencing biofilm formation and the amount of available organic matter and rates of disinfectant decay that ultimately determine the formation of disinfection by products chandy et al 2001 besides disinfection the limiting of nutrients in particular organic carbon is considered beneficial for controlling microbial growth in drinking water systems van der kooij et al 2003 volk and lechevallier 1999 showed that microbial growth was inhibited in dwds by reducing the level of organic carbon but in the short term the impact was greater on planktonic microorganisms than biofilms although carbon is typically the principal limiting nutrient in dwds phosphorus can also limit microbial growth miettinen et al 1997 sathasivan et al 1997 the impact of phosphate on the drinking water microbiome has been studied using laboratory pipe systems yielding contradictory results about the effect of phosphate on microorganisms and or biofilms some studies have shown that the addition of phosphates may trigger bacterial growth miettinen et al 1997 sathasivan et al 1997 jang et al 2012 while other studies did not observe an increase in the growth or number of bacteria appenzeller et al 2001 frias et al 2001 gouider et al 2009 in some cases limiting phosphate has been shown to control biofouling of reverse osmosis membranes vrouwenvelder et al 2010 these contradictory results might be associated to different experimental conditions for example appenzeller et al 2001 found a decrease in heterotrophic bacteria growth when phosphate was added in highly corroded iron pipes but a moderate increase in slightly corroded pipes however the research reported was mainly limited to laboratory studies and characterised specific microorganisms using standard culturing methods the work presented here avoids these limitations by investigating the microbial impact of phosphate in an operational network using a holistic approach and includes advanced molecular techniques such as whole metagenome sequencing to study functional traits this information will help to understand the ecological impact of phosphate and to inform network dosing as part of lead or iron control in dwds in addition the results may assist utilities concerned about the potential impact of ceasing phosphate dosing in dwds which has associated benefits including reducing treatment complexities e g ph control chemical purchasing storage needs and critically as part of protecting the environment against eutrophication risks by removing the need for downstream phosphate removal 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and flushing scheme the studied site is from an operational dwds in the uk where high lead and iron concentrations were reported as part of routine network sampling phosphate dosing was installed to ensure regulatory compliance and prevent future health concerns ortho phosphoric acid phosphoric acid 75 pwg airedale chemical company ltd uk was dosed in order to achieve a final water concentration of 1 2 mg l sampling from 2018 to 2020 x 1 18 sd 0 11 mg l n 71 pre dosing orthophosphate as p showed all samples from 2017 0 03 mg l n 25 the new dosing regimen presented an opportunity to examine the impact of phosphate on developing biofilms including mix species microbial composition and potential functional traits in sections of different pipe materials both pre and post phosphate dosing to achieve this a detailed trial plan was proposed that required 4 controlled and extensively monitored flushing operations research has shown that particulate material in dwds accumulates on all boundary surfaces as part of a biofilm matrix with cohesive shear strength properties husband et al 2016 accumulation rates are a factor of background water quality with processes such as corrosion increasing asset deterioration rates with respect to discolouration and associated elevated metal concentrations husband et al 2008 by raising the shear stress the component of stress coplanar to the pipe surface a function of hydraulics pipe diameter and pipe roughness above daily peak values material is lifted from the pipe wall and entrained into the bulk flow this behaviour is commonly observed following network bursts or other interventions that result in modified hydraulic demands but is also utilised in flushing and flow conditioning exercises sunny et al 2020 due to the shear strength characteristics the amount of material mobilised is related to the imposed excess shear stress as a function of the additional flow and with each subsequent increase there is a further release of material as a particulate response the amount of material in the bulk flow can be measured by optical scattering as turbidity the material release responses have been shown to be predictable and repeatable including consistent patterns and magnitudes when given equal development periods and stable water quality husband et al 2008 vreeburg et al 2008 with this understanding of network and pipe wall material behaviour flushing trials were planned with an initial visit to condition test sections by removing material with shear strengths below that of a target flushing flow rate biofilm and associated material were then allowed to develop for three months before a second flushing trial was performed to mobilise the regenerated material that was collected for detailed analysis this twin flushing process was scheduled to occur prior to phosphate addition trials 1 and 2 and then repeated once dosing was established trials 3 and 4 with the aim to investigate the impact of phosphate dosing environmental factors such as temperature and seasonal daily demands were minimised by conducting the trials a year apart and using the same equipment and at the same time of the day the trial flow increases were monitored and controlled by purpose built langham hydrant standpipes with electromagnetic abb aquamaster 3 flow meters with 5 reading accuracy and maximum working pressure of 12 bar turbidity responses connected to the standpipes were measured using 2x ati nephnet loggers for data validity with infrared ir nephelometric measurement and functioning range limited to 0 4 000 ntu for high resolution in one unit and 0 40 00 ntu in the second unit both with an accuracy of 5 of reading in standard flushing operations it is normal to maintain a clean waterfront by ensuring all upstream pipe sections are flushed first this needs to be done otherwise when downstream flushing flows are imposed the extra demand may exceed upstream conditioned values causing material to be mobilised and hence consumer water quality issues yet any network interventions may also potentially disturb test sections whilst upstream flushing could also release material that could affect the composition community on downstream pipes to avoid this and minimise resource requirements to 1 day pipe test sections were connected directly to a larger supply pipe to safeguard against the risk that planned flushing trials would cause upstream impact through collaboration with the water company 4 trial sections were identified for field work with the added advantage that they were of different pipe compositions medium density polyethylene mdpe asbestos cement ac polyvinyl chloride upvc and cast iron ci although this study focusses on comparing independent pipe sections pre and post dosing by selecting trial sections in close proximity and supplied directly from a common trunk main water entering each pipe section was effectively comparable the first three sections mdpe ac upvc were all supplied directly from the single surface water treatment works via a 21 ac trunk main the fourth section 2 km further downstream or one hour extra transit time was via an extra 18 section of spun iron si trunk main both trunk mains were laid in 1987 so established biofilm and long term accumulated material could be assumed relatively consistent with all four trial sections linked directly to effectively the same trunk main i e no intermediary pipe lengths or different pipe materials it meant the bulk water entering each had the same source treatment and transmission experience thereby limiting the impact of bulk water as an experimental variable the high demands through the trunk main and the close proximity of all test sections meant water age and residual chlorine concentrations were also comparable trial sections had diameters in the small range of 75 mm to 125 mm 3 to 5 and were 300 m or more in length except the mdpe pipe pipe properties were mdpe 85 m of 125 mm laid 1995 ac 300 m of 4 100 mm laid 1962 upvc 420 m of 3 75 mm laid 1967 ci 300 m of 4 100 mm laid 1953 with the exception of the upvc which was a dead end each pipe supplied downstream networks and experienced daily demand patterns with peak flows of around 10 l s each pipe was over 20 years in service and water company records indicated no flushing or disturbance within the last 10 years allowing an assumption that pipe wall material and communities were well established and in equilibrium with the system site schematics and more details in douterelo et al 2020 with trial sections feeding downstream consumers flushing flows were selected using the podds prediction of discolouration in distribution systems model husband and boxall 2010 furnass et al 2014 this identified flows to exceed daily peak but limit material mobilisation to prevent the particulate turbidity response in the bulk water from producing customer observable discolouration uk regulatory limit at the customer s tap is 4 ntu whilst circa 10 ntu is required to start becoming visible to investigate differences in shear characteristics and to increase discrete sample numbers for analysis and comparison purposes flushing was planned initially to have three incremental steps with increases occurring once turbidity responses dropped however because time constrained to 1 day on site decisions based on tracking turbidity responses meant trials 2 4 were reduced to just two steps once equipment was installed on site a low flow through the standpipe was established and run for a minimum of 20 min to allow monitoring equipment to stabilise and ensure any stagnant water from the hydrant was removed this was confirmed by ensuring residual chlorine was present 2 2 water quality monitoring the sixteen flushing trials involved an adapted standpipe to control flushing discharge through selected hydrants at the end of each pipe section with visual displays and logging of flow and turbidity water samples prior to flush commencement and at each flushing stage were collected for physico chemical and microbiological analysis several parameters were measured in situ at the times of discrete sample collection prior and during flushing of the pipes free and total chlorine were measured with a palintest method using electrochemical sensors and a palintest cs 100 chlorosense chlorine metre fisher scientific uk temperature and ph were measured using a hanna portable metre and probe hi 991003 all other parameters were obtained by an accredited laboratory analysis of the discrete samples and using validated methods to meet uk drinking water regulations water samples were collected in designated containers and bacterial colony counts were determined by the pour plate method in which yeast extract agar was used following the uk environment agency recommendations environment agency 2012 cultures were incubated at 37 c for 48 h 2 day colony and 22 c for 72 h 3 day colony 2 3 microbial molecular analysis the molecular microbial approach used in this study is based on two different sequencing strategies to study the structure taxonomic composition of all the samples obtained before and after phosphate dosing n 78 two marker genes were sequenced 16s rrna for bacteria and the its2 for fungi in addition selected samples based on turbidity results from each type of material were pooled total number of final samples 8 4 pre and 4 post phosphate dosing and dna concentrated to perform a whole metagenomics sequencing analysis details of each of these analyses are described as follows 2 3 1 dna extraction three replicates of 2 l samples of bulk water were collected as discrete samples during the flushing trials for dna analysis from both pre and post phosphate dosing trials 2 and 4 including collecting background samples before flushing commenced for the mdpe pipe this meant 4 samples and 3 for the ac upvc and ci sections giving a total of 78 samples these samples were each filtered through 0 22 μm nitrocellulose membrane filters millipore corp filters were preserved in the dark and at 80 c for subsequent dna extraction dna extraction from filters was carried out by a method based on proteinase k digestion followed by a standard phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol extraction douterelo et al 2013 the quantity and purity of the extracted dna were assessed using nanodrop nd 1000 spectrophotometer nanodrop wilmington usa 2 3 2 sequencing of marker genes 16s rrna for bacteria and its2 for fungi sequencing was performed at mr dna www mrdnalab com shallowater tx usa on a miseq following the manufacturer s guidelines the 16s rrna gene using primers 28f and 519r spanning the v1 to v3 hypervariable regions and primers targeting the its1 2 regions were used for bacterial and fungal analysis respectively the pcr conditions and illumina library preparation are explained in detail in douterelo et al 2020 sequencing data was processed using mr dna analysis pipeline mr dna shallowater tx usa in summary sequences were joined and depleted of barcodes then sequences with less than 150 bp and with ambiguous base calls were removed sequences were de noised and chimeras were detected using uchime edgar et al 2011 and removed from further analysis final operational taxonomic units otus were taxonomically classified using blastn altschul et al 1990 against a curated database derived from rdpii cole et al 2005 and ncbi to study alpha diversity

and holmes 2014 2 3 3 whole metagenome sequencing to obtain a fingerprint of functional traits selected samples based on peaks of turbidity during flushes were pooled and subjected to whole metagenome sequencing 50 ng of dna was used to prepare the libraries by nextera dna sample preparation illumina following the manufacturer s user guide and the sequencing was performed at mr dna www mrdnalab com shallowater tx usa on miseq following the manufacturer s guidelines as described by douterelo 2020 eight libraries mdpe ac upvc and ci all sampled before and after phosphate treatment were quality checked with fastqc https www bioinformatics babraham ac uk projects fastqc and cross assembled with metaspades v 3 11 0 nurk et al 2017 comparative metagenomic analysis based on this cross assembly was performed with crass dutilh et al 2012 contig abundance was calculated by mapping the reads back to the contigs using bwa mem li and durbin 2009 and calculating the average depth with the jgi summarize bam contig depths script from metabat kang et al 2015 contigs were annotated with interproscan 5 36 75 0 with the parameters appl pfam goterms iprlookup pathways https github com ebi pf team interproscan jones et al 2014 and summarized using the metagenomics ontology of go slim http geneontology org docs download ontology abundance of the functional categories was calculated for each sample by summing the depth values of the contigs where it occurred and the values log 10 transformed pseudocount 0 0001 see supplementary table 1 because the crass cladograms indicated separation of the samples into groups before after phosphate treatment fig 5 overall enrichment scores per functional category due to the phosphate treatment were calculated by averaging the values across the four pipe materials 2 4 statistics to assess the similarity in microbial community structure amongst samples the relative sequence abundance at genus level 97 sequence similarity cut off for each sample was used to calculate pairwise similarities all data were transformed by square root calculations and bray curtis similarity matrixes were generated using the software primer v7 primer e plymouth uk bray curtis similarity matrixes were visualised using multiple dimensional scaling mds diagrams analysis of similarity statistics anosim was calculated using the same bray curtis distance matrix to test the significance of differences amongst samples based on pipe material for both bacteria and fungi the values for the anosim r statistic ranges from 1 to 1 where r 1 indicates that communities from different pipe materials are completely dissimilar principal component analysis pca was used to evaluate the distribution of microorganisms taking into account materials and phosphate dosing generated using the software primer v7 primer e plymouth uk to determine if the observed differences in the richness diversity and dominance indeces were significant pairwise comparisons between samples from different materials were made using the non parametric mann whitney u test using ibm spss 21 3 results 3 1 flushing flow and turbidity each investigative visit 4 over two years and flushing operations 4 per visit approximately 1 hour each including incremental increases were completed in one day with initial pre dosing conditioning trial 1 in march 2017 followed after 90 days biofilm material development by the sample collection analysis trial 2 phosphate dosing at the treatment works commenced 5 months later november 2017 following a field operative call out on the scheduled date the post dosing conditioning trial 3 was delayed a month until april 2018 with the sample collection trial 4 after biofilm development again exactly 90 days later prior to and during the investigative period no significant network events were recorded or changes in network demands or operation other than phosphate dosing coming on line sampling results including free chlorine water temperature and doc from the water treatment works highlight network supplied water quality and therefore likely particulate material loading to be consistent across both generation phases as shown in fig 1 although water temperature at the start is the same for both years during 2018 it does however rise quicker a cold spell just before the final flushing visit brings temperatures back in line flow and turbidity results from all four flushing trials for each pipe section are shown in fig 2 plots show times adjusted to create a common start time with a maximum 63 minute shift required to align all 16 trials in all cases imposed hydraulics were comparable for all flushes except the mdpe pipe where flush 2 4 had higher flows fig 2a with trials 1 and 3 however the same applied hydraulics are consistent for both phases of the trial and therefore results remain comparable in the ac pipe fig 2b during trial 4 the terminal step was 4 l s compared to 3 4 l s from trial 2 trials in both the upvc and ci pipes figs 2c and 2d respectively had consistent flow magnitudes but some variance in durations in particular the terminal flushing phase as a result of waiting for turbidity values to drop to agreed levels of 0 5 ntu before finishing these temporal differences however would be not expected to impact turbidity responses more details on the hydraulic properties and results from the first two trials can be found in douterelo et al 2020 initial inspection of the turbidity responses observed from all pipe sections suggests that the addition of phosphate considerably increases discolouration risk the mean turbidity results for each pipe and trial are reported in table 1 in every pipe a greater turbidity response is observed once phosphate dosing has commenced supporting the initial observation that phosphate enrichment increases discolouration risk comparison between materials of the pipe sections showed similar turbidity increases for mdpe and ac pipes where both sections were hydraulically similar 2 1x and 1 5x respectively the ci pipe showed by far the greatest increase in turbidity 4 7x suggesting changes in corrosion or corrosion legacy thus suggesting metallic corrosion remains an issue despite the presence of phosphate the dead end pipe where material accumulation can be considered predominantly a sedimentation process and not biofilm formation on walls showed almost no change 1 1x suggesting that the bulk water material loading background concentrations is largely unaffected 3 2 discrete sampling and physico chemical analysis results from the physico chemical analysis of discrete water samples are showed in table 2 given the common water source supply many physico chemical variables were similar amongst all the samples including ph 7 6 7 8 conductivity 240 250 μs cm nitrite 0 004 mg l and sulphate 8 6 9 5 mg l however changes were found in some physico chemical parameters between the first sample period in june 2017 and the second period a year later after phosphate dosing the quantification of orthophosphate confirms that water in the first sampling period had no little phosphate 0 03 mg l whilst one year later this had increased to 1 1 1 2 mg l which is the average uk standard water phosphate concentration toc and doc were higher and more variable going from 1 9 2 0 mg l to 2 4 2 7 mg l and 2 0 2 1 mg l to 2 4 3 2 mg l respectively post phosphate addition nitrate were 0 52 0 54 mg l in the first sampling period and decreased until not being detected 0 5 after phosphate dosing chlorine both free and total was higher under post phosphate dosing conditions in most of the samples analysed with the exception of mdpe samples where it was slightly higher pre phosphate 0 7 1 1 mg l temperature in the second sampling period was slightly higher and increased across the trial periods from an average of 18 c to 21 30 c in pre phosphate dosing water iron concentrations were significantly higher in the ci pipe and the upvc pipe samples when compared with other pipe materials post phosphate dosing higher iron concentrations were found in mdpe and ac pipes when compared with pre phosphate conditions in addition iron increased in the last flushing step in the ac pipe after phosphate dosing manganese concentration was stable in most of the conditions 0 012 0 053 mg l and it was slightly higher in the final flushing steps in both ci and ac pipes in post phosphate samples lead concentration was similar amongst all the samples except in the last flushing steps after phosphate dosing were increased in ac and ci pipes and decrease in the upvc pipe results from the colony counts are shown in table 3 colony counts values were only representative in samples from the ac pipe with up to 7 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days and 4 colonies at 22 c for 3 in pre phosphate samples however up to 21 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days and up to 3 colonies at 22 c for 3 days were found under phosphate concentrations also 42 colonies per ml at 22 c for 7 days were count in the ci pipe and 13 in the final flushing stage of mdpe pipe in post phosphate addition samples 3 2 effect of phosphate on microbial community composition before vs after taxonomic analysis based on marker genes 16s rrna and its2 for bacteria and fungi respectively differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were found in relation to phosphate dosing pipe material and flushing steps 3 2 1 bacterial relative abundance at genus level the relative abundance of the most abundant otus at genus level 95 similarity cut off has been analysed comparing the flushing steps in different materials and pre and post phosphate dosing figs 3 and 4 independently of pipe material or phosphate concentration the first flushing step generally resulted in samples with higher relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities the proceeding flushing steps were less microbial rich bacteria and fungi concerning phosphate dosing bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi the results observed from figs 3 and 4 were reinforced by the diversity indices data fig 7 the bacterial analysis fig 3 showed that the most represented genera in all the samples was pseudomonas with a relative abundance between 4 and 21 in pre phosphate samples and ranging from 4 to 32 under post phosphate dosing an increase in abundance of pseudomonas post phosphate was observed particularly in ac and ci pipe samples other genera well represented in pre phosphate samples were gloeobacter 2 14 and staphylococcus 3 14 however in post phosphate samples gloeobacter almost disappeared 0 2 and staphylococcus was mainly present in mdpe pipe samples 4 17 but noticeably diminished in ac upvc and ci pipe samples acinetobacter was relatively abundant in mdpe samples particularly in the last flushing steps under pre phosphate dosing 10 suggesting preference to deeper and more consolidated biofilm colonisation niche this genus had little representation in ac pvc and ci pipe pre phosphate but increased abundance in post phosphate samples especially in ci 13 24 other genus that had little representation 0 2 in all pre phosphate samples but increased post phosphate was paenibacillus paenibacillus post phosphate showed high relative abundance in mdpe samples in the first flushing steps 12 13 and in the first flushing step of other materials 2 5 but was then poorly represented suggesting a colonisation preference for outer layers of developing dwds biofilms when phosphate is prevalent brucella in pre phosphate upvc samples ranged from 1 in the first flushing step to 14 in the last one in ci samples brucella was also relatively abundant 7 21 in pre phosphate samples and decreased to 3 in the last flushing step post phosphate in pre phosphate samples and upvc streptococcus have higher abundance 5 to 12 when compared with samples from other materials after phosphate addition streptococcus was still present in ac 6 4 ci 2 0 and upvc samples 0 11 and mdpe samples 0 6 in the first flushing step to 7 in the last one 3 2 2 fungal relative abundance at genus level the analysis of fungal communities fig 4 showed that in pre phosphate samples cladosporium from 15 to 51 was present in all the samples remarkably pre phosphate ac samples showed relative abundances of 43 to 51 cryptococcus was the second most abundant genus in pre phosphate samples average 12 n 13 yet its presence decreased after phosphate dosing 1 6 and only showing a relative abundance of 10 in the last flushing step in ci samples under pre phosphate dosing conditions other abundant genera were saccharomyces in mdpe samples average 7 n 4 and in the first flushing steps of ac and upvc 4 and 32 respectively aureobasidium had a relative abundance of 3 4 in mdpe ac and ci samples penicillium in ci 30 in the first flush and alternaria in mdpe 25 in the third flushing stage under post phosphate conditions saccharomyces was also represented in mdpe average 4 n 4 and in ac changing from 22 to 4 as the flushing steps moved forward cadophora was represented in all samples ranging from 1 to 22 being more abundant in ac and ci and exophiala in mdpe average 4 n 4 and ac average 8 n 3 samples rhizophagus was a genus with no representation under pre phosphate conditions but it was found ranging from 1 to 11 in all water samples post phosphate 3 2 3 non metric multidimensional scaling mds analysis of bacteria and fungi and cross assembly analysis of whole metagenome sequencing with crass mds plots of the relative abundance of bacteria at 95 sequence similarity cut off showed a clear separation between pre and post phosphate dosing and all different pipe materials even though some outliers were found fig 5 a the analysis of similarities anosim confirmed the differences amongst bacterial community structures global r 0 654 p 0 1 differences also were found in fungal structure between phosphate conditions global r 0 56 p 0 1 but only between some pipe materials fig 5b pre phosphate fungal community structure was significantly different between mdpe and ac pipes r 0 258 p 0 3 mdpe and pvc pipes r 0 317 p 0 1 mdpe and ci pipes r 0 389 p 0 1 and ac and ci pipes r 0 275 p 0 3 post phosphate showed significant differences only between mdpe and ci pipes r 0 336 p 0 2 and ac and ci pipes r 0 408 p 0 1 the differences amongst microbial community structures were further supported by comparative metagenomics analysis i e similarities between metagenomes the cross assembly analysis with crass using whole metagenomics reads was represented using cladograms fig 5c these show many cross contigs that exclusively contain reads from pre or post phosphate metagenomes independently of the pipe material analysed notably the pre and post treatment phosphate samples were sequenced in separate batches so potential batch effects could not be ruled out leek et al 2010 3 2 4 principal component analysis pca pca analysis was performed in bacterial and fungal communities using data from relative abundance at 95 sequence similarity cut off fig 6 pca indicated that generally samples clustered together as function of phosphate dosing in both bacteria and fungi a clear separation between pre and post phosphate addition samples were observed and some genera had affinity for one or the other condition several bacterial genera fig 6a including pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter had a vector with tendency to appear after phosphate dosing p this trend was also observed for the fungi fig 6b rhizophagus eupenicillium cadophora and trechispora for bacteria samples also clustered with respect to pipe material yet this effect of pipe material was not clear for fungi after phosphate addition the results indicate that differences in microbial community arise following the addition of phosphate and this occurs irrespective of pipe material 3 2 5 bacterial and fungal alpha diversity shannon diversity index dominance and chao1 richness estimator at genus level for bacteria and fungi were performed fig 7 overall bacterial communities were more diverse and rich than fungal communities regarding bacteria significant differences were found in all indices shannon chao1 and dominance between pre and post phosphate conditions p 0 05 n 39 higher diversity and richness were obtained for bacteria under pre phosphate conditions compared to post phosphate samples ac samples presented more diversity average 3 76 n 18 and lower values for the dominance indicator average 0 07 n 18 lower values were found in pre phosphate samples for the dominance indicator in bacteria regarding this index significant differences were found between ac and ci in pre phosphate samples for bacteria p 0 05 and between mdpe and ac fungi pre phosphate samples p 0 05 fungal communities pre phosphate dosing were less rich and had higher values for the dominance index than fungi post phosphate conditions but no differences were found regarding diversity 3 3 effect of phosphate on microbial traits and functions results for the analysis of whole metagenomics sequencing are showed in fig 8 overall pre phosphate samples independently of the pipe material or flush step had higher relative abundance of functional traits associated to biosynthetic process nucleotidyl transferase activity and nucleic acid binding and transport activity when the results of the relative abundance of the functional traits were log transformed supplementary material table 1 some functional traits that were not present or not well represented in pre phosphate samples were distinguished for all types of pipe material including gram negative bacterium type cell wall virion thylakoid and extrachromosomal circular dna however other functional traits decreased in all samples including quorum sensing methanogenesis beta galactosidase complex vitamin binding 4 discussion 4 1 effect of phosphate dosing on turbidity and material accumulation on pipe materials independently of pipe material or phosphate regime results showed the first flushing step generally resulted in samples with higher microbial relative abundance this result could be expected as biofilm mobilised in the first flushing step can be considered as the outer layer that is exposed to the highest exchange with the bulk flow including nutrient and planktonic cell transfer donlan 2002 while the underlying biofilm layers with more consolidated conditions and lower transfer potential are less diverse and more resistant to detachment paul et al 2012 douterelo et al 2013 it is generally considered that diverse microbial communities are better at resisting and adapting to environmental changes due to functional redundancy allison and martiny 2008 the outer layers therefore provide a barrier helping to maintain conditions and protect against mobilisation of material consolidated in underlying zones in addition the metabolically active outer biofilm layers may prevent the immediate effectiveness of phosphate dosing by breaking up and slowing the formation of resilient and protective insoluble lead phosphates scales with the rapid increase of hydraulic forces during flushing deeper biofilm layers become exposed to new conditions as these communities adapt or break down material previously trapped can be released resulting in higher turbidity as observed table 1 the generally higher turbidity after flushing post phosphate dosing could also be attributable to the newly developing biofilm having an enhanced capability of cellular growth and or extracellular polymeric substance eps production this would enable greater material trapping and retention flemming et al 2016 however without cells or eps quantification this observation on more rapid biofilm growth and or increased eps production yielding enhanced material capture cannot be confirmed eps contains compounds that participate in biofilm adhesion and several studies in drinking water agree that when phosphate content increases the production of eps decreases fang et al 2010 kirisits et al 2013 noh et al 2019 if eps production is reduced by phosphate addition it could be argued biofilm capability to adhere to pipes will be reduced allowing easier removal and hence a reason for the higher turbidities observed the effect of phosphate on eps production could explain the increased turbidity response from the ci pipe post phosphate preventing the rapid action of phosphate forming protective scales and allowing high concentrations of corrosion by products historically phosphate addition is recognised as beneficial to reduce plumbosolvency of drinking water hence the higher turbidity response observed in this study could be linked to a transitional period that will recover once phosphate adapted microbial communities have been established further trials would be key to test this and are recommended especially with initial findings showing the addition of phosphate has not reduced iron or lead concentrations as expected a key recommendation to water utilities would be to ensure that where changes in the network are planned preceding maintenance or cleaning strategies are undertaken to minimise biofilm impact this would remove accumulated pipe wall material capable of causing both short and long term risk and in the case of preventative chemical remediation such as phosphate dosing to build protective scales allow more rapid penetration and greater effectiveness 4 2 phosphate dosing effect on microbial community structure considering the influence of phosphate on material mobilised from pipe walls clear differences were found between pre and post phosphate dosing samples particularly for bacterial communities bacteria were the main drivers of changes in biofilm community structure in terms of richness and diversity bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi previous studies have observed that bacterial communities were more affected by environmental fluctuations than fungi within biofilms in chlorinated dwds douterelo et al 2018 this study supports this trend and shows higher environmental influence on bacteria occurring in biofilms attached to a range of materials used in dwds the analysis of bacterial relative abundance showed clear taxonomic differences related to phosphate dosing in all type of materials higher diversity and richness were obtained pre phosphate for bacteria when compared with post phosphate conditions this study shows how phosphate acts as a selective force for microorganisms favouring those able to use or metabolise phosphate many microorganisms are able to transform phosphate in polyphosphates polyp and accumulate it in their cells boswell et al 2001 in fact there is a phenomenon called luxury uptake of phosphorous phosphate in which bacteria accumulate polyp under phosphate excess conditions even though it might not be favourable for their growth khoshmanesh et al 2002 hirota et al 2010 in this study higher abundance of acinetobacter members were found in post phosphate samples and it has been reported that acinetobacter are important in phosphorus removal strategies in wastewater treatment plants kim et al 1997 bunce et al 2018 similarly paenibacillus present in this study has been related to solubilisation of phosphate in soils arthurson et al 2011 the pca analysis fig 6 showed that some genera such as pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia and acinetobacter were clearly influenced by phosphate and these genera have been linked to solubilisation or accumulation of phosphate in previous studies van groenestijn et al 1988 boswell et al 2001 zheng et al 2017 fungi such as rhizophagus increased their abundance after phosphate dosing and this fungi is known to establish symbiotic interactions with plants to help phosphate uptake fiorilli et al 2013 rhizophagus and eupenicillium were clearly influenced by phosphate addition in this study and they have been previously related to phosphate solubilisation in a range of environments vyas et al 2007 garcia et al 2017 previous studies indicated that certain materials used to build drinking water infrastructure can leach out polymers that fungi can degrade belila et al 2017 a possible explanation for the high relative abundance of some organisms in this study for example penicillium and fusarium are known biodegraders of natural and synthetic polyethylene ojha et al 2017 and have great potential for removal of pharmaceutical compounds olicón hernández et al 2017 since biofilm formation on pipes is unavoidable further research is now needed to determine if the occurrence of specific inter kingdom interactions can promote beneficial biofilms and aid biodegradation of contaminants in these systems the most common group of microorganisms in all the samples but with different relative abundance depending on the pipe material and flushing step were pseudomonas acinetobacter and sphingomonas and in ci pipes brucella niquette et al 2000 examined the influence of pipe materials on densities of fixed bacterial biomass in dwds showing that biomass on plastic pvc and pe were lowest in comparison with iron and that cement based materials had intermediate values conversely other researchers have shown that plastic including pe can stimulate biofilm growth due to the release of biodegradable compounds that can promote microbial growth van der kooij et al 2005 yu et al 2010 the results from this study indicate that pipe material affects microbial communities in particular bacteria and those differences were mainly between corroding and non corroding materials 4 3 effect of phosphate dosing on functional traits and metagenomes most of the sequences analysed were related to biofilm development and resistant mechanisms overall three main functional traits were characterised biosynthetic process nucleic acid binding and nucleotide transferase activity fig 8 biosynthetic process in biofilms are mainly related with eps production and related to functions such as cell attachment formation and maintenance of biofilm structure and resistance to environmental stress including disinfectants hall stoodley and stoodley 2002 regarding nucleic acid binding these sequences are associated to proteins that bind to dna rna and include transcriptional factors which modulate protein expression hudson and ortlund 2014 nucleotidyltransferases are enzymes within the transferases group which are associated to an extensive class of bacterial enzymes that inhibit antibiotic target binding promoting its inactivation wright 2005 schroeder et al 2017 the analysis of interrelationships between metagenomes showed clear differences between pre and post phosphate treatments fig 5c mapping metagenomic sequences to a reference database is a useful approach to transfer taxonomical and functional annotations to sequence reads however it can limit the amount of data that can be analysed since most sequencing reads in difficult to annotate datasets e g viral metagenomes lack known homologs dutilh et al 2012 an alternative is using reference independent comparative metagenomics by cross assembly through crass the cross assembly analysis showed that the effect of the phosphate addition was stronger than the effect of the pipe material since the before and after samples clustered together phosphate dosing favoured the presence of sequences related to functional traits in particular gram negative bacterium type cell walls virions thylakoids and extrachromosal circular dna supplementary table 1 gram negative bacteria are predominant inhabitants of drinking water systems and include proteobacteria members and the phylum bacterioidetes vaz moreira et al 2017 gram negative bacteria have an outer membrane that makes them resistant to antibiotics detergents and disinfectants mckeon et al 1995 thus are of public health concern very high rate of resistance to antibiotics have been found amongst gram negative bacteria and within them enterobacteriaceae since they have a more fluid genome mediated by plasmids that carry antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity genes wellington et al 2013 hawkey 2015 this reinforces our results where higher abundance of sequences associated with extrachromosomal circular dna were observed after phosphate dosing extrachromosomal circular dna are a type of mobile genetic elements mge that facilitate dna transfer between cells and can provide host cells with advantages such as antibiotic resistance or adaptive metabolic pathways rankin et al 2011 it is known that mixed species biofilms in dwds can house antibiotic resistance bacteria gomez alvarez et al 2016 douterelo et al 2018 thus biofilm mobilisation may contribute to spreading environmental antimicrobial resistance additionally gram negative bacteria are known to have enhanced adhesion capabilities sommer et al 1999 promoting biofilm spread and colonisation taking into account these findings phosphate addition is shown to have potentially detrimental consequences that may be of concern to public health on the distribution system microbiome virions were more represented in all samples post phosphate dosing they are commonly transported in drinking water systems by amoebas atanasova et al 2018 where they are protected against the action of disinfectants flood and ashbolt 2000 have demonstrated the potential of model enteric virions and virion sized particles to accumulate and persist within biofilms in drinking water systems this study only analysed dna thus it is not known if the sequences associated to virions are a realistic representation of these type of microorganisms in biofilms the results obtained however support the need for more detailed microbial analysis in routine drinking water monitoring strategies with surveillance methods needing to take into consideration the accumulation of virions and other potential pathogens within water pipe biofilms sequences associated with thylakoids were also prevalent post phosphate dosing fig 8 thylakoids are organelles which contains pigments that absorb energy in photosynthetic organisms and have been used as a fast and effective screening test to detect herbicides in water euzet et al 2005 the presence of thylakoids can also indicate the increase of photosynthetic microorganisms such as cyanobacteria in biofilms of dwds cyanobacteria have been found in this study however no significant increase was observed in post phosphate dosing samples cyanobacteria have been reported previously as important inhabitants of biofilms in dwds hwang et al 2012 lin et al 2013 douterelo et al 2016 and despite the lack of light it has been suggested that they have an alternative metabolism that allows them to survive in the absence of light sequences associated with functional traits that decreased in all samples after phosphate dosing include quorum sensing methanogenesis beta galactosidase complexes and vitamin binding fig 8 quorum sensing is a mechanism common in biofilms where cells regulate their cooperative activities and physiological processes by releasing sensing and responding to small diffusible signal molecules li and tian 2012 therefore phosphate dosing might influence the ability of bacteria to communicate and subsequently form biofilms and as discussed above phosphate can inhibit eps production if phosphate addition is involved or has an indirect role in quorum sensing mechanisms and their control this may open a new avenue for controlling biofilm formation in dwds beta galactosidase complexes are hydrolytic enzymes responsible for the degradation of a variety of natural and synthetic substrates asraf and gunasekaran 2010 thus biofilms may use them to degrade a range of compounds and thrive in dwds phosphate dosing also decreased methanogenesis which is the final step in anaerobic degradation of carbon and is used by microorganisms to degrade carbon when all alternative electron acceptors have been exhausted zeikus 1977 methanogens are amongst the most diverse groups of microbes and vary significantly in their environmental conditions and cell structure in the literature methanogens are well known bio degraders of micropollutants and most belong to the group of archaea harb et al 2019 archaea have been found in drinking water systems mainly in systems supplied from groundwater and associated to ammonia oxidation van der wielen et al 2009 although phosphate dosing decreased sequences associated to methanogenesis this study cannot directly associate this with a reduction in the number of archaea phosphate addition decreased functional sequences related to vitamin binding vitamins and other cofactors play a critical role in determining bacterial growth rates and microbiome dynamics sonnenburg and sonnenburg 2014 the importance of vitamin acquisition and the mechanisms that microbes use to acquire these vitamins have been reported in other environments putnam et al 2020 vitamins can play a critical role in driving microbiome dynamics and competition for vitamins can favour bacteria that are better at capturing those studies based on single species biofilms showed vitamin related processes can influence biofilm formation and development pandit et al 2017 studying pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms suggested that non lethal concentrations of vitamin c can inhibit bacterial quorum sensing and other regulatory mechanisms involved in biofilm development as a result eps biosynthesis is reduced and once content is below a critical point cells get exposed and are more susceptible to antimicrobials or treatments considering these previous studies a reduction of vitamin binding function in a dwds context could be translated as selection for certain type of microorganisms supporting reduced diversity observed post phosphate and or influence eps structure and microbiome susceptibility to environmental conditions further studies are needed to understand how vitamin acquisition shapes competition and community structure under dwds environmental conditions and appreciate vitamin binding implications at an operational and management level 5 conclusions this innovative research investigates the effect of phosphate dosing on the microbial ecology within an operational dwds the detailed study plan facilitated investigation of the impact of pipe material and hydraulics on developing biofilms following changes in water chemistry due to phosphate enrichment the work highlights differences in microbial diversity and functional traits and demonstrates clear operational impact with respect to discolouration risk key findings include differences in the taxonomic composition of both bacteria and fungi were found in relation to phosphate dosing pipe material and flushing steps bacterial communities showed a higher relative abundance diversity and richness in pre phosphate dose samples whilst the opposite was observed for fungi cast iron pipe samples had less diverse communities with dominant representatives compared to other non corroding pipes first flushing steps resulted in samples with higher relative abundance of bacterial and fungal communities post phosphate dosing a community shift towards microorganisms able to use or metabolise phosphate was observed including the bacteria pseudomonas paenibacillus massilia acinetobacter and the fungi cadophora rhizophagus and eupenicillium addition of phosphate favoured the appearance of gram negative bacterium type cell wall virion and thylakoid function sequences but decreased functional sequences associated to vitamin binding methanogenesis and toxin biosynthesis operationally turbidity responses discolouration and elevated metal concentration risk from the phosphate enriched water was increased particularly from cast iron pipes with current faecal indicator tests only providing risk detection this work improves understanding and highlights the potential

17496,hypochlorous acid hocl is typically assumed to be the primary reactive species in free available chlorine fac solutions lately it has been shown that less abundant chlorine species such as chlorine monoxide cl2o and chlorine cl2 can also influence the kinetics of the abatement of certain organic compounds during chlorination in this study the chlorination as well as bromination kinetics and mechanisms of 12 olefins including 3 aliphatic and 9 aromatic olefins with different structures were explored hocl shows a low reactivity towards the selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants 1 0 m 1s 1 about 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than those of cl2o and cl2 hocl is the dominant chlorine species during chlorination of olefins under typical drinking water conditions while cl2o and cl2 are likely to play important roles at high fac concentration near circum neutral ph for cl2o or at high cl concentration under acidic conditions for cl2 bromination of the 12 olefins suggests that hobr and br2o are the major reactive species at ph 7 5 with species specific second order rate constants of br2o nearly 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than of hobr ranging from 0 01 to 103 m 1s 1 the reactivities of chlorine and bromine species towards olefins follow the order of hocl hobr br2o cl2o cl2 generally electron donating groups e g ch2oh and ch3 enhances the

reasonable linear free energy relationship lfer between the species specific second order rate constants of br2o or cl2o reactions with aromatic olefins and their hammett σ was established with a more

organic compounds hocl and ocl eq 1 morris 1966 are often regarded as the main chlorine species during chlorination with hocl often controlling reaction kinetics deborde and von gunten 2008 1 hocl ocl

due to their low concentrations which are several orders of magnitude lower than hocl ocl for example the concentrations of hocl ocl cl2o and cl2 are around 1 4 10 5 1 4 10 5 1 7 10 12 and 2 3 10 13 m respectively at ph 7 5 under typical drinking water chlorination conditions e g fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm cl 8 mg l 0 23 mm in this paper if not otherwise stated text s1 and figure s1a supporting information si yet there is evidence that the low concentrations of cl2 and cl2o can be compensated by their high reactivities with some organic compounds sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 cai et al 2013 2017 for instance sivey et al 2010 reported that the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with dimethenamid were around 0 18 1 37 106 and 1 21 106 m 1s 1 respectively and cl2o contributed 50 to the total fac reactivity under typical drinking water chlorination conditions cai et al 2013 showed that the contribution of cl2 to the transformation of antipyrine an anti inflammatory drug by chorine increased with decreasing ph with a contribution of 42 at ph 3 2 while cl2o had a relatively stable contribution 23 over the ph range of 4 0 7 0 generally cl2 can affect fac reactivity towards some organic compounds at ph 7 5 in the presence of high concentration of cl while cl2o plays an important role around neutral ph for high fac concentrations sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 cai et al 2013 lau et al 2016 bromine bromide br is one of the key constituents of water matrixes and is highly relevant in oxidation

second order rate constants k app of hobr reactions with substituted phenols at ph 7 0 k app 103 105 m 1s 1 are on average about 3000 times higher than for hocl the presence of br during chlorination can not only accelerate the transformation of micropollutants but also change the types and concentrations of dbps formed from dissolved organic matter lee and von gunten 2009 zhao et al 2010 zhai and

reactions of br2o br2 brcl and brocl with dimethenamid were up to 103 106 times higher than for hobr brcl is predominant at ph 7 0 while hobr dominated the overall transformation of dimethenamid at ph 7 0 under typical drinking water chlorination conditions i e fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm cl 10 5 mg l 0 3 mm br 100 µg l 1 25 µm contributions of br2o brocl and brcl were 20 in the ph range of 5 9 however they become increasingly important at higher cl for brcl fac for brocl or br leading to higher hobr and consequently higher br2o concentrations concentrations for example br2o contributed 3 5 to dimethenamid transformation under typical drinking water chlorination conditions at ph 7 5 in the presence of 1 25 µm br 100 µg l while it contributed 13 1 and 28 4 when the br concentration increased to 5 0 µm 400 µg l and 10 µm br 800 µg l respectively under similar conditions sivey et al 2013 overall the available kinetic data suggest that the less abundant chlorine or bromine species e g cl2o cl2 br2o br2 brcl and brocl can play significant roles in the chlorination or bromination of various organic compounds such as p xylene voudrias and reinhard 1988a voudrias and reinhard 1988b ethers sivey and roberts 2012 sivey et al 2015 antipyrine cai et al 2013 aminopyrine cai et al 2017 chloro phenols lau et al 2016 and dimethenamid sivey et al 2010 2013 especially those reacting with relatively low second order rate constants with hocl and hobr olefinic compounds olefins are electron rich compounds which are frequently present in anthropogenic and natural micropollutants such as carbamazepine ionones β cyclocitral and microcystins tixier et al 2003 nikolaou et al 2007 peter et al 2009 chen et al 2010 limited studies show that hocl has a low to negligible reactivities towards olefins prütz 1998 pattison et al 2003 acero et al 2005b rodriguez et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 while bromine has moderate to high reactivities however generally only limited kinetic information is available staff et al 2007 2008 it has been reported that the relative importance of cl2o and cl2 increases with decreasing reactivity of the target compound towards hocl sivey et al 2012 recently lau et al 2019 reported that cl2 and cl2o dominated the chlorination kinetics of cyclic olefins e g β ionone at high cl and hocl concentrations respectively even though these studies provide some insights into the reactivity of fac and bromine including their speciation towards selected olefin structures there is still a significant knowledge gap in this field the aim of this study was to establish kinetic and mechanistic data on chlorine or bromine reactions with olefins with various substituents both aliphatic and aromatic olefins were investigated in this study the effect of fac and bromine speciation on the apparent second order rate constants was investigated by ph variations and or concentration variations of fac and bromine based on these systematic variations of the reaction conditions species specific second order rate constants for various chlorine mainly hocl cl2o and cl2 and bromine species mainly hobr and br2o were determined to assess their importance during chlorination or bromination of various olefinic compounds furthermore products from the chlorination of cinnamic acid were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the 12 selected olefins fig 1 were purchased from sigma aldrich and used without further purification table s1 si for more information on purities and cas numbers stock solutions of the olefins 4 mm were prepared by dissolving the compounds in methanol due to their low solubility in water spiking solutions of olefins were prepared by diluting the methanolic stock solutions to 1 mm by ultrapurified water 18 2 ωm cm obtained from a millipore milli q water purification system the final concentrations of methanol introduced in the reaction solutions were 2 5 v v which was demonstrated in control experiments to have a negligible effect on the fac and bromine concentrations for the relevant time scales in this study fac stock solutions 45 0 mm were obtained by diluting a commercial sodium hypochlorite naocl

guarantee full oxidation of bromide pinkernell et al 2000 after 24 h the hobr solution was purged with nitrogen for 15 min to remove residual ozone and then the solution ph was elevated to 12 0 using naoh to avoid the disproportionation of hobr beckwith and margerum 1997 the hobr stock solution 0 8 0 9 mm was stored at 4 c in brown bottles and standardized spectrophotometrically by measuring the obr absorbance at 329 nm ε 332 m 1 cm 1 at ph 12 before use kumar and margerum 1987 fresh hobr solutions were prepared every week 2 2 kinetic experiments all experiments were performed in duplicates

experiments investigating the impacts of cl on the chlorination kinetics of ca and dien cooh fig 1 kcl 0 20 mm was also added to acetic acid 10 mm buffered solutions at ph 5 0 thereafter the solution ph was measured and re adjusted addition of fac or bromine slightly increased the ph by h2so4 1 m or naoh 1 m to maintain the reaction solution at the desired ph finally a selected olefin 3 5 µm was added to the vigorously stirred solution to initiate the reaction and the vials were immediately capped 1 ml samples were withdrawn after pre determined reaction times and quenched with thiosulfate thiosulfate fac 0 or thiosulfate bromine 0 5 for high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis of the olefins control experiments showed that thiosulfate had a negligible impact on the stability of the chlorinated and brominated samples the ph changed by 0 1 unit over the course of all the reactions for the fast reactions of bromine with dien cooh and dien oh fig 1 a stopped flow

information uv vis spectra were measured by a shimadzu uv 1800 spectrophotometer the initial and final concentrations of fac and bromine in working solutions were measured by the abts method pinkernell et al 2000 and the results indicated that the oxidant concentrations varied 10 for all the kinetic runs the cl concentration in the fac solution was analyzed by ion chromatography ic

first order rate constants k obs for the reactions of olefins with fac or bromine were determined from linear regressions of the experimental ln olefins t olefins 0 vs time data second order rate constants k app for the reactions of chlorine species hocl cl2o and cl2 and bromine species hobr and br2o with olefins were calculated by nonlinear least squares regressions in origin 8 5 seifert 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 chlorination of olefins 3 1 1 kinetics of fac reactions with olefins figure s4 si shows the first order plots for the oxidation of olefins 5 0 µm by fac 0 5 4 5 mm at ph 7 5 the good linear correlations suggest that the reactions are first order with respect to olefins the reaction rates for chlorination of olefins in the presence of excess fac can be described by eqs 10 and 11 10 rate d olefin dt k fac 0 n olefin k obs olefin 11 k obs k fac 0 n where k represents the second order rate constant for the reaction of fac with an olefin k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate constant for reaction of fac with an olefin fac 0 represents the initial fac concentration and n represents the reaction order in fac a log transformation of eq 11 yields eq 12 12 lo g obs n log fac 0 logk the reaction order in fac i e values of n can be determined via linear regressions of log k obs vs log fac 0 k obs for selected olefins 5 0 µm in the presence of different fac 0 0 1 6 0 mm under pseudo first order conditions at ph 7 5 were measured and are shown in fig 2 k obs increases with increasing fac 0 and the resulting n values range from 1 0 0 2 for mca and 4 cl α cnca to 2 1 0 07 for 4 cl ca figure s5 si for most of the olefins n values are 1 4 similar trends were also observed for reactions of aromatic ethers sivey et al 2012 and dimethenamid sivey et al 2010 with fac which can be explained by the combined contributions of different chlorine species to the overall chlorine reactivity the reaction is second order in hocl i e n 2 if cl2o is the predominant reactive chlorine species as cl2o is proportional to hocl 2 i e cl2o k2 hocl 2 eq 2 furthermore a disguised second order dependence on hocl can be observed if fac solutions contain approximately equimolar concentrations of hocl and cl i e cl2 k3 hocl cl h k3 hocl 2 h when hocl cl eq 3 lau et al 2016 indeed ion chromatography analyses showed that cl in the fac solution were about 1 7 times the hocl and this level of cl cl baseline was considered for reaction solutions without extra addition of cl hence the obtained n values ranging from 1 to 2 likely resulted from the combined contribution of hocl cl2o and cl2 therefore k obs for the chlorination of olefins can be expressed as eq 13 13 k obs k hocl hocl k cl 2 o cl 2 o k cl 2 cl 2 where k hocl k c l 2 o and k c l 2 represent the species specific second order rate constants m 1s 1 for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with olefins respectively 3 1 2 chlorination kinetics of dien cooh and ca role of cl2 for the oxidation of organic compounds previous studies show that cl2 usually plays an important role at ph 7 5 in the presence of high cl concentrations while cl2o is non negligible at neutral ph sivey et al 2010 2012 lau et al 2016 based on literature data the fractions of hocl f hocl eq 14a cl2o f cl2o eq 14b and cl2 f cl2 eq 14c to the transformation of selected target compounds by fac under our experimental conditions i e fac 0 1 6 0 mm cl baseline 1 7 hocl 0 ph 7 5 were calculated with the reported species specific second order rate constants and are provided in figure s6 si 14a f h o c l k hocl hocl k c l 2 o c l 2

of 0 1 mm while it becomes increasingly important with increasing fac 0 for each compound f cl2 remains 20 for the majority of the compounds except for two chlorophenols and one cyclic olefin at ph 7 5 even at fac 0 of 6 0 mm the maximum fac 0 used in this study even though the contribution of cl2 seems to be generally low its relevance for chlorination of olefins at ph 7 5 was investigated for dien cooh and ca as representative aliphatic and aromatic olefins respectively determination of kinetic parameters for chlorination of dien cooh and ca the impact of the cl concentration 0 20 mm on the chlorination kinetics of dien cooh and ca at ph 5 were investigated as shown in fig 3 k obs for both dien cooh and ca increase linearly with increasing cl concentrations k obs for dien cooh in the presence of 10 mm cl is almost 40 times higher than the value without addition of cl cl baseline 1 7 fac 0 i e 0 31 and 1 02 mm for dien cooh and ca respectively similar observations were also reported during chlorination of phenols lau et al 2016 alkenes lau et al 2019 and p xylene voudrias et al 1988a b which was attributed to the reaction of cl2 based on eq 3 the formation of cl2 is favored in the presence of cl at lower ph k c l 2 and k c l 2 o for dien cooh and ca could be obtained by fitting the experimental data in fig 2 2 a for dien cooh and 2 d for ca and fig 3 with eq 13 following a similar protocol as reported in the literature lau et al 2019 si text s3 and figure s7 for more information the experimental data could be well fitted lines in fig 2 a 2 d and fig 3 and the obtained k c l 2 o and k c l 2 were 9 9 1 5 105 m 1s 1 and 1 1 0 2 106 m 1s 1 for dien cooh and 2 6 0 8 104 m 1s 1 and 4 2 0 1 104 m 1s 1 for ca respectively table 1 overall cl2o and cl2 have comparable reactivities towards dien cooh and ca within a factor of 2 the concentrations of hocl cl2o and cl2 at ph 7 5 were calculated as a function of the initial fac concentrations text s1 si and are shown in figure s1b si within the investigated fac concentration ranges 0 1 6 0 mm hocl is by far the dominant chlorine species followed by cl2o with a concentration nearly 35 times higher than that of cl2 therefore the low calculated concentration of cl2 leads to only a small contribution f cl2 5 to the chlorination of dien cooh and ca at ph 7 5 in fig 2 figures s8a s8b si ph dependence of chlorination of dien cooh and ca the kinetics of the chlorination of dien cooh and ca were investigated in the ph range of 5 0 8 5 k obs for dien cooh and ca showed a strong ph dependence with a decreasing trend as the ph increased fig 4 the ph dependence of k obs for dien cooh and ca was fitted by eq 13 with the obtained values for k hocl k c l 2 o and k c l 2 table 1 a fairly good agreement between the experimental squares in fig 4 and calculated results lines in fig 4 was obtained for both dien cooh and ca f hocl f cl2o and f cl2 for the chlorination of dien cooh and ca in the investigated ph range are shown in figures s8c s8d si f cl2 was 60 at ph 5 for both dien cooh and ca and decreased to 5 at ph 7 cl2o played an important role at circum neutral ph with f cl2o 20 for both dien cooh and ca while f cl2o decreased significantly at lower and higher ph f hocl f cl2o and f cl2 for dien cooh and ca as a function of ph under typical drinking water chlorination conditions were also calculated and are shown in figures s8e s8f si the importance of cl2 decreased as the ph increased with f cl2 decreasing from 30 at ph 5 to 2 at ph 7 5 for both olefins though f cl2o reached the maximum at neutral ph it was 5 in the ph range investigated these results suggest that cl2 tends to contribute to the chlorination kinetics of olefins in the presence of cl at lower ph ph 6 0 while cl2o plays a more significant role in the ph range of 6 0 ph 7 5 at high fac concentrations however for conditions relevant for drinking water the contributions of cl2 and cl2o for the reactions with dien cooh and ca are typically low figures s8e s8f si 3 1 3 contributions of hocl and cl2o to the oxidation of selected olefins by fac determination of kinetic parameters the above results suggest that cl2 contributes only slightly to the chlorination kinetics of olefins at ph 6 0 therefore to simplify the modeling process eq 13 was adapted to eq 15 by excluding the cl2 reactions for ph 6 0 15 k obs k hocl hocl k c l 2 o c l 2 o second order rate constants for the reactions of hocl k hocl and cl2o k c l 2 o with olefins were computed by fitting data of kobs fig 2 with nonlinear least squares regressions based on eq 15 the kobs data for each olefin at ph 7 5 is well predicted lines in fig 2 and the corresponding values for k hocl and k c l 2 o are compiled in table 1 for each of the selected olefins except for mca k c l 2 o was 4 6 orders of magnitude higher than k hocl f cl2o and f hocl to the overall transformation of olefins by fac under our experimental conditions were calculated by the second order rate constants in table 1 and are presented in figure s9 si overall f cl2o increases gradually with increasing fac 0 at ph 7 5 f cl2o was 50 for olefins such as 4 clca 4 brca and α ch3ca in contrast for olefins such as dien cho 4 cl α cnca and mca f hocl dominated at ph 7 5 chlorination under realistic conditions f cl2o and f hocl for the transformation of selected olefins by fac as well as the half lives t1 2 of olefins at ph 7 5 for typical drinking water chlorination conditions were calculated and are presented in table 1 hocl contributes the most to the transformation of all the selected olefins with f hocl generally 85 while cl2o contributes 10 except for dien oh 10 4 and 4 ch3ca 13 7 these observations are different from the results obtained under the laboratory conditions above for which cl2o plays an equal or more significant role compared to hocl figure s9 si this discrepancy is due to the lower concentration of fac applied for typical drinking water chlorination conditions i e fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm leading to much lower cl2o concentrations figure s1 si overall f cl2o to the transformation of olefins by chlorine is mainly determined by two factors i the relative reactivities of hocl and cl2o towards olefins k h o c l k c l 2 o and ii the hocl concentration eq 16 originating from eq 14b by excluding the negligible contribution of cl2 16 f c l 2 o k c l 2 o c l 2 o k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k c l 2 o k 2 hocl 2 k c l 2 o k 2 hocl 2 k hocl hocl 1 1 k hocl k c l 2 o k 2 hocl f cl2o were calculated as a function of k hocl k c l 2 o 10 8 10 3 for various fac concentrations fac 0 028 6 0 mm fig 5 f cl2o increases with increasing reactivity of cl2o i e decreasing k hocl k c l 2 o for each hocl concentration a higher f cl2o can be calculated at higher hocl concentrations for a fixed k hocl k c l 2 o the t1 2 during chlorination fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm of the selected olefins varies from 40 min for dien oh to 126 days for 4 no2ca with values 1 1 days for most of the olefins this result indicates that chlorination will only lead to a partial abatement of the selected olefins in drinking water treatment and distribution systems 3 2 bromination of olefins 3 2 1 kinetics of bromine reactions with olefins plots of ln olefins t olefins 0 obtained under pseudo first order conditions i e bromine 0 olefin 0 10 displayed linear relationships as a function of the reaction time figure s11 si suggesting that the reactions of bromine with olefins are first order in olefins k obs for bromine reactions with olefins 3 µm increases with increasing initial bromine concentrations hobr 0 0 03 0 85 mm at ph 7 5 fig 6 the corresponding reaction order in bromine was obtained by plotting log k obs vs log bromine 0 as outlined above the slope n was in the range of 1 0 0 06 for 4 cl α cnca to 1 9 0 04 for dien oh for the investigated conditions figure s12 si with n 1 4 for most of the selected olefins these results indicate that bromine species other than hobr contribute to the transformation of olefins 3 2 2 contributions of hobr and br2o based on the assessment above and the production of hobr solutions by reaction of br with excess ozone the presence of br2 can be excluded for our experimental systems therefore only hobr and br2o will be considered in this manuscript br2o which is in equilibrium with hobr eq 6 generally exhibits higher reactivities towards organic compounds than hobr and it can play important roles in the transformation of organic compounds sivey et al 2013 2015 the high reaction order n 1 4 except for 4 cl α cnca in bromine under our experimental conditions is likely due to the contributions of br2o because this species is proportional to hobr 2 eq 6 accordingly the observed first order rate constants for the reactions of bromine with olefins can be interpreted by eq 17 17 k obs k hobr hobr k b r 2 o b r 2 o k hobr and k b r 2 o represent the species specific second order rate constants for reactions of hobr and br2o with an olefin respectively k hobr and k b r 2 o values were obtained by fitting k obs in fig 6 with eq 17 via non linear least squares regressions the experimental data were well fitted lines in fig 6 and the obtained values for k hobr and k b r 2 o are compiled in table 1 for most of the selected olefins except for 4 cl α cnca k b r 2 o is 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than k hobr 0 01 103 m 1s 1 the fractions of hobr f hobr and br2o f br2o to the overall transformation of olefins under the investigated conditions are shown in figure s13 si the relative importance of br2o to the overall reactivity increased with increasing hobr 0 br2o was the dominant reactive species for the bromination of dien oh ca 4 clca 4 brca 4 ch3ca 2 ch3ca and α ch3ca with f br2o 50 in accordance with the higher reaction order in bromine n 1 5 therein for dien cho and 4 no2ca hobr also played a non negligible role in their transformation while for 4 cl α cnca hobr was the primary bromine species moreover it seems that cl2o is generally more reactive towards olefins than br2o table 1 for instance k c l 2 o for dien cooh 9 9 105 m 1s 1 4 brca 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and α ch3ca 1 4 105 m 1s 1 are much higher than k b r 2 o i e 2 5 105 m 1s 1 for dien cooh 4 0 103 m 1s 1 for 4 brca and 9 4 103 m 1s 1 for α ch3ca respectively in comparison hobr is more reactive towards selected olefins than hocl table 1 as has been widely documented in the literature heeb et al 2014 a similar trend was also reported for the reactions of different chlorine and bromine species with dimethenamid following the order of hocl hobr br2o cl2o cl2 brocl br2 brcl which was explained by the differences in nucleofugality and polarizability of these halogen species sivey et al 2013 though brocl br2 and brcl are not present in our bromine solution they are also likely to contribute to the transformation of olefins during chlorination of br containing waters under certain conditions 3 3 effects of substituents on the kinetics of the reactions of fac and bromine with olefins and linear free energy relationship lfer 3 3 1 effects of substituents on the kinetics of fac reactions with olefins aliphatic olefins the species specific second order rate constants in table 1 demonstrate that substituents play a significant role in the chlorination of olefins for aliphatic olefins the second order rate constants for the reactions with cl2o decreased in the order of dien oh 1 8 0 1 107 m 1s 1 dien cooh 9 9 1 5 105 m 1s 1 dien cho 6 8 0 9 103 m 1s 1 a similar trend was observed for k hocl with dien oh 19 0 1 5 m 1s 1 dien cooh 4 0 0 6 m 1s 1 dien cho 0 1 0 01 m 1s 1 the smaller electron withdrawing effect of the oh than the cooh group leads to a higher electron density in the conjugated double bonds of dien oh compared to dien cooh lee and von gunten 2012 which enhances its reactivity with electrophiles such as cl2o a factor of 10 and hocl a factor of 5 a substitution by an aldehyde as in dien cho leads to an electron deficiency and results in a lower chlorine reactivity than dien cooh a factor of 102 because cho is a stronger electron withdrawing group than coo deprotonated form of dien cooh is the major species pka 4 75 arya 1980 at ph 7 5 as suggested by their taft constants σ 2 15 and 1 06 for cho and coo respectively lee and von gunten 2012 aromatic olefins for aromatic olefins including ca and its derivatives substituents at both the benzene ring and at the olefin bond were investigated fig 1 and table 1 furthermore a cinnamic acid methyl ester was investigated hocl shows very low reactivities towards ca and its derivatives with k hocl 1 0 m 1s 1 wherefore the substituent effects are mainly discussed based on olefin reactions with cl2o k c l 2 o for ca derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring decrease in the order of 4 ch3ca 2 ch3ca ca 4 clca 4 brca 4 no2ca the methyl group as an electron donor i e hammet constants σ for 4 ch3 and 2 ch3 groups are 0 306 and 0 210 respectively lee and von gunten 2012 increases the electron density on the benzene ring which may activate the double bond via an inductive effect therefore a higher k app for the reactions of cl2o with 4 ch3ca and 2 ch3ca compared to the unsubstituted ca a factor of 3 10 were obtained the substitution of electron withdrawing halogen substituents cl and br at the para position of the benzene ring of ca displays slight effects on its reactivity towards cl2o comparatively substitution by a no2 group remarkably decreased the second order rate constant for the reaction of 4 no2ca with cl2o by a factor of 100 compared to ca these results are likely due to the stronger electron withdrawing properties of the no2 group as indicated by its larger hammet constant i e σ for no2 cl and br groups are 0 777 0 112 and 0 148 respectively lee and von gunten 2012 which leads to a significantly greater impact on the olefin bond than the cl and br groups fang et al 1958 butt and topsom 1980 wang and chen 2020 similar results were also reported by aruna and manikyamba 1995 where 4 clca and ca showed comparable reactivities towards quinolinium dichromate with both of them reacting much more readily than 4 no2ca moreover substituents on the ca double bond also showed significant impact on the reactivity of aromatic olefins towards cl2o k c l 2 o for the reaction of α ch3ca with cl2o was 10 times higher compared to ca while k c l 2 o for the reaction of 4 cl α cnca with cl2o was nearly 10 times lower compared to 4 clca table 1 these observations can be explained by the electron donating effect of the methyl group in α ch3ca which increases the electron density of the double bond in contrast the cyano group in 4 cl α cnca reduced the electron density of the double bond due to its electron withdrawing character lee and von gunten 2012 for mca cl2o displayed a much lower reactivity compared to ca due to the ester group in mca which is expected to decrease the electron density via its electron withdrawing effect lee and von gunten 2012 3 3 2 effects of substituents on the kinetics of bromine reactions with olefins similar substitution effects for the kinetics of the reactions of bromine and chlorine with olefins were obtained i e electron donating groups i e oh and ch3 generally enhance the reactivities a factor of 3 100 while electron withdrawing groups i e cooh cho cl br no2 cn and coor lead to lower second order rate constants a factor of 10 10000 table 1 3 3 3 lfer a lfer for the reactions of ca and its derivatives with cl2o br2o was developed a previous study showed that taft constants σ were the most suitable descriptors for establishing lfer relationships for olefin reactions with ozone lee and von gunten 2012 an attempt was made to establish a relationship between k c l 2 o or k b r 2 o for selected olefins vs taft σ but it was impossible due to the lack of taft σ for most of the substituents on the olefins in contrast a reasonable correlation between log k c l 2 o or log k b r 2 o and hammett σ for the reaction of cl2o or br2o with ca derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring could be established figures s14a s14b si negative slopes ρ were obtained for both cases with 2 6 0 3 r2 0 95 for cl2o and 3 8 0 3 r2 0 96 for br2o the more negative ρ value for br2o than for cl2o indicates that br2o is more sensitive to substituent effects moreover the lfer between log k c l 2 o or log k b r 2 o vs hammett σ by excluding 4 no2ca was also assessed acceptable correlations r2 0 76 and 0 84 for cl2o and br2o respectively figures s14c s14d si were obtained with a similar trend as observed by including 4 no2ca figure s14a s14b si these results confirm that though 4 no2ca as an end member tends to dominate the correlation figures s14a s14b si it does not affect the final conclusion 3 4 transformation

selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants 1 0 m 1s 1 nearly 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than for cl2o and cl2 cl2 is non negligible for chlorination of olefins at lower ph ph 6 0 in the presence of excess cl while cl2o plays an important role near neutral ph 6 0 ph 7 5 at high fac concentration nevertheless hocl is the dominant chlorine species for the oxidation of the selected olefins under typical drinking water chlorination conditions hobr has a large variation of reactivities towards the selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants ranging

17496,hypochlorous acid hocl is typically assumed to be the primary reactive species in free available chlorine fac solutions lately it has been shown that less abundant chlorine species such as chlorine monoxide cl2o and chlorine cl2 can also influence the kinetics of the abatement of certain organic compounds during chlorination in this study the chlorination as well as bromination kinetics and mechanisms of 12 olefins including 3 aliphatic and 9 aromatic olefins with different structures were explored hocl shows a low reactivity towards the selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants 1 0 m 1s 1 about 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than those of cl2o and cl2 hocl is the dominant chlorine species during chlorination of olefins under typical drinking water conditions while cl2o and cl2 are likely to play important roles at high fac concentration near circum neutral ph for cl2o or at high cl concentration under acidic conditions for cl2 bromination of the 12 olefins suggests that hobr and br2o are the major reactive species at ph 7 5 with species specific second order rate constants of br2o nearly 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than of hobr ranging from 0 01 to 103 m 1s 1 the reactivities of chlorine and bromine species towards olefins follow the order of hocl hobr br2o cl2o cl2 generally electron donating groups e g ch2oh and ch3 enhances the

reasonable linear free energy relationship lfer between the species specific second order rate constants of br2o or cl2o reactions with aromatic olefins and their hammett σ was established with a more

century le paulouë and langlais 1999 mcguire 2006 von sonntag and von gunten 2012 consecutively they have been used for the transformation abatement of inorganic and or organic micropollutants detected in water von gunten 2018 however undesirable disinfection by products dbps or harmful transformation products can be generated from the reactions of oxidants with water matrix components and

compounds e g fe ii as iii cn and no2 under water treatment conditions but not for others such as mn ii deborde and von gunten 2008 allard et al 2013 the reactivity of fac towards organic compounds is influenced by their electronic properties with species specific second order rate constants varying over a wide range from 0 1 to 109 m 1s 1 deborde and von gunten 2008 in general fac is prone to reaction with compounds containing electron rich sites including activated aromatic systems gallard et al 2002b acero et al 2005a criquet et al 2015 gao et al 2018 neutral amines armesto et al 1993 antelo et al 1995 dodd and huang 2004 dodd et al 2005 and reduced sulfur moieties armesto et al 2000 pattison and davies 2001 chlorine speciation is another factor influencing fac reactivity towards organic compounds hocl and ocl eq 1 morris 1966 are often regarded as the main chlorine species during chlorination with hocl often controlling reaction kinetics deborde and von gunten 2008 1 hocl ocl h p k 1 7 5 morris 1966 however other chlorine species such as chlorine monoxide cl2o and chlorine cl2 have drawn increasing scientific attention sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 cai et al 2013 2017 lau et al 2016 2019 rose et al 2020 cl2o is formed via dehydration of 2 hocl molecules eq 2 25 c 0 0 m ionic strength sivey et al 2010 2 2 hocl c l 2 o h 2 o log k 2 2 06 furthermore cl2 can be

due to their low concentrations which are several orders of magnitude lower than hocl ocl for example the concentrations of hocl ocl cl2o and cl2 are around 1 4 10 5 1 4 10 5 1 7 10 12 and 2 3 10 13 m

information si yet there is evidence that the low concentrations of cl2 and cl2o can be compensated by their high reactivities with some organic compounds sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 cai et al 2013 2017 for instance sivey et al 2010 reported that the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with dimethenamid were around 0 18 1 37 106 and 1 21 106 m 1s 1 respectively and cl2o contributed 50 to the total fac reactivity under typical drinking water chlorination conditions cai et al 2013 showed that the contribution of cl2 to the transformation of antipyrine an anti inflammatory drug by chorine increased with decreasing ph with a contribution of 42 at ph 3 2 while cl2o had a relatively stable contribution 23 over the ph range of 4 0 7 0 generally cl2 can affect fac reactivity towards some organic compounds at ph 7 5 in the presence of high concentration of cl while cl2o plays an important role around neutral ph for high fac concentrations sivey et al 2010 sivey and roberts 2012 cai et al 2013 lau et al 2016 bromine bromide br is one of the key constituents of water matrixes and is highly relevant in oxidation

second order rate constants k app of hobr reactions with substituted phenols at ph 7 0 k app 103 105 m 1s 1 are on average about 3000 times higher than for hocl the presence of br during chlorination can not only accelerate the transformation of micropollutants but also change the types and concentrations of dbps formed from dissolved organic matter lee and von gunten 2009 zhao et al 2010 zhai and zhang 2011 ding et al 2013 liu et al 2013 liu et al 2018 similar to the case of fac br2o can be formed via dehydration of 2 hobr molecules eq 6 25 c 0 0 m ionic strength sivey et al 2013 6 2 hobr b r

could influence bromination rates under typical drinking water conditions sivey et al 2013 2015 for instance sivey et al 2013 showed that the species specific second order rate constants for the reactions of br2o br2 brcl and brocl with dimethenamid were up to 103 106 times higher than for hobr brcl is predominant at ph 7 0 while hobr dominated the overall transformation of dimethenamid at ph

however they become increasingly important at higher cl for brcl fac for brocl or br leading to higher hobr and consequently higher br2o concentrations concentrations for example br2o contributed 3 5 to dimethenamid transformation under typical drinking water chlorination conditions at ph 7 5 in the presence of 1 25 µm br 100 µg l while it contributed 13 1 and 28 4 when the br concentration increased to 5 0 µm 400 µg l and 10 µm br 800 µg l respectively under similar conditions sivey et al 2013 overall the available kinetic data suggest that the less abundant chlorine or bromine species e g cl2o cl2 br2o br2 brcl and brocl can play significant roles in the chlorination or bromination of various organic compounds such as p xylene voudrias and reinhard 1988a voudrias and reinhard 1988b ethers sivey and roberts 2012 sivey et al 2015 antipyrine cai et al 2013 aminopyrine cai et al 2017 chloro phenols lau et al 2016 and dimethenamid sivey et al 2010 2013 especially those reacting with relatively low second order rate constants with hocl and hobr olefinic compounds olefins are electron rich compounds which are frequently present in anthropogenic and natural micropollutants such as carbamazepine ionones β cyclocitral and microcystins tixier et al 2003 nikolaou et al 2007 peter et al 2009 chen et al 2010 limited studies show that hocl has a low to negligible reactivities towards olefins prütz 1998 pattison et al 2003 acero et al 2005b rodriguez et al 2008 zhang et al 2012 while bromine has moderate to high reactivities however generally only limited kinetic information is available staff et al 2007 2008 it has been reported that the relative importance of cl2o and cl2 increases with decreasing reactivity of the target compound towards hocl sivey et al 2012 recently lau et al 2019 reported that cl2 and cl2o dominated the chlorination kinetics of cyclic olefins e g β ionone at high cl and hocl concentrations respectively even though these studies provide some insights into the reactivity of fac and bromine including their speciation towards selected olefin structures there is still a significant knowledge gap in this field the aim of this study was to establish kinetic and mechanistic data on chlorine or bromine reactions with olefins with various substituents both aliphatic and aromatic olefins were investigated in this study the effect of fac and bromine speciation on the apparent second order rate constants was investigated by ph variations and or concentration variations of fac and bromine based on these systematic variations of the reaction conditions species specific second order rate constants for various chlorine mainly hocl cl2o and cl2 and bromine species mainly hobr and br2o were determined to assess their importance during chlorination or bromination of various olefinic compounds furthermore products from the chlorination of cinnamic acid were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents the 12 selected

ph was measured and re adjusted addition of fac or bromine slightly increased the ph by h2so4 1 m or naoh 1 m to maintain the reaction solution at the desired ph finally a selected olefin 3 5 µm was added to the vigorously stirred solution to initiate the reaction and the vials were immediately capped 1 ml samples were withdrawn after pre determined reaction times and quenched with thiosulfate thiosulfate fac 0 or thiosulfate bromine 0 5 for high performance liquid chromatography hplc analysis of the olefins control experiments showed that thiosulfate had a negligible impact on the

5 the good linear correlations suggest that the reactions are first order with respect to olefins the reaction rates for chlorination of olefins in the presence of excess fac can be described by eqs 10 and 11 10 rate d olefin dt k fac 0 n olefin k obs olefin 11 k obs k fac 0 n where k represents the second order rate constant for the reaction of fac with an olefin k obs is the observed pseudo first order rate constant for reaction of fac with an olefin fac 0 represents the initial fac concentration and n represents the reaction order in fac a log transformation of eq 11 yields eq 12 12 lo

cnca to 2 1 0 07 for 4 cl ca figure s5 si for most of the olefins n values are 1 4 similar trends were also observed for reactions of aromatic ethers sivey et al 2012 and dimethenamid sivey et al 2010 with fac which can be explained by the combined contributions of different chlorine species to the overall chlorine reactivity the reaction is second order in hocl i e n 2 if cl2o is the predominant reactive chlorine species as cl2o is proportional to hocl 2 i e cl2o k2 hocl 2 eq 2 furthermore a disguised second order dependence on hocl can be observed if fac solutions contain approximately equimolar concentrations of hocl and cl i e cl2 k3 hocl cl h k3 hocl 2 h when hocl cl eq 3 lau et al 2016 indeed ion chromatography analyses showed that cl in the fac solution were about 1 7 times the hocl and this level of cl cl baseline was considered for reaction solutions without extra addition of cl hence the obtained n values ranging from 1 to 2 likely resulted from the combined contribution of hocl cl2o and cl2 therefore k obs for the chlorination of olefins can be expressed as eq 13 13 k obs k hocl hocl k cl 2 o cl 2 o k cl 2 cl 2 where k hocl k c l 2 o and k c l 2 represent the species specific second order rate constants m 1s 1 for the reactions of hocl cl2o and cl2 with olefins respectively 3 1 2 chlorination kinetics of dien cooh and ca role of cl2 for the oxidation of organic compounds previous studies show that cl2 usually plays an important role at ph 7 5 in the presence of high cl concentrations while cl2o is non negligible at neutral ph sivey et al 2010 2012 lau et al 2016 based on literature data the fractions of hocl f hocl eq 14a cl2o f cl2o eq 14b and cl2 f cl2 eq 14c to the transformation of selected target compounds by fac under our experimental conditions i

of 0 1 mm while it becomes increasingly important with increasing fac 0 for each compound f cl2 remains 20 for the majority of the compounds except for two chlorophenols and one cyclic olefin at ph 7 5 even at fac 0 of 6 0 mm the maximum fac 0 used in this study even though the contribution of cl2 seems to be generally low its relevance for chlorination of olefins at ph 7 5 was investigated for dien cooh and ca as representative aliphatic and aromatic olefins respectively determination of kinetic parameters for chlorination of dien cooh and ca the impact of the cl concentration 0 20 mm on the chlorination kinetics of dien cooh and ca at ph 5 were investigated as shown in fig 3 k obs for both dien cooh and ca increase linearly with increasing cl concentrations k obs for dien cooh in the presence of 10 mm cl is almost 40 times higher than the value without addition of cl cl baseline 1 7 fac 0 i e 0 31 and 1 02 mm for dien cooh and ca respectively similar observations were also reported during chlorination of phenols lau et al 2016 alkenes lau et al 2019 and p xylene voudrias et al 1988a b which was attributed to the reaction of cl2 based on eq 3 the formation of cl2 is favored in the presence of cl at lower ph k c l 2 and k c l 2 o for dien cooh and ca could be obtained by fitting the experimental data in fig 2 2 a for dien cooh and 2 d for ca and fig 3 with eq 13 following a similar protocol as reported in the literature lau et al 2019 si text s3 and figure s7 for more information the experimental data could be well fitted lines in fig 2 a 2 d and fig 3 and the obtained k c l 2 o and k c l 2 were 9 9 1 5 105 m 1s 1 and 1 1 0 2 106 m 1s 1 for dien cooh and 2 6 0 8 104 m 1s 1 and 4 2 0 1 104 m 1s 1 for ca respectively table 1 overall cl2o and cl2 have comparable reactivities towards dien cooh and ca within a factor of 2 the concentrations of hocl cl2o and cl2 at ph 7 5 were calculated as a function of the initial fac concentrations text s1 si and are shown in figure s1b si within the investigated fac concentration ranges 0 1 6 0 mm hocl is by far the dominant chlorine species followed by cl2o with a concentration nearly 35 times higher than that of cl2 therefore the low calculated concentration of cl2 leads to only a small contribution f cl2 5 to the chlorination of dien cooh and ca at ph 7 5 in fig 2 figures s8a s8b si ph dependence of chlorination of dien cooh and ca the kinetics of the chlorination of dien cooh and ca were investigated in the ph range of 5 0 8 5 k obs for dien cooh and ca showed a strong ph dependence with a decreasing trend as the ph increased fig 4 the ph dependence of k obs for dien cooh and ca was fitted by eq 13 with the obtained values for k hocl k c l 2 o and k c l 2 table 1 a fairly good agreement between the experimental squares in fig 4 and calculated results lines in fig 4 was obtained for both dien cooh and ca f hocl f cl2o and f cl2 for the chlorination of dien cooh and ca in the investigated ph range are shown in figures s8c s8d si f cl2 was 60 at ph 5 for both dien cooh and ca and decreased to 5 at ph 7 cl2o played an important role at circum neutral ph with f cl2o 20 for both dien cooh and ca while f cl2o decreased significantly at lower and higher ph f hocl f cl2o and f cl2 for dien cooh and ca as a function of ph under typical drinking water chlorination conditions were also calculated and are shown in figures s8e s8f si the importance of cl2 decreased as the ph increased with f cl2 decreasing from 30 at ph 5 to 2 at ph 7 5 for both olefins though f cl2o reached the maximum at neutral ph it was 5 in the ph range investigated these results suggest that cl2 tends to contribute to the chlorination kinetics of olefins in the presence of cl at lower ph ph 6 0 while cl2o plays a more significant role in the ph range of 6 0 ph 7 5 at high fac concentrations however for conditions relevant for drinking water the contributions of cl2 and cl2o for the reactions with dien cooh and ca are typically low figures s8e s8f si 3 1 3 contributions of hocl and cl2o to the oxidation of selected olefins by fac determination of kinetic parameters the above results suggest that cl2 contributes only slightly to the chlorination kinetics of olefins at ph 6 0 therefore to simplify the modeling process eq 13 was adapted to eq 15 by excluding the cl2 reactions for ph 6 0 15 k obs k hocl hocl k c l 2 o c l 2 o second order rate constants for the reactions of hocl k hocl and cl2o k c l 2 o with olefins were computed by fitting data of kobs fig 2 with nonlinear least squares regressions based on eq 15 the kobs data for each olefin at ph 7 5 is well predicted lines in fig 2 and the corresponding values for k hocl and k c l 2 o are compiled in table 1 for each of the selected olefins except for mca k c l 2 o was 4 6 orders of magnitude higher than k hocl f cl2o and f hocl to the overall transformation of olefins by fac under our experimental conditions were calculated by the second order rate constants in table 1 and are presented in figure s9 si overall f cl2o increases gradually with increasing fac 0 at ph 7 5 f cl2o was 50 for olefins such as 4 clca 4 brca and α ch3ca in contrast for olefins such as dien cho 4 cl α cnca and mca f hocl dominated at ph 7 5 chlorination under realistic conditions f cl2o and f hocl for the transformation of selected olefins by fac as well as the half lives t1 2 of olefins at ph 7 5 for typical drinking water chlorination conditions were calculated and are presented in table 1 hocl contributes the most to the transformation of all the selected olefins with f hocl generally 85 while cl2o contributes 10 except for dien oh 10 4 and 4 ch3ca 13 7 these observations are different from the results obtained under the laboratory conditions above for which cl2o plays an equal or more significant role compared to hocl figure s9 si this discrepancy is due to the lower concentration of fac applied for typical drinking water chlorination conditions i e fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm leading to much lower cl2o concentrations figure s1 si overall f cl2o to the transformation of olefins by chlorine is mainly determined by two factors i the relative reactivities of hocl and cl2o towards olefins k h o c l k c l 2 o and ii the hocl concentration eq 16 originating from eq 14b by excluding the negligible contribution of cl2 16 f c l 2 o k c l 2 o c l 2 o k c l 2 o c l 2 o k hocl hocl k c l 2 o k 2 hocl 2 k c l 2 o k 2 hocl 2 k hocl hocl 1 1 k hocl k c l 2 o k 2 hocl f cl2o were calculated as a function of k hocl k c l 2 o 10 8 10 3 for various fac concentrations fac 0 028 6 0 mm fig 5 f cl2o increases with increasing reactivity of cl2o i e decreasing k hocl k c l 2 o for each hocl concentration a higher f cl2o can be calculated at higher hocl concentrations for a fixed k hocl k c l 2 o the t1 2 during chlorination fac 2 0 mg l as cl2 28 µm of the selected olefins varies from 40 min for dien oh to 126 days for 4 no2ca with values 1 1 days for most of the olefins this result indicates that chlorination will only lead to a partial abatement of the selected olefins in drinking water treatment and distribution systems 3 2 bromination of olefins 3 2 1 kinetics of bromine reactions with olefins plots of ln olefins t olefins 0 obtained under pseudo first order conditions i e bromine 0 olefin 0 10 displayed linear relationships as a function of the reaction time figure s11 si suggesting that the reactions of bromine with olefins are first order in olefins k obs for bromine reactions with olefins 3 µm increases with increasing initial bromine concentrations hobr 0 0 03 0 85 mm at ph 7 5 fig 6 the corresponding reaction order in bromine was obtained by plotting log k obs vs log bromine 0 as outlined above the slope n was in the range of 1 0 0 06 for 4 cl α cnca to 1 9 0 04 for dien oh for the investigated conditions figure s12 si with n 1 4 for most of the selected olefins these results indicate that bromine species other than hobr contribute to the transformation of olefins 3 2 2 contributions of hobr and br2o based on the assessment above and the production of hobr solutions by reaction of br with excess ozone the presence of br2 can be excluded for our experimental systems therefore only hobr and br2o will be considered in this manuscript br2o which is in equilibrium with hobr eq 6 generally exhibits higher reactivities towards organic compounds than hobr and it can play important roles in the transformation of organic compounds sivey et al 2013 2015 the high reaction order n 1 4 except for 4 cl α cnca in bromine under our experimental conditions is likely due to the contributions of br2o because this species is proportional to hobr 2 eq 6 accordingly the observed first order rate constants for the reactions of bromine with olefins can be interpreted by eq 17 17 k obs k hobr hobr k b r 2 o b r 2 o k hobr and k b r 2 o represent the species specific second order rate constants for reactions of hobr and br2o with an olefin respectively k hobr and k b r 2 o values were obtained by fitting k obs in fig 6 with eq 17 via non linear least squares regressions the experimental data were well fitted lines in fig 6 and the obtained values for k hobr and k b r 2 o are compiled in table 1 for most of the selected olefins except for 4 cl α cnca k b r 2 o is 3 4 orders of magnitude higher than k hobr 0 01 103 m 1s 1 the fractions of hobr f hobr and br2o f br2o to the overall transformation of olefins under the investigated conditions are shown in figure s13 si the relative importance of br2o to the overall reactivity increased with increasing hobr 0 br2o was the dominant reactive species for the bromination of dien oh ca 4 clca 4 brca 4 ch3ca 2 ch3ca and α ch3ca with f br2o 50 in accordance with the higher reaction order in bromine n 1 5 therein for dien cho and 4 no2ca hobr also played a non negligible role in their transformation while for 4 cl α cnca hobr was the primary bromine species moreover it seems that cl2o is generally more reactive towards olefins than br2o table 1 for instance k c l 2 o for dien cooh 9 9 105 m 1s 1 4 brca 2 0 104 m 1s 1 and α ch3ca 1 4 105 m 1s 1 are much higher than k b r 2 o i e 2 5 105 m 1s 1 for dien cooh 4 0 103 m 1s 1 for 4 brca and 9 4 103 m 1s 1 for α ch3ca respectively in comparison hobr is more reactive towards selected olefins than hocl table 1 as has been widely documented in the literature heeb et al 2014 a similar trend was also reported for the reactions of different chlorine and bromine species with dimethenamid following the order of hocl hobr br2o cl2o cl2 brocl br2 brcl which was explained by the differences in nucleofugality and polarizability of these halogen species sivey et al 2013 though brocl br2 and brcl are not present in our bromine solution they are also likely to contribute to the transformation of olefins during chlorination of br containing waters under certain conditions 3 3 effects of substituents on the kinetics of the reactions of fac and bromine with olefins and linear free energy relationship lfer 3 3 1 effects of substituents on the kinetics of fac reactions with olefins aliphatic olefins the species specific second order rate constants in table 1 demonstrate that substituents play a significant role in the chlorination of olefins for aliphatic olefins the second order rate constants for the reactions with cl2o decreased in the order of dien oh 1 8 0 1 107 m 1s 1 dien cooh 9 9 1 5 105 m 1s 1 dien cho 6 8 0 9 103 m 1s 1 a similar trend was observed for k hocl with dien oh 19 0 1 5 m 1s 1 dien cooh 4 0 0 6 m 1s 1 dien cho 0 1 0 01 m 1s 1 the smaller electron withdrawing effect of the oh than the cooh group leads to a higher electron density in the conjugated double bonds of dien oh compared to dien cooh lee and von gunten 2012 which enhances its reactivity with electrophiles such as cl2o a factor of 10 and hocl a factor of 5 a substitution by an aldehyde as in dien cho leads to an electron deficiency and results in a lower chlorine reactivity than dien cooh a factor of 102 because cho is a stronger electron withdrawing group than coo deprotonated form of dien cooh is the major species pka 4 75 arya 1980 at ph 7 5 as suggested by their taft constants σ 2 15 and 1 06 for cho and coo respectively lee and von gunten 2012 aromatic olefins for aromatic olefins including ca and its derivatives substituents at both the benzene ring and at the olefin bond were investigated fig 1 and table 1 furthermore a cinnamic acid methyl ester was investigated hocl shows very low reactivities towards ca and its derivatives with k hocl 1 0 m 1s 1 wherefore the substituent effects are mainly discussed based on olefin reactions with cl2o k c l 2 o for ca derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring decrease in the order of 4 ch3ca 2 ch3ca ca 4 clca 4 brca 4 no2ca the methyl group as an electron donor i e hammet constants σ for 4 ch3 and 2 ch3 groups are 0 306 and 0 210 respectively lee and von gunten 2012 increases the electron density on the benzene ring which may activate the double bond via an inductive effect therefore a higher k app for the reactions of cl2o with 4 ch3ca and 2 ch3ca compared to the unsubstituted ca a factor of 3 10 were obtained the substitution of electron withdrawing halogen substituents cl and br at the para position of the benzene ring of ca displays slight effects on its reactivity towards cl2o comparatively substitution by a no2 group remarkably decreased the second order rate constant for the reaction of 4 no2ca with cl2o by a factor of 100 compared to ca these results are likely due to the stronger electron withdrawing properties of the no2 group as indicated by its larger hammet constant i e σ for no2 cl and br groups are 0 777 0 112 and 0 148 respectively lee and von gunten 2012 which leads to a significantly greater impact on the olefin bond than the cl and br groups fang et al 1958 butt and topsom 1980 wang and chen 2020 similar results were also reported by aruna and manikyamba 1995 where 4 clca and ca showed comparable reactivities towards quinolinium dichromate with both of them reacting much more readily than 4 no2ca moreover substituents on the ca double bond also showed significant impact on the reactivity of aromatic olefins towards cl2o k c l 2 o for the reaction of α ch3ca with cl2o was 10 times higher compared to ca while k c l 2 o for the reaction of 4 cl α cnca with cl2o was nearly 10 times lower compared to 4 clca table 1 these observations can be explained by the electron donating effect of the methyl group in α ch3ca which increases the electron density of the double bond in contrast the cyano group in 4 cl α cnca reduced the electron density of the double bond due to its electron withdrawing character lee and von gunten 2012 for mca cl2o displayed a much lower reactivity compared to ca due to the ester group in mca which is expected to decrease the electron density via its electron withdrawing effect lee and von gunten 2012 3 3 2 effects of substituents on the kinetics of bromine reactions with olefins similar substitution effects for the kinetics of the reactions of bromine and chlorine with olefins were obtained i e electron donating groups i e oh and ch3 generally enhance the reactivities a factor of 3 100 while electron withdrawing groups i e cooh cho cl br no2 cn and coor lead to lower second order rate constants a factor of 10 10000 table 1 3 3 3 lfer a lfer for the reactions of ca and its derivatives with cl2o br2o was developed a previous study showed that taft constants σ were the most suitable descriptors for establishing lfer relationships for olefin reactions with ozone lee and von gunten 2012 an attempt was made to establish a relationship between k c l 2 o or k b r 2 o for selected olefins vs taft σ but it was impossible due to the lack of taft σ for most of the substituents on the olefins in contrast a reasonable correlation between log k c l 2 o or log k b r 2 o and hammett σ for the reaction of cl2o or br2o with ca derivatives with substituents at the benzene ring could be established figures s14a s14b si negative slopes ρ were obtained for both cases with 2 6 0 3 r2 0 95 for cl2o and 3 8 0 3 r2 0 96 for br2o the more negative ρ value for br2o than for cl2o indicates that br2o is more sensitive to substituent effects moreover the lfer between log k c l 2 o or log k b r 2 o vs hammett σ by excluding 4 no2ca was also assessed acceptable correlations r2 0 76 and 0 84 for cl2o and br2o respectively figures s14c s14d si were obtained with a similar trend as observed by including 4 no2ca figure s14a s14b si these results confirm that though 4 no2ca as an end member tends to dominate the correlation figures s14a s14b si it does not affect the final conclusion 3 4 transformation products the transformation products from the reaction of fac 600 µm with ca 5 µm at ph 5 0 were analyzed by hplc hrms in both esi and esi mode three transformation products tps 1 3 were detected with elution times of 12 92 14 38 and 19 10 min for tp 1 tp 2 and tp 3 respectively figures s15a s15b si tp 1 and tp 2 identified at esi mode have the same molecular ion of m z 199 0168 suggesting that they are structural isomers they are assigned to c9h8o3cl m h based on their fragment ions of 163 0401 c9h7o3 m hcl and 119 0503 c8h7o m hcl coo figure s16 si and their chlorine isotopic patterns i e 35cl 37cl 3 1 figure s17 si corresponding to hocl adduct products of ca c9h8o2 the higher response of peak tp 2 compared to tp 1 figure s15a si indicated that tp 2 might be the major product tp 3 with a molecular ion of m z 139 0314 m h was identified at esi with a minor peak figure s15b si and was assigned to c8h7cl corresponding to a cl adduct product of the decarboxylated ca it has been reported that addition of hocl or hobr at the olefin β carbon relative to the benzene ring is favored due to the polarization of the π electron of ca yamada et al 1985 hence tp 1 tp 2 and tp 3 are proposed as 2 hydroxyl 3 chlorophenyl propionic acid 2 chloro 3 hydroxylphenyl propionic acid and 1 chloro 2 phenylethylene respectively fig 7 brominated analogues of tps 1 3 were previously detected from hobr reaction with ca involving the formation of a bromonium ion intermediate yamada et al 1985 the corresponding chloronium ion is likely also formed in the case of hocl fig 7 hocl cl adduct products were also reported for chlorination of carbamazepine and ca derivatives norwood et al 1980 soufan et al 2013 tp 1 and tp 2 were also detected from the ca 5 µm reaction with hocl 2 4 mm at ph 7 0 with a similarly higher response of peak tp 2 than tp 1 figure s18a si tp 3 was not detected at ph 7 0 while a new peak tp 4 with m z of 163 0401 appeared in esi mode figure s18 si 4 conclusion the kinetics and mechanisms for the reactions of selected aliphatic and aromatic olefins with chlorine and bromine species were investigated the following conclusions can be drawn hocl has a low reactivity towards selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants 1 0 m 1s 1 nearly 4 6 orders of magnitude lower than for cl2o and cl2 cl2 is non negligible for chlorination of olefins at lower ph ph 6 0 in the presence of excess cl while cl2o plays an important role near neutral ph 6 0 ph 7 5 at high fac concentration nevertheless hocl is the dominant chlorine species for the oxidation of the selected olefins under typical drinking water chlorination conditions hobr has a large variation of reactivities towards the selected olefins with species specific second order rate constants ranging from 0 01 to 103 m 1s 1 about 3 4 orders of magnitude lower than for br2o the reactivities of chlorine and bromine species towards olefins increases in the order of hocl hobr br2o cl2o cl2 electron donating groups e g ch2oh and ch3 enhance the reactivities of cinnamic type olefins towards chlorine and bromine species by a factor of 3 100 while electron withdrawing groups e g cl br no2 cooh cho coor and cn reduce the reactivities by a factor of 3 10000 hocl and or cl adducts are generated during chlorination of cinnamic acid at ph 5 0 and 7 0 declaration of competing interest the authors

17497,low microbial activity and serious membrane biofouling are still critical problems that hinder the extensive application of membrane bioreactor mbr for industrial wastewater treatment to address these bottlenecks we report a new specialized microorganism encapsulation strategy for constructing a highly efficient mbr system in our study the algae entrapping fiber macrospheres with polymeric coating were first coupled with membrane separation for treating refractory high ammonia nitrogen wastewater in comparison with traditional alginate beads the developed macrocapsule 0 5 cm exhibited higher biomass harvesting and lower microbial leakage because of the confined micro aerobic environment created by dual encapsulation of rigid inorganic macrosphere and porous polymeric layers application of algae encapsulating macrocapsule to mbr presented excellent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n removal efficiency of 62 23 and 97 38 respectively which were higher than the corresponding values for algae sa beads and free algae the biodegradation performance of nh3 n by encapsulated microalgae was similar or superior to that by free cells when the initial content of ammonia nitrogen ranged from 50 to 100 mg l the results well demonstrated that the gfs polymer macrocapsule as a physical barrier reduced the inhibitory effect of higher concentration ammonia nitrogen on the bioactivity of living cells importantly the encapsulated core shell macrocapsules showed superior anti biofouling capacity which had a membrane resistance of 3 5 times lower than that of cell alginate beads and free cells this work will open a new avenue to develop a novel encapsulated mbr for various non degradable wastewater treatments as an energy saving and

nitrogen in this wastewater can be extremely harmful to our health primarily in forms of surface runoff and groundwater kim et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 hence developing efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for wastewater treatment is urgently needed membrane bioreactor mbr as a promising and economical alternative has been widely applied for treating various wastewater because of its small occupation high quality of effluent and easy operation vallero et al 2005 jeong et al 2014 rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 qin et al 2017 to further improve the biological treatment performance the considerable attention has been paid on screening and cultivating the specialized microorganisms with excellent activity xiao and roberts 2013 woo et al 2019 wu et al 2020 among various microorganisms microalgae presented a big potential in refractory wastewater treatment due to their outstanding nitrogen removal efficiency good recycling performance and renewable bioenergy production angenent et al 2004 cheah et al 2016 however maintaining the stable and efficient performance of suspended microalgae under harsh environments remains a big challenge lay et al 2010 ebrahimi et al 2015 meanwhile the serious biofouling of the membrane owing to poor settling properties and small size of microalgae also restricts the wide application of mbr huang et al 2008 qin et al 2015 chen et al 2017 meng et al 2017 liao et al 2018 therefore the development of a new mbr system with excellent bioactivity and anti fouling capability is very important for practical application microorganism encapsulation technology has attracted extensive attention in environmental protection yeon et al 2009 de bashan and bashan 2010 qin et al 2020 pharmaceutical engineering ng et al 2015 and biomass production as discussed in the previous literatures compared with tradational suspension cultures the use of encapsulated carriers provides many important advantages such as protecting microbes against environmental stress shock loading and toxic by products thus enhancing the substrate conversion yield and the ease of collection in particular for mbr application the entrapment of small sized microorganisms within macrocapsules will be very efficient for biofouling reduction to our knowledge the developments of advanced mbr coupled with the microorganism encapsulation method have been rarely reported in the previous studies over the past decades the microorganisms have mainly been entrapped into spherical alginate beads owing to the biocompatibility and simple preparation associated with this approach recently more efforts have been devoted to enhance the chemical and physical stability of alginate frameworks using a polymeric coating such as poly ethylene glycol polyvinylamine guisan et al 2006 and polysulfone kim et al 2015 however the calcium alginate matrix as the core was susceptible to the presence of excess monovalent ions organics and shear forces the main challenge of microorganisms encapsulation is the maintenance of sufficient stability and microbial biomass of capsules without cell leaking under harsh conditions therefore it is essential to fabricate a highly stable microorganism encapsulating macrocapsule for practical mbr application based on the above observations we developed novel algae encapsulating macrocapsules integration with membrane separation for high ammonia nitrogen wastewater treatment wherein the cultivation of highly active chlorella for cod and nh3 n removal was easily achieved and membrane biofouling could be effectively mitigated different from the traditional entrapment method a dual encapsulation strategy was put forward to anchor chlorella cells into fiber spheres with porous polymeric layer coating the rapidly synthesized macrospheres created a large enough space for microbial cell immobilization to address the limitations of the conventional organic core the structure biomass harvesting and bacterial leakage were characterized and compared between the prepared algae encapsulating macrocapsule and sodium alginate beads moreover a comparison on ammonia nitrogen biodegradation between encapsulated and free cells was performed with the initial content of nh3 n as 10 200 mg l to evaluate the feasibility of cell encapsulation for refractory wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods

chemicals were of analytical grade without further purification 2 2 microalgae and high ammonia nitrogen wastewater chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 28 cells were provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences which were cultivated under shaking condition in bg11 medium during the pilot scale cultivation the intensity of light irradiation aeration rate and temperature were adjusted to about 3000 lux 2 5 l min and 28 c respectively the initial concentration of chlorella was adjusted to the approximately 0 045 g l in each bioreactor in this work the wastewater containing large amounts of inorganic nitrogen was used to evaluate the activity of microorganism encapsulating macrocapsules the composition and concentration of high ammonia nitrogen wastewater are shown in table s1 which presented a high organic loading cod of 550 820 mg l and nutrient substance max nh3 n of 200 mg l moreover the ph of wastewater was fluctuated between 5 0 and 7 0 2 3 mbr experiment setup a schematic diagram of membrane photo bioreactor for treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater is shown in fig 1 two identical scale mbrs one algae encapsulating macrocapsules added mbr and another mbr with the addition of free microalgae were run in parallel under the same conditions based on our previously reported strategy fan et al 2018 mbr integration with chlorella pyrenoidosa was constructed for high ammonia nitrogen wastewater treatment the working volume of each mbr configuration was set at about 10 l the mbr system was operated under constant flux about 8 2 l m2h and run with 10 min suction followed by 2 min relaxation the solid retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration rate were controlled at 30 d 72 h and 2 5 l min respectively to explore the effect of microorganisms on membrane fouling the self made nylon 6 n6 and cellulose acetate ca microfiltration flat modules were used in the bioreactor more details in membrane parameters are given in table s2 the transmembrane pressure tmp was measured to evaluate membrane fouling the encapsulated macrocapsules were washed to remove the adhesive cells of surface the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total nitrogen tn were tested using standard analytical methods apha et al 2005 the light intensity of the bioreactor was examined by digital lux meter as831 2 4 preparation of various macrocapsules 2 4 1 algae entrapping sodium alginate beads the pathway was used to fabricate algae entrapping sodium alginate sa according to the previously reported method kim et al 2015 a mixture solution of sodium alginate sa and algae cells was dropped into cacl2 solution 4 w v and stirred at room temperature 2 4 2 algae encapsulating gfs polymer capsules in this work algae cells were encapsulated into organic inorganic composite macrocapsules using the dual encapsulation strategy firstly the glass fiber spheres gfs were fabricated by shearing force induced self assembly method and soaked into naoh solution the as synthesized spheres were dried at 80 c after washing with deionized water then the resulted gfs were immersed into algae solution and incubated together for several hours to entrap living cells into the interior of spheres secondly the microporous polymeric substances psf and pvdf were coated on the out surface of fiber spheres by the phase inversion method typically the polymeric substances were dissolved in n n dimethylformamide by the vigorously stirring subsequently the algae entrapping gfs were immersed into the casting solutions for 10 s the polymer coating gfs was soaked into a water coagulation bath finally the as prepared macrocapsules were washed and preserved at 4 c until use by calculation the chlorella content of obtained macrocapsules was approximately 0 05 0 016 g cells g macrocapsules 2 5 measurement of biomass concentration the biomass harvesting dcw of free chlorella cells in the suspension liquid was measured by using a spectrophotometer wavelength of 625 nm which was illustrated as follows eq 1 wang et al 2012 1 d c w g l 0 2538 o d 625 r 2 0 9860 where od 625 is the absorbance value of chlorella solution and biomass dcw represents the concentration of microalgae the algae biomass of the macrocapsules was measured by the weight difference method a certain amount of macrocapsules were dried in an oven at 80 c for 6 h the weight of which was denoted as m1 in addition the algae encapsulating macrocapsules were heated to remove moisture and weight of which was denoted as m2 the weight difference of m1 and m2 represents the weight of encapsulated microalgae the biomass concentration of macrocapsules was the ratio of microalgae weight to volume cell leakage from various encapsulated macrocapsules to the solution was determined by testing the absorbance of suspension liquid at a wavelength of 625 nm 2 6 analysis of membrane permeability and filtration resistance membrane fouling was evaluated by assessing the variation of permeability with operation time nylon 6 n6 and cellulose acetate ca microfiltration membranes with pore size of 0 22 μm were chosen in the mbr system the permeability was calculated from eq 2 as follows 2 l p l m 2 h 1 b a r 1 j p δ p t m where j p is the permeate flux l m2 h1 and p tm is the transmembrane pressure bar the total filtration resistance r t m 1 was calculated according to the darcy s law eq 3 3 r t r m r f δ p t m μ j p where r t r m and r f represent total membrane filtration resistance m 1 intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 and filtration resistance owing to membrane fouling m 1 respectively µ is the permeate viscosity pa 1 s to investigate the effect of biomass concentration on membrane filtration resistance the time of sampling to determine each rt was set at 5 10 15 20 and 30 d respectively 2 7 scanning electron microscope sem scanning electron microscope sem was used to analyze the out surface and cross sectional structure of macrocapsules the algae encapsulating macrocapsules were cut in half and the porous polymeric layer was exfoliated from fiber macrosphere to estimate membrane fouling the surfaces of membranes after filtration were also examined before sem analysis the prepared samples were dried in vacuum and coated with a gold layer zhang et al 2013 2 8 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm three dimensional structure of various prepared macrocapsules was visually analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope leica tcs sp5 german samples were firstly frozen in liquid nitrogen and were then cut into the slices as thin as possible subsequently the slices were fluorescently stained with nucleic acid specific syto9 living cell dna and propidium iodide abbreviated to pi respectively the clsm images of the prepared samples were carried out after removing the excess dyes moreover the biomass production was observed by ds fi1 fluorescence optical microscope nikon japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules as illustrated in fig 2 a the large sized fiber spheres were synthesized by the self assembly of short glass fibers porous frameworks high biocompatibility and strong mechanical property of fiber spheres are beneficial for encapsulation and cultivation of living cells subsequently the phase inversion of polymeric substances occurred on the outer surface of fiber spheres to confine algae cells in a favorable environment which effectively reduced the leakage of cells into the solution by measurement the diameter of the globular macrocapsules varied from 4 5 to 5 5 mm which demonstrated that the polymeric coating had no evident effect on the shape and size of macrocapsules in terms of surface color it was found that the pvdf coating of macrocapsules was transparency which had a positive effect on light utilization of the encapsulated algae cells to further characterize and analyze the surface morphology and microstructure of algae encapsulating macrocapsules sem images of the outer surface and cross section for algae gfs polymer are displayed in fig 2b evidently the continuous microporous polymeric film was adhered around the outer surface of gfs to generate the gfs polymer core shell structure as apparent from figure some living microorganisms were uniformly entrapped into the interior matrix of the gfs core fig 2c and d the total thickness of porous polymeric layer was measured to be 150 200 μm and the pore diameter of the layer was approximately 50 200 nm fig 2e seen from the cross section image of polymeric layer fig 2f the typical finger like channel was clearly presented similar with the flat sheet polymer membrane shen et al 2011 after the phase inversion process the percentage of dead chlorella encapsulated into the gfs polymer capsule was about 3 0 6 4 figure s1 which demonstrated that the introduction of polymer with high biocompatibility had little negative effect on the viability of chlorella 3 2 application of algae encapsulating macrocapsule to mbr 3 2 1 concentration of biomass production biomass production of free and encapsulated algae with increasing operation time was measured and the results are presented in fig 3 fluorescence optical microscope was used to visually assess the bacterial growth of free and encapsulated chlorella fig 3a d in comparison with the suspended system the inverted fluorescence microscope photograph highlighted that large amounts of living algae were scattered on the surface of fibers whereas only a small number of dead microbes red were seen the result demonstrated that the fiber macrosphere provides more sites for the adherence of living cells fig 3e points out the biomass harvesting of free cells alginate beads and gfs polymer during the long operation time results show that an obvious increase trend in the concentration of free algae was observed from 0 045 to 0 378 g l after 4 days the content of biomass reached the highest value 0 482 g l and was maintained at that constant concentration for a long time in comparison with the suspended system the high biomass productivity of 0 183 g l per day was obtained for gfs polymer encapsulated culture the confined encapsulation obviously improved chlorella cultivation about 1 23 times harvesting rate to enhance the biological activity for waste pollutants removal it well demonstrated that the self assembly fiber macrocapsule provided enough space and functional sites for the fast growth and harvesting of chlorella by analysis the enhanced content of chlorella may be due to the fact that the micro aerobic environment dissolved oxygen of 0 3 1 0 mg l of the macrocapsule allows the encapsulated cells obtaining more energy to promote the metabolic ability and growth rate liu et al 2012 qiao et al 2009 qin et al 2020 3 2 2 stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule more details in the structural stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule were investigated which often plays significant roles in the application of cell encapsulation strategy to continuous mbr operation yao et al 2017 by tests it was found that the prepared gfs polymer macrocapsule retained the original spherical structure despite strong squeezing compared with sa beads figure s2 the enhanced mechanical strength of prepared macrocapsules was mainly attributed to the great rigidity of the inorganic fiber macrosphere besides the mechanical strength testing the structural stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule was also estimated in the long term operation of mbr after wastewater treatment the algae entrapping alginate beads were damaged and became colloid whereas the gfs polymer macrocapsules maintained their spherical morphology thus demonstrating that the core shell structured macrocapsules exhibited relatively long term structural stability and high tolerance to hydraulic shear besides mechanical stability the microbial leaking of macrocapsules is considered as a key issue hindering the wide application of microorganism encapsulation technology for wastewater treatment the contents of algae cell leakage from microcapsules were monitored and calculated by measuring optical density od625 fig 3f with the operation time increasing it was found that a remarkable increase in od625 was observed in the mixture of algae entrapping sa beads around 0 391 g l of bacteria leakage which demonstrated that the alginate framework gradually decomposed to cause the leakage of chlorella cells on the contrary the contribution of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules to od625 of the suspension was very small less than 0 1 g l of biomass during the whole operation it demonstrated that both fiber immobilization and polymer coating effectively prevent the leaking out of microorganisms from the capsules for a long time meanwhile the viability of chlorella in gfs and gfs polymer was evaluated by clsm after 24 h of operation fig 4 in order to elucidate the distribution of encapsulated algae cells the prepared macrocapsules were stained with fluorescent probe the selected probe molecule produced strong green fluorescence and showed the presence of living cells it was worth to note that an obvious reduction in the viability approximately 28 4 of algae cells entrapped into gfs was observed with increasing incubation time compared to gfs polymer figure s3 as more dead cells red were distributed on the surface of fibers microsphere it displayed that the coated polymeric layer could keep living cells away from physical chemical stress via the size sieve effect in comparison with traditional carriers the developed core shell macrocapsules exhibited the bigger potentials in the practical application of mbr for wastewater treatment 3 2 3 microbial activity of algae encapsulating macrocapsule the feasibility of the encapsulated macrocapsule was evaluated for treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater the degradation performance of algae gfs polymer macrocapsule algae entrapping sa beads and free cells in terms of cod and nh3 n removal efficiency are shown in fig 5 a the performance of pure gfs polymer macrocapsule and sa beads showed that no evident reduction in the removal of contaminants lower than 3 0 was obtained via surface adsorption by comparison the biodegradation performance of algae sa beads was comparable to that of free algae average cod and nh3 n removal efficiency of 51 31 and 91 98 notably it was found that the average cod and nh3 n removal rates of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules were up to 62 23 and 97 38 respectively higher than the corresponding values for algae sa beads and frees algae moreover it was found that an average tn removal efficiency of 86 9 90 2 was observed for algae gfs polymer macrocapsules figure s4 by analysis the no3 n removal rate was lower than nh4 n removal rate which is mainly attributed to the fact that chlorella mainly consuming nh4 n as the nitrogen source the comparison of biodegradation performance between free and encapsulated cells indicated that the core shell structure of the macrocapsule created a confined micro aerobic environment and had a positive effect on high ammonia nitrogen treatment liu et al 2012 qiao et al 2009 compared with the psf coating the generated pvdf layer was transparent to allow chlorella to get more light energy for biomass harvesting figure s5 under light irradiation it was clearly found that green chlorella cells were emerged in pvdf coated macrocapsules however for psf coated macrocapsules it is difficult to distinguish encapsulated cells owing to their weak light transmittance because of favorable light penetration of the pvdf coating the obvious increases in biomass production and cell activity were observed for algae gfs pvdf macrocapsules moreover compared to alginate beads the porous structure of macrocapsules also facilitated higher diffusion rates of organics dissolved oxygen and other nutrients entering the encapsulated culture as previously reported the activity of living cells entrapped into sa beads fe3o4 nanoparticles polyvinyl alcohol matrixes and membrane constructed particles was similar to or lower than that of free cells kurzbaum et al 2017 cai et al 2017 li et al 2009 liu et al 2009 chen et al 2008 so far few encapsulated microbes have been found to exhibit better performance than suspended cells the novel results can be ascribed to the unique structure of the prepared core shell capsules which display the dual functions in terms of enabling faster flow of targeted organic molecules into the polymer pores and slower diffusion of encapsulated cells through matrix of gfs and continuous polymeric layer lei et al 2007 high surface area 8 49 m2 g and porosity are beneficial for the flow of pollutants and byproducts in and out of the macrocapsule moreover the reusability of algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was measured in mbr system by investigating their durability over time it was found that algae gfs polymer can be reused for up to 30 d and achieved above 90 0 nh3 n removal fig 5b the result well indicated that gfs polymer macrocapsule offers a long term suitable microenvironment suitable for long term growth of chlorella culture the biodegradation performance of the algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was further investigated by increasing the initial concentrations of ammonia nitrogen fig 5c f as apparent from figure the lower biodegradation rates of the algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was observed at an initial nh3 n content of 10 mg l which could be ascribed to the lower nh3 n content gradient causing a lower diffusion rate across the macrocapsule surface at the initial nh3 n content of 50 mg l the comparable biodegradation rates were obtained in encapsulated and suspended systems with the nh3 n content further increasing to 100 mg l the biodegradation performance of encapsulated cells was higher than that of free cells this demonstrated that the biodegradation rate of encapsulated cells was similar or superior to that of free cells with the initial content of nh3 n ranging from 50 to 100 mg l however an evident reduction in the biodegradation rate was observed at nh3 n contents over 200 mg l which may be due to the accumulation of toxic intermediate compounds the comparison of biodegradation performance between encapsulated and free cells demonstrated that gfs polymer macrocapsule as a physical barrier could reduce the inhibitory effect of higher concentration ammonia nitrogen on the bioactivity of living cells 3 3 biofouling inhibition by macrocapsules in mbr system biofouling of membranes has been considered as a thorny issue limiting the application of mbr which could mainly be attributed to the proliferation of microorganisms on membrane surface and generation of a cohesive biofilm miura et al 2007 maximous et al 2009 xu et al 2020 in order to better understand the effect of free and encapsulated microorganisms on membrane fouling the calculations on filtration resistance of two membranes ca and n6 were performed fig 6 based on darcy s law the total membrane filtration resistance comprised the intrinsic membrane filtration resistance and membrane fouling resistance after analysis it was obvious that the membrane resistance r m of ca and n6 occupied only a small fraction of overall resistance 10 but much higher resistance of the cake layer was primarily responsible for the loss of permeability as apparent from fig 6a the calculated biofouling resistances of mbr with free cells and algae entrapping sa beads were 10 95 1011 and 10 65 1011 m 1 for ca and 28 73 1011 and 25 33 1011 m 1 for n6 membranes respectively however a significant reduction in filtration resistance of two membranes was evident for gfs polymer macrocapsules which exhibited 3 8 4 5 times lower resistance than free cells and cell sa beads according to the carman kozeny equation eq 4 the specific resistance α of the cake layer presents a close relationship with flocs size which is in inverse proportion to the square of particle diameter 4 α 180 1 ε 2 ρ p d p 2 ε 3 where ε is the cake porosity d p is the particle size m and ρ p is the particle density kg m3 as reported the microorganisms or flocs smaller than 50 μm were easily deposited on membrane surface to form dense cake layer which would significantly worsen membrane permeation meng et al 2007 zhang and jiang 2019 the results well confirmed that the large sized macrocapsules had a positive effect on reducing the biofouling of membrane surface and improving the permeation flux fig 6 b and c shows the variation of filtration resistances for n6 and ca membranes in different mbr systems with the algae biomass concentration increasing as noticed the amount of microbes had little influence on the filtration resistance of membrane during the operation of gfs polymer encapsulated mbr since the membrane filtration resistance of the pvdf encapsulated system hovered around 2 79 1011 m 1 as the biomass concentration rose from 0 498 to 1 87 g l more details shown in figure s6 the results well demonstrated that the synergistic effect of polymeric layer and glass fiber sphere can effectively prevent the leakage of algae from the capsules different from the algae gfs polymer capsules a rapid increase in membrane filtration resistance was observed for sa mbr with increasing operation time which was mainly attributed to a large number of small chlorella cells deposited on the membrane surface this reveals that the algae encapsulating gfs polymer capsules exhibited great potential for mbr operation with the high biomass concentration moreover the sem observations clearly presented that the outer surface of fouled membranes was covered with the free and encapsulated microorganisms fig 7 compared with the original ca and n6 membranes figure s7 it was clear that the surface of membranes was covered by a dense biofilm containing many chlorella cells in the free algae and sa entrapped mbr systems however only a thin and porous layer of large flocs was deposited on the surface of membranes in the gfs polymer encapsulated mbr systems after long term chlorella cultivation this reveals that the microorganism immobilization played a significant role in hindering the formation of a dense biofilm on membrane surface owing to the rising resistance directly associated with the energy consumption of mbr sun et al 2016 the significant reduction in membrane resistance with the addition of prepared cell encapsulating capsules is very encouraging from the view point of sustainable green fouling control and energy saving 4 conclusions we report macroencapsulation of microalgae within highly stable gfs polymer core shell capsules for mbr application in term of ammonia nitrogen removal and membrane biofouling control in comparison with traditional alginate entrapment method the dual encapsulation strategy enables the combination of porous polymer layer and rigid inorganic sphere to be constructed as a barrier for harvesting microalgae and reducing leakage of cells the prepared cell encapsulating macrocapsules exhibited higher nh3 n degradation compared to free cells in the mbr system this reveals that porous structure can allow fast flow of targeted organic molecules into capsules and slow down the diffusion of encapsulated cells outside capsules the biofouling of membrane surface was evidently reduced by using cells gfs polymer capsules which had a membrane resistance of 3 5 times lower than that of free cells and cells alginate beads long term stability of the encapsulated macrocapsules 30 d in complex surroundings offers an energy saving method to address the current low microbial activity and serious biofouling problems of mbr for wastewater treatment

17497,low microbial activity and serious membrane biofouling are still critical problems that hinder the extensive application of membrane bioreactor mbr for industrial wastewater treatment to address these bottlenecks we report a new specialized microorganism encapsulation strategy for constructing a highly efficient mbr system in our study the algae entrapping fiber macrospheres with polymeric coating were first coupled with membrane separation for treating refractory high ammonia nitrogen wastewater in comparison with traditional alginate beads the developed macrocapsule 0 5 cm exhibited higher biomass harvesting and lower microbial leakage because of the confined micro aerobic environment created by dual encapsulation of rigid inorganic macrosphere and porous polymeric layers application of algae encapsulating macrocapsule to mbr presented excellent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia nitrogen nh3 n removal efficiency of 62 23 and 97 38 respectively which were higher than the corresponding values for algae sa beads and free algae the biodegradation performance of nh3 n by encapsulated microalgae was similar or superior to that by free cells when the initial content of ammonia nitrogen ranged from 50 to 100 mg l the results well demonstrated that the gfs polymer macrocapsule as a physical barrier reduced the inhibitory effect of higher concentration ammonia nitrogen on the bioactivity of living cells importantly the encapsulated core shell macrocapsules showed superior anti biofouling capacity which had a membrane resistance of 3 5 times lower than that of cell alginate beads and free cells this work will open a new avenue to develop a novel encapsulated mbr for various non degradable wastewater treatments as an energy saving and

nitrogen in this wastewater can be extremely harmful to our health primarily in forms of surface runoff and groundwater kim et al 2013 zhao et al 2016 hence developing efficient and environmentally friendly technologies for wastewater treatment is urgently needed membrane bioreactor mbr as a promising and economical alternative has been widely applied for treating various wastewater because of its small occupation high quality of effluent and easy operation vallero et al 2005 jeong et al 2014 rodriguez sanchez et al 2017 qin et al 2017 to further improve the biological treatment performance the considerable attention has been paid on screening and cultivating the specialized microorganisms with excellent activity xiao and roberts 2013 woo et al 2019 wu et al 2020 among various microorganisms microalgae presented a big potential in refractory wastewater treatment due to their outstanding nitrogen removal efficiency good recycling performance and renewable bioenergy production angenent et al 2004 cheah et al 2016 however maintaining the stable and efficient performance of suspended microalgae under harsh environments remains a big challenge lay et al 2010 ebrahimi et al 2015 meanwhile the serious biofouling of the membrane owing to poor settling properties and small size of microalgae also restricts the wide application of mbr huang et al 2008 qin et al 2015 chen et al 2017 meng et al 2017 liao et al 2018 therefore the development of a new mbr system with excellent bioactivity and anti fouling capability is very important for practical application microorganism encapsulation technology has attracted extensive attention in environmental protection yeon et al 2009 de bashan and bashan 2010 qin et al 2020 pharmaceutical engineering ng et al 2015 and biomass production as discussed in the previous literatures compared with tradational suspension cultures the use of encapsulated carriers provides many important advantages such as protecting microbes against environmental stress shock loading and toxic by products thus enhancing the substrate conversion yield and the ease of collection in particular for mbr application the entrapment of small sized microorganisms within macrocapsules will be very efficient for biofouling reduction to our knowledge the developments of advanced mbr coupled with the microorganism encapsulation method have been rarely reported in the previous studies over the past decades the microorganisms have mainly been entrapped into spherical alginate beads owing to the biocompatibility and simple preparation associated with this approach recently more efforts have been devoted to enhance the chemical and physical stability of alginate frameworks using a polymeric coating such as poly ethylene glycol polyvinylamine guisan et al 2006 and polysulfone kim et al 2015 however the calcium alginate matrix as the core was susceptible to the presence of excess monovalent ions organics and shear forces the main challenge of microorganisms encapsulation is the maintenance of sufficient stability and microbial biomass of capsules without cell leaking under harsh conditions therefore it is essential to fabricate a highly stable microorganism encapsulating macrocapsule for practical mbr application based on the above observations we developed novel algae encapsulating macrocapsules integration with membrane separation for high ammonia nitrogen wastewater treatment wherein the cultivation of highly active chlorella for cod and nh3 n removal was easily achieved and membrane biofouling could be effectively mitigated different from the traditional entrapment method a dual encapsulation strategy was put forward to anchor chlorella cells into fiber spheres with porous polymeric layer coating the rapidly synthesized macrospheres created a large enough space for microbial cell immobilization to address the limitations of the conventional organic core the structure biomass harvesting and bacterial leakage were characterized and compared between the prepared algae encapsulating macrocapsule and sodium alginate beads moreover a comparison on ammonia nitrogen biodegradation between encapsulated and free cells was performed with the initial content of nh3 n as 10 200 mg l to evaluate the feasibility of cell encapsulation for refractory wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials glass fiber was obtained from hangzhou composite material co ltd china polyvinylidene fluoride average mw 95000 da of 1010 and polysulfone pellets mw 120000da of p 3500 were purchased from solvay usa n n dimethylformamide dmf sodium alginate sa calcium chloride cacl2 sodium chloride nacl and sodium hydroxide naoh were bought from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china all chemicals were of analytical grade without further purification 2 2 microalgae and high ammonia nitrogen wastewater chlorella pyrenoidosa fachb 28 cells were provided by the institute of hydrobiology chinese academy of sciences which were cultivated under shaking condition in bg11 medium during the pilot scale cultivation the intensity of light irradiation aeration rate and temperature were adjusted to about 3000 lux 2 5 l min and 28 c respectively the initial concentration of chlorella was adjusted to the approximately 0 045 g l in each bioreactor in this work the wastewater containing large amounts of inorganic nitrogen was used to evaluate the activity of microorganism encapsulating macrocapsules the composition and concentration of high ammonia nitrogen wastewater are shown in table s1 which presented a high organic loading cod of 550 820 mg l and nutrient substance max nh3 n of 200 mg l moreover the ph of wastewater was fluctuated between 5 0 and 7 0 2 3 mbr experiment setup a schematic diagram of membrane photo bioreactor for treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater is shown in fig 1 two identical scale mbrs one algae encapsulating macrocapsules added mbr and another mbr with the addition of free microalgae were run in parallel under the same conditions based on our previously reported strategy fan et al 2018 mbr integration with chlorella pyrenoidosa was constructed for high ammonia nitrogen wastewater treatment the working volume of each mbr configuration was set at about 10 l the mbr system was operated under constant flux about 8 2 l m2h and run with 10 min suction followed by 2 min relaxation the solid retention time srt hydraulic retention time hrt and aeration rate were controlled at 30 d 72 h and 2 5 l min respectively to explore the effect of microorganisms on membrane fouling the self made nylon 6 n6 and cellulose acetate ca microfiltration flat modules were used in the bioreactor more details in membrane parameters are given in table s2 the transmembrane pressure tmp was measured to evaluate membrane fouling the encapsulated macrocapsules were washed to remove the adhesive cells of surface the concentration of chemical oxygen demand cod ammonia nitrogen nh3 n and total nitrogen tn were tested using standard analytical methods apha et al 2005 the light intensity of the bioreactor was examined by digital lux meter as831 2 4 preparation of various macrocapsules 2 4 1 algae entrapping sodium alginate beads the pathway was used to fabricate algae entrapping sodium alginate sa according to the previously reported method kim et al 2015 a mixture solution of sodium alginate sa and algae cells was dropped into cacl2 solution 4 w v and stirred at room temperature 2 4 2 algae encapsulating gfs polymer capsules in this work algae cells were encapsulated into organic inorganic composite macrocapsules using the dual encapsulation strategy firstly the glass fiber spheres gfs were fabricated by shearing force induced self assembly method and soaked into naoh solution the as synthesized spheres were dried at 80 c after washing with deionized water then the resulted gfs were immersed into algae solution and incubated together for several hours to entrap living cells into the interior of spheres secondly the microporous polymeric substances psf and pvdf were coated on the out surface of fiber spheres by the phase inversion method typically the polymeric substances were dissolved in n n dimethylformamide by the vigorously stirring subsequently the algae entrapping gfs were immersed into the casting solutions for 10 s the polymer coating gfs was soaked into a water coagulation bath finally the as prepared macrocapsules were washed and preserved at 4 c until use by calculation the chlorella content of obtained macrocapsules was approximately 0 05 0 016 g cells g macrocapsules 2 5 measurement of biomass concentration the biomass harvesting dcw of free chlorella cells in the suspension liquid was measured by using a spectrophotometer wavelength of 625 nm which was illustrated as follows eq 1 wang et al 2012 1 d c w g l 0 2538 o d 625 r 2 0 9860 where od 625 is the absorbance value of chlorella solution and biomass dcw represents the concentration of microalgae the algae biomass of the macrocapsules was measured by the weight difference method a certain amount of macrocapsules were dried in an oven at 80 c for 6 h the weight of which was denoted as m1 in addition the algae encapsulating macrocapsules were heated to remove moisture and weight of which was denoted as m2 the weight difference of m1 and m2 represents the weight of encapsulated microalgae the biomass concentration of macrocapsules was the ratio of microalgae weight to volume cell leakage from various encapsulated macrocapsules to the solution was determined by testing the absorbance of suspension liquid at a wavelength of 625 nm 2 6 analysis of membrane permeability and filtration resistance membrane fouling was evaluated by assessing the variation of permeability with operation time nylon 6 n6 and cellulose acetate ca microfiltration membranes with pore size of 0 22 μm were chosen in the mbr system the permeability was calculated from eq 2 as follows 2 l p l m 2 h 1 b a r 1 j p δ p t m where j p is the permeate flux l m2 h1 and p tm is the transmembrane pressure bar the total filtration resistance r t m 1 was calculated according to the darcy s law eq 3 3 r t r m r f δ p t m μ j p where r t r m and r f represent total membrane filtration resistance m 1 intrinsic membrane resistance m 1 and filtration resistance owing to membrane fouling m 1 respectively µ is the permeate viscosity pa 1 s to investigate the effect of biomass concentration on membrane filtration resistance the time of sampling to determine each rt was set at 5 10 15 20 and 30 d respectively 2 7 scanning electron microscope sem scanning electron microscope sem was used to analyze the out surface and cross sectional structure of macrocapsules the algae encapsulating macrocapsules were cut in half and the porous polymeric layer was exfoliated from fiber macrosphere to estimate membrane fouling the surfaces of membranes after filtration were also examined before sem analysis the prepared samples were dried in vacuum and coated with a gold layer zhang et al 2013 2 8 confocal laser scanning microscope clsm three dimensional structure of various prepared macrocapsules was visually analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscope leica tcs sp5 german samples were firstly frozen in liquid nitrogen and were then cut into the slices as thin as possible subsequently the slices were fluorescently stained with nucleic acid specific syto9 living cell dna and propidium iodide abbreviated to pi respectively the clsm images of the prepared samples were carried out after removing the excess dyes moreover the biomass production was observed by ds fi1 fluorescence optical microscope nikon japan 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and characterization of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules as illustrated in fig 2 a the large sized fiber spheres were synthesized by the self assembly of short glass fibers porous frameworks high biocompatibility and strong mechanical property of fiber spheres are beneficial for encapsulation and cultivation of living cells subsequently the phase inversion of polymeric substances occurred on the outer surface of fiber spheres to confine algae cells in a favorable environment which effectively reduced the leakage of cells into the solution by measurement the diameter of the globular macrocapsules varied from 4 5 to 5 5 mm which demonstrated that the polymeric coating had no evident effect on the shape and size of macrocapsules in terms of surface color it was found that the pvdf coating of macrocapsules was transparency which had a positive effect on light utilization of the encapsulated algae cells to further characterize and analyze the surface morphology and microstructure of algae encapsulating macrocapsules sem images of the outer surface and cross section for algae gfs polymer are displayed in fig 2b evidently the continuous microporous polymeric film was adhered around the outer surface of gfs to generate the gfs polymer core shell structure as apparent from figure some living microorganisms were uniformly entrapped into the interior matrix of the gfs core fig 2c and d the total thickness of porous polymeric layer was measured to be 150 200 μm and the pore diameter of the layer was approximately 50 200 nm fig 2e seen from the cross section image of polymeric layer fig 2f the typical finger like channel was clearly presented similar with the flat sheet polymer membrane shen et al 2011 after the phase inversion process the percentage of dead chlorella encapsulated into the gfs polymer capsule was about 3 0 6 4 figure s1 which demonstrated that the introduction of polymer with high biocompatibility had little negative effect on the viability of chlorella 3 2 application of algae encapsulating macrocapsule to mbr 3 2 1 concentration of biomass production biomass production of free and encapsulated algae with increasing operation time was measured and the results are presented in fig 3 fluorescence optical microscope was used to visually assess the bacterial growth of free and encapsulated chlorella fig 3a d in comparison with the suspended system the inverted fluorescence microscope photograph highlighted that large amounts of living algae were scattered on the surface of fibers whereas only a small number of dead microbes red were seen the result demonstrated that the fiber macrosphere provides more sites for the adherence of living cells fig 3e points out the biomass harvesting of free cells alginate beads and gfs polymer during the long operation time results show that an obvious increase trend in the concentration of free algae was observed from 0 045 to 0 378 g l after 4 days the content of biomass reached the highest value 0 482 g l and was maintained at that constant concentration for a long time in comparison with the suspended system the high biomass productivity of 0 183 g l per day was obtained for gfs polymer encapsulated culture the confined encapsulation obviously improved chlorella cultivation about 1 23 times harvesting rate to enhance the biological activity for waste pollutants removal it well demonstrated that the self assembly fiber macrocapsule provided enough space and functional sites for the fast growth and harvesting of chlorella by analysis the enhanced content of chlorella may be due to the fact that the micro aerobic environment dissolved oxygen of 0 3 1 0 mg l of the macrocapsule allows the encapsulated cells obtaining more energy to promote the metabolic ability and growth rate liu et al 2012 qiao et al 2009 qin et al 2020 3 2 2 stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule more details in the structural stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule were investigated which often plays significant roles in the application of cell encapsulation strategy to continuous mbr operation yao et al 2017 by tests it was found that the prepared gfs polymer macrocapsule retained the original spherical structure despite strong squeezing compared with sa beads figure s2 the enhanced mechanical strength of prepared macrocapsules was mainly attributed to the great rigidity of the inorganic fiber macrosphere besides the mechanical strength testing the structural stability of algae encapsulating macrocapsule was also estimated in the long term operation of mbr after wastewater treatment the algae entrapping alginate beads were damaged and became colloid whereas the gfs polymer macrocapsules maintained their spherical morphology thus demonstrating that the core shell structured macrocapsules exhibited relatively long term structural stability and high tolerance to hydraulic shear besides mechanical stability the microbial leaking of macrocapsules is considered as a key issue hindering the wide application of microorganism encapsulation technology for wastewater treatment the contents of algae cell leakage from microcapsules were monitored and calculated by measuring optical density od625 fig 3f with the operation time increasing it was found that a remarkable increase in od625 was observed in the mixture of algae entrapping sa beads around 0 391 g l of bacteria leakage which demonstrated that the alginate framework gradually decomposed to cause the leakage of chlorella cells on the contrary the contribution of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules to od625 of the suspension was very small less than 0 1 g l of biomass during the whole operation it demonstrated that both fiber immobilization and polymer coating effectively prevent the leaking out of microorganisms from the capsules for a long time meanwhile the viability of chlorella in gfs and gfs polymer was evaluated by clsm after 24 h of operation fig 4 in order to elucidate the distribution of encapsulated algae cells the prepared macrocapsules were stained with fluorescent probe the selected probe molecule produced strong green fluorescence and showed the presence of living cells it was worth to note that an obvious reduction in the viability approximately 28 4 of algae cells entrapped into gfs was observed with increasing incubation time compared to gfs polymer figure s3 as more dead cells red were distributed on the surface of fibers microsphere it displayed that the coated polymeric layer could keep living cells away from physical chemical stress via the size sieve effect in comparison with traditional carriers the developed core shell macrocapsules exhibited the bigger potentials in the practical application of mbr for wastewater treatment 3 2 3 microbial activity of algae encapsulating macrocapsule the feasibility of the encapsulated macrocapsule was evaluated for treating high ammonia nitrogen wastewater the degradation performance of algae gfs polymer macrocapsule algae entrapping sa beads and free cells in terms of cod and nh3 n removal efficiency are shown in fig 5 a the performance of pure gfs polymer macrocapsule and sa beads showed that no evident reduction in the removal of contaminants lower than 3 0 was obtained via surface adsorption by comparison the biodegradation performance of algae sa beads was comparable to that of free algae average cod and nh3 n removal efficiency of 51 31 and 91 98 notably it was found that the average cod and nh3 n removal rates of algae gfs polymer macrocapsules were up to 62 23 and 97 38 respectively higher than the corresponding values for algae sa beads and frees algae moreover it was found that an average tn removal efficiency of 86 9 90 2 was observed for algae gfs polymer macrocapsules figure s4 by analysis the no3 n removal rate was lower than nh4 n removal rate which is mainly attributed to the fact that chlorella mainly consuming nh4 n as the nitrogen source the comparison of biodegradation performance between free and encapsulated cells indicated that the core shell structure of the macrocapsule created a confined micro aerobic environment and had a positive effect on high ammonia nitrogen treatment liu et al 2012 qiao et al 2009 compared with the psf coating the generated pvdf layer was transparent to allow chlorella to get more light energy for biomass harvesting figure s5 under light irradiation it was clearly found that green chlorella cells were emerged in pvdf coated macrocapsules however for psf coated macrocapsules it is difficult to distinguish encapsulated cells owing to their weak light transmittance because of favorable light penetration of the pvdf coating the obvious increases in biomass production and cell activity were observed for algae gfs pvdf macrocapsules moreover compared to alginate beads the porous structure of macrocapsules also facilitated higher diffusion rates of organics dissolved oxygen and other nutrients entering the encapsulated culture as previously reported the activity of living cells entrapped into sa beads fe3o4 nanoparticles polyvinyl alcohol matrixes and membrane constructed particles was similar to or lower than that of free cells kurzbaum et al 2017 cai et al 2017 li et al 2009 liu et al 2009 chen et al 2008 so far few encapsulated microbes have been found to exhibit better performance than suspended cells the novel results can be ascribed to the unique structure of the prepared core shell capsules which display the dual functions in terms of enabling faster flow of targeted organic molecules into the polymer pores and slower diffusion of encapsulated cells through matrix of gfs and continuous polymeric layer lei et al 2007 high surface area 8 49 m2 g and porosity are beneficial for the flow of pollutants and byproducts in and out of the macrocapsule moreover the reusability of algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was measured in mbr system by investigating their durability over time it was found that algae gfs polymer can be reused for up to 30 d and achieved above 90 0 nh3 n removal fig 5b the result well indicated that gfs polymer macrocapsule offers a long term suitable microenvironment suitable for long term growth of chlorella culture the biodegradation performance of the algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was further investigated by increasing the initial concentrations of ammonia nitrogen fig 5c f as apparent from figure the lower biodegradation rates of the algae gfs polymer macrocapsule was observed at an initial nh3 n content of 10 mg l which could be ascribed to the lower nh3 n content gradient causing a lower diffusion rate across the macrocapsule surface at the initial nh3 n content of 50 mg l the comparable biodegradation rates were obtained in encapsulated and suspended systems with the nh3 n content further increasing to 100 mg l the biodegradation performance of encapsulated cells was higher than that of free cells this demonstrated that the biodegradation rate of encapsulated cells was similar or superior to that of free cells with the initial content of nh3 n ranging from 50 to 100 mg l however an evident reduction in the biodegradation rate was observed at nh3 n contents over 200 mg l which may be due to the accumulation of toxic intermediate compounds the comparison of biodegradation performance between encapsulated and free cells demonstrated that gfs polymer macrocapsule as a physical barrier could reduce the inhibitory effect of higher concentration ammonia nitrogen on the bioactivity of living cells 3 3 biofouling inhibition by macrocapsules in mbr system biofouling of membranes has been considered as a thorny issue limiting the application of mbr which could mainly be attributed to the proliferation of microorganisms on membrane surface and generation of a cohesive biofilm miura et al 2007 maximous et al 2009 xu et al 2020 in order to better understand the effect of free and encapsulated microorganisms on membrane fouling the calculations on filtration resistance of two membranes ca and n6 were performed fig 6 based on darcy s law the total membrane filtration resistance comprised the intrinsic membrane filtration resistance and membrane fouling resistance after analysis it was obvious that the membrane resistance r m of ca and n6 occupied only a small fraction of overall resistance 10 but much higher resistance of the cake layer was primarily responsible for the loss of permeability as apparent from fig 6a the calculated biofouling resistances of mbr with free cells and algae entrapping sa beads were 10 95 1011 and 10 65 1011 m 1 for ca and 28 73 1011 and 25 33 1011 m 1 for n6 membranes respectively however a significant reduction in filtration resistance of two membranes was evident for gfs polymer macrocapsules which exhibited 3 8 4 5 times lower resistance than free cells and cell sa beads according to the carman kozeny equation eq 4 the specific resistance α of the cake layer presents a close relationship with flocs size which is in inverse proportion to the square of particle diameter 4 α 180 1 ε 2 ρ p d p 2 ε 3 where ε is the cake porosity d p is the particle size m and ρ p is the particle density kg m3 as reported the microorganisms or flocs smaller than 50 μm were easily deposited on membrane surface to form dense cake layer which would significantly worsen membrane permeation meng et al 2007 zhang and jiang 2019 the results well confirmed that the large sized macrocapsules had a positive effect on reducing the biofouling of membrane surface and improving the permeation flux fig 6 b and c shows the variation of filtration resistances for n6 and ca membranes in different mbr systems with the algae biomass concentration increasing as noticed the amount of microbes had little influence on the filtration resistance of membrane during the operation of gfs polymer encapsulated mbr since the membrane filtration resistance of the pvdf encapsulated system hovered around 2 79 1011 m 1 as the biomass concentration rose from 0 498 to 1 87 g l more details shown in figure s6 the results well demonstrated that the synergistic effect of polymeric layer and glass fiber sphere can effectively prevent the leakage of algae from the capsules different from the algae gfs polymer capsules a rapid increase in membrane filtration resistance was observed for sa mbr with increasing operation time which was mainly attributed to a large number of small chlorella cells deposited on the membrane surface this reveals that the algae encapsulating gfs polymer capsules exhibited great potential for mbr operation with the high biomass concentration moreover the sem observations clearly presented that the outer surface of fouled membranes was covered with the free and encapsulated microorganisms fig 7 compared with the original ca and n6 membranes figure s7 it was clear that the surface of membranes was covered by a dense biofilm containing many chlorella cells in the free algae and sa entrapped mbr systems however only a thin and porous layer of large flocs was deposited on the surface of membranes in the gfs polymer encapsulated mbr systems after long term chlorella cultivation this reveals that the microorganism immobilization played a significant role in hindering the formation of a dense biofilm on membrane surface owing to the rising resistance directly associated with the energy consumption of mbr sun et al 2016 the significant reduction in membrane resistance with the addition of prepared cell encapsulating capsules is very encouraging from the view point of sustainable green fouling control and energy saving 4 conclusions we report macroencapsulation of microalgae within highly stable gfs polymer core shell capsules for mbr application in term of ammonia nitrogen removal and membrane biofouling control in comparison with traditional alginate entrapment method the dual encapsulation strategy enables the combination of porous polymer layer and rigid inorganic sphere to be constructed as a barrier for harvesting microalgae and reducing leakage of cells the prepared cell encapsulating macrocapsules exhibited higher nh3 n degradation compared to free cells in the mbr system this reveals that porous structure can allow fast flow of targeted organic molecules into capsules and slow down the diffusion of encapsulated cells outside capsules the biofouling of membrane surface was evidently reduced by using cells gfs polymer capsules which had a membrane resistance of 3 5 times lower than that of free cells and cells alginate beads long term stability of the encapsulated macrocapsules 30 d in complex surroundings offers an energy saving method to address the current low microbial activity and serious biofouling problems of mbr for wastewater treatment

17498,to offset estuarine eutrophication interest is increasing in restoring oyster reefs and expanding oyster aquaculture however ecosystem scale evidence is lacking on oyster assemblages impacts on estuarine pelagic nitrogen n cycling using a multiple isotope approach and isotope mixing model we examined the sources transformations and influence of intensive oyster aquaculture on n pollution in a subtropical estuary the salinity dependent no3 and nh4 concentrations and their correlations with isotopic signals δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ15n nh4 indicated the nutrient spatial distribution in low salinity areas was largely regulated by mixing between freshwater and seawater however the intensive oyster aquaculture greatly increased nitrification in the estuary in high salinity areas where oyster assemblages were absent the assimilation of no3 by phytoplankton became dominant and sharply increased the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage and wastewater treatment plants were the major no3 sources in the estuary while internal nitrification contributed 20 6 to the no3 pool oyster biodeposits comprised up to one third of the particulate organic matter in the water column and as much as 47 3 of the nh4 pool could be from the oysters our study shows that oysters significantly contribute to the pelagic nutrient pools and n transformations adding an important dimension to our understanding of oyster assemblages impacts on estuarine n cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen sources transformations isotope mixing model oyster 1 introduction nitrogen n pollution in estuaries has received particularly wide attention because it leads to algae blooms hypoxia fish kills and widespread ecological damage in these ecologically and economically important areas hagy et al 2004 howarth and marino 2006 bricker and devlin 2011 while many efforts have been made to reduce point sources of n interest is rising in oyster restoration efforts or increasing the scale of oyster aquaculture as a companion strategy to mitigate estuarine eutrophication fulford et al 2007 rose et al 2014 bricker et al 2018 several studies have indicated that oyster reefs can offset n pollution by transferring pelagic n to sediments as biodeposits enhancing sedimentary denitrification and removing n from the ecosystem via direct harvest newell et al 2005 cerco and noel 2007 carmichael et al 2012 oyster assemblages can influence the ammonification of organic n nitrification and denitrification in sediments newell et al 2005 kellogg et al 2013 these studies clearly demonstrate the positive roles of oysters in mitigating estuarine n pollution rose et al 2014 however the magnitude of oyster s impact on estuarine n pollution is associated not only with the benthic n processes smyth et al 2013 hoellein et al 2015 but also with the hydrologic processes controlling nutrient dispersion and n input from external sources in the estuary coen et al 2007 few studies have examined the impact of oysters on pelagic n transformations to date ecosystem scale understanding of oyster s contribution to estuarine n cycling is lacking forrest et al 2009 much remains to be learned about oysters contributions to the pelagic n pool and transformations at the estuary scale the multiple isotope approach has proven to be a useful means of studying n pollution kendall et al 2007 dual isotopes e g δ15n no3 δ18o no3 have been used to identify sources and mixing as well as for evaluating nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems wong et al 2014 ye et al 2015 yu et al 2015 archana et al 2018 mixing of different sources or the presence of transformation processes n2 fixation assimilation nitrification and denitrification can reflect in changes of isotopic signals this technique could also be utilized as a tool for understanding how oysters might intervene in estuarine n cycling large scale of oyster populations could change the isotopic compositions of seawater if they are able to significantly contribute to the n pool or intensify n transformations in an estuary qinzhou bay in south china provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of oysters on pelagic n cycling in an estuary this bay has a more than 350 year long history of culturing the oyster crassostrea hongkongensis and it is the largest oyster producing site in south china today qinzhou bay supports a well developed oyster industry and large scale oyster farming with around 10 of the bay surface occupied by oyster rafts and numerous bottom cultures growing underwater internet based data estimates of annual oyster production in qinzhou bay is currently at 270 000 tons with a marketing value of nearly 400 million usd per year this large oyster assemblage might exert some control over the water quality in the bay but the extent to which the oysters play a role remains unknown in this study we measured n concentrations and the isotopic compositions of the nutrients δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 in water samples collected from the bay and from potential n sources we also measured the isotopic compositions of particulate organic nitrogen δ15n pon and carbon δ13c poc in the suspended particulate matter and oyster biodeposits key questions addressed in this study included the following 1 what are the spatial distribution patterns of the nutrients in the water column and could the oysters affect these patterns 2 how does the oyster aquaculture in the bay affect pelagic n cycling 3 what are the sources of no3 nh4 and pon to qinzhou bay and how does this large oyster assemblage contribute to the n input it was expected that the multiple isotope approach would generate important clues for understanding these key biogeochemical processes and provide important implications of oyster s role in estuarine n cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling descriptions of climate hydrodynamics and anthropogenic activities in the qinzhou bay are provided in supporting information si see brief descriptions of qinzhou bay a large scale sampling was performed in july 2019 this period was chosen because oyster filtration is generally maximized in the summer pomeroy et al 2007 and therefore the oysters should have their most significant influence on water quality at this time a total of 34 surface seawater samples were collected from the bay fig 1 b at a depth of 0 5 m in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles in situ water quality parameters i e ph salinity dissolved oxygen do water temperature and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were recorded using calibrated probes ysi 600 during sampling the samples were immediately filtered through 0 7 µm whatman glass fiber membrane filters the suspended solids were collected for the δ15n pon and δ13c poc analyses and the filtered seawater was transported to the laboratory in a refrigerated box for the nitrate no3 nitrite no2 phosphate po4 3 ammonium nh4 δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analyses in addition an aliquot of unfiltered sample was used for a total nitrogen tn analysis river water groundwater atmospheric precipitation shrimp pond effluents oyster biodeposits domestic sewage and effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps were collected to evaluate their contributions to the n pollution in the bay the sampling locations for each source are shown in fig 1c longitudinal water samples were collected from the rivers flowing into the bay qin and the maoling river see si groundwater was collected from artificial wells precipitation samples were collected from july to october of 2019 using a measuring cylinder domestic sewage and effluents from three wwtps were collected from the inlets and outlets respectively to sample oyster biodeposits ten oysters c hongkongensis were collected from the bay and immediately transported back to laboratory the oysters allowed to defecate in a 20 l tank and the freshly released feces were sucked up by a dropper and collected on 0 7 µm whatman glass fiber membrane filters the feces were identified by their compact dark colored and line shape appearance 2 2 analytical procedures for nutrients and isotopic signals all chemical analyses were performed within two weeks of sample collection with the exception of the isotope analyses which were performed within 1 month the no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were determined by a flow injection analyzer fia using the spectrophotometric method apha 2005 total nitrogen was also determined with a fia after oxidation by alkaline potassium persulfate the uncertainties of the spectrophotometric analyses were within 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the samples were measured by well established denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 weigand et al 2016 no3 in the water samples was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o by denitrifying pseudomonas aureofaciens lacking n2o reductase activity the n2o was concentrated and purified before introduction into an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms to determine the isotopic composition international standards usgs 34 δ15n 1 8 0 2 and usgs 32 δ15n 18 1 were used to correct δ15n no3 data while δ18o no3 data were corrected using usgs 34 δ18o 27 9 0 6 and usgs 35 δ18o 57 5 0 6 isotope data are reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical uncertainties were 0 2 for the δ15n no3 and 0 3 for the δ18o no3 the δ15n nh4 determination was performed using the ammonia diffusion method holmes et al 1998 five liters of field filtered samples were transported to the lab in hdpe diffusion bottles meanwhile three control samples were prepared nh4 2so4 of known isotopic composition 2 37 0 03 was added to diffusion bottles containing millipore purified water to achieve an nh4 concentration similar to that expected in the samples ammonia traps sulfuric acid impregnated fiber disks sandwiched between two 2 5 cm diameter 10 μm pore size teflon membranes 200 g nacl and 15 g mgo were added to the diffusion bottles which were then incubated for 2 weeks at 40 c before the δ15n nh4 determination the fiber disks were dried in a desiccator with silica gel and concentrated sulfuric acid for the δ15n pon and δ13c poc determinations the suspended particle collections were carefully scraped from the filter membranes to remove the inorganic carbon the samples were acidified with 10 hydrochloric acid centrifuged and rinsed with purified water and lyophilized the sewage and oyster biodeposits samples were also lyophilized all solid samples fiber disks suspended particles sewage and oyster biodeposits were ground and put through a 100 mesh sieve the powdered samples were placed in 5 5 mm silver micro cups and introduced into an element analyzer ea irms to determine the δ15n and δ13c values which were reported relative to air and pee dee belemnite pdb respectively usgs 34 and usgs 32 were used to correct the δ15n data the reference standards for δ13c were usgs 64 δ13c 40 81 and usgs 66 δ13c 0 67 the average fractionation of the control samples was added to the observed δ15n nh4 values for the fiber disks to correct for fractionation during the diffusion procedure the analytical uncertainties were 0 2 for δ15n and 0 1 for δ13c 2 3 calculating different n source contributions the proportional contributions of the n sources were quantified by either an algebraic isotope mixing model when two endmembers are considered or by the r package stable isotope analysis in r parnell et al 2010 in which a markov chain monte carlo mcmc isotope mixing model is integrated when multiple endmembers are considered the algebraic isotope mixing model was defined as 1 δ 15 n m i x a δ 15 n 1 b δ 15 n 2 where δ15nmix is the isotopic ratio in a measured sample which is considered to result from a mixture of two endmember ratios δ15n1 and δ15n2 a and b are parameters representing the weighted contributions of the two endmembers a b 1 the mcmc mixing model determining the mixing of k sources with j isotopes was defined as 2 x ij k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j 3 s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 4 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 and 5 ε j k n 0 σ j 2 where xij is isotope value j for water sample i p k refers to the contribution of source k sjk is the source value k for isotope j which has a mean value μjk and variance ω 2 jk cjk is the fractionation of isotope j on source k which has a mean value λjk and variance τjk 2 εij is the residual error and σj 2 is the residual variance this model has recently been widely applied in river studies worldwide e g xia et al 2017 li et al 2019 but has seldom been applied in estuarine environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen pollution in qinzhou bay salinity do and chl a and nutrient concentrations in the 34 surface water samples are shown in table s1 surface seawater salinity in the bay increased from the river mouth to the bay margin fig 1b all do concentrations were above 5 0 mg l 1 indicating oxic conditions in the surface seawater the spatial distributions of chl a no3 nh4 and tn are shown in figures s1a d the spatial pattern of chl a and no3 appeared to be related to the oyster distribution a low chl a area coincided with the dense distribution of oyster rafts in the middle of the bay figs 1c and figure s1a possibly reflecting the efficient removal of phytoplankton by oyster filtration no3 concentrations were elevated at the river mouths and at areas where oysters were distributed fig 1c and figures s1b two wwtps located downstream of the qin river may be responsible for the high no3 concentrations in the northeastern part of the bay fig 1c except for the areas around a hotspot nh4 concentrations were generally below 5 µmol l 1 across the bay figure s1c even in the intensive oyster growing areas however the nh4 concentrations decreased sharply moving away from the point source suggesting the nh4 has a short residence time due either to hydraulic flushing or assimilation by phytoplankton table s2 lists some values reported for no3 and nh4 in estuaries around the world although a strict statistical comparison is impossible qinzhou bay appeared to have no3 and nh4 concentrations comparable to those of most human impacted estuaries e g chesapeake bay and san francisco bay estuary deutsch et al 2007 used the equation n no3 16 po4 3 2 9 μmol l 1 to evaluate deviations from the redfield ratio in seawater positive n values suggest excess no3 from n2 fixation and nitrification or additional sources and negative n suggest denitrification or assimilation no3 removal processes in this study 32 of the 34 samples had positive n values of which 22 were 10 therefore qinzhou bay had excessive no3 but low chl a during the sampling period which was possibly due to the suppressive role of oysters on phytoplankton growth newell and langdon 1996 newell et al 2005 but this speculation needs a more experimental setting to testify e g nutrient addition experiments or mesocosm studies 3 2 isotopic characteristics of the surface seawater and their relation to salinity the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ15n nh4 δ15n pon and δ13c poc values are shown in table s1 the spatial variation in the isotopic values is shown in figures s1e i the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 values were low in the inner bay and gradually increased moving southward figures s1e g in contrast the δ15n pon values were higher in the inner bay figure s1h together with the isotopic values the no3 nh4 and tn concentrations were plotted against salinity a conservative tracer of estuarine water mixing to identify additional local sources or cycling fig 2 good correlations were found between the nutrient concentrations and salinity figs 2a c suggesting that physical mixing largely controlled the spatial patterns of no3 nh4 and tn in qinzhou bay notably some data points clearly fell beyond the freshwater seawater mixing line on the nh4 salinity plot fig 2b this suggested the presence of other endmembers for nh4 which was supported by the salinity dependent δ15n nh4 figs 2f plotting δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 against salinity revealed contrasting n cycling patterns between the low 20 psu and high salinity 20 psu areas figs 2d and e similar isotopic values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggests the low salinity area 0 20 psu is mainly dominated by conservative mixing this area begins at the two river mouths and extends to the middle of the outer bay covering a large portion of the bay and a majority of the oyster growing area fig 1c however we noticed the dual isotopic values did not strictly follow the theoretical mixing lines figs 2d and e for the areas with salinities 20 psu the data fell above the mixing line for δ15n no3 and below the line for δ18o no3 suggesting other endmembers may exist besides the river and seawater endmembers and or the presence of non conservative behavior for the areas with salinities 20 psu both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 increased with the salinity gradient and the isotopic signals clearly deviated from conservative mixing figs 2d and e the presence of transformation processes such as n2 fixation assimilation nitrification and denitrification may be responsible for this strong deviation see discussion below 3 3 the impacts of oyster culturing on n transformations a keeling plot δ15n versus 1 no3 or 1 nh4 are used to distinguish mixing and biological n removal processes such as assimilation and denitrification kendall et al 2007 simple mixing between two sources yields a linear negative correlation between δ15n and 1 n on a keeling plot whereas biological removal processes result in progressively increasing δ15n values as n concentration decreases yielding a curved correlation furthermore n removal can be also identified by a straight line when the isotopes are plotted against ln n fig 3 shows the keeling plot for the low and high salinity areas salinities 20 and 20 psu respectively in terms of the δ15n and 1 n relationship a significant linear correlation was only found between δ15n nh4 and 1 nh4 at low salinity which is characteristic of simple mixing between two endmembers however no relationship was found between δ15n no3 and 1 no3 or between δ18o no3 and 1 no3 neither was a negative linear correlation observed at low salinity for the plots between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 versus ln no3 these results suggest that at low salinity areas where oysters were growing the pelagic assimilation or denitrification of no3 was not prevailing and there were multiple sources of no3 oysters can effectively filter phytoplankton in the water column which could be the major reason for the lack of assimilation effects in the low salinity environments studies have indicated that oyster biodeposits add organic n to the sediment and facilitate sedimentary denitrification in estuarine environments newell et al 2002 higgins et al 2013 hoellein et al 2015 meanwhile several studies suggested that oysters can facilitate denitrification by providing a habitat for denitrifying microbes caffrey et al 2016 arfken et al 2017 however the effects of denitrification in the water column appeared weak in our study suggesting the oyster aquaculture may not be significantly helpful to enhance pelagic denitrification in this bay the do concentrations were above 5 mg l 1 in the surface seawater table s1 a scenario that does not favor denitrification kendall et al 2007 we postulated the vast majority of the facilitated denitrification should occur in the sediments as suggested by many studies e g newell et al 2002 higgins et al 2013 the absence of strong pelagic denitrification in our study may be due to the decoupling of sedimentary and pelagic processes despite the weak pelagic denitrification the intensive oyster aquaculture may greatly increase nitrification in the bay first oysters can release large amounts of ammonia into seawater e g in one study oysters contributed 37 of the total nh4 flux from the sediment to the water column boucher and boucher rodoni 1998 the nh4 released by oysters provides abundant nh4 for pelagic nitrification dame 2011 and this may be why the nh4 concentrations deviated from the theoretical mixing line fig 2b second oysters can also contribute to the no3 pool via the mineralization of suspended and sedimented biodeposits mazouni 2004 richard et al 2007 increased sedimentation of biodeposits under oyster cultures has been shown to increase the concentrations and fluxes of nh4 and no3 from sediments higgins et al 2013 as a result intensive oyster aquaculture may significantly change the isotopic signals of seawater on the one hand the enhanced nitrification produces depleted δ18o no3 signals 1 5 to 1 3 sigman et al 2009 buchwald et al 2012 driving most of the δ18o no3 values below the freshwater seawater mixing line fig 2e on the other hand oysters actively filter phytoplankton and re mineralize it into dissolved inorganic n which is quickly assimilated by phytoplankton to produce biomass the assimilation by phytoplankton and oysters in this cycling like other biological reactions discriminates between isotopes and generally favors the incorporation of the isotope with the lower mass kendall et al 2007 for example a large range of n fractionations 30 to 0 has been measured in both field studies cifuentes et al 1989 montoya et al 1991 and laboratory experiments on no3 and nh4 assimilation by algae pennock et al 1996 waser et al 2003 granger et al 2004 oysters may actually act as filters to retain 14n and leave behind 15n enriched seawater leading to δ15n no3 values slightly distributed above the mixing line fig 2d significant negative linear correlations were observed between δ18o no3 and ln no3 and between δ15n nh4 and ln nh4 at high salinity area figs 3e and f indicating that the presence of n removal processes kendall et al 2007 we postulated that the assimilation by phytoplankton was dominant at high salinity environments causing the sharp increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 figs 2d and e first chl a concentrations were negatively correlated with the nh4 r 0 60 p 0 01 and no3 r 0 54 p 0 001 concentrations indicating these nutrients were removed by phytoplankton in addition significant positive correlations were observed between δ15n pon and δ15n nh4 r 0 73 p 0 001 and between δ15n pon and δ15n no3 r 0 44 p 0 05 this also pointed to the assimilation effects of nh4 and no3 as the pon was mainly comprised of phytoplankton see discussion below no3 assimilation by marine phytoplankton generally causes 1 1 change in the δ15n and δ18o of no3 regardless of species or the magnitude of the isotope effect granger et al 2004 however the enrichment of δ18o no3 was obviously much higher than that of δ15n at high salinity fig 2d and e suggesting the isotopic compositions were not solely regulated by assimilation the co occurrence of assimilation nitrification and n2 fixation could be responsible for the increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the high salinity environments ye et al 2015 anacha et al 2018 but the relative importance of these effects remains unknown in this study 3 4 contribution of oyster aquaculture to pon nh4 and no3 in qinzhou bay as mixing largely controlled spatial patterns of no3 nh4 and tn in in low salinity areas fig 2 and fig 3 therefore it is possible to use different mixing models to estimate the oyster aquaculture to pon nh4 and no3 in these areas the salinity no3 and nh4 concentrations and isotopic values for the putative endmembers for pon nh4 and no3 in the study area are summarized in table 1 see isotopic composition of the putative endmembers in si for details differing from most other studies we analyzed the isotopic composition in most putative endmembers except seawater and phytoplankton instead of using values in the literature the δ15n pon and δ13c poc values in the oyster biodeposits were 21 1 5 1 and 20 5 1 5 table 1 respectively to our knowledge this is the first report of the isotopic composition in oyster biodeposits the biodeposits were more enriched in 15n than the other endmembers table 1 which is consistent with a previous report that animal waste can be 5 to 15 more enriched than their diets in 15n kreitler 1979 the δ15n pon and δ13c poc values in the suspended particles ranged from 5 7 to 13 4 and from 27 0 to 23 7 respectively table s1 the δ15n pon values were negatively correlated with salinity figure s2a while the δ13c poc values were positively correlated figure s2b as the riverine pon had a δ15n pon value of only 7 3 table 1 the high δ15n pon up to 13 4 around the river mouths may reflect an impact by the oyster biodeposits which were enriched in 15n plotting δ15n pon and δ13c poc against the c n ratio revealed the pon and poc was mainly comprised of phytoplankton and oyster biodeposits in the low salinity area fig 4 the decreasing δ15n pon along the salinity gradient may be due to an increasing contribution from marine phytoplankton which have less 15n than the biodeposits table 1 two endmember mixing model equation 1 was applied to calculate the oyster biodeposits contribution to pon in low salinity areas using oyster biodeposits and phytoplankton as two endmembers the lowest δ15n pon value 5 7 was assigned to the phytoplankton endmember which was similar to the mean δ15n level of 5 reported for marine phytoplankton in previous studies france 1995 fry 2006 our calculation indicated that the phytoplankton accounted for 68 8 8 8 of the pon with the remainder coming from the oyster biodeposits our results quantitatively demonstrate that the intensive oyster biodeposits comprised a significant portion of pon in qinzhou bay the linear correlation seen in fig 3c indicates that the mixing of two endmembers was the major process regulating the δ15n nh4 composition in the low salinity areas therefore two endmember mixing model equation 1 was also used to calculate the contribution of oyster culturing to nh4 pool the regression line has a y intercept of 20 and extends to a level of 0 indicating that one of the nh4 sources would be expected to have a δ15n nh4 level 20 while the other source would have a signal depleted in δ15n fig 3c as oyster biodeposits were the only endmember with a δ15n composition 20 21 1 and pon mineralization has little fractionation kendall et al 2007 wong et al 2018 we consider it likely the oyster biodeposits are the 15n enriched source the river water at the mouth with a δ15n nh4 value of 2 0 0 3 could act as the 15n depleted source by applying the two endmember mixing model it was estimated that 53 6 27 8 of the nh4 is from river discharge and that the remainder could be from the mineralization of oyster biodeposits previous studies suggested that the flux of nh4 from oyster reefs or aquaculture oyster rafts was estimated to be 0 01 0 06 g n m 2 d 1 srna and baggale 1976 higgins et al 2013 considering that the oyster growing area in the inner bay was approximately 30 km2 the nh4 generation rate by oysters was estimated to be 0 3 1 8 tons n d 1 assuming a riverine discharge of 1 7 107 m3 d 1 during high flow season bi et al 2014 and an nh4 concentration of 3 3 2 3 μmol l 1 table 1 the riverine input of nh4 was approximately 0 8 0 6 tons n d 1 that is riverine discharge of nh4 n appeared to be comparable with that released by oysters which agrees with our modeling calculations the mcmc isotope mixing model parnell et al 2010 was used to quantify the source contributions for no3 in the oyster growing low salinity areas the putative endmembers include river discharge groundwater and atmospheric precipitation table 1 the direct inputs from domestic sewage and effluents from the wwtps and shrimp ponds were excluded in our calculation because the annual no3 fluxes for these sources were negligible compared to that of the riverine inputs see endmembers 5 and 6 wwtps and domestic sewage and endmember 7 shrimp pond effluent in si for details we consider the nitrification in the bay to be an important source regulating the isotopic composition in qinzhou bay the nitrification process includes but is not limited to oxidation of the nh4 excreted by oysters as well as pon mineralization in the water column and sediment biodeposits the fractionation effect of 15n in the conversion from nh4 to no3 could be minor in this nh4 limited system mostly 2 μmol l 1 kendall et al 2007 wong et al 2018 we therefore assigned the mean for δ15n nh4 in the inner bay 8 6 to the nitrification endmember table 1 and a conservative uncertainty of 6 9 1 σ was applied our model calculation showed that riverine inputs dominated the no3 pool 74 5 9 1 which was followed by nitrification 20 6 8 4 fig 5 a these results indicate that nitrification was much less important than riverine input in other words the contribution of intensive oyster aquaculture to the no3 pool in qinzhou bay was much smaller than the river discharge groundwater and atmospheric precipitation only contributed a minor fraction to the no3 pool 3 6 2 4 and 1 4 1 0 respectively we suggest that the no3 in the groundwater was mainly from soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer and has undergone a denitrification process in these anaerobic environments see endmember 4 groundwater in si for details however it should be noted that the major no3 endmembers for the rivers included soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage wwtps and atmospheric precipitation see endmember 2 river water and endmembers 5 and 6 wwtps and domestic sewage in si for details the contributions of these endmembers to the no3 pool was 29 5 7 8 26 4 12 7 40 4 11 0 and 3 7 1 7 respectively therefore we calculated that 25 6 6 8 19 7 9 8 30 1 8 9 20 6 8 4 and 4 1 1 6 of the no3 was from soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage wwtps nitrification and atmospheric precipitation respectively fig 5b thus nitrification contributed a significant though not dominant amount to the no3 pool in qinzhou bay although the exact contribution of the enhanced nitrification by oysters remains unknown it could be significant 4 conclusions and implications overall having determined the key controls of the sources amounts and transformations of n in qinzhou bay we have quantitatively demonstrated the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture on the pelagic n cycling over a broad spatial scale mixing between freshwater and seawater is the major force regulating the nutrient no3 and nh4 spatial distribution and isotopic composition in the estuary pelagic denitrification was weak due to the high do concentrations in the water column the deviations of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from the mixing line indicate an additional source of no3 in the oyster growing areas the no3 may be enhanced by the dense presence of oysters generating large amounts of nh4 and biodeposits which comprised up to a half of the nh4 and one third of the pon in the water column respectively their mineralization and nitrification would add additional no3 to the estuarine environment causing the isotopic signals to deviate from the simple mixing line in contrast in the high salinity areas where oysters were absent and phytoplankton thrived the effects of assimilation by phytoplankton became dominant as reflected by the sharp increases in the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 our results indicated the dense oysters significantly influenced the pelagic n pool and cycling during summer this study adds an important dimension to the understanding of the impact of oyster aquaculture or reefs on n cycling in estuarine environments however it should be noted that this study was only a snapshot in the summer of 2019 the situations may be quite different in other seasons for example in winter when temperature is low the feeding activity and metabolism of oysters could be depressed newell and langdon 1996 cranford et al 2011 wall et al 2013 the oyster related nitrification may become weak adding less no3 to the water column meanwhile the effects of assimilation could be relatively more significant in the period when phytoplankton blooms the seasonal variations of the n cycling in the estuary deserve further study to fully understand the roles of oysters in regulating the pelagic n pools and transformations declaration of competing interest none

17498,to offset estuarine eutrophication interest is increasing in restoring oyster reefs and expanding oyster aquaculture however ecosystem scale evidence is lacking on oyster assemblages impacts on estuarine pelagic nitrogen n cycling using a multiple isotope approach and isotope mixing model we examined the sources transformations and influence of intensive oyster aquaculture on n pollution in a subtropical estuary the salinity dependent no3 and nh4 concentrations and their correlations with isotopic signals δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ15n nh4 indicated the nutrient spatial distribution in low salinity areas was largely regulated by mixing between freshwater and seawater however the intensive oyster aquaculture greatly increased nitrification in the estuary in high salinity areas where oyster assemblages were absent the assimilation of no3 by phytoplankton became dominant and sharply increased the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage and wastewater treatment plants were the major no3 sources in the estuary while internal nitrification contributed 20 6 to the no3 pool oyster biodeposits comprised up to one third of the particulate organic matter in the water column and as much as 47 3 of the nh4 pool could be from the oysters our study shows that oysters significantly contribute to the pelagic nutrient pools and n transformations adding an important dimension to our understanding of oyster assemblages impacts on estuarine n cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords nitrogen sources transformations isotope mixing model oyster 1 introduction nitrogen n pollution in estuaries has received particularly wide attention because it leads to algae blooms hypoxia fish kills and widespread ecological damage in these ecologically and economically important areas hagy et al 2004 howarth and marino 2006 bricker and devlin 2011 while many efforts have been made to reduce point sources of n interest is rising in oyster restoration efforts or increasing the scale of oyster aquaculture as a companion strategy to mitigate estuarine eutrophication fulford et al 2007 rose et al 2014 bricker et al 2018 several studies have indicated that oyster reefs can offset n pollution by transferring pelagic n to sediments as biodeposits enhancing sedimentary denitrification and removing n from the ecosystem via direct harvest newell et al 2005 cerco and noel 2007 carmichael et al 2012 oyster assemblages can influence the ammonification of organic n nitrification and denitrification in sediments newell et al 2005 kellogg et al 2013 these studies clearly demonstrate the positive roles of oysters in mitigating estuarine n pollution rose et al 2014 however the magnitude of oyster s impact on estuarine n pollution is associated not only with the benthic n processes smyth et al 2013 hoellein et al 2015 but also with the hydrologic processes controlling nutrient dispersion and n input from external sources in the estuary coen et al 2007 few studies have examined the impact of oysters on pelagic n transformations to date ecosystem scale understanding of oyster s contribution to estuarine n cycling is lacking forrest et al 2009 much remains to be learned about oysters contributions to the pelagic n pool and transformations at the estuary scale the multiple isotope approach has proven to be a useful means of studying n pollution kendall et al 2007 dual isotopes e g δ15n no3 δ18o no3 have been used to identify sources and mixing as well as for evaluating nutrient cycling in coastal ecosystems wong et al 2014 ye et al 2015 yu et al 2015 archana et al 2018 mixing of different sources or the presence of transformation processes n2 fixation assimilation nitrification and denitrification can reflect in changes of isotopic signals this technique could also be utilized as a tool for understanding how oysters might intervene in estuarine n cycling large scale of oyster populations could change the isotopic compositions of seawater if they are able to significantly contribute to the n pool or intensify n transformations in an estuary qinzhou bay in south china provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the influence of oysters on pelagic n cycling in an estuary this bay has a more than 350 year long history of culturing the oyster crassostrea hongkongensis and it is the largest oyster producing site in south china today qinzhou bay supports a well developed oyster industry and large scale oyster farming with around 10 of the bay surface occupied by oyster rafts and numerous bottom cultures growing underwater internet based data estimates of annual oyster production in qinzhou bay is currently at 270 000 tons with a marketing value of nearly 400 million usd per year this large oyster assemblage might exert some control over the water quality in the bay but the extent to which the oysters play a role remains unknown in this study we measured n concentrations and the isotopic compositions of the nutrients δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 in water samples collected from the bay and from potential n sources we also measured the isotopic compositions of particulate organic nitrogen δ15n pon and carbon δ13c poc in the suspended particulate matter and oyster biodeposits key questions addressed in this study included the following 1 what are the spatial distribution patterns of the nutrients in the water column and could the oysters affect these patterns 2 how does the oyster aquaculture in the bay affect pelagic n cycling 3 what are the sources of no3 nh4 and pon to qinzhou bay and how does this large oyster assemblage contribute to the n input it was expected that the multiple isotope approach would generate important clues for understanding these key biogeochemical processes and provide important implications of oyster s role in estuarine n cycling 2 materials and methods 2 1 field sampling descriptions of climate hydrodynamics and anthropogenic activities in the qinzhou bay are provided in supporting information si see brief descriptions of qinzhou bay a large scale sampling was performed in july 2019 this period was chosen because oyster filtration is generally maximized in the summer pomeroy et al 2007 and therefore the oysters should have their most significant influence on water quality at this time a total of 34 surface seawater samples were collected from the bay fig 1 b at a depth of 0 5 m in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles in situ water quality parameters i e ph salinity dissolved oxygen do water temperature and chlorophyll a chl a concentrations were recorded using calibrated probes ysi 600 during sampling the samples were immediately filtered through 0 7 µm whatman glass fiber membrane filters the suspended solids were collected for the δ15n pon and δ13c poc analyses and the filtered seawater was transported to the laboratory in a refrigerated box for the nitrate no3 nitrite no2 phosphate po4 3 ammonium nh4 δ15n nh4 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 analyses in addition an aliquot of unfiltered sample was used for a total nitrogen tn analysis river water groundwater atmospheric precipitation shrimp pond effluents oyster biodeposits domestic sewage and effluents from wastewater treatment plants wwtps were collected to evaluate their contributions to the n pollution in the bay the sampling locations for each source are shown in fig 1c longitudinal water samples were collected from the rivers flowing into the bay qin and the maoling river see si groundwater was collected from artificial wells precipitation samples were collected from july to october of 2019 using a measuring cylinder domestic sewage and effluents from three wwtps were collected from the inlets and outlets respectively to sample oyster biodeposits ten oysters c hongkongensis were collected from the bay and immediately transported back to laboratory the oysters allowed to defecate in a 20 l tank and the freshly released feces were sucked up by a dropper and collected on 0 7 µm whatman glass fiber membrane filters the feces were identified by their compact dark colored and line shape appearance 2 2 analytical procedures for nutrients and isotopic signals all chemical analyses were performed within two weeks of sample collection with the exception of the isotope analyses which were performed within 1 month the no2 no3 nh4 and po4 3 concentrations were determined by a flow injection analyzer fia using the spectrophotometric method apha 2005 total nitrogen was also determined with a fia after oxidation by alkaline potassium persulfate the uncertainties of the spectrophotometric analyses were within 3 the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the samples were measured by well established denitrifier method casciotti et al 2002 weigand et al 2016 no3 in the water samples was reduced to nitrous oxide n2o by denitrifying pseudomonas aureofaciens lacking n2o reductase activity the n2o was concentrated and purified before introduction into an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms to determine the isotopic composition international standards usgs 34 δ15n 1 8 0 2 and usgs 32 δ15n 18 1 were used to correct δ15n no3 data while δ18o no3 data were corrected using usgs 34 δ18o 27 9 0 6 and usgs 35 δ18o 57 5 0 6 isotope data are reported in parts per thousand relative to atmospheric air air and vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow the analytical uncertainties were 0 2 for the δ15n no3 and 0 3 for the δ18o no3 the δ15n nh4 determination was performed using the ammonia diffusion method holmes et al 1998 five liters of field filtered samples were transported to the lab in hdpe diffusion bottles meanwhile three control samples were prepared nh4 2so4 of known isotopic composition 2 37 0 03 was added to diffusion bottles containing millipore purified water to achieve an nh4 concentration similar to that expected in the samples ammonia traps sulfuric acid impregnated fiber disks sandwiched between two 2 5 cm diameter 10 μm pore size teflon membranes 200 g nacl and 15 g mgo were added to the diffusion bottles which were then incubated for 2 weeks at 40 c before the δ15n nh4 determination the fiber disks were dried in a desiccator with silica gel and concentrated sulfuric acid for the δ15n pon and δ13c poc determinations the suspended particle collections were carefully scraped from the filter membranes to remove the inorganic carbon the samples were acidified with 10 hydrochloric acid centrifuged and rinsed with purified water and lyophilized the sewage and oyster biodeposits samples were also lyophilized all solid samples fiber disks suspended particles sewage and oyster biodeposits were ground and put through a 100 mesh sieve the powdered samples were placed in 5 5 mm silver micro cups and introduced into an element analyzer ea irms to determine the δ15n and δ13c values which were reported relative to air and pee dee belemnite pdb respectively usgs 34 and usgs 32 were used to correct the δ15n data the reference standards for δ13c were usgs 64 δ13c 40 81 and usgs 66 δ13c 0 67 the average fractionation of the control samples was added to the observed δ15n nh4 values for the fiber disks to correct for fractionation during the diffusion procedure the analytical uncertainties were 0 2 for δ15n and 0 1 for δ13c 2 3 calculating different n source contributions the proportional contributions of the n sources were quantified by either an algebraic isotope mixing model when two endmembers are considered or by the r package stable isotope analysis in r parnell et al 2010 in which a markov chain monte carlo mcmc isotope mixing model is integrated when multiple endmembers are considered the algebraic isotope mixing model was defined as 1 δ 15 n m i x a δ 15 n 1 b δ 15 n 2 where δ15nmix is the isotopic ratio in a measured sample which is considered to result from a mixture of two endmember ratios δ15n1 and δ15n2 a and b are parameters representing the weighted contributions of the two endmembers a b 1 the mcmc mixing model determining the mixing of k sources with j isotopes was defined as 2 x ij k 1 k p k s j k c j k ε i j 3 s j k n μ j k ω j k 2 4 c j k n λ j k τ j k 2 and 5 ε j k n 0 σ j 2 where xij is isotope value j for water sample i p k refers to the contribution of source k sjk is the source value k for isotope j which has a mean value μjk and variance ω 2 jk cjk is the fractionation of isotope j on source k which has a mean value λjk and variance τjk 2 εij is the residual error and σj 2 is the residual variance this model has recently been widely applied in river studies worldwide e g xia et al 2017 li et al 2019 but has seldom been applied in estuarine environments 3 results and discussion 3 1 nitrogen pollution in qinzhou bay salinity do and chl a and nutrient concentrations in the 34 surface water samples are shown in table s1 surface seawater salinity in the bay increased from the river mouth to the bay margin fig 1b all do concentrations were above 5 0 mg l 1 indicating oxic conditions in the surface seawater the spatial distributions of chl a no3 nh4 and tn are shown in figures s1a d the spatial pattern of chl a and no3 appeared to be related to the oyster distribution a low chl a area coincided with the dense distribution of oyster rafts in the middle of the bay figs 1c and figure s1a possibly reflecting the efficient removal of phytoplankton by oyster filtration no3 concentrations were elevated at the river mouths and at areas where oysters were distributed fig 1c and figures s1b two wwtps located downstream of the qin river may be responsible for the high no3 concentrations in the northeastern part of the bay fig 1c except for the areas around a hotspot nh4 concentrations were generally below 5 µmol l 1 across the bay figure s1c even in the intensive oyster growing areas however the nh4 concentrations decreased sharply moving away from the point source suggesting the nh4 has a short residence time due either to hydraulic flushing or assimilation by phytoplankton table s2 lists some values reported for no3 and nh4 in estuaries around the world although a strict statistical comparison is impossible qinzhou bay appeared to have no3 and nh4 concentrations comparable to those of most human impacted estuaries e g chesapeake bay and san francisco bay estuary deutsch et al 2007 used the equation n no3 16 po4 3 2 9 μmol l 1 to evaluate deviations from the redfield ratio in seawater positive n values suggest excess no3 from n2 fixation and nitrification or additional sources and negative n suggest denitrification or assimilation no3 removal processes in this study 32 of the 34 samples had positive n values of which 22 were 10 therefore qinzhou bay had excessive no3 but low chl a during the sampling period which was possibly due to the suppressive role of oysters on phytoplankton growth newell and langdon 1996 newell et al 2005 but this speculation needs a more experimental setting to testify e g nutrient addition experiments or mesocosm studies 3 2 isotopic characteristics of the surface seawater and their relation to salinity the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 δ15n nh4 δ15n pon and δ13c poc values are shown in table s1 the spatial variation in the isotopic values is shown in figures s1e i the δ15n no3 δ18o no3 and δ15n nh4 values were low in the inner bay and gradually increased moving southward figures s1e g in contrast the δ15n pon values were higher in the inner bay figure s1h together with the isotopic values the no3 nh4 and tn concentrations were plotted against salinity a conservative tracer of estuarine water mixing to identify additional local sources or cycling fig 2 good correlations were found between the nutrient concentrations and salinity figs 2a c suggesting that physical mixing largely controlled the spatial patterns of no3 nh4 and tn in qinzhou bay notably some data points clearly fell beyond the freshwater seawater mixing line on the nh4 salinity plot fig 2b this suggested the presence of other endmembers for nh4 which was supported by the salinity dependent δ15n nh4 figs 2f plotting δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 against salinity revealed contrasting n cycling patterns between the low 20 psu and high salinity 20 psu areas figs 2d and e similar isotopic values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 suggests the low salinity area 0 20 psu is mainly dominated by conservative mixing this area begins at the two river mouths and extends to the middle of the outer bay covering a large portion of the bay and a majority of the oyster growing area fig 1c however we noticed the dual isotopic values did not strictly follow the theoretical mixing lines figs 2d and e for the areas with salinities 20 psu the data fell above the mixing line for δ15n no3 and below the line for δ18o no3 suggesting other endmembers may exist besides the river and seawater endmembers and or the presence of non conservative behavior for the areas with salinities 20 psu both δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 increased with the salinity gradient and the isotopic signals clearly deviated from conservative mixing figs 2d and e the presence of transformation processes such as n2 fixation assimilation nitrification and denitrification may be responsible for this strong deviation see discussion below 3 3 the impacts of oyster culturing on n transformations a keeling plot δ15n versus 1 no3 or 1 nh4 are used to distinguish mixing and biological n removal processes such as assimilation and denitrification kendall et al 2007 simple mixing between two sources yields a linear negative correlation between δ15n and 1 n on a keeling plot whereas biological removal processes result in progressively increasing δ15n values as n concentration decreases yielding a curved correlation furthermore n removal can be also identified by a straight line when the isotopes are plotted against ln n fig 3 shows the keeling plot for the low and high salinity areas salinities 20 and 20 psu respectively in terms of the δ15n and 1 n relationship a significant linear correlation was only found between δ15n nh4 and 1 nh4 at low salinity which is characteristic of simple mixing between two endmembers however no relationship was found between δ15n no3 and 1 no3 or between δ18o no3 and 1 no3 neither was a negative linear correlation observed at low salinity for the plots between δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 versus ln no3 these results suggest that at low salinity areas where oysters were growing the pelagic assimilation or denitrification of no3 was not prevailing and there were multiple sources of no3 oysters can effectively filter phytoplankton in the water column which could be the major reason for the lack of assimilation effects in the low salinity environments studies have indicated that oyster biodeposits add organic n to the sediment and facilitate sedimentary denitrification in estuarine environments newell et al 2002 higgins et al 2013 hoellein et al 2015 meanwhile several studies suggested that oysters can facilitate denitrification by providing a habitat for denitrifying microbes caffrey et al 2016 arfken et al 2017 however the effects of denitrification in the water column appeared weak in our study suggesting the oyster aquaculture may not be significantly helpful to enhance pelagic denitrification in this bay the do concentrations were above 5 mg l 1 in the surface seawater table s1 a scenario that does not favor denitrification kendall et al 2007 we postulated the vast majority of the facilitated denitrification should occur in the sediments as suggested by many studies e g newell et al 2002 higgins et al 2013 the absence of strong pelagic denitrification in our study may be due to the decoupling of sedimentary and pelagic processes despite the weak pelagic denitrification the intensive oyster aquaculture may greatly increase nitrification in the bay first oysters can release large amounts of ammonia into seawater e g in one study oysters contributed 37 of the total nh4 flux from the sediment to the water column boucher and boucher rodoni 1998 the nh4 released by oysters provides abundant nh4 for pelagic nitrification dame 2011 and this may be why the nh4 concentrations deviated from the theoretical mixing line fig 2b second oysters can also contribute to the no3 pool via the mineralization of suspended and sedimented biodeposits mazouni 2004 richard et al 2007 increased sedimentation of biodeposits under oyster cultures has been shown to increase the concentrations and fluxes of nh4 and no3 from sediments higgins et al 2013 as a result intensive oyster aquaculture may significantly change the isotopic signals of seawater on the one hand the enhanced nitrification produces depleted δ18o no3 signals 1 5 to 1 3 sigman et al 2009 buchwald et al 2012 driving most of the δ18o no3 values below the freshwater seawater mixing line fig 2e on the other hand oysters actively filter phytoplankton and re mineralize it into dissolved inorganic n which is quickly assimilated by phytoplankton to produce biomass the assimilation by phytoplankton and oysters in this cycling like other biological reactions discriminates between isotopes and generally favors the incorporation of the isotope with the lower mass kendall et al 2007 for example a large range of n fractionations 30 to 0 has been measured in both field studies cifuentes et al 1989 montoya et al 1991 and laboratory experiments on no3 and nh4 assimilation by algae pennock et al 1996 waser et al 2003 granger et al 2004 oysters may actually act as filters to retain 14n and leave behind 15n enriched seawater leading to δ15n no3 values slightly distributed above the mixing line fig 2d significant negative linear correlations were observed between δ18o no3 and ln no3 and between δ15n nh4 and ln nh4 at high salinity area figs 3e and f indicating that the presence of n removal processes kendall et al 2007 we postulated that the assimilation by phytoplankton was dominant at high salinity environments causing the sharp increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 figs 2d and e first chl a concentrations were negatively correlated with the nh4 r 0 60 p 0 01 and no3 r 0 54 p 0 001 concentrations indicating these nutrients were removed by phytoplankton in addition significant positive correlations were observed between δ15n pon and δ15n nh4 r 0 73 p 0 001 and between δ15n pon and δ15n no3 r 0 44 p 0 05 this also pointed to the assimilation effects of nh4 and no3 as the pon was mainly comprised of phytoplankton see discussion below no3 assimilation by marine phytoplankton generally causes 1 1 change in the δ15n and δ18o of no3 regardless of species or the magnitude of the isotope effect granger et al 2004 however the enrichment of δ18o no3 was obviously much higher than that of δ15n at high salinity fig 2d and e suggesting the isotopic compositions were not solely regulated by assimilation the co occurrence of assimilation nitrification and n2 fixation could be responsible for the increase of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the high salinity environments ye et al 2015 anacha et al 2018 but the relative importance of these effects remains unknown in this study 3 4 contribution of oyster aquaculture to pon nh4 and no3 in qinzhou bay as mixing largely controlled spatial patterns of no3 nh4 and tn in in low salinity areas fig 2 and fig 3 therefore it is possible to use different mixing models to estimate the oyster aquaculture to pon nh4 and no3 in these areas the salinity no3 and nh4 concentrations and isotopic values for the putative endmembers for pon nh4 and no3 in the study area are summarized in table 1 see isotopic composition of the putative endmembers in si for details differing from most other studies we analyzed the isotopic composition in most putative endmembers except seawater and phytoplankton instead of using values in the literature the δ15n pon and δ13c poc values in the oyster biodeposits were 21 1 5 1 and 20 5 1 5 table 1 respectively to our knowledge this is the first report of the isotopic composition in oyster biodeposits the biodeposits were more enriched in 15n than the other endmembers table 1 which is consistent with a previous report that animal waste can be 5 to 15 more enriched than their diets in 15n kreitler 1979 the δ15n pon and δ13c poc values in the suspended particles ranged from 5 7 to 13 4 and from 27 0 to 23 7 respectively table s1 the δ15n pon values were negatively correlated with salinity figure s2a while the δ13c poc values were positively correlated figure s2b as the riverine pon had a δ15n pon value of only 7 3 table 1 the high δ15n pon up to 13 4 around the river mouths may reflect an impact by the oyster biodeposits which were enriched in 15n plotting δ15n pon and δ13c poc against the c n ratio revealed the pon and poc was mainly comprised of phytoplankton and oyster biodeposits in the low salinity area fig 4 the decreasing δ15n pon along the salinity gradient may be due to an increasing contribution from marine phytoplankton which have less 15n than the biodeposits table 1 two endmember mixing model equation 1 was applied to calculate the oyster biodeposits contribution to pon in low salinity areas using oyster biodeposits and phytoplankton as two endmembers the lowest δ15n pon value 5 7 was assigned to the phytoplankton endmember which was similar to the mean δ15n level of 5 reported for marine phytoplankton in previous studies france 1995 fry 2006 our calculation indicated that the phytoplankton accounted for 68 8 8 8 of the pon with the remainder coming from the oyster biodeposits our results quantitatively demonstrate that the intensive oyster biodeposits comprised a significant portion of pon in qinzhou bay the linear correlation seen in fig 3c indicates that the mixing of two endmembers was the major process regulating the δ15n nh4 composition in the low salinity areas therefore two endmember mixing model equation 1 was also used to calculate the contribution of oyster culturing to nh4 pool the regression line has a y intercept of 20 and extends to a level of 0 indicating that one of the nh4 sources would be expected to have a δ15n nh4 level 20 while the other source would have a signal depleted in δ15n fig 3c as oyster biodeposits were the only endmember with a δ15n composition 20 21 1 and pon mineralization has little fractionation kendall et al 2007 wong et al 2018 we consider it likely the oyster biodeposits are the 15n enriched source the river water at the mouth with a δ15n nh4 value of 2 0 0 3 could act as the 15n depleted source by applying the two endmember mixing model it was estimated that 53 6 27 8 of the nh4 is from river discharge and that the remainder could be from the mineralization of oyster biodeposits previous studies suggested that the flux of nh4 from oyster reefs or aquaculture oyster rafts was estimated to be 0 01 0 06 g n m 2 d 1 srna and baggale 1976 higgins et al 2013 considering that the oyster growing area in the inner bay was approximately 30 km2 the nh4 generation rate by oysters was estimated to be 0 3 1 8 tons n d 1 assuming a riverine discharge of 1 7 107 m3 d 1 during high flow season bi et al 2014 and an nh4 concentration of 3 3 2 3 μmol l 1 table 1 the riverine input of nh4 was approximately 0 8 0 6 tons n d 1 that is riverine discharge of nh4 n appeared to be comparable with that released by oysters which agrees with our modeling calculations the mcmc isotope mixing model parnell et al 2010 was used to quantify the source contributions for no3 in the oyster growing low salinity areas the putative endmembers include river discharge groundwater and atmospheric precipitation table 1 the direct inputs from domestic sewage and effluents from the wwtps and shrimp ponds were excluded in our calculation because the annual no3 fluxes for these sources were negligible compared to that of the riverine inputs see endmembers 5 and 6 wwtps and domestic sewage and endmember 7 shrimp pond effluent in si for details we consider the nitrification in the bay to be an important source regulating the isotopic composition in qinzhou bay the nitrification process includes but is not limited to oxidation of the nh4 excreted by oysters as well as pon mineralization in the water column and sediment biodeposits the fractionation effect of 15n in the conversion from nh4 to no3 could be minor in this nh4 limited system mostly 2 μmol l 1 kendall et al 2007 wong et al 2018 we therefore assigned the mean for δ15n nh4 in the inner bay 8 6 to the nitrification endmember table 1 and a conservative uncertainty of 6 9 1 σ was applied our model calculation showed that riverine inputs dominated the no3 pool 74 5 9 1 which was followed by nitrification 20 6 8 4 fig 5 a these results indicate that nitrification was much less important than riverine input in other words the contribution of intensive oyster aquaculture to the no3 pool in qinzhou bay was much smaller than the river discharge groundwater and atmospheric precipitation only contributed a minor fraction to the no3 pool 3 6 2 4 and 1 4 1 0 respectively we suggest that the no3 in the groundwater was mainly from soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer and has undergone a denitrification process in these anaerobic environments see endmember 4 groundwater in si for details however it should be noted that the major no3 endmembers for the rivers included soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage wwtps and atmospheric precipitation see endmember 2 river water and endmembers 5 and 6 wwtps and domestic sewage in si for details the contributions of these endmembers to the no3 pool was 29 5 7 8 26 4 12 7 40 4 11 0 and 3 7 1 7 respectively therefore we calculated that 25 6 6 8 19 7 9 8 30 1 8 9 20 6 8 4 and 4 1 1 6 of the no3 was from soil organic nitrogen and fertilizer domestic sewage wwtps nitrification and atmospheric precipitation respectively fig 5b thus nitrification contributed a significant though not dominant amount to the no3 pool in qinzhou bay although the exact contribution of the enhanced nitrification by oysters remains unknown it could be significant 4 conclusions and implications overall having determined the key controls of the sources amounts and transformations of n in qinzhou bay we have quantitatively demonstrated the impact of intensive oyster aquaculture on the pelagic n cycling over a broad spatial scale mixing between freshwater and seawater is the major force regulating the nutrient no3 and nh4 spatial distribution and isotopic composition in the estuary pelagic denitrification was weak due to the high do concentrations in the water column the deviations of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from the mixing line indicate an additional source of no3 in the oyster growing areas the no3 may be enhanced by the dense presence of oysters generating large amounts of nh4 and biodeposits which comprised up to a half of the nh4 and one third of the pon in the water column respectively their mineralization and nitrification would add additional no3 to the estuarine environment causing the isotopic signals to deviate from the simple mixing line in contrast in the high salinity areas where oysters were absent and phytoplankton thrived the effects of assimilation by phytoplankton became dominant as reflected by the sharp increases in the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 our results indicated the dense oysters significantly influenced the pelagic n pool and cycling during summer this study adds an important dimension to the understanding of the impact of oyster aquaculture or reefs on n cycling in estuarine environments however it should be noted that this study was only a snapshot in the summer of 2019 the situations may be quite different in other seasons for example in winter when temperature is low the feeding activity and metabolism of oysters could be depressed newell and langdon 1996 cranford et al 2011 wall et al 2013 the oyster related nitrification may become weak adding less no3 to the water column meanwhile the effects of assimilation could be relatively more significant in the period when phytoplankton blooms the seasonal variations of the n cycling in the estuary deserve further study to fully understand the roles of oysters in regulating the pelagic n pools and transformations declaration of competing interest none

17499,in this study we newly investigated surface water samples collected in two contrasting korean estuary systems i e closed geum and open seomjin estuaries along a salinity gradient in winter december in 2016 the main objectives were to determine the source of particulate organic carbon poc in winter and to assess the environmental factors inducing seasonal differences in poc characteristics concentrations and dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c of poc were analyzed together with concentrations and stable carbon isotopes δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and compared with those obtained in summer august in 2016 our study provided a new insight that for both estuarine systems the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics was associated with stronger wind induced

contrast the seomjin estuary was an open estuary without a dam a previous study of the geum and seomjin rivers showed that the catchment area normalized fluxes of poc were 4 0 10 4 tc km 2 yr 1 in the geum river and 5 2 10 4 tc km 2 yr 1 in the seomjin river between may 2016 and may 2018 kang et al 2019 the poc flux was more weakly associated with the water discharge in the geum river than in the seomjin river indicating that the estuary dam of the geum river influenced the poc fluxes into the estuary by modifying the water residence times through an artificial drainage control in the reservoir higher δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc values in the surface water samples collected along a salinity gradient in the geum estuary than those in the seomjin estuary in august 2016 indicated that phytoplankton derived poc was the main contributor to the total poc pool in the reservoir of the geum estuary due to an enhanced phytoplankton bloom associate with an increase in water residence time by the estuary dam whereas terrestrial derived poc was predominantly transported by the seomjin river kang et al 2020 accordingly the estuary dam of the geum river altered the source and reactivity of poc in the reservoir in summer which could have been exported to the adjacent estuary when the water gate was open however the seasonal contrast of poc characteristics along a salinity gradient has not been yet determined in either estuary system in this study we newly investigated surface water samples collected along a salinity gradient from the geum closed and seomjin open estuary systems in winter december in 2016 we analyzed the concentrations and dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c of poc together with the concentrations and stable carbon isotopes δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and compared them with those obtained in summer august in 2016 the main objectives of this study were to determine the source of poc in winter and thus to evaluate the environmental factors inducing the seasonal differences in poc characteristics in two contrasting korean estuary systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected along a salinity gradient

following their standard routines 2 4 conservative mixing model calculation the dic and poc concentrations and the isotope compositions of δ13cdic δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc resulting from a mix of

and the water masses were characterized by a temperature range of 4 9 9 7 c a salinity range of 0 3 35 0 psu a ph range of 6 5 9 7 and a turbidity range of 261 450 ntu figs 3 and 4 the surface water temperature in december 2016 on average 8 6 1 5 c was much lower than in august 2016 on average 30 9 1 1 c showing similar temperatures before and after the dam fig 4a however other water parameters i e salinity ph and total alkalinity were drastically changed before and after the dam in two sampling periods figs 4b d the turbidity in december 2016 on average 436 16 ntu was much higher than in august 2016 on average 48 18 ntu showing a similar before and after the dam fig 4e in general the tsm concentrations were lower before the dam than after the dam showing similar ranges in summer and winter fig 4f the dic concentrations 11 1 27 1 mgc l 1 in august 2016 and 17 2 28 2 mgc l 1 in december 2016 were also lower before the dam than after the dam for both sampling periods but with higher concentrations in the reservoir in winter than in summer fig 5 a in contrast the poc concentrations in december 2016 0 3 2 7 mgc l 1 were slightly higher before the dam than after the dam showing a smaller contrast compared to that in summer fig 5b the δ13cdic values were lower before the dam than after the dam for both sampling periods ranging from 12 0 to 0 3 fig 6 a the δ13cpoc values in december 2016 were between 32 5 and 25 3 showing different trends along the salinity gradient for two sampling periods fig 6b the δ14cpoc values in december 2016 351 0 to 87 0 showed a larger difference between before and after the dam compared to that in august 2016 fig 6c 3 2 seomjin estuary the average wind speed of previous 14 days at the time of sampling was higher in december 2016

water temperature showed a decreasing trend in august 2016 but an increasing trend in december 2016 with the much lower average value of 9 9 2 3 c in december 2016 fig 4a however other water parameters i e salinity ph and total alkalinity showed the same trends for both sampling periods figs 4c and d the turbidity and the tsm concentration showed a gradual increase toward the sea sites in both sampling periods figs 4d and e but the turbidity showed a larger difference between august 2016 on average 52 28 ntu and december 2016 on average 283 140 ntu the dic concentration also showed an increasing trend toward the sea sites having a similar range of 9 9 to 27 1 mgc l 1 in august 2016 and 9 7 to 27 2 mgc l 1 in december 2016 fig 5a in contrast the poc concentrations did not reveal a clear trend with the lower average concentration of 0 4 0 1 mgc l 1 in december 2016 than in august 2016 fig 5b the δ13cdic values increased toward the sea sites for both sampling periods ranging from 12 7 to 0 fig 6a in december 2016 neither δ13cpoc nor δ14cpoc showed a clear trend with generally lower values 29 0 to 26 6 and 302 2 to 187 3 respectively than those in august 2016 figs 6 b and c 4 discussion 4 1 riverine poc sources at the geum river sites gr1 and gr2 the poc concentrations were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b in a natural river system the poc concentration associated with soil erosion is commonly related to the tsm concentration which is strongly controlled by hydrodynamic processes e g wood 1977 beusen et al 2005 bouchez et al 2011 guo et al 2015 wu et al 2018 at gr1 and gr2 the tsm concentrations were slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 4f which is consistent with the higher water discharge in august 2016 compared with december 2016 fig 2a thus it appears that the input of soil derived poc into the geum river was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 notably the poc concentration was lower at gr2 than at gr1 in august 2016 whereas both sites showed similar poc concentrations in december 2016 fig 5b the poc concentration at gr2 was also much lower than the modeled value in august 2016 this suggests that in addition to the soil derived poc supply an additional input from other poc sources might have contributed to the total riverine poc pool indeed a previous study at gr1 showed that a heavy riverine algae bloom occurred in the geum river in august 2016 kang et al 2019 hence it appears that the contribution of phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher at gr1 than at gr2 in august 2016 associated with the estuary dam which altered the natural land sea continuum kang et al 2020 at the seomjin river site sjr1 the poc concentration was also higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b although the tsm concentrations and water discharges were similar in both seasons figs 2b and 4f this might be due to a higher contribution of plant derived poc to the tsm pool in august 2016 than in december 2016 whereas the variation in soil derived poc was minor in both seasons the δ13cpoc values at gr1 and gr2 were higher in august 2016 22 9 to 19 4 than in december 2016 32 5 to 28 7 fig 6b the fact that the δ13cpoc values were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 appears to be associated with the higher contribution of autochthonous poc due to increased primary phytoplankton production kang et al 2019 2020 in contrast the lower δ13cpoc values in december 2016 are comparable with the signatures of the terrestrial c3 plants which use the calvin pathway of carbon fixation with δ13c values of average 28 in the range of 32 to 24 e g peterson and fry 1987 meyers 1997 marwick et al 2015 indeed c3 plants such as phragmites spp salix spp and rubus parvifolius are dominant in the geum river watershed in spring and summer s lee et al 2018 thus lower δ13cpoc values of winter samples suggest that influence of c3 plant debris inputs to the total poc pool was stronger in winter in the absence of a phytoplankton bloom notably the δ13cpoc values at gr2 for both seasons were lower than those at gr1 as well as the modeled values fig 6b this seems to be associated with higher contributions of phytoplankton derived poc with enriched δ13cpoc values to the total poc pool at gr1 than gr2 in both seasons at sjr1 the δ13cpoc value was lower in august 2016 29 1 than in december 2016 26 6 fig 6b considering the fact that the poc concentration in august 2016 was higher than in december 2016 see fig 5b with similar tsm concentrations and water discharges fig 2b as mentioned above the lower δ13cpoc value in august 2016 as compared with that in december 2016 seems to be due to the higher contribution of fresher plant derived poc to the total poc pool whereas the soil derived poc contributions were similar in both seasons in fact the δ13cpoc value in august 2016 was in the range of the signatures of the common c3 reed phragmites australis 27 to 29 which is dominant in the seomjin river in spring and summer min and je 2002 choi et al 2005 kang et al 2020 hence it seems that the contribution of c3 plants to the total poc pool in the seomjin river was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 evidence supporting the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above can be found in the δ13c characteristics of dic which play a critical role in the primary productivity as a source of bioavailable carbon for aquatic plant photosynthesis e g sand jensen et al 1992 maberly and madsen 2002 in general the δ13c value of phytoplankton depends on the aquatic δ13cdic and subsequent carbon isotope fractionation on average 21 during the assimilation process e g chanton and lewis 1999 guo et al 2015 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 at gr1 and gr2 the calculated δ13c values of phytoplankton based on the measured δ13cdic and carbon isotope fractionation 21 values cf guo et al 2015 were 30 2 and 33 0 in august 2016 and 29 3 and 29 7 in december 2016 respectively thus this was within the range 23 to 32 of the typical freshwater phytoplankton observed in the various aquatic systems e g bade et al 2006 chanton and lewis 1999 finlay and kendall 2007 however the measured δ13cpoc at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 22 9 and 19 4 respectively see fig 6 was much higher than the calculated δ13c of phytoplankton whereas the measured δ13cpoc values in december 2016 28 7 and 32 5 respectively see fig 6 was similar or slightly depleted compared with the calculated values interestingly the 13c values of phytoplankton can be enriched during the assimilation owing to an increase in water temperature and shift in carbon source from dissolved co2 to hco3 when dissolved co2 is exhausted due to a heavy phytoplankton bloom particularly when the chlorophyta and cyanophyta are dominant this is because the δ13c of hco3 is higher than that of co2 and the chlorophyta and cyanophyta can directly use hco3 wang et al 2013 and references therein although there is no direct information regarding phytoplankton assemblages at our study sites chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae are dominant in the middle reaches of the geum river in summer han et al 2016 thus it seems that the phytoplankton bloom observed at gr1 during the sampling campaign in august 2016 kang et al 2019 2020 could also be linked to the occurrence of chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae which might have caused a shift from dissolved co2 to hco3 in the dic pool at gr1 and gr2 accordingly the higher measured δ13cpoc values as compared with the calculated values at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 were associated with the enhanced contribution of 13c enriched phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool furthermore the lower dic concentrations on average 12 0 1 2 mgc l 1 at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 than those on average 17 6 0 6 mgc l 1 in december 2016 see fig 5a were supportive of the phytoplankton bloom in summer as the in situ photosynthesis would result in a decrease in the dic concentration through the consumption of dissolved co2 e g samanta et al 2015 bhavya et al 2018 in contrast the seasonal differences in dic concentration at sjr1 were minor suggesting the negligible influence of the in situ photosynthesis on dic concentration for the two sampling periods see fig 5a another piece of evidence supporting the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above can be found in the δ14cpoc characteristics which have been commonly used to constrain the source of poc e g raymond and bauer 2001 wu et al 2018 riverine δ14cpoc values depend on the mean time elapsed because of biosynthesis and the integrated effect of transport or deposition of poc in the watershed e g raymond and bauer 2001 hilton et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 recently fixed terrestrial plants have a high δ14c value of 40 to 200 consistent with the δ14c of atmospheric co2 e g marwick et al 2015 wu et al 2018 whereas ancient oc from bedrock weathering and fossil fuels has a δ14c value of 1000 e g marwick et al 2015 xue et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and the δ14c of soil derived oc has a wide range between that of ancient oc and that of modern biomass derived oc marwick et al 2015 because phytoplankton uses dic as a carbon source the δ14c of riverine phytoplankton depends on the δ14c of dic in water mortazavi and chanton 2004 zigah et al 2012 tao et al 2018 the global mean riverine δ14cdic value was 2 although the riverine δ14cdic can be much lower e g 164 to 125 in the yellow river and 137 to 164 in the changjiang river marwick et al 2015 wang et al 2016 tao et al 2018 the δ14cpoc values at gr1 and gr2 were higher in august 2016 81 7 to 51 1 than in december 2016 101 8 to 87 0 fig 6c moreover the δ14cpoc values were lower at sjr1 on average 187 8 0 7 than at gr1 and gr2 in both seasons fig 6c to the best of our knowledge the δ14c values of soil oc in the geum and seomjin watersheds have not yet been reported however the δ14cpoc value observed in the seomjin river was slightly higher than the δ14c values of soil oc from the yellow river basin 510 to 174 and the changjiang river basin 306 to 246 xue et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and thus from the changjiang river 436 to 103 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2018 and the yellow river 635 to 243 wang et al 2012 tao et al 2018 note that the input of soil derived oc is higher in the yellow river than in the changjiang river resulting in lower δ14cpoc values wang et al 2012 accordingly the δ14cpoc values at the geum river sites indicate that the contribution of phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 while a higher input of plant debris decreased the δ14cpoc values in december 2016 in contrast for both seasons the soil derived oc was the dominant source at the seomjin river site 4 2 poc sources within the estuarine region in general the poc in the estuary results from the mixing of several oc sources including riverine i e soils plants and freshwater phytoplankton detritus and in situ phytoplankton bianchi and bauer 2011 and references therein after the dam in the geum estuary system gr3 to gr6 the poc concentrations were slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b notably the tsm concentration at gr3 was much higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 whereas those of other sites were similar for both seasons fig 4f considering that the water discharge was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 2a it seems that the gr3 site located just after the estuary dam was more strongly influenced by the input of the riverine derived poc than the other estuary sites it is also worthwhile to note that the measured poc concentrations were higher than the modeled ones fig 5b this suggests that in addition to the terrestrial and in situ poc sources an additional source appears to contribute to the total poc pool in the estuarine region in the seomjin estuarine region sjr2 to sjr5 the poc concentrations were also higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b whereas the tsm concentrations and the water discharges were similar for both seasons figs 2b and 4f notably the measured poc concentrations were in general higher than the modeled values in the mixing zone fig 5b this suggests that besides the riverine and in situ poc sources an additional poc source contributed to the total poc pool in the seomjin estuarine region similar to the case in the geum estuarine region in the geum estuarine region gr3 to gr6 δ13cpoc was higher in august 2016 22 4 1 5 than in december 2016 27 2 2 4 fig 6b similarly in the seomjin estuarine region sjr2 to sjr5 δ13cpoc was higher in august 2016 22 0 0 8 than in december 2016 27 2 1 2 fig 6b marine phytoplankton has a δ13cpoc range of 17 to 24 e g chanton and lewis 1999 lamb et al 2006 kim et al 2019 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 which is higher than that of terrestrial derived poc e g peterson and fry 1987 meyers 1997 marwick et al 2015 hence our results suggest that in both estuarine systems the contributions of in situ phytoplankton derived poc were generally higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 it is worthwhile to note that in natural estuaries an increasing δ13cpoc trend toward the marine sites was observed due to mixing between 13c depleted terrestrial and 13c enriched marine poc sources wu et al 2013 guo et al 2015 in the geum estuarine region such an increasing trend was not observed in august 2016 fig 6b owing to the high δ13cpoc signature associated with the increased freshwater phytoplankton production before the estuary dam as discussed in section 4 1 in contrast an increasing δ13cpoc trend was observed in december 2016 fig 6b however the δ13cpoc of gr3 was much lower than the modeled value but similar to that of gr2 located just before the estuary dam indicating a strong influence by the gr2 signature at gr3 in the seomjin estuarine region δ13cpoc increased toward the marine sites in august 2016 fig 6b however such a trend was not observed in december 2016 with similar δ13cpoc values along the estuary gradient which indicates that the riverine derived poc was dominant in the total poc pool nonetheless the δ13cpoc value was lower at sjr2 than at other sites suggesting an additional source besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc another piece of evidence supporting the enhanced in situ phytoplankton derived poc contribution in august 2016 over that in december 2016 as discussed above can be found in the dic signatures the δ13cdic value in seawater is higher than that of the riverine dic 12 to 15 ranging from 0 to 2 4 e g chanton and lewis 1999 campeau et al 2017 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 in natural estuary systems similar to the case of δ13cpoc an increasing δ13cdic trend 15 to 2 4 was observed e g chanton and lewis 1999 kaldy et al 2005 bhavya et al 2018 he and xu 2017 in both estuarine regions δ13cdic was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 showing an increasing trend toward the marine sites fig 6a thus the calculated δ13c of phytoplankton cf guo et al 2015 was slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 with values of 21 4 0 6 and 22 8 0 in the geum estuarine region respectively and 22 5 1 8 and 23 5 2 0 in the seomjin estuarine region respectively thus the δ13cdic signatures are consistent with the measured δ13cpoc suggesting that the contribution of in situ phytoplankton derived poc was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 in both estuarine regions the δ14cpoc characteristics in both estuarine regions also exhibited seasonal differences showing higher values in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 6c this is in good agreement with the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above indicating that the contribution of in situ phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 in both estuarine regions notably in august 2016 the measured δ14cpoc values were slightly lower than the modeled values in the geum estuarine region whereas they were slightly higher in the seomjin estuarine region see also fig 6c this suggests that a contribution of fresher poc to the total poc pool was larger in the mixing zone of the seomjin estuary as previously suggested by kang et al 2020 in contrast in december 2016 the measured δ14cpoc values were generally lower than the modeled values in both estuarine regions they were also lower than the global median signature of 230 in the estuaries marwick et al 2015 this suggests that besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool 4 3 environmental factors influencing poc sources as can be seen in figs 3 and 4 water parameters such as salinity showed an abrupt change from before the dam to after the dam in the geum estuary system for the two sampling periods whereas a gradual change was observed in the seomjin estuary system for both seasons hence it is evident that the geum estuary dam regulated the salinity diffusion to the upstream region cho et al 2016 consequently the upstream of the estuary dam was converted into a lacustrine system jeong et al 2014 yang 2014 promoting a phytoplankton bloom in august 2016 as discussed in section 4 1 see figs 5 and 6 it seems that the phytoplankton bloom caused a ph increase see fig 4c owing to the fixation of co2 by the phytoplankton verspagen et al 2014 which converted the dic pool into an hco3 dominant one wang et al 2013 and their referencein a shift in the carbon source from dissolved co2 to hco3 could have promoted a chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae bloom increasing the δ13cpoc values in august 2016 see fig 6b accordingly it appears that the geum estuary dam plays an important role in altering the characteristics of poc transferred to the estuarine region the oc degradation increases the dic concentration and decreases δ13cdic because of the selective loss of 13c enriched labile carbohydrate and amino acids fractions e g bellanger et al 2004 thus the deviation of the measured dic concentration or δ13cdic from the modeled values can represent an input or removal of carbon within a system e g loder and reichard 1981 he and xu 2017 oliveira et al 2017 the differences between the measured and modeled values of the dic concentration and δ13cdic were illustrated as a scatter plot in fig 7 a in general the small deviations from zero of δ dic and δ δ13cdic suggested that the oc degradation was less important at most of the sites in both the geum and somjin estuary systems in august and december 2016 however the sample at gr2 collected in august 2016 was separately plotted from others in the right lower quadrant suggesting the occurrence of the oc degradation at this site the degradable oc at gr2 might be supplied from gr1 where a heavy phytoplankton bloom occurred in august 2016 kang et al 2019 2020 the δ poc and δ δ13cpoc values of the sample at gr2 collected in august 2016 were also separately plotted in the lower left quadrant fig 7b supporting the removal of oc by degradation accordingly it appears that the oc degradation at gr2 was promoted owing to the longer residence time of oc in the geum reservoir associated with the estuary dam interestingly the δ δ13cpoc and δ δ14cpoc of the samples collected in both the geum and seomjin estuarine regions in december 2016 were mostly negatively plotted figs 7b and c furthermore for both the geum and seomjin estuarine regions the relatively modern poc estimated using a simple binary mixing model between the fossil and recently fixed modern terrestrial riverine estuarine and marine poc cf kang et al 2020 was much smaller for the samples collected in december 2016 than those collected in august 2016 fig 8 in contrast at the geum and seomjin river sites the relatively modern poc was similar for both sampling periods as mentioned in section 4 2 an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool in the estuarine regions besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc the resuspension of poc in the estuary occurs related to tidal and wind processes such as tidal induced upwelling wind induced upwelling and overturning eddies e g demers et al 1987 bianchi and bauer 2011 indeed in the geum and seomjin estuaries the resuspension of bottom sediments occurs in association with tidal currents jeong et al 2014 m lee et al 2018 however a tidal derived mixing has a relatively short cycle of about 15 days cho et al 2020 and thus would not be responsible for the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics observed in this study in the study areas north winds generate large waves especially during the winter season jeong et al 2014 wells and park 1992 yang et al 2003 the average wind speed of previous 14 days at the time of sampling which affected the sediment resuspension tammeorg et al 2013 on the sampling day in december 2016 was higher than that in august 2016 in both geum and seomjin estuaries see fig 2b the stronger wind speed in winter thus resulted in a stronger resuspension of bottom sediments as shown by the enhanced turbidity in december 2016 than in august 2016 see figs 3 and 4 accordingly our results suggest that resuspended sediments which have lower δ14c values than those of riverine suspended particulate matter provided a stronger contribution to the total poc pool in both estuarine regions in winter than in summer owing to the stronger wind related processes in winter 5 conclusion we investigated surface water samples collected in the two contrasting korean estuary systems i e closed geum and open seomjin estuaries along a salinity gradient in august and december 2016 the poc concentration δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 at the geum river sites which was due to the higher contribution of the phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool in august 2016 associated with the estuary dam however at the seomjin river site the δ13cpoc value was lower in august 2016 than in december 2016 while the tsm and dic concentrations water discharge and δ14cpoc were similar for both the seasons except for the poc concentration this suggests that the contribution of fresher plant derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 at the seomjin river site which was related to the occurrence of local c3 plant i e phragmites australis in both estuarine regions the poc concentration δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 furthermore the relatively modern poc estimated using a simple binary mixing model between fossil and recently fixed modern terrestrial riverine estuarine and marine poc was much higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 given that the relatively modern poc was similar for both sampling periods an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool along with the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc especially in winter accordingly our results suggest that the seasonal characteristics of poc at the river sites were strongly influenced by the presence of the estuary dam however wind induced sediment resuspensions played a more important role in causing the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics in both estuarine regions accordingly our results provide valuable background information on efficient management and preservation of the geum and seomjin estuarine ecosystems declaration of competing

17499,in this study we newly investigated surface water samples collected in two contrasting korean estuary systems i e closed geum and open seomjin estuaries along a salinity gradient in winter december in 2016 the main objectives were to determine the source of particulate organic carbon poc in winter and to assess the environmental factors inducing seasonal differences in poc characteristics concentrations and dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c of poc were analyzed together with concentrations and stable carbon isotopes δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and compared with those obtained in summer august in 2016 our study provided a new insight that for both estuarine systems the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics was associated with stronger wind induced estuarine sediment resuspensions in winter than in summer providing a greater contribution of aged poc to the total poc pool in winter graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords particulate

the stable carbon isotope δ13c has been used for tracing the source of poc in estuaries combined with the radiocarbon isotope δ14c which provides additional information on the source and the reactivity of poc e g raymond and bauer 2001 organic carbon oc delivery via the river estuary sea continuum may vary seasonally due to biotic and abiotic processes including primary productivity river discharge and physical mixing e g bianchi and duan 2006 cai et al 2016 guo et al 2015 hoffman and bronk 2006 for instance thermal and saline stratifications prevent a vertical mixing in summer due to a large temperature difference between warmer surface water and cold bottom water and a stronger episodic riverine freshwater input under the asian monsoon system lee et al 2010 the geum river is the

contrast the seomjin estuary was an open estuary without a dam a previous study of the geum and seomjin rivers showed that the catchment area normalized fluxes of poc were 4 0 10 4 tc km 2 yr 1 in the geum river and 5 2 10 4 tc km 2 yr 1 in the seomjin river between may 2016 and may 2018 kang et al 2019 the poc flux was more weakly associated with the water discharge in the geum river than in the seomjin river indicating that the estuary dam of the geum river influenced the poc fluxes into the estuary by modifying the water residence times through an artificial drainage control in the reservoir higher δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc values in the surface water samples collected along a salinity gradient in the geum estuary than those in the seomjin estuary in august 2016 indicated that phytoplankton derived poc was the main contributor to the total poc pool in the reservoir of the geum estuary due to an enhanced phytoplankton bloom associate with an increase in water residence time by the estuary dam whereas terrestrial derived poc was predominantly transported by the seomjin river kang et al 2020 accordingly the estuary dam of the geum river altered the source and reactivity of poc in the reservoir in summer which could have been exported to the adjacent estuary when the water gate was open however the seasonal contrast of poc characteristics along a salinity gradient has not been yet determined in either estuary system in this study we newly investigated surface water samples collected along a salinity gradient from the geum closed and seomjin open estuary systems in winter december in 2016 we analyzed the concentrations and dual carbon isotopes δ13c and δ14c of poc together with the concentrations and stable carbon isotopes δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic and compared them with those obtained in summer august in 2016 the main objectives of this study were to determine the source of poc in winter and thus to evaluate the environmental factors inducing the seasonal differences in poc characteristics in two contrasting korean estuary systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection surface water samples were collected along a salinity gradient

ph and total alkalinity cf shin et al 2015 the stable isotope ratios of dic δ13cdic were analyzed with extracted co2 gas using a dual inlet isotope ratio mass spectrometer isoprime gv instrument

following their standard routines 2 4 conservative mixing model calculation the dic and poc concentrations and the isotope compositions of δ13cdic δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc resulting from a mix of

and the water masses were characterized by a temperature range of 4 9 9 7 c a salinity range of 0 3 35 0 psu a ph range of 6 5 9 7 and a turbidity range of 261 450 ntu figs 3 and 4 the surface water temperature in december 2016 on average 8 6 1 5 c was much lower than in august 2016 on average 30 9 1 1 c showing similar temperatures before and after the dam fig 4a however other water parameters i e salinity ph and total alkalinity were drastically changed before and after the dam in two sampling periods figs 4b d the turbidity in december 2016 on average 436 16 ntu was much higher than in august 2016 on average 48 18 ntu showing a similar before and after the dam fig 4e in general the tsm concentrations were lower before the dam than after the dam showing similar ranges in summer and winter fig 4f the dic concentrations 11 1 27 1 mgc l 1 in august 2016 and 17 2 28 2 mgc l 1 in december 2016 were also lower before the dam than after the dam for both sampling periods but with higher concentrations in the reservoir in winter than in summer fig 5 a in contrast the poc concentrations in december 2016 0 3 2 7 mgc l 1 were slightly higher before the dam than after the dam showing a smaller contrast compared to that in summer fig 5b the δ13cdic values were lower before the dam than after the dam for both sampling periods ranging from 12 0 to 0 3 fig 6 a the δ13cpoc values in december 2016 were between 32 5 and 25 3 showing different trends along the salinity gradient for two sampling periods fig 6b the δ14cpoc values in december 2016 351 0 to 87 0 showed a larger difference between before and after the dam compared to that in august 2016 fig 6c 3 2 seomjin estuary the average wind speed of previous 14 days at the time of sampling was higher in december 2016 than in august 2016 fig 2b vertical profiles of the water temperature salinity and turbidity indicated variations of 7 2 11 8 c 0 1 35 2 psu and 78 467 ntu in december 2016 figs 3c and d the surface water temperature showed a decreasing trend in august 2016 but an increasing trend in december 2016 with the much lower average value of 9 9 2 3 c in december 2016 fig 4a however other water parameters i e salinity ph and total alkalinity showed the same trends for both sampling periods figs 4c and d the turbidity and the tsm concentration showed a gradual increase toward the sea sites in both sampling periods figs 4d and e but the turbidity showed a larger difference between august 2016 on average 52 28 ntu and december 2016 on average 283 140 ntu the dic concentration also showed an increasing trend toward the sea sites having a similar range of 9 9 to 27 1 mgc l 1 in august 2016 and 9 7 to 27 2 mgc l 1 in december 2016 fig 5a in contrast the poc concentrations did not reveal a clear trend with the lower average concentration of 0 4 0 1 mgc l 1 in december 2016 than in august 2016 fig 5b the δ13cdic values increased toward the sea sites for both sampling periods ranging from 12 7 to 0 fig 6a in december 2016 neither δ13cpoc nor δ14cpoc showed a clear trend with generally lower values 29 0 to 26 6 and 302 2 to 187 3 respectively than those in august 2016 figs 6 b and c 4 discussion 4 1 riverine poc sources at the geum river sites gr1 and gr2 the poc concentrations were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b in a natural river system the poc concentration associated with soil erosion is commonly related to the tsm concentration which is strongly controlled by hydrodynamic processes e g wood 1977 beusen et al 2005 bouchez et al 2011 guo et al 2015 wu et al 2018 at gr1 and gr2 the tsm concentrations were slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 4f which is consistent with the higher water discharge in august 2016 compared with december 2016 fig 2a thus it appears that the input of soil derived poc into the geum river was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 notably the poc concentration was lower at gr2 than at gr1 in august 2016 whereas both sites showed similar poc concentrations in december 2016 fig 5b the poc concentration at gr2 was also much lower than the modeled value in august 2016 this suggests that in addition to the soil derived poc supply an additional input from other poc sources might have contributed to the total riverine poc pool indeed a previous study at gr1 showed that a heavy riverine algae bloom occurred in the geum river in august 2016 kang et al 2019 hence it appears that the contribution of phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher at gr1 than at gr2 in august 2016 associated with the estuary dam which altered the natural land sea continuum kang et al 2020 at the seomjin river site sjr1 the poc concentration was also higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b although the tsm concentrations and water discharges were similar in both seasons figs 2b and 4f this might be due to a higher contribution of plant derived poc to the tsm pool in august 2016 than in december 2016 whereas the variation in soil derived poc was minor in both seasons the δ13cpoc values at gr1 and gr2 were higher in august 2016 22 9 to 19 4 than in december 2016 32 5 to 28 7 fig 6b the fact that the δ13cpoc values were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 appears to be associated with the higher contribution of autochthonous poc due to increased primary phytoplankton production kang et al 2019 2020 in contrast the lower δ13cpoc values in december 2016 are comparable with the signatures of the terrestrial c3 plants which use the calvin pathway of carbon fixation with δ13c values of average 28 in the range of 32 to 24 e g peterson and fry 1987 meyers 1997 marwick et al 2015 indeed c3 plants such as phragmites spp salix spp and rubus parvifolius are dominant in the geum river watershed in spring and summer s lee et al 2018 thus lower δ13cpoc values of winter samples suggest that influence of c3 plant debris inputs to the total poc pool was stronger in winter in the absence of a phytoplankton bloom notably the δ13cpoc values at gr2 for both seasons were lower than those at gr1 as well as the modeled values fig 6b this seems to be associated with higher contributions of phytoplankton derived poc with enriched δ13cpoc values to the total poc pool at gr1 than gr2 in both seasons at sjr1 the δ13cpoc value was lower in august 2016 29 1 than in december 2016 26 6 fig 6b considering the fact that the poc concentration in august 2016 was higher than in december 2016 see fig 5b with similar tsm concentrations and water discharges fig 2b as mentioned above the lower δ13cpoc value in august 2016 as compared with that in december 2016 seems to be due to the higher contribution of fresher plant derived poc to the total poc pool whereas the soil derived poc contributions were similar in both seasons in fact the δ13cpoc value in august 2016 was in the range of the signatures of the common c3 reed phragmites australis 27 to 29 which is dominant in the seomjin river in spring and summer min and je 2002 choi et al 2005 kang et al 2020 hence it seems that the contribution of c3 plants to the total poc pool in the seomjin river was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 evidence supporting the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above can be found in the δ13c characteristics of dic which play a critical role in the primary productivity as a source of bioavailable carbon for aquatic plant photosynthesis e g sand jensen et al 1992 maberly and madsen 2002 in general the δ13c value of phytoplankton depends on the aquatic δ13cdic and subsequent carbon isotope fractionation on average 21 during the assimilation process e g chanton and lewis 1999 guo et al 2015 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 at gr1 and gr2 the calculated δ13c values of phytoplankton based on the measured δ13cdic and carbon isotope fractionation 21 values cf guo et al 2015 were 30 2 and 33 0 in august 2016 and 29 3 and 29 7 in december 2016 respectively thus this was within the range 23 to 32 of the typical freshwater phytoplankton observed in the various aquatic systems e g bade et al 2006 chanton and lewis 1999 finlay and kendall 2007 however the measured δ13cpoc at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 22 9 and 19 4 respectively see fig 6 was much higher than the calculated δ13c of phytoplankton whereas the measured δ13cpoc values in december 2016 28 7 and 32 5 respectively see fig 6 was similar or slightly depleted compared with the calculated values interestingly the 13c values of phytoplankton can be enriched during the assimilation owing to an increase in water temperature and shift in carbon source from dissolved co2 to hco3 when dissolved co2 is exhausted due to a heavy phytoplankton bloom particularly when the chlorophyta and cyanophyta are dominant this is because the δ13c of hco3 is higher than that of co2 and the chlorophyta and cyanophyta can directly use hco3 wang et al 2013 and references therein although there is no direct information regarding phytoplankton assemblages at our study sites chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae are dominant in the middle reaches of the geum river in summer han et al 2016 thus it seems that the phytoplankton bloom observed at gr1 during the sampling campaign in august 2016 kang et al 2019 2020 could also be linked to the occurrence of chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae which might have caused a shift from dissolved co2 to hco3 in the dic pool at gr1 and gr2 accordingly the higher measured δ13cpoc values as compared with the calculated values at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 were associated with the enhanced contribution of 13c enriched phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool furthermore the lower dic concentrations on average 12 0 1 2 mgc l 1 at gr1 and gr2 in august 2016 than those on average 17 6 0 6 mgc l 1 in december 2016 see fig 5a were supportive of the phytoplankton bloom in summer as the in situ photosynthesis would result in a decrease in the dic concentration through the consumption of dissolved co2 e g samanta et al 2015 bhavya et al 2018 in contrast the seasonal differences in dic concentration at sjr1 were minor suggesting the negligible influence of the in situ photosynthesis on dic concentration for the two sampling periods see fig 5a another piece of evidence supporting the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above can be found in the δ14cpoc characteristics which have been commonly used to constrain the source of poc e g raymond and bauer 2001 wu et al 2018 riverine δ14cpoc values depend on the mean time elapsed because of biosynthesis and the integrated effect of transport or deposition of poc in the watershed e g raymond and bauer 2001 hilton et al 2015 marwick et al 2015 recently fixed terrestrial plants have a high δ14c value of 40 to 200 consistent with the δ14c of atmospheric co2 e g marwick et al 2015 wu et al 2018 whereas ancient oc from bedrock weathering and fossil fuels has a δ14c value of 1000 e g marwick et al 2015 xue et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and the δ14c of soil derived oc has a wide range between that of ancient oc and that of modern biomass derived oc marwick et al 2015 because phytoplankton uses dic as a carbon source the δ14c of riverine phytoplankton depends on the δ14c of dic in water mortazavi and chanton 2004 zigah et al 2012 tao et al 2018 the global mean riverine δ14cdic value was 2 although the riverine δ14cdic can be much lower e g 164 to 125 in the yellow river and 137 to 164 in the changjiang river marwick et al 2015 wang et al 2016 tao et al 2018 the δ14cpoc values at gr1 and gr2 were higher in august 2016 81 7 to 51 1 than in december 2016 101 8 to 87 0 fig 6c moreover the δ14cpoc values were lower at sjr1 on average 187 8 0 7 than at gr1 and gr2 in both seasons fig 6c to the best of our knowledge the δ14c values of soil oc in the geum and seomjin watersheds have not yet been reported however the δ14cpoc value observed in the seomjin river was slightly higher than the δ14c values of soil oc from the yellow river basin 510 to 174 and the changjiang river basin 306 to 246 xue et al 2017 wu et al 2018 yu et al 2019 and thus from the changjiang river 436 to 103 wang et al 2012 wu et al 2018 and the yellow river 635 to 243 wang et al 2012 tao et al 2018 note that the input of soil derived oc is higher in the yellow river than in the changjiang river resulting in lower δ14cpoc values wang et al 2012 accordingly the δ14cpoc values at the geum river sites indicate that the contribution of phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 while a higher input of plant debris decreased the δ14cpoc values in december 2016 in contrast for both seasons the soil derived oc was the dominant source at the seomjin river site 4 2 poc sources within the estuarine region in general the poc in the estuary results from the mixing of several oc sources including riverine i e soils plants and freshwater phytoplankton detritus and in situ phytoplankton bianchi and bauer 2011 and references therein after the dam in the geum estuary system gr3 to gr6 the poc concentrations were slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b notably the tsm concentration at gr3 was much higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 whereas those of other sites were similar for both seasons fig 4f considering that the water discharge was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 2a it seems that the gr3 site located just after the estuary dam was more strongly influenced by the input of the riverine derived poc than the other estuary sites it is also worthwhile to note that the measured poc concentrations were higher than the modeled ones fig 5b this suggests that in addition to the terrestrial and in situ poc sources an additional source appears to contribute to the total poc pool in the estuarine region in the seomjin estuarine region sjr2 to sjr5 the poc concentrations were also higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 5b whereas the tsm concentrations and the water discharges were similar for both seasons figs 2b and 4f notably the measured poc concentrations were in general higher than the modeled values in the mixing zone fig 5b this suggests that besides the riverine and in situ poc sources an additional poc source contributed to the total poc pool in the seomjin estuarine region similar to the case in the geum estuarine region in the geum estuarine region gr3 to gr6 δ13cpoc was higher in august 2016 22 4 1 5 than in december 2016 27 2 2 4 fig 6b similarly in the seomjin estuarine region sjr2 to sjr5 δ13cpoc was higher in august 2016 22 0 0 8 than in december 2016 27 2 1 2 fig 6b marine phytoplankton has a δ13cpoc range of 17 to 24 e g chanton and lewis 1999 lamb et al 2006 kim et al 2019 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 which is higher than that of terrestrial derived poc e g peterson and fry 1987 meyers 1997 marwick et al 2015 hence our results suggest that in both estuarine systems the contributions of in situ phytoplankton derived poc were generally higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 it is worthwhile to note that in natural estuaries an increasing δ13cpoc trend toward the marine sites was observed due to mixing between 13c depleted terrestrial and 13c enriched marine poc sources wu et al 2013 guo et al 2015 in the geum estuarine region such an increasing trend was not observed in august 2016 fig 6b owing to the high δ13cpoc signature associated with the increased freshwater phytoplankton production before the estuary dam as discussed in section 4 1 in contrast an increasing δ13cpoc trend was observed in december 2016 fig 6b however the δ13cpoc of gr3 was much lower than the modeled value but similar to that of gr2 located just before the estuary dam indicating a strong influence by the gr2 signature at gr3 in the seomjin estuarine region δ13cpoc increased toward the marine sites in august 2016 fig 6b however such a trend was not observed in december 2016 with similar δ13cpoc values along the estuary gradient which indicates that the riverine derived poc was dominant in the total poc pool nonetheless the δ13cpoc value was lower at sjr2 than at other sites suggesting an additional source besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc another piece of evidence supporting the enhanced in situ phytoplankton derived poc contribution in august 2016 over that in december 2016 as discussed above can be found in the dic signatures the δ13cdic value in seawater is higher than that of the riverine dic 12 to 15 ranging from 0 to 2 4 e g chanton and lewis 1999 campeau et al 2017 mackensen and schmiedl 2019 in natural estuary systems similar to the case of δ13cpoc an increasing δ13cdic trend 15 to 2 4 was observed e g chanton and lewis 1999 kaldy et al 2005 bhavya et al 2018 he and xu 2017 in both estuarine regions δ13cdic was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 showing an increasing trend toward the marine sites fig 6a thus the calculated δ13c of phytoplankton cf guo et al 2015 was slightly higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 with values of 21 4 0 6 and 22 8 0 in the geum estuarine region respectively and 22 5 1 8 and 23 5 2 0 in the seomjin estuarine region respectively thus the δ13cdic signatures are consistent with the measured δ13cpoc suggesting that the contribution of in situ phytoplankton derived poc was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 in both estuarine regions the δ14cpoc characteristics in both estuarine regions also exhibited seasonal differences showing higher values in august 2016 than in december 2016 fig 6c this is in good agreement with the δ13cpoc signatures discussed above indicating that the contribution of in situ phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 in both estuarine regions notably in august 2016 the measured δ14cpoc values were slightly lower than the modeled values in the geum estuarine region whereas they were slightly higher in the seomjin estuarine region see also fig 6c this suggests that a contribution of fresher poc to the total poc pool was larger in the mixing zone of the seomjin estuary as previously suggested by kang et al 2020 in contrast in december 2016 the measured δ14cpoc values were generally lower than the modeled values in both estuarine regions they were also lower than the global median signature of 230 in the estuaries marwick et al 2015 this suggests that besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool 4 3 environmental factors influencing poc sources as can be seen in figs 3 and 4 water parameters such as salinity showed an abrupt change from before the dam to after the dam in the geum estuary system for the two sampling periods whereas a gradual change was observed in the seomjin estuary system for both seasons hence it is evident that the geum estuary dam regulated the salinity diffusion to the upstream region cho et al 2016 consequently the upstream of the estuary dam was converted into a lacustrine system jeong et al 2014 yang 2014 promoting a phytoplankton bloom in august 2016 as discussed in section 4 1 see figs 5 and 6 it seems that the phytoplankton bloom caused a ph increase see fig 4c owing to the fixation of co2 by the phytoplankton verspagen et al 2014 which converted the dic pool into an hco3 dominant one wang et al 2013 and their referencein a shift in the carbon source from dissolved co2 to hco3 could have promoted a chlorophyceae and cyanophyceae bloom increasing the δ13cpoc values in august 2016 see fig 6b accordingly it appears that the geum estuary dam plays an important role in altering the characteristics of poc transferred to the estuarine region the oc degradation increases the dic concentration and decreases δ13cdic because of the selective loss of 13c enriched labile carbohydrate and amino acids fractions e g bellanger et al 2004 thus the deviation of the measured dic concentration or δ13cdic from the modeled values can represent an input or removal of carbon within a system e g loder and reichard 1981 he and xu 2017 oliveira et al 2017 the differences between the measured and modeled values of the dic concentration and δ13cdic were illustrated as a scatter plot in fig 7 a in general the small deviations from zero of δ dic and δ δ13cdic suggested that the oc degradation was less important at most of the sites in both the geum and somjin estuary systems in august and december 2016 however the sample at gr2 collected in august 2016 was separately plotted from others in the right lower quadrant suggesting the occurrence of the oc degradation at this site the degradable oc at gr2 might be supplied from gr1 where a heavy phytoplankton bloom occurred in august 2016 kang et al 2019 2020 the δ poc and δ δ13cpoc values of the sample at gr2 collected in august 2016 were also separately plotted in the lower left quadrant fig 7b supporting the removal of oc by degradation accordingly it appears that the oc degradation at gr2 was promoted owing to the longer residence time of oc in the geum reservoir associated with the estuary dam interestingly the δ δ13cpoc and δ δ14cpoc of the samples collected in both the geum and seomjin estuarine regions in december 2016 were mostly negatively plotted figs 7b and c furthermore for both the geum and seomjin estuarine regions the relatively modern poc estimated using a simple binary mixing model between the fossil and recently fixed modern terrestrial riverine estuarine and marine poc cf kang et al 2020 was much smaller for the samples collected in december 2016 than those collected in august 2016 fig 8 in contrast at the geum and seomjin river sites the relatively modern poc was similar for both sampling periods as mentioned in section 4 2 an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool in the estuarine regions besides the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc the resuspension of poc in the estuary occurs related to tidal and wind processes such as tidal induced upwelling wind induced upwelling and overturning eddies e g demers et al 1987 bianchi and bauer 2011 indeed in the geum and seomjin estuaries the resuspension of bottom sediments occurs in association with tidal currents jeong et al 2014 m lee et al 2018 however a tidal derived mixing has a relatively short cycle of about 15 days cho et al 2020 and thus would not be responsible for the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics observed in this study in the study areas north winds generate large waves especially during the winter season jeong et al 2014 wells and park 1992 yang et al 2003 the average wind speed of previous 14 days at the time of sampling which affected the sediment resuspension tammeorg et al 2013 on the sampling day in december 2016 was higher than that in august 2016 in both geum and seomjin estuaries see fig 2b the stronger wind speed in winter thus resulted in a stronger resuspension of bottom sediments as shown by the enhanced turbidity in december 2016 than in august 2016 see figs 3 and 4 accordingly our results suggest that resuspended sediments which have lower δ14c values than those of riverine suspended particulate matter provided a stronger contribution to the total poc pool in both estuarine regions in winter than in summer owing to the stronger wind related processes in winter 5 conclusion we investigated surface water samples collected in the two contrasting korean estuary systems i e closed geum and open seomjin estuaries along a salinity gradient in august and december 2016 the poc concentration δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 at the geum river sites which was due to the higher contribution of the phytoplankton derived poc to the total poc pool in august 2016 associated with the estuary dam however at the seomjin river site the δ13cpoc value was lower in august 2016 than in december 2016 while the tsm and dic concentrations water discharge and δ14cpoc were similar for both the seasons except for the poc concentration this suggests that the contribution of fresher plant derived poc to the total poc pool was higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 at the seomjin river site which was related to the occurrence of local c3 plant i e phragmites australis in both estuarine regions the poc concentration δ13cpoc and δ14cpoc were higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 furthermore the relatively modern poc estimated using a simple binary mixing model between fossil and recently fixed modern terrestrial riverine estuarine and marine poc was much higher in august 2016 than in december 2016 given that the relatively modern poc was similar for both sampling periods an additional poc source seems to contribute to the total poc pool along with the riverine and in situ phytoplankton derived poc especially in winter accordingly our results suggest that the seasonal characteristics of poc at the river sites were strongly influenced by the presence of the estuary dam however wind induced sediment resuspensions played a more important role in causing the seasonal contrast in poc characteristics in both estuarine regions accordingly our results provide valuable background information on efficient management and preservation of the geum and seomjin estuarine ecosystems declaration of competing
