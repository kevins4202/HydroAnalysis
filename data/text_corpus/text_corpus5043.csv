25215,input capacity constraints means a firm cannot make its output decision based on the first order optimal condition of profit maximization because it does not have enough inputs input capacity constraints have a significant effect on production quality and firm competition especially on food safety management this paper tries to provide a new perspective for quality operation in supply chain management it also designs a new mechanism for quality regulation after distinguishing between quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints this paper demonstrates a theoretical analysis about the impact of input capacity constraints on food quality and quality regulation by game theory the results show that both kinds of capacity input constraints lead to a lower level of output quality and consumer surplus but a higher level of prices in this study we design a quality regulation to stimulate the growth of high quality food products more importantly this paper proves that reward is more effective in food quality guarantee programs than punishment or fine based programs the conclusions are helpful for addressing food safety

central government has taken up food safety issue as a key task in its no 1 central document in 2015 http english agri gov cn 1 1 the no 1 central document is the first document of the central government of china announcing key responsibilities for agriculture during the subsequent years food safety incidents happen regularly not only in china but throughout the world liu and ma 2016 taylor et al 2016 the first food contamination incident recorded in the history happened in the ancient roman empire kelth 2012 since then several foodborne illnesses have happened in europe and other developed countries such as the united states during the 1900 1950 period the number of food safety outbreaks peaked during the last half of the 20th century yang et al 2009 harrington 2011 interestingly at the beginning of the 21st century more food safety incidents have occurred in the developing countries particularly in asia and latin america including china brazil india based on the above information we infer that food safety outbreaks have something to do with the development of the economy and the issue should be investigated through the use of economic theory such as input capacity constraints as well as ethics and law disciplines take the case of china an increasing number of food safety incidents are being reported by the media making food safety a focal point of major agricultural issues xue and zhang 2013 as a result studies have proposed ways to improve food safety li 2009 ni and zeng 2009 handschuch et al 2013 chen et al 2015b these studies conclude that lack of laws standards and regulations are the main reasons for food safety outbreaks few studies see lin et al 2010 lentz and barrett 2013 geng et al 2015 have used economic reasoning to understand the effects of regulations on food safety outbreaks recall that food quality is the foundation of food safety and material inputs inherently determine the quality of food we know that inputs are scarce and scarcity could lead to input capacity constraints and could lead to changes in the quantity and quality of output and other competitive decisions made by firms benjaafar et al 2017 jansen and özaltın 2017 cachon et al 2017 and supply chains graves and schoenmeyr 2016 additionally input capacity constraints have significant influence on the food industry because firms under input capacity constraints are inclined to use lower quality of inputs or alternative inputs to produce the same product and to increase profit margins food safety depends on production handling preparation transportation and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illnesses this includes routines that should be followed in order to avoid potentially severe health hazards any improper operation of the process no matter intentional or unintentional may result in food pollution or may even lead to food safety accidents outbreaks food safety accidents can result from moral hazard behavior of food producers based on asymmetric information or from input capacity constraints for example quality of orange juice may be affected because only 80 oranges were used instead of 100 a case of input constraint that were required in the production process on the other hand if a producer deliberately uses a wrong input a case of moral hazard in the food production process it could also compromise the food safety generally quality motivation is employed for the latter and punishment is used for the former hence different food safety problems need different regulations previous studies in the literature have focused on the moral hazard problem in food safety however only a few studies see lin et al 2010 lentz and barrett 2013 geng et al 2015 have addressed the issue of input capacity constraints on food safety therefore the objective of this study is to assess the impact of input capacity constraints on food safety and how to make quality regulation more successful specifically we address the issue of quantity and quality sensitive input constraints in the food industry a major issue about input capacity constraints is how it could lead to a decrease in the quality of food products and food safety standards this study contributes to the literature in several ways first this paper aims to model the impact of input capacity constraints on food quality and food safety using game theory second we show differential impacts of quality sensitive and quantity sensitive input capacity constraints on the food industry third we design an effective quality regulation mechanism in order to reduce food safety problems the results of this study should be helpful in designing and reducing input capacity constraints and in developing regulations finally we offer a new perspective in solving food safety issues for agri food markets and food supply chain management we classify input capacity constraints into quantity sensitive and quality sensitive constraints a quantity sensitive input capacity constraint means that the constrained input has a major impact on the quantity of the output while a quality sensitive input capacity constraint has a significant impact on the quality of the output produced lastly we compare the differences in quality and quantity as well as in consumer surplus among the three different scenarios based on symmetric cournot competition the rest of this article is organized as follows the next section sets up the basic model in section 3 we derive the unique equilibrium of our game in this section equilibrium analyses are offered under three different scenarios namely no constraints quantity sensitive and quality sensitive input constraints some major propositions are outlined after comparing the analyses section 4 develops a quality regulation mechanism based on basu and dixit s too small to regulate theory and some significant propositions are presented in this section the last section of the paper provides conclusions and implications of the study here we also provide the major limitations of our study and avenues for future research finally all omitted proofs are presented in the appendix 2 literature review food safety outbreaks is not only a problem in the developing countries but across the world even developed countries such as the unite states cannot be excluded recently rieger et al 2016 investigated food scandal in the german meat industry and found that consumption habits and media usage behaviors impact households responses to food safety outbreaks in another study liu and ma 2016 analyzed food scandals in china and found that media exposure was helpful in securing food safety food safety risks could exist in any part of the food supply chain but the vast majority of food safety outbreaks occur during the food production and processing or due to producing with inferior inputs additionally illegal additives could lead to outbreaks in food safety for example wang et al 2015 concluded that scarcity in raw milk played a significant role in the 2008 milk scandal in china several studies chen et al 2017 lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 have investigated the impact of soil and water pollution on food safety in each case the authors found that water and soil pollutions are major factors affecting food safety in china finally a study karp et al 2016 investigated the influence of agricultural practices on food safety and found a positive and significant relationship between agricultural practices and food safety food production and safety standards are widely used in the food industry therefore a plethora of studies especially in developing countries have investigated the impact of food safety standards on food safety for instance jongwanich 2009 concluded that food safety standards of developed countries have a significant influence on the food safety standard in the developing countries and that developing countries benefit from those standards the food safety standards stimulate firms in the developing countries to raise their food quality standards similarly handschuch et al 2013 examined the effects of food safety and quality standards on the growth of small farms in the developing countries the authors found that food standards have a positive and significant effect on small farms quality performance and income finally hou et al 2016 investigated the impacts of food safety standards on international supply chain organization isco and concluded that isco benefits from food safety standards standards ethics and law play a critical role in the food safety problem fagotto 2015 sperling 2010 food safety laws are ameliorating due to food safety problems geng et al 2015 regulations especially quality control regulations are needed to enhance food safety in any economy for example dou et al 2015 investigated the influence of food safety regulation on vegetable exports from china and found that implementation of food safety regulation was helpful in increasing exports from china similarly buckley 2015 investigated the impact of food safety regulation on small food processing firms and found that regulations have significant effects on the interactions between processors and inspectors note that the above studies are examples of moral hazard problem of food producers based on asymmetric information however input capacity constraints offer us a new perspective on food safety regulations see ben elhadj et al 2012 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2015a chen et al 2018 capture the effects of capacity constraints on the restaurant industry and food safety by employing a two stage asymmetric capacity constraints model their study shows that capacity constrains influence both food quantity and quality this is a major study on this issue recall that input capacity constraints impact decisions on price quantity mergers and reputation of firms input capacity constraints could influence food safety risk in the food industry nie and chen 2012 kawasaki and uchida 2016 for instance wang et al 2015 concluded that input capacity constraints played a critical role in food safety the authors argue that scarcity of high quality milk was a major factor in the 2008 milk scandal of china constrained input capacity also impacts industrial development for instance ben elhadj et al 2012 and chen et al 2015a argue that input capacity constraints reduce product quality differences between firms and make the product and by extension the industry more symmetrical or identical food industry is a special sector where consumers care more about quality than quantity kawasaki and uchida 2016 in the early 2000s melumad and ziv 2004 found that firms are fully motivated to reduce output quality under input capacity constraints the authors note that firms prefer to decrease output quality in favor of increasing output quantity the authors illustrated that by decreasing quality one can increase social welfare however results may be different for the food industry recall that product quality is paramount in the food industry as a result keener 2010 and varadaraj 2010 show that food safety standards could be raised by building input capacity or boosting input capacity of food product firms finally rouvière 2016 and parker et al 2016 illustrated that firm size affects food safety risks implying that input capacity constraints have a crucial impact on food safety 3 model and analysis 3 1 basic model consider a duopoly competition industry with an upstream input provider and input capacity constraints downstream firms compete to buy capacity in the upstream market which allocates capacity efficiently denote the downstream firms by i and j and they compete with quantity and quality to maximize their profits we illustrate this competition by a two stage game with a duopoly cournot competition model 3 1 1 consumers both quantity and quality impact a consumer s utility similar to nie 2014 and chen and nie 2014 this paper uses the utility of a representative consumer in the following functional form 2 2 different from nie 2014 chen and nie 2014 this paper considers the effects of quality on consumer utility 1 u x i x j α 2 q i x i α 2 q j x j 1 2 x i x j γ x i x j where α 0 and is a constant representing the total market size γ 0 1 manifests the degree of product substitutability q i and x i i i j are the quality and quantity of the product under consideration given the quality q i the consumer chooses x i to maximize her utility specifically 2 p i α 2 q i x i γ x j note that i j and the above inverse demand function is directly induced by the utility function 1 combining eqs 1 and 2 we get consumer surplus as 3 c s 1 2 x i x j γ x i x j interestingly note that the above consumer surplus expression is only a function of quantities note also that consumers pay for any increase in the quality of the product or any increase in the utility derived from an increase in the quality is offset by an increase in the price of the product 3 1 2 producers the two symmetric downstream firms play a two stage cournot competition game the firms make quality decisions in the first stage and the quantity decisions in the second stage quality of the product has a strong effect on the quantity decision of the firms because higher food quality requires higher quality inputs but recall that higher quality inputs are scarce and can have a significant influence on the quantity of output produced the upstream firm supplies inputs to downstream firms with a unique price efficient and input constrained capacity let us denote by 0 r α the total input of this industry and r i and r j represent the input allocated to firms i and j respectively also note that r i r j r downstream firms maximize their profit by choosing the optional quantity and quality of inputs and the objective function is given as 4 m a x x i q j π i p i x i c i x q α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i where c i x q 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i i i j and is the cost function 3 3 chen et al 2015a nie and chen 2014 have similar costs function of firm i q i 2 2 and x i 2 2 represent the share of costs in quality and quantity respectively the last term of the cost function q i x i is the interaction between the cost of quantity and quality investment note that eq 4 is concave in q i and x i and i i j furthermore similar to nie 2014 and esó et al 2010 this study assumes that the upstream firm distributes resources efficiently and we only pay attention to the downstream firms now the two downstream firms make quality decisions in the first stage and competein quantity in the second stage in the following section we will outline the equilibrium analysis quality quantity price and consumer surplus under three scenarios no constraints benchmark model quantity sensitive input constraints and quality sensitive input constraints note that all equilibrium solutions are obtained by using the backward induction method 3 2 benchmark analysis we use standard duopoly cournot competition structure as the benchmark model following the first order conditions for eq 4 we obtain the equilibrium solution and the equilibrium quality quantity and prices given as follows 5 q i 9 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 6 x i 9 γ 2 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 7 p i 27 2 γ 2 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 we define a parameter ρ q i q j x i x j 9 9 γ 2 and note that ρ 1 9 8 for γ 0 1 this parameter will be used later substituting eq 6 into eq 3 one can obtain the consumer surplus cs in equilibrium cs is given as 8 c s 9 2 γ 2 1 γ 3 γ 2 α 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 2 3 3 quantity sensitive capacity constraints quantity sensitive input capacity constraints means that the input capacity constraints mainly result from increased output or quantity produced which is quite common considering quantity sensitive input constraints eq 4 is reconstructed as 9 m a x x i q j π i α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i s t θ 1 x i x i r where θ 1 is the transformation efficiency and we assume that the two firms have identical transformation efficiency wang et al 2017 high θ means low efficiency and vice versa furthermore we assume that θ 1 1 which means one unit of output needs more than one unit of input decreasing returns to scale in other words x i r i θ 1 i i j under the binding constraints condition or θ 1 x i x j r eq 9 also includes the following equilibrium conditions on quality quantity and prices 10 q i 3 2 γ r 2 α θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 11 x i r 2 θ 1 12 p i 1 7 γ 2 r 2 α 7 2 γ θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 and the lagrange multiplier of eq 9 or λ 12 γ 2 γ 2 r 4 3 γ α θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 2 0 for all θ 1 1 and γ 0 1 finally the consumer surplus cs under quantity sensitive capacity constraints can be shown as 13 c s 1 γ r 2 4 θ 1 2 3 4 quality sensitive capacity constraints recall that there is scarcity of higher quality inputs and as a result fewer resources are being used in other words as the output quality increases the total input resources which are required to produce the product will also decrease based on this assumption we assess the effect of quality sensitive input capacity constraints on the equilibrium quality quantity and prices the objective function of the firm under quality sensitive input capacity constraints can be written as 14 m a x x i q j π i α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i s t θ 1 q i q i r where θ 2 has the same meaning as θ 1 then solving eq 14 we obtain the equilibrium quality quantity and prices under quality sensitive input capacity constraints as follows 15 q i r 2 θ 2 16 x i r 2 α θ 2 2 3 γ θ 2 17 p i 5 γ r 4 α θ 2 2 3 γ θ 2 and from eq 14 we also know λ 18 α θ 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 r 3 2 γ 3 γ 2 θ 1 2 0 for all θ 2 1 and γ 0 1 finally the equilibrium consumer surplus for the above case can be shown as 18 c s 1 γ r 2 α θ 2 2 4 3 γ 2 θ 1 2 3 5 comparison analysis in this section we compare the equilibrium output quality price and cs among the above three cases first we need to make the following assumption assumption θ 1 ρ θ 2 remarks the equilibrium from the benchmark model shows that 1 ρ q i q j x i x j 9 9 γ 2 9 8 in order to make the input capacity constraints boundary under the two different cases same or θ 1 x i x j r θ 2 q i q j the equation θ 1 ρ θ 2 always holds otherwise it is impossible to make a reasonable comparison based on the analyses we obtains the following two propositions proposition 1 the quantity and quality under the three conditions unconstrained quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints satisfy the following relationships x i x i x and q i q i q i i j proof see appendix a remarks proposition 1 shows that both equilibrium output quality and quantity under the two input capacity constraint cases are lower than under the standard cournot competition this implies that input capacity constraints tend to decrease quality and quantity of output more importantly proposition 1 shows that output quantity under competitive quality sensitive input capacity constraints is less than that under the competitive quantity sensitive input capacity constraints however the relationship between output qualities for the two cases is just the reverse therefore quality sensitive input capacity constraints have worse impacts on the food industry and could possibly lead to more cases of food safety breakdown or food contamination the policy implication of proposition 1 is that due to input capacity constraints the food quality reduction is a forced decision by the food manufacturer under this condition the government could incentivize food production firms to relax their input capacity constraints for example firms can alleviate their input capacity constraints by merging with other similar firms froeb et al 2003 we should also note that there is a possibility that input capacity constraints affect both quality and quantity simultaneously or f x i q i f x j q j r and that will make things even worse proposition 2 the output price and consumer surplus under the three conditions no constraints quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints satisfy the following relationships p i p i p i and c s i c s i c s i i j proof see appendix a proof equilibrium prices of capacity input constraints are higher than prices for no input constraint and the price under quantity sensitive input capacity constraint is the highest because price is a monotonically decreasing function of quantity on the other hand consumer surplus under constrained input condition is less compared to no input constraint case the consumer surplus is the lowest under the quantity sensitive input capacity constraints condition finally firm s profit π and consumer surplus under different conditions are too complex to compare propositions 1 and 2 imply that input capacity constraints reduce consumer welfare by decreasing equilibrium quality quality consumer surplus and increasing equilibrium output prices the conclusions derived above can easily be expanded to a multi firm competitive structure maybe it is not easy to remove input capacity constraints but there are some things we can do to stimulate firms to raise the quality of their products and prevent or control food safety breakdowns therefore in the next section we offer a quality regulation mechanism that could be used to motivate firms to increase quality of their food product to accomplish this our proposal uses basu and dixit 2017 too small to regulate theory 4 quality regulation mechanism design a reasonable way to remove or minimize the effects of input capacity constraints on quality is to lower θ by technical progress but technical progress is a time consuming phenomenon therefore we design a suitable quality regulation mechanism to curb the urge for decreasing food quality especially in the food industry in this section we expand the model to an n firm setting following basu and dixit 2017 we consider n small firms subject to quality q q regulation which is costly to comply with each firm s profit is denoted by π l if it complies and if it violates the requirement and the violation cannot be traced then the profit is π h π l but if the violating firm is inspected and the violation is caught then it will be punished in such a case the profit of the violating firm is normalized to 0 it also pays a fine c different from basu and dixit 2017 we add an extra punishment fine c if the firm is caught violating the quality regulation in this paper we assume that the government has m n inspectors to enforce the quality regulation each inspector chooses randomly a firm to inspect without any duplication for any random firm the probability that it is not visited by an inspector is p pr first inspector goes to one of the other n 1 firms pr second inspector goes to one of the other n 2 out of the remaining n 1 firms pr mth inspector goes to one of the other n m out of the remaining n m 1 firms 19 n 1 n n 2 n 1 n m n m 1 n m n as a result the expected profit of the violating firm with getting away from being inspected is given by 20 p π h 1 p 0 c n m n π h therefore successful deterrence requires n m n π h π l or 21 m n π h π l π h c from the inequality 21 we get the following proposition proposition 3 the increase of n and π h makes the quality regulation easier to fail while the increase in c and π l makes the quality regulation more likely to be successful proof the conclusions of this proposition are obtained by direct inspection of inequality 21 conclusions are therefore achieved and the proof is complete remarks proposition 3 implies the number of firms has a significant impact on the quality regulation high payoff stimulates food product firms to violate quality regulation while too many supervised samples increase the probability of violating firms to get away from being caught and make the quality regulation less likely to be successful low probability of being caught for violation combined with less punishment fines makes the food product firms prefer to take the risk of violating quality especially when it is confronted with input capacity constraints although the punishment has the power to prohibit cheating behavior the amount of fine is not always enough moreover bernheim and whiston 1990 conclude that good behavior is not always sustained by the threat of punishment therefore we should consider rewards beside punishment if the regulator adds reward s to π l when the firm complies with the regulation and the regulation rule could be rewritten as 22 m n π h π l s π h c proposition 4 reward s makes the quality regulation mechanism easier and successful and s is more effective than s in case of quality regulation proof see the appendix a remarks a good regulation mechanism should have a balance between punishment and reward prospect theory indicates that reward has more power to regulate people s behavior than punishment and we prove this conclusion theoretically people may say that reward will raise government expenditures that may be true but reward also saves on inspection costs cost related to inspector s salary transportation inspection fees etc more importantly reward has the isolation effect good from bad if a firm does not apply for the reward we have more confidence in believing that the firm does not satisfy the quality regulation the policy implication of proposition 4 is that based on the difficultly of implementation and high costs of supervision the government could propose high quality reward as an incentive to food producing firms to enhance food quality and raise food safety standards 5 a simple case study all the analyses above can be outlined by the following logical flow chart fig 1 the quantity and quality of food impact consumers utility utility maximization choices of consumers influence the price of food production price and costs affect firms profits profit maximization behavior of firms and input capacity constraints determine the equilibrium quality regulators design quality regulations with rewards and penalties based on the number of firms and supervisors while regulated quality influences consumers utility below we supply a hypothetical case to show the influence of input capacity constraints on food safety problem suppose the safe quality level of orange juice is 100 and there are 100 oranges which can be used to produce 100 l orange juice with 100 quality level if the demand for orange juice is also 100 l then it can be met by 100 l safe orange juice produced using 100 oranges if the demand for orange juice is 120 l while the total number of oranges is still 100 then the average quality level of orange juice produced will fall below the safe level 100 in another case if the total demand quantity of orange juice is still 100 l and 100 oranges can be used but some consumers claim that they only purchase orange juice with 120 quality level then the quality of the rest juice for other consumers will fall below 100 quality level both the two cases will result in food safety incidents while increases punishment is useless in reality the 2008 milk scandal of china is one of the typical food safety incidents which results from limited supply of milk input capacity constraints 4 4 as the increase of milk demand in china milk production firms such as sanlu group co ltd were found adding melamine to pure milk product to fulfill the nutrition standard of milk illegally melamine added milk is noxious to consumers and make many children suffer from kidney stones 6 conclusions and discussions food safety is not a single country problem but a worldwide problem with global connectivity and global trade food safety outbreaks can happen at any time and anywhere and losses both human and financial could be significant furthermore food safety problems are becoming a serious issue in emerging economies including china as a result the central government of china has taken major steps to enhance food safety in china in many cases of food safety outbreaks people tend to attribute it to poor technology in food production and inefficient and ineffective supply chain management as a result most of the existing studies advocate raising the standards of food safety and production enacting more severe laws or using ethics pressure to guarantee food safety however studies in the literature fail to address the food safety problem as an economic problem this is because there is inherent laws of economics in the cases of food safety outbreaks and input capacity constraints is one such law for the regulation of food safety most attention has been given to punishing the firms that break the regulation although some regulatory systems involve incentives those incentives such as promotion are only given to the supervisors results from this study show that regulators should give the incentives to food producers in order to increase efficiency of the food regulation system the principles of management also reveal that we should encourage trade offs between reward and punishment for the same regulated subject we illustrate in this paper that food safety outbreaks is not only because of the absence of food safety regulation and supervision but also because of some economic factors such as input capacity constraints these constraints have the ability to encourage food producers to reduce their output quality and supervision is costly because of low inspector to firm ratio this paper classifies input capacity constraints into quality sensitive input capacity constraints and quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and compares equilibrium quantity quality prices and cs under different scenarios the policy implications of this study are that policymakers should limit the total number of food producer by restricting entry or stimulating mergers and acquisition to make firms larges to increase the inspector to firm ratio at least two positive effects will result from decreasing the number of food production firms first decreasing the number of firms increases the probability of catching a violating firm besides policymakers should increase the penalty or fines of violation for example except forfeiture the food producer should be forbidden to enter the food industry forever once it is found guilty of violating quality regulation but punishment alone may not go far enough so policymakers should also offer rewards to food producers who meet the output quality note that the reward gain is more helpful than fine loss based on the characteristics of risk attitudes of human beings second decreasing the number of firms gives existing firms a chance to become bigger and more efficient which will enable them to obtain economy of scale and stronger ability to relieve the constraints of input capacity both of the two effects will stimulate food production firms to improve quality and the improving of efficiency will enable firms to increase quantity as the demand increases a limitation of this study is that it only considers cournot competition maybe different industrial structure may have different interactions with input capacity constraints another competitive structure could be stackelberg competition furthermore there is a possibility that input capacity constraints are both quality and quantity sensitive and future studies could take this condition into consideration besides dynamic model such as used in the study of yang et al 2018 can also be considered in this issue appendix a proof of proposition 1 based on the equilibrium solutions of the three cases we have x i x i 2 α θ 1 3 γ ρ r 2 3 γ θ 1 0 q i q i 2 α θ 1 3 2 γ 1 ρ 5 ρ r 2 5 2 γ θ 1 0 and x i x i 18 α θ 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 r 2 54 45 γ 6 γ 3 4 γ 4 θ 2 0 q

which means the increase of s is more effective than an equal increase of c in holding inequality 22 conclusions are therefore achieved and the proof is complete 
25215,input capacity constraints means a firm cannot make its output decision based on the first order optimal condition of profit maximization because it does not have enough inputs input capacity constraints have a significant effect on production quality and firm competition especially on food safety management this paper tries to provide a new perspective for quality operation in supply chain management it also designs a new mechanism for quality regulation after distinguishing between quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints this paper demonstrates a theoretical analysis about the impact of input capacity constraints on food quality and quality regulation by game theory the results show that both kinds of capacity input constraints lead to a lower level of output quality and consumer surplus but a higher level of prices in this study we design a quality regulation to stimulate the growth of high quality food products more importantly this paper proves that reward is more effective in food quality guarantee programs than punishment or fine based programs the conclusions are helpful for addressing food safety

central government has taken up food safety issue as a key task in its no 1 central document in 2015 http english agri gov cn 1 1 the no 1 central document is the first document of the central government of china announcing key responsibilities for agriculture during the subsequent years food safety incidents happen regularly not only in china but throughout the world liu and ma 2016 taylor et al 2016 the first food contamination incident recorded in the history happened in the ancient roman empire kelth 2012 since then several foodborne illnesses have happened in europe and other developed countries such as the united states during the 1900 1950 period the number of food safety outbreaks peaked during the last half of the 20th century yang et al 2009 harrington 2011 interestingly at the beginning of the 21st century more food safety incidents have occurred in the developing countries particularly in asia and latin america including china brazil india based on the above information we infer that food safety outbreaks have something to do with the development of the economy and the issue should be investigated through the use of economic theory such as input capacity constraints as well as ethics and law disciplines take the case of china an increasing number of food safety incidents are being reported by the media making food safety a focal point of major agricultural issues xue and zhang 2013 as a result studies have proposed ways to improve food safety li 2009 ni and zeng 2009 handschuch et al 2013 chen et al 2015b these studies conclude that lack of laws standards and regulations are the main reasons for food safety outbreaks few studies see lin et al 2010 lentz and barrett 2013 geng et al 2015 have used economic reasoning to understand the effects of regulations on food safety outbreaks recall that food quality is the foundation of food safety and material inputs inherently determine the quality of food we know that inputs are scarce and scarcity could lead to input capacity constraints and could lead to changes in the quantity and quality of output and other competitive decisions made by firms benjaafar et al 2017 jansen and özaltın 2017 cachon et al 2017 and supply chains graves and schoenmeyr 2016 additionally input capacity constraints have significant influence on the food industry because firms under input capacity constraints are inclined to use lower quality of inputs or alternative inputs to produce the same product and to increase profit margins food safety depends on production handling preparation transportation and storage of food in ways that prevent foodborne illnesses this includes routines that should be followed in order to avoid potentially severe health hazards any improper operation of the process no matter intentional or unintentional may result in food pollution or may even lead to food safety accidents outbreaks food safety accidents can result from moral hazard behavior of food producers based on asymmetric information or from input capacity constraints for example quality of orange juice may be affected because only 80 oranges were used instead of 100 a case of input constraint that were required in the production process on the other hand if a producer deliberately uses a wrong input a case of moral hazard in the food production process it could also compromise the food safety generally quality motivation is employed for the latter and punishment is used for the former hence different food safety problems need different regulations previous studies in the literature have focused on the moral hazard problem in food safety however only a few studies see lin et al 2010 lentz and barrett 2013 geng et al 2015 have addressed the issue of input capacity constraints on food safety therefore the objective of this study is to assess the impact of input capacity constraints on food safety and how to make quality regulation more successful specifically we address the issue of quantity and quality sensitive input constraints in the food industry a major issue about input capacity constraints is how it could lead to a decrease in the quality of food products and food safety standards this study contributes to the literature in several ways first this paper aims to model the impact of input capacity constraints on food quality and food safety using game theory second we show differential impacts of quality sensitive and quantity sensitive input capacity constraints on the food industry third we design an effective quality regulation mechanism in order to reduce food safety problems the results of this study should be helpful in designing and reducing input capacity constraints and in developing regulations finally we offer a new perspective in solving food safety issues for agri food markets and food supply chain management we classify input capacity constraints into quantity sensitive and quality sensitive constraints a quantity sensitive input capacity constraint means that the constrained input has a major impact on the quantity of the output while a quality sensitive input capacity constraint has a significant impact on the quality of the output produced lastly we compare the differences in quality and quantity as well as in consumer surplus among the three different scenarios based on symmetric cournot competition the rest of this article is organized as follows the next section sets up the basic model in section 3 we derive the unique equilibrium of our game in this section equilibrium analyses are offered under three different scenarios namely no constraints quantity sensitive and quality sensitive input constraints some major propositions are outlined after comparing the analyses section 4 develops a quality regulation mechanism based on basu and dixit s too small to regulate theory and some significant propositions are presented in this section the last section of the paper provides conclusions and implications of the study here we also provide the major limitations of our study and avenues for future research finally all omitted proofs are presented in the appendix 2 literature review food safety outbreaks is not only a problem in the developing countries but across the world even developed countries such as the unite states cannot be excluded recently rieger et al 2016 investigated food scandal in the german meat industry and found that consumption habits and media usage behaviors impact households responses to food safety outbreaks in another study liu and ma 2016 analyzed food scandals in china and found that media exposure was helpful in securing food safety food safety risks could exist in any part of the food supply chain but the vast majority of food safety outbreaks occur during the food production and processing or due to producing with inferior inputs additionally illegal additives could lead to outbreaks in food safety for example wang et al 2015 concluded that scarcity in raw milk played a significant role in the 2008 milk scandal in china several studies chen et al 2017 lu et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 have investigated the impact of soil and water pollution on food safety in each case the authors found that water and soil pollutions are major factors affecting food safety in china finally a study karp et al 2016 investigated the influence of agricultural practices on food safety and found a positive and significant relationship between agricultural practices and food safety food production and safety standards are widely used in the food industry therefore a plethora of studies especially in developing countries have investigated the impact of food safety standards on food safety for instance jongwanich 2009 concluded that food safety standards of developed countries have a significant influence on the food safety standard in the developing countries and that developing countries benefit from those standards the food safety standards stimulate firms in the developing countries to raise their food quality standards similarly handschuch et al 2013 examined the effects of food safety and quality standards on the growth of small farms in the developing countries the authors found that food standards have a positive and significant effect on small farms quality performance and income finally hou et al 2016 investigated the impacts of food safety standards on international supply chain organization isco and concluded that isco benefits from food safety standards standards ethics and law play a critical role in the food safety problem fagotto 2015 sperling 2010 food safety laws are ameliorating due to food safety problems geng et al 2015 regulations especially quality control regulations are needed to enhance food safety in any economy for example dou et al 2015 investigated the influence of food safety regulation on vegetable exports from china and found that implementation of food safety regulation was helpful in increasing exports from china similarly buckley 2015 investigated the impact of food safety regulation on small food processing firms and found that regulations have significant effects on the interactions between processors and inspectors note that the above studies are examples of moral hazard problem of food producers based on asymmetric information however input capacity constraints offer us a new perspective on food safety regulations see ben elhadj et al 2012 wang et al 2015 chen et al 2015a chen et al 2018 capture the effects of capacity constraints on the restaurant industry and food safety by employing a two stage asymmetric capacity constraints model their study shows that capacity constrains influence both food quantity and quality this is a major study on this issue recall that input capacity constraints impact decisions on price quantity mergers and reputation of firms input capacity constraints could influence food safety risk in the food industry nie and chen 2012 kawasaki and uchida 2016 for instance wang et al 2015 concluded that input capacity constraints played a critical role in food safety the authors argue that scarcity of high quality milk was a major factor in the 2008 milk scandal of china constrained input capacity also impacts industrial development for instance ben elhadj et al 2012 and chen et al 2015a argue that input capacity constraints reduce product quality differences between firms and make the product and by extension the industry more symmetrical or identical food industry is a special sector where consumers care more about quality than quantity kawasaki and uchida 2016 in the early 2000s melumad and ziv 2004 found that firms are fully motivated to reduce output quality under input capacity constraints the authors note that firms prefer to decrease output quality in favor of increasing output quantity the authors illustrated that by decreasing quality one can increase social welfare however results may be different for the food industry recall that product quality is paramount in the food industry as a result keener 2010 and varadaraj 2010 show that food safety standards could be raised by building input capacity or boosting input capacity of food product firms finally rouvière 2016 and parker et al 2016 illustrated that firm size affects food safety risks implying that input capacity constraints have a crucial impact on food safety 3 model and analysis 3 1 basic model consider a duopoly competition industry with an upstream input provider and input capacity constraints downstream firms compete to buy capacity in the upstream market which allocates capacity efficiently denote the downstream firms by i and j and they compete with quantity and quality to maximize their profits we illustrate this competition by a two stage game with a duopoly cournot competition model 3 1 1 consumers both quantity and quality impact a consumer s utility similar to nie 2014 and chen and nie 2014 this paper uses the utility of a representative consumer in the following functional form 2 2 different from nie 2014 chen and nie 2014 this paper considers the effects of quality on consumer utility 1 u x i x j α 2 q i x i α 2 q j x j 1 2 x i x j γ x i x j where α 0 and is a constant representing the total market size γ 0 1 manifests the degree of product substitutability q i and x i i i j are the quality and quantity of the product under consideration given the quality q i the consumer chooses x i to maximize her utility specifically 2 p i α 2 q i x i γ x j note that i j and the above inverse demand function is directly induced by the utility function 1 combining eqs 1 and 2 we get consumer surplus as 3 c s 1 2 x i x j γ x i x j interestingly note that the above consumer surplus expression is only a function of quantities note also that consumers pay for any increase in the quality of the product or any increase in the utility derived from an increase in the quality is offset by an increase in the price of the product 3 1 2 producers the two symmetric downstream firms play a two stage cournot competition game the firms make quality decisions in the first stage and the quantity decisions in the second stage quality of the product has a strong effect on the quantity decision of the firms because higher food quality requires higher quality inputs but recall that higher quality inputs are scarce and can have a significant influence on the quantity of output produced the upstream firm supplies inputs to downstream firms with a unique price efficient and input constrained capacity let us denote by 0 r α the total input of this industry and r i and r j represent the input allocated to firms i and j respectively also note that r i r j r downstream firms maximize their profit by choosing the optional quantity and quality of inputs and the objective function is given as 4 m a x x i q j π i p i x i c i x q α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i where c i x q 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i i i j and is the cost function 3 3 chen et al 2015a nie and chen 2014 have similar costs function of firm i q i 2 2 and x i 2 2 represent the share of costs in quality and quantity respectively the last term of the cost function q i x i is the interaction between the cost of quantity and quality investment note that eq 4 is concave in q i and x i and i i j furthermore similar to nie 2014 and esó et al 2010 this study assumes that the upstream firm distributes resources efficiently and we only pay attention to the downstream firms now the two downstream firms make quality decisions in the first stage and competein quantity in the second stage in the following section we will outline the equilibrium analysis quality quantity price and consumer surplus under three scenarios no constraints benchmark model quantity sensitive input constraints and quality sensitive input constraints note that all equilibrium solutions are obtained by using the backward induction method 3 2 benchmark analysis we use standard duopoly cournot competition structure as the benchmark model following the first order conditions for eq 4 we obtain the equilibrium solution and the equilibrium quality quantity and prices given as follows 5 q i 9 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 6 x i 9 γ 2 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 7 p i 27 2 γ 2 α 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 we define a parameter ρ q i q j x i x j 9 9 γ 2 and note that ρ 1 9 8 for γ 0 1 this parameter will be used later substituting eq 6 into eq 3 one can obtain the consumer surplus cs in equilibrium cs is given as 8 c s 9 2 γ 2 1 γ 3 γ 2 α 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 2 3 3 quantity sensitive capacity constraints quantity sensitive input capacity constraints means that the input capacity constraints mainly result from increased output or quantity produced which is quite common considering quantity sensitive input constraints eq 4 is reconstructed as 9 m a x x i q j π i α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i s t θ 1 x i x i r where θ 1 is the transformation efficiency and we assume that the two firms have identical transformation efficiency wang et al 2017 high θ means low efficiency and vice versa furthermore we assume that θ 1 1 which means one unit of output needs more than one unit of input decreasing returns to scale in other words x i r i θ 1 i i j under the binding constraints condition or θ 1 x i x j r eq 9 also includes the following equilibrium conditions on quality quantity and prices 10 q i 3 2 γ r 2 α θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 11 x i r 2 θ 1 12 p i 1 7 γ 2 r 2 α 7 2 γ θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 and the lagrange multiplier of eq 9 or λ 12 γ 2 γ 2 r 4 3 γ α θ 1 2 5 2 γ θ 1 2 0 for all θ 1 1 and γ 0 1 finally the consumer surplus cs under quantity sensitive capacity constraints can be shown as 13 c s 1 γ r 2 4 θ 1 2 3 4 quality sensitive capacity constraints recall that there is scarcity of higher quality inputs and as a result fewer resources are being used in other words as the output quality increases the total input resources which are required to produce the product will also decrease based on this assumption we assess the effect of quality sensitive input capacity constraints on the equilibrium quality quantity and prices the objective function of the firm under quality sensitive input capacity constraints can be written as 14 m a x x i q j π i α 2 q i x i γ x j x i 1 2 q i 2 1 2 x i 2 q i x i s t θ 1 q i q i r where θ 2 has the same meaning as θ 1 then solving eq 14 we obtain the equilibrium quality quantity and prices under quality sensitive input capacity constraints as follows 15 q i r 2 θ 2 16 x i r 2 α θ 2 2 3 γ θ 2 17 p i 5 γ r 4 α θ 2 2 3 γ θ 2 and from eq 14 we also know λ 18 α θ 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 r 3 2 γ 3 γ 2 θ 1 2 0 for all θ 2 1 and γ 0 1 finally the equilibrium consumer surplus for the above case can be shown as 18 c s 1 γ r 2 α θ 2 2 4 3 γ 2 θ 1 2 3 5 comparison analysis in this section we compare the equilibrium output quality price and cs among the above three cases first we need to make the following assumption assumption θ 1 ρ θ 2 remarks the equilibrium from the benchmark model shows that 1 ρ q i q j x i x j 9 9 γ 2 9 8 in order to make the input capacity constraints boundary under the two different cases same or θ 1 x i x j r θ 2 q i q j the equation θ 1 ρ θ 2 always holds otherwise it is impossible to make a reasonable comparison based on the analyses we obtains the following two propositions proposition 1 the quantity and quality under the three conditions unconstrained quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints satisfy the following relationships x i x i x and q i q i q i i j proof see appendix a remarks proposition 1 shows that both equilibrium output quality and quantity under the two input capacity constraint cases are lower than under the standard cournot competition this implies that input capacity constraints tend to decrease quality and quantity of output more importantly proposition 1 shows that output quantity under competitive quality sensitive input capacity constraints is less than that under the competitive quantity sensitive input capacity constraints however the relationship between output qualities for the two cases is just the reverse therefore quality sensitive input capacity constraints have worse impacts on the food industry and could possibly lead to more cases of food safety breakdown or food contamination the policy implication of proposition 1 is that due to input capacity constraints the food quality reduction is a forced decision by the food manufacturer under this condition the government could incentivize food production firms to relax their input capacity constraints for example firms can alleviate their input capacity constraints by merging with other similar firms froeb et al 2003 we should also note that there is a possibility that input capacity constraints affect both quality and quantity simultaneously or f x i q i f x j q j r and that will make things even worse proposition 2 the output price and consumer surplus under the three conditions no constraints quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and quality sensitive input capacity constraints satisfy the following relationships p i p i p i and c s i c s i c s i i j proof see appendix a proof equilibrium prices of capacity input constraints are higher than prices for no input constraint and the price under quantity sensitive input capacity constraint is the highest because price is a monotonically decreasing function of quantity on the other hand consumer surplus under constrained input condition is less compared to no input constraint case the consumer surplus is the lowest under the quantity sensitive input capacity constraints condition finally firm s profit π and consumer surplus under different conditions are too complex to compare propositions 1 and 2 imply that input capacity constraints reduce consumer welfare by decreasing equilibrium quality quality consumer surplus and increasing equilibrium output prices the conclusions derived above can easily be expanded to a multi firm competitive structure maybe it is not easy to remove input capacity constraints but there are some things we can do to stimulate firms to raise the quality of their products and prevent or control food safety breakdowns therefore in the next section we offer a quality regulation mechanism that could be used to motivate firms to increase quality of their food product to accomplish this our proposal uses basu and dixit 2017 too small to regulate theory 4 quality regulation mechanism design a reasonable way to remove or minimize the effects of input capacity constraints on quality is to lower θ by technical progress but technical progress is a time consuming phenomenon therefore we design a suitable quality regulation mechanism to curb the urge for decreasing food quality especially in the food industry in this section we expand the model to an n firm setting following basu and dixit 2017 we consider n small firms subject to quality q q regulation which is costly to comply with each firm s profit is denoted by π l if it complies and if it violates the requirement and the violation cannot be traced then the profit is π h π l but if the violating firm is inspected and the violation is caught then it will be punished in such a case the profit of the violating firm is normalized to 0 it also pays a fine c different from basu and dixit 2017 we add an extra punishment fine c if the firm is caught violating the quality regulation in this paper we assume that the government has m n inspectors to enforce the quality regulation each inspector chooses randomly a firm to inspect without any duplication for any random firm the probability that it is not visited by an inspector is p pr first inspector goes to one of the other n 1 firms pr second inspector goes to one of the other n 2 out of the remaining n 1 firms pr mth inspector goes to one of the other n m out of the remaining n m 1 firms 19 n 1 n n 2 n 1 n m n m 1 n m n as a result the expected profit of the violating firm with getting away from being inspected is given by 20 p π h 1 p 0 c n m n π h therefore successful deterrence requires n m n π h π l or 21 m n π h π l π h c from the inequality 21 we get the following proposition proposition 3 the increase of n and π h makes the quality regulation easier to fail while the increase in c and π l makes the quality regulation more likely to be successful proof the conclusions of this proposition are obtained by direct inspection of inequality 21 conclusions are therefore achieved and the proof is complete remarks proposition 3 implies the number of firms has a significant impact on the quality regulation high payoff stimulates food product firms to violate quality regulation while too many supervised samples increase the probability of violating firms to get away from being caught and make the quality regulation less likely to be successful low probability of being caught for violation combined with less punishment fines makes the food product firms prefer to take the risk of violating quality especially when it is confronted with input capacity constraints although the punishment has the power to prohibit cheating behavior the amount of fine is not always enough moreover bernheim and whiston 1990 conclude that good behavior is not always sustained by the threat of punishment therefore we should consider rewards beside punishment if the regulator adds reward s to π l when the firm complies with the regulation and the regulation rule could be rewritten as 22 m n π h π l s π h c proposition 4 reward s makes the quality regulation mechanism easier and successful and s is more effective than s in case of quality regulation proof see the appendix a remarks a good regulation mechanism should have a balance between punishment and reward prospect theory indicates that reward has more power to regulate people s behavior than punishment and we prove this conclusion theoretically people may say that reward will raise government expenditures that may be true but reward also saves on inspection costs cost related to inspector s salary transportation inspection fees etc more importantly reward has the isolation effect good from bad if a firm does not apply for the reward we have more confidence in believing that the firm does not satisfy the quality regulation the policy implication of proposition 4 is that based on the difficultly of implementation and high costs of supervision the government could propose high quality reward as an incentive to food producing firms to enhance food quality and raise food safety standards 5 a simple case study all the analyses above can be outlined by the following logical flow chart fig 1 the quantity and quality of food impact consumers utility utility maximization choices of consumers influence the price of food production price and costs affect firms profits profit maximization behavior of firms and input capacity constraints determine the equilibrium quality regulators design quality regulations with rewards and penalties based on the number of firms and supervisors while regulated quality influences consumers utility below we supply a hypothetical case to show the influence of input capacity constraints on food safety problem suppose the safe quality level of orange juice is 100 and there are 100 oranges which can be used to produce 100 l orange juice with 100 quality level if the demand for orange juice is also 100 l then it can be met by 100 l safe orange juice produced using 100 oranges if the demand for orange juice is 120 l while the total number of oranges is still 100 then the average quality level of orange juice produced will fall below the safe level 100 in another case if the total demand quantity of orange juice is still 100 l and 100 oranges can be used but some consumers claim that they only purchase orange juice with 120 quality level then the quality of the rest juice for other consumers will fall below 100 quality level both the two cases will result in food safety incidents while increases punishment is useless in reality the 2008 milk scandal of china is one of the typical food safety incidents which results from limited supply of milk input capacity constraints 4 4 as the increase of milk demand in china milk production firms such as sanlu group co ltd were found adding melamine to pure milk product to fulfill the nutrition standard of milk illegally melamine added milk is noxious to consumers and make many children suffer from kidney stones 6 conclusions and discussions food safety is not a single country problem but a worldwide problem with global connectivity and global trade food safety outbreaks can happen at any time and anywhere and losses both human and financial could be significant furthermore food safety problems are becoming a serious issue in emerging economies including china as a result the central government of china has taken major steps to enhance food safety in china in many cases of food safety outbreaks people tend to attribute it to poor technology in food production and inefficient and ineffective supply chain management as a result most of the existing studies advocate raising the standards of food safety and production enacting more severe laws or using ethics pressure to guarantee food safety however studies in the literature fail to address the food safety problem as an economic problem this is because there is inherent laws of economics in the cases of food safety outbreaks and input capacity constraints is one such law for the regulation of food safety most attention has been given to punishing the firms that break the regulation although some regulatory systems involve incentives those incentives such as promotion are only given to the supervisors results from this study show that regulators should give the incentives to food producers in order to increase efficiency of the food regulation system the principles of management also reveal that we should encourage trade offs between reward and punishment for the same regulated subject we illustrate in this paper that food safety outbreaks is not only because of the absence of food safety regulation and supervision but also because of some economic factors such as input capacity constraints these constraints have the ability to encourage food producers to reduce their output quality and supervision is costly because of low inspector to firm ratio this paper classifies input capacity constraints into quality sensitive input capacity constraints and quantity sensitive input capacity constraints and compares equilibrium quantity quality prices and cs under different scenarios the policy implications of this study are that policymakers should limit the total number of food producer by restricting entry or stimulating mergers and acquisition to make firms larges to increase the inspector to firm ratio at least two positive effects will result from decreasing the number of food production firms first decreasing the number of firms increases the probability of catching a violating firm besides policymakers should increase the penalty or fines of violation for example except forfeiture the food producer should be forbidden to enter the food industry forever once it is found guilty of violating quality regulation but punishment alone may not go far enough so policymakers should also offer rewards to food producers who meet the output quality note that the reward gain is more helpful than fine loss based on the characteristics of risk attitudes of human beings second decreasing the number of firms gives existing firms a chance to become bigger and more efficient which will enable them to obtain economy of scale and stronger ability to relieve the constraints of input capacity both of the two effects will stimulate food production firms to improve quality and the improving of efficiency will enable firms to increase quantity as the demand increases a limitation of this study is that it only considers cournot competition maybe different industrial structure may have different interactions with input capacity constraints another competitive structure could be stackelberg competition furthermore there is a possibility that input capacity constraints are both quality and quantity sensitive and future studies could take this condition into consideration besides dynamic model such as used in the study of yang et al 2018 can also be considered in this issue appendix a proof of proposition 1 based on the equilibrium solutions of the three cases we have x i x i 2 α θ 1 3 γ ρ r 2 3 γ θ 1 0 q i q i 2 α θ 1 3 2 γ 1 ρ 5 ρ r 2 5 2 γ θ 1 0 and x i x i 18 α θ 2 18 9 γ 3 γ 2 γ 3 r 2 54 45 γ 6 γ 3 4 γ 4 θ 2 0 q

which means the increase of s is more effective than an equal increase of c in holding inequality 22 conclusions are therefore achieved and the proof is complete 
25216,the health of natural ecosystems including mangrove wetlands is being severely challenged by biological invasions worldwide for a holistic evaluation of ecosystem health researchers have commonly measured the eco exergy of the system in question mangrove wetlands depend on their macrobenthic fauna and are threatened by the exotic cordgrass spartina alterniflora particularly in south china however the effect of s alterniflora on the health status of macrobenthic faunal community in such wetlands is still unclear in this study in zhanjiang china eco exergy was measured to compare the health status of macrobenthic faunal communities in 1 an avicennia marina monoculture vs an s alterniflora invaded a marina stand an a marina and s alterniflora mixture and in 2 an unvegetated shoal vs an s alterniflora invaded shoal that had rapidly become an s alterniflora monoculture macrobenthic faunal community eco exergy and biomass but not specific eco exergy were lower in s alterniflora invaded mangrove habitats than in non invaded ones in terms of eco exergy mollusks were the dominant group in all habitats and were mainly responsible for the decrease in eco exergy in the invaded habitats differences in the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community in s alterniflora invaded habitats were mainly associated with differences in sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics in general and with the greater plant density in invaded habitats in particular the results indicate that the health of the macrobenthic faunal community in mangrove wetlands has been reduced by s alterniflora invasion and the conservation of ecosystem health in mangrove wetlands will require eradication of s alterniflora keywords ecosystem health

linares et al 2018a b in the current research we measured the effect of s alterniflora invasion on the eco exergy of the macrobenthic fauna community in a zhanjiang mangrove wetland we compared s

e which is located along the coastal shoal of the leizhou peninsula guangdong china the reserve lies in a northern tropical subtropical climate zone the mean annual temperature is 22 3 c and there is no frost at any time during the year the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1500 to 2000 mm and most of the precipitation occurs during the rainy or monsoon season chen et al 2015 the intertidal zone is characterized by one or two tidal cycles per day with an approximately 2 m tidal range http ocean cnss com cn the reserve was listed by the ramsar international convention as an internationally important wetland in 2002 all sampling habitats were in the mangrove area of gaoqiao town this is the core zone of the reserve it occupies the largest continuous area and has the best preserved mangroves in the reserve the forefront sea land eco tone of mangroves is a large area of unvegetated shoal defined here as without macrophytes or with only some seedlings avicennia marina a pioneer mangrove species colonized the area first and developed as a short and sparse shrub monoculture zhang et al 2009 chen et al 2015 about 10 years ago the exotic grass s alterniflora was naturally transported and introduced to the mudflat in the gaoqiao mangroves and rapidly spread over a large area of the previously unvegetated shoal lin and lu 2011 s alterniflora also invaded the

sample the same area before and after invasion as an alternative we sampled invaded and non invaded areas that were otherwise similar and we reasonably assumed that the non invaded areas represented the pre invasion condition in the results we describe differences in invaded and non invaded areas in the discussion we infer that these differences resulted from s alterniflora invasion more specifically we compared a non invaded a marina monoculture am with an s alterniflora invaded a marina stand mix and we compared an unvegetated shoal us with an s alterniflora invaded shoal that had rapidly become an s alterniflora monoculture sa in a previous study in the same location macrobenthic faunal community indices were unaffected by interactions between sampling season wet summer and dry winter and habitat chen et al 2015 thus from 11 to 25 january 2015 we sampled the macrobenthic fauna during the winter season and during the low tide period when the habitats were not inundated four plots 10 m 10 m were randomly chosen within each of the four habitats as replicates the plots were separated by at least 100 m all habitats were in the same low tide zone and were inundated and exposed to the same daily tidal cycle fig 1 2 3 investigation of environmental factors the sampling for macrobenthic fauna in the current study was done at the same time and in the same plots as the determination of vegetation characteristics and the sampling for sediment physicochemical properties as reported by chen et al 2018b in addition to determining the changes in the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community the current study used the raw data from the report of chen et al 2018b to determine whether vegetation and physicochemical properties were correlated with macrobenthic faunal eco exergy 2 4 macrobenthic fauna sampling as noted in the previous section the same plots and sampling dates were used for the determination of macrobenthic fauna and environmental factors and the environmental data used in this study were published by chen et al 2018b whereas the latter study reported the community structure of macrobenthic fauna the current study reports the biomasses and eco exergy of taxonomic groups of macrobenthic fauna as previously indicated by chen et al 2018b sampling for macrobenthic fauna was done before sampling for environmental factors to reduce the chances that mobile macrobenthic fauna would escape in response to sampling disturbance in each plot three subplots 50 50 cm were randomly designated and all macrobenthic fauna from the sediment surface of each subplot were collected using a hand held macrobenthos d type net each subplot was then dug to a depth of 50 cm to obtain a block of sediment with a shovel the sediment was placed in sealed nylon bags to prevent the macrobenthic fauna from escaping washed stirred manually and poured gently through a 0 5 mm sieve the benthic organisms collected from the sediment surface and retained on the sieve were stored in a 75 alcohol solution the macrobenthic fauna were identified to species and counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope and the total fresh weight of each species was determined the samples from each subplot were pooled to yield one sample per plot leading to four replicates per habitat the procedures for sample collection and data analysis followed the standards specified for oceanographic marine biological survey china national standardization management committee 2007 2 5 calculation of macrobenthic faunal eco exergy and specific eco exergy the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community i e the eco exergy of the fauna per unit area was computedusing eq 1 1 e x 18 7kj g i 0 n c i β i where 18 7 kj g is the mean eco exergy of detritus or dead organic matter ci is the biomass of the ith species g m 2 and βi is the weighting factor of the genetic information based on kullbach s measurement of genome size and the complexity of the ith species jørgensen et al 1995 fu 2015 lu et al 2015 two methods are usually used to calculate the β value e g the suggested β value swf is used directly table s3 jørgensen et al 2005 jørgensen and nielsen 2007 in contrast the β value is calculated from the c value cv which is the amount of dna contained within a haploid nucleus as measured by the number of base pairs fu 2015 lu et al 2015 in the cv method the weighting factor β is calculated by eq 2 2 β 1 ln 20165000000 c 7 43 105 where 7 43 105 is the contribution of detritus to the eco exergy in g l and c is the total quantity of dna in the diploid genome of the faunal cell in pico grams pg where 1 pg 0 98 109 base pairs the multiplication of c in pg by 1 65 108 indicates the number of nucleotide triplets which is the maximum coding capacity of the haploid genome because each adjacent triplet of nucleotides corresponds to a transcribed rna signal fonseca et al 2000 graur and li 2000 twenty is the number of possible amino acids

biodiversity will require reductions in biological invasions bradley et al 2011 simberloff et al 2013 the exotic cordgrass s alterniflora is a highly successful invasive plant on coastlines worldwide including coastlines with mangrove forests wang et al 2005 zhang et al 2012 macrobenthic fauna are also sensitive to disturbances or stresses and are therefore useful indicators of changes in ecosystem functioning and health ogbeibu and oribhabor 2002 previous studies have focused on the effects of s alterniflora on the taxonomic diversity functional diversity and trophic structure diversity of macrobenthic fauna in mangrove wetlands feng et al 2014 chen and ma 2018 feng et al 2018 chen et al 2018a 2018b these earlier studies could be usefully augmented by a more holistic assessment based on the changes in eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community caused by s alterniflora invasion in the current study invasion by s alterniflora led to a remarkable decline in the eco exergy and biomass of the macrobenthic faunal community in both the a marina stand and unvegetated shoal the specific eco exergy however changed little in response to the invasion as noted in the material and methods we assumed that the non invaded habitats in the current study were representative of pre invasion habitats we therefore inferred that the differences between invaded and non invaded habitats resulted from s alterniflora invasion marchi et al 2011 reported that invasion of lake chozas león nw spain by the exotic swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii caused a gradual decrease in eco exergy of the submerged vegetation due to grazing by crayfish on submerged plants and in mediterranean sea the structure of seagrass posidonia oceanica ecosystem was degraded and finally replaced by alien or native plants which was consistently shown to loss in macrobenthic fauna species richness and biomass and was paralleled by a reduction of exergy montefalcone et al 2015 all these studies confirmed that invaded ecosystems tend to reduce their eco exergy and to move toward thermodynamic equilibrium following degradation jørgensen 2005 in the current study s alterniflora invasion reduced both macrobenthic faunal biomass and eco exergy the results are consistent with those of salas et al 2005 who also predicted that reductions in eco exergy would be associated with reduced functional redundancy buffer capacity resilience and system complexity in another recent study conducted in the same location as the current study however the macrobenthic faunal shannon weiner diversity simpson s diversity margalef s species richness and pielou s evenness were not significantly affected by s alterniflora invasion chen et al 2018b determining why s alterniflora invasion reduced macrobenthic faunal eco exergy and biomass but did not affect macrobenthic faunal biodiversity will require additional research the consideration of eco exergy along with abundance biomass and biodiversity data provides a more complete understanding of the health of a macrobenthic faunal community than consideration of any of these properties alone tang et al 2013 similarly reported that the status of mature ecosystems could be effectively evaluated based on benthic faunal eco exergy and species biodiversity abundance and biomass although s alterniflora invasion tended to increase arthropod and annelid biomasses in the current study invasion significantly reduced mollusk biomass and the β value and c value were higher for mollusks than for arthropods and annelids table s3 and http www genomesize com index php thus the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community was significantly reduced by s alterniflora invasion substantial research has indicated that changes in eco exergy are often closely related to changes in the biomass of the associated organisms luo 2008 lu et al 2011 fu 2015 in the current study the biomass of macrobenthos was significantly decreased by s alterniflora invasion in all types of mangrove habitat fig 2 the effects of vegetation characteristics and sediment physicochemical properties on eco exergy of macrobenthos were similar to the effects of vegetation characteristics and sediment physicochemical properties on macrobenthic faunal biodiversity biomass and abundance tang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 macroinvertebrates living belowground e g macrobenthic fauna in the current study may be especially sensitive to reductions in food resources as indicated by increases in the c p ratio and c n ratios and in the micro space available for habitation and burrowing kristensen and kostka 2005 qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 increases in plant density reduce the suitability of the habitat for macrobenthos in s alterniflora invaded mangrove habitats kon et al 2011 the extensive stems of s alterniflora can severely restrict the mobility of macrobenthic fauna qin et al 2010 similarly the accompanying extensive root systems make it more difficult for macrobenthic fauna especially mollusks to form burrows in the sediment kristensen and kostka 2005 wang et al 2014 furthermore the organic matter generated by mangrove litter that accumulates in the invaded habitats may negatively affect the biomass and abundance of macrobenthos because of its high polyphenolic and tannin content and low ph lee 1999 chen et al 2015 the eco exergy of macrobenthos was significantly lower if calculated by the suggested β value swf than by the c value cv regardless of habitat this mainly resulted from the different biological information included in the two calculations a linear correlation was found between evolution time and the logarithm of exswf while the cv method emphasizes species attributes at the cellular and organismic level cell size and cell division rate etc and each method has its advantages bennett and leitch 2005 gregory 2005 jørgensen 2015 moreover whether based on the swf or cv method the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community significantly decreased following invasion of mangrove habitats by the exotic cordgrass s alterniflora in zhanjiang china we infer that this invasion has reduced the stability and resilience of the macrobenthic faunal community the results of this study indicate that biological invasions could seriously disturb the thermodynamic self organization of invaded ecosystems marchi et al 2010 the health of local mangrove wetland ecosystems in southeast china probably depends on the control and more likely the removal s alterniflora 4 1 limitations of this study one limitation of the current study is that the two habitats in each comparison were assumed to represent a chronosequence it is reasonable that the chronosequences or space for time substitution are often used in studies of ecological succession or a long term development walker et al 2010 srivathsa et al 2018 another more important concern is that the replicate plots could be considered pseudoreplicates the results of this study should therefore be viewed with appropriate caution and a related concern is that the study depended on correlation analyses rather than on experimentation 5 conclusions by comparing habitats with and without exotic s alterniflora we found that the presence of exotic s alterniflora led to significant decreases in the eco exergy and biomass of the macrobenthic faunal community in a previously unvegetated shoal vs an a marina stand more specifically exotic s alterniflora significantly reduced the eco exergy of mollusks which were largely responsible for the decrease of macrobenthic faunal eco exergy variation in the eco exergy of the mangrove macrobenthic faunal community was mainly associated with sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics increased plant density due to s alterniflora invasion apparently limited the distribution of macrobenthic fauna mainly mollusks resulting in a reduction in the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community in mangrove habitats the relationships between eco exergy and sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics however were assessed by correlation rather than by experimentation it follows that we must be cautious in assigning causality thus additional research is needed to confirm and clarify these findings acknowledgements we

25216,the health of natural ecosystems including mangrove wetlands is being severely challenged by biological invasions worldwide for a holistic evaluation of ecosystem health researchers have commonly measured the eco exergy of the system in question mangrove wetlands depend on their macrobenthic fauna and are threatened by the exotic cordgrass spartina alterniflora particularly in south china however the effect of s alterniflora on the health status of macrobenthic faunal community in such wetlands is still unclear in this study in zhanjiang china eco exergy was measured to compare the health status of macrobenthic faunal communities in 1 an avicennia marina monoculture vs an s alterniflora invaded a marina stand an a marina and s alterniflora mixture and in 2 an unvegetated shoal vs an s alterniflora invaded shoal that had rapidly become an s alterniflora monoculture macrobenthic faunal community eco exergy and biomass but not specific eco exergy were lower in s alterniflora invaded mangrove habitats than in non invaded ones in terms of eco exergy mollusks were the dominant group in all habitats and were mainly responsible for the decrease in eco exergy in the invaded habitats differences in the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community in s alterniflora invaded habitats were mainly associated with differences in sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics in general and with the greater plant density in invaded habitats in particular the results indicate that the health of the macrobenthic faunal community in mangrove wetlands has been reduced by s alterniflora invasion and the conservation of ecosystem health in mangrove wetlands will require eradication of s alterniflora keywords ecosystem health

surface of each subplot were collected using a hand held macrobenthos d type net each subplot was then dug to a depth of 50 cm to obtain a block of sediment with a shovel the sediment was placed in sealed nylon bags to prevent the macrobenthic fauna from escaping washed stirred manually and poured gently through a 0 5 mm sieve the benthic organisms collected from the sediment surface and retained on the sieve were stored in a 75 alcohol solution the macrobenthic fauna were identified to species and counted with the aid of a dissecting microscope and the total fresh weight of each species was determined the samples from each subplot were pooled to yield one sample per plot leading to four replicates per habitat the procedures for sample collection and data analysis followed the standards specified for oceanographic marine biological survey china national standardization management committee 2007 2 5 calculation of macrobenthic faunal eco exergy and specific eco exergy the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community i e the eco exergy of the fauna per unit area was computedusing eq 1 1 e x 18 7kj g i 0 n c i β i where 18 7 kj g is the mean eco exergy of detritus or dead organic matter ci is the biomass of the ith species g m 2 and βi is the weighting factor of the genetic information based on kullbach s measurement of genome size and the complexity of the ith species jørgensen et al 1995 fu 2015 lu et al 2015 two methods are usually used to calculate the β value e g the suggested β value swf is used directly table s3 jørgensen et al 2005 jørgensen and nielsen 2007 in contrast the β value is calculated from the c value cv which is the amount of dna contained within a haploid nucleus as measured by the number of base pairs fu 2015 lu et al 2015 in the cv method the weighting factor β is calculated by eq 2 2 β 1 ln 20165000000 c 7 43 105 where 7 43 105 is the contribution of detritus to the eco exergy in g l and c is the total quantity of dna in the diploid genome of the faunal cell in pico grams pg where 1 pg 0 98 109 base pairs the multiplication of c in pg by 1 65 108 indicates the number of nucleotide triplets which is the maximum coding capacity of the haploid genome because each adjacent triplet of nucleotides corresponds to a transcribed rna signal fonseca et al 2000 graur and li 2000 twenty is the number of possible amino acids that can be coded by each triplet all c values used in this study were obtained from the animal genome size database http www genomesize com index php for those species not in that database their mean c value for their genus family or order was used fu 2015 the specific eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community i e the eco exergy per unit mass of the fauna was computed using eq 3 3 sp e x 18

differences in eco exergy exswf and excv and specific eco exergy spexswf and spexcv of the macrobenthic faunal community in the two comparisons of two habitats am vs mix and sa vs us paired samples t

investigate the relationships between environmental factors these data were obtained from chen et al 2018b and the changes in macrobenthic faunal eco exergy associated with s alterniflora invasion all macrobenthic fauna groups were included in the rda analysis and the environmental properties that were significantly related to eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community are shown in the biplot

biodiversity will require reductions in biological invasions bradley et al 2011 simberloff et al 2013 the exotic cordgrass s alterniflora is a highly successful invasive plant on coastlines worldwide including coastlines with mangrove forests wang et al 2005 zhang et al 2012 macrobenthic fauna are also sensitive to disturbances or stresses and are therefore useful indicators of changes in ecosystem functioning and health ogbeibu and oribhabor 2002 previous studies have focused on the effects of s alterniflora on the taxonomic diversity functional diversity and trophic structure diversity of macrobenthic fauna in mangrove wetlands feng et al 2014 chen and ma 2018 feng et al 2018 chen et al 2018a 2018b these earlier studies could be usefully augmented by a more holistic assessment based on the changes in eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community caused by s alterniflora invasion in the current study invasion by s alterniflora led to a remarkable decline in the eco exergy and biomass of the macrobenthic faunal community in both the a marina stand and unvegetated shoal the specific eco exergy however changed little in response to the invasion as noted in the material and methods we assumed that the non invaded habitats in the current study were representative of pre invasion habitats we therefore inferred that the differences between invaded and non invaded habitats resulted from s alterniflora invasion marchi et al 2011 reported that invasion of lake chozas león nw spain by the exotic swamp crayfish procambarus clarkii caused a gradual decrease in eco exergy of the submerged vegetation due to grazing by crayfish on submerged plants and in mediterranean sea the structure of seagrass posidonia oceanica ecosystem was degraded and finally replaced by alien or native plants which was consistently shown to loss in macrobenthic fauna species richness and biomass and was paralleled by a reduction of exergy montefalcone et al 2015 all these studies confirmed that invaded ecosystems tend to reduce their eco exergy and to move toward thermodynamic equilibrium following degradation jørgensen 2005 in the current study s alterniflora invasion reduced both macrobenthic faunal biomass and eco exergy the results are consistent with those of salas et al 2005 who also predicted that reductions in eco exergy would be associated with reduced functional redundancy buffer capacity resilience and system complexity in another recent study conducted in the same location as the current study however the macrobenthic faunal shannon weiner diversity simpson s diversity margalef s species richness and pielou s evenness were not significantly affected by s alterniflora invasion chen et al 2018b determining why s alterniflora invasion reduced macrobenthic faunal eco exergy and biomass but did not affect macrobenthic faunal biodiversity will require additional research the consideration of eco exergy along with abundance biomass and biodiversity data provides a more complete understanding of the health of a macrobenthic faunal community than consideration of any of these properties alone tang et al 2013 similarly reported that the status of mature ecosystems could be effectively evaluated based on benthic faunal eco exergy and species biodiversity abundance and biomass although s alterniflora invasion tended to increase arthropod and annelid biomasses in the current study invasion significantly reduced mollusk biomass and the β value and c value were higher for mollusks than for arthropods and annelids table s3 and http www genomesize com index php thus the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community was significantly reduced by s alterniflora invasion substantial research has indicated that changes in eco exergy are often closely related to changes in the biomass of the associated organisms luo 2008 lu et al 2011 fu 2015 in the current study the biomass of macrobenthos was significantly decreased by s alterniflora invasion in all types of mangrove habitat fig 2 the effects of vegetation characteristics and sediment physicochemical properties on eco exergy of macrobenthos were similar to the effects of vegetation characteristics and sediment physicochemical properties on macrobenthic faunal biodiversity biomass and abundance tang et al 2013 chen et al 2015 macroinvertebrates living belowground e g macrobenthic fauna in the current study may be especially sensitive to reductions in food resources as indicated by increases in the c p ratio and c n ratios and in the micro space available for habitation and burrowing kristensen and kostka 2005 qin et al 2010 wang et al 2014 chen et al 2015 increases in plant density reduce the suitability of the habitat for macrobenthos in s alterniflora invaded mangrove habitats kon et al 2011 the extensive stems of s alterniflora can severely restrict the mobility of macrobenthic fauna qin et al 2010 similarly the accompanying extensive root systems make it more difficult for macrobenthic fauna especially mollusks to form burrows in the sediment kristensen and kostka 2005 wang et al 2014 furthermore the organic matter generated by mangrove litter that accumulates in the invaded habitats may negatively affect the biomass and abundance of macrobenthos because of its high polyphenolic and tannin content and low ph lee 1999 chen et al 2015 the eco exergy of macrobenthos was significantly lower if calculated by the suggested β value swf than by the c value cv regardless of habitat this mainly resulted from the different biological information included in the two calculations a linear correlation was found between evolution time and the logarithm of exswf while the cv method emphasizes species attributes at the cellular and organismic level cell size and cell division rate etc and each method has its advantages bennett and leitch 2005 gregory 2005 jørgensen 2015 moreover whether based on the swf or cv method the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community significantly decreased following invasion of mangrove habitats by the exotic cordgrass s alterniflora in zhanjiang china we infer that this invasion has reduced the stability and resilience of the macrobenthic faunal community the results of this study indicate that biological invasions could seriously disturb the thermodynamic self organization of invaded ecosystems marchi et al 2010 the health of local mangrove wetland ecosystems in southeast china probably depends on the control and more likely the removal s alterniflora 4 1 limitations of this study one limitation of the current study is that the two habitats in each comparison were assumed to represent a chronosequence it is reasonable that the chronosequences or space for time substitution are often used in studies of ecological succession or a long term development walker et al 2010 srivathsa et al 2018 another more important concern is that the replicate plots could be considered pseudoreplicates the results of this study should therefore be viewed with appropriate caution and a related concern is that the study depended on correlation analyses rather than on experimentation 5 conclusions by comparing habitats with and without exotic s alterniflora we found that the presence of exotic s alterniflora led to significant decreases in the eco exergy and biomass of the macrobenthic faunal community in a previously unvegetated shoal vs an a marina stand more specifically exotic s alterniflora significantly reduced the eco exergy of mollusks which were largely responsible for the decrease of macrobenthic faunal eco exergy variation in the eco exergy of the mangrove macrobenthic faunal community was mainly associated with sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics increased plant density due to s alterniflora invasion apparently limited the distribution of macrobenthic fauna mainly mollusks resulting in a reduction in the eco exergy of the macrobenthic faunal community in mangrove habitats the relationships between eco exergy and sediment physicochemical properties and vegetation characteristics however were assessed by correlation rather than by experimentation it follows that we must be cautious in assigning causality thus additional research is needed to confirm and clarify these findings acknowledgements we

25217,intraguild competition is a complex phenomenon that shapes parasitoid communities when several species of parasitoids oviposit within the same individual host a complex phenomenon of larval competitive interaction occurs within the same guild there is a specialization in competitive strategies sometimes multiparasitism is avoided but some species are facultative hyperparasitoids predators of their competitors as these interactions occur within a very small host and during a brief period of time and that direct observation is very difficult to achieve we used an alternative methodological approach we analyzed intraguild host competition mechanisms via the combination of a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models thurstonian competition model and set theory these models were fitted via a reversible jump bayesian model selection procedure to a series of competition experiments data using larvae of three species of gonatocerus spp hymenoptera mymaridae egg parasitoids of the sharpshooter tapajosa rubromarginata hemiptera cicadellidae as a case of study this study tests the influence of intrinsic interspecific competition between inmature stages within on an individual host and parasitoid arrival order among the three parasitoid species the results showed that the species differed in competitive behavior some species were better competitors than others individuals arriving earlier had a competitive advantage the weaker species were able to outcompete the stronger ones if the time advantage was longer than 18 h all the species avoided already parasitized hosts but in different degrees the functional response was also different with the best competitors having shorter estimated handling times using this analytical approach on a conventional experimental setup we gained insights in the mechanism of competition both on interference and exploitation and in terms of host selection all in a single analysis keywords thurstone model functional response gonatocerus sp tapajosa rubromarginata biological control egg parasitoid 1 introduction intraguild competition is a key phenomenon for parasitoid communities polis et al 1989 most solitary or gregarious endophagous parasitoids require a full host insect to complete their own development vinson and ables 1980 so if there are more than one parasitoid species within the same host a complex phenomenon of competitive interference and predation takes place volkoff and colazza 1992 pennacchio and strand 2006 competition between parasitoids can be extrinsic adult adult or intrinsic adult larva or larva larva godfray 1994 the analysis of this interaction has two aspects of interest 1 it helps to understand how parasitoid insect communities are structured and 2 it is important when designing a biological control program with several controlling species competing with each other among the most common difficulties found among studies of competition among parasitoids are those of observing competition within the host harvey et al 2013 if this is also very small as in the case of egg parasitoids and the interactions occur in a very short time direct observation of this phenomenon is very difficult then complex experimental designs and modeling are alternative procedures being the second option more readily available in the existing infrastructure in the laboratories it is known that different species have different competitive strategies and within the same guild there is a specialization in competition strategies for example some species eliminate the competitors via physiological suppression chen et al 2006 other species are facultative hyperparasitoids brodeur and rosenheim 2000 hindayana et al 2001 lucas 2005 cusumano et al 2011 as a consequence it has been suggested that interaction between parasitoid guilds should be considered in all biological control programs since competitive effects among them may change the reproductive success of each parasitoid species and thus may affect the host mortality nechols et al 1992 follett et al 2000 although females of many parasitoid families have the ability to discriminate between unparasitized and parasitized hosts wylie 1965 van lenteren 1981 ruschioni et al 2015 in natural systems multiple species of parasitoids commonly attack the same host price 1971 hawkins 1990 hawkins and mills 1996 producing multiparasitism and competition between immature stages fisher 1961 vinson and ables 1980 cusumano et al 2011 multiparasitism occurrence depends on the behavior reproductive capacity and phenological synchronization of the female parasitoid with the host van alphen and visser 1990 tumlinson et al 1993 if the female does not avoid or even prefers a parasitized host the successful larvae produce adult parasitoids which changes the population dynamics of the parasitoid species involved and plays a role in sizing and shaping the community godfray 1994 an interesting approach to analyzing interference competition among parasitoids is the elo competition model from chess elo 1978 which is already used as a black box model to analyze animal competitive interactions albers and de vries 2001 de vries et al 2006 neumann et al 2011 intraguild competition between parasitoids may be strongly related to functional response mostly because the number of hosts attacked depends on the amount available when there is an excess of hosts the overlap of different parasitoids within the same host is expected to be less frequent than when their availability is low if there is an excess of parasitoids the competition is almost unavoidable some authors have combined competition with functional response at population level skalski and gilliam 2001 and others incorporate interference under intra and inter specific competition de villemereuil and lópez sepulcre 2011 yet no models integrated functional response and behavioral model of the competition process one problem with these models is their complexity which hinders their analysis the use of a stepwise model of proposal and selection is a powerful tool to identify the best model that explains a dataset using the fewest parameters possible gelman et al 2003 using a novel approach we analyzed negative interactions between parasitoids adults and immatures and their hosts via a series of models using three egg parasitoid species as a study case for this purpose we studied the following interactions indirect extrinsic competition when two females arrived at the same host at different times regardless of the female detecting if the host was parasitized or not intrinsic direct competition when a female tried to kill the larvae of other parasitoid species that arrived first to the host intrinsic direct competition between larvae coming from different species we conducted black box laboratory experiments to investigate 1 the effect of sequential ovipositions of different parasitoid species on the outcome of multiparasitism 2 the existence of host selection behavior in parasitoid females 3 the larval competition strength 4 the effect of interval between ovipositions on the multiparasitism competition outcome we analyzed the outcome of the experiments by combining functional response models with different variations of the elo model and set theory 2 methods 2 1 study system tapajosa rubromarginata signoret cicadellidae proconiini the most frequent and ubiquitous sharpshooter species in argentina paradell et al 2012 is one of the vectors of the bacteria xylella fastidiosa that causes citrus variegated chlorosis cvc to citrus plants dellapé and paradell 2013 in order to identify biological control candidates to control this vector we conducted surveys in argentina between 2003 and 2009 and found 25 species of parasitoid hymenoptera during the surveys we noticed that specimens belonging to three parasitoid families mymaridae trichogrammatidae and aphelinidae emerged from a single egg mass of t rubromarginata but the co emergence of different species of the genus gonatocerus mymaridae was more frequent possibly related to its higher abundance logarzo et al 2004 2005 virla et al 2005 2009 2 2 insect collection and rearing laboratory studies were carried out with three egg parasitoids species gonatocerus virlai triapitsyn logarzo and de leon g near tuberculifemur clade 1 and g annulicornis ogloblin de león et al 2008 reared in proimi planta piloto de procesos industriales microbiológicos laboratory at san miguel de tucumán tucumán province specimens of g virlai and g near tuberculifemur clade 1 were obtained from egg masses of t rubromarginata collected on johnson grass sorghum halepense pers in a field at el manantial 26 49 50 2 s 65 16 59 4 w elevation 495 m and san miguel de tucumán 26 48 35 7 s 65 16 25 3 w elevation 470 m from january to march 2004 gonatocerus annulicornis was obtained from egg masses of the same sharpshooter species on lemon leaves in horco molle tucumán province 26 46 50 1 s 65 19 38 3 w elevation 703 m during december 2003 in both areas parasitoid species were sympatric in the laboratory the colonies were cultured on eggs of t rubromarginata following the methodology established in virla et al 2005 field collected females of t rubromarginata were placed in polyethylene terephthalate pet cylindrical vented cages 35 cm high 18 cm diam on lemon plant leaves to obtain host eggs potted citrus lemon plants pot of 6 3 l were checked daily for eggs when egg masses were detected the sharpshooters and the pet cages were removed and a leaf with the eggs was ready to be used in the experiments about 10 of the egg masses were used as control not parasitized and maintained until complete development all the colonies and the experiments were conducted in the summer at room temperature 26 3 c at 70 80 rh with natural photoperiod 2 3 competition experiment the experiment consisted of a sequential exposure of leafhopper eggs to parasitoids in an arena which comprised a 10 cm 1 5 cm culture tube with a cotton plug an egg mass of t rubromaginata was exposed to the female of one parasitoid species g virlai g near tuberculifemur clade 1 or g annulicornis for 24 hs at the end of which the female was removed and the egg mass was exposed to a second female of a different species for another 24 hs after the second wasp was removed the exposed egg mass was transferred to a petri dish with wet tissue paper and covered with clear plastic food wrap to prevent desiccation and to keep wasps from escaping the egg masses were checked daily and the number of wasps of both species and leafhopper nymphs emerged was recorded the six possible parasitoid combinations were performed g annulicornis vs g near tuberculifemur clade 1 g annulicornis vs g virlai g near tuberculifemur clade 1 vs g virlai and their reciprocal 24 58 replicates were conducted table 1 as the number of eggs in each egg mass of t rubromarginata was highly variable 1 55 eggs each the egg mass size was used as a random variable and therefore was randomly assigned to all the experiments all female parasitoids used in the experiment were 24 48 hs old mated with no previous oviposition experience and were used only once egg masses used were up to 24 hs old 2 4 functional response estimation as shown in fig 1 simultaneously to the competition experiment we needed to estimate the number of eggs attacked as a function of eggs offered in the absence of competition ie the functional response the functional response curve was then used as a control to the treatments of consecutive exposures to different parasitoids this curve also served as a null model in which the absence of interference between hosts was postulated see section 3 2 1 so to estimate each species functional response an experimental design similar to that explained above was used with the difference that egg masses were not exposed to a second female for each parasitoid species between 81 and 90 t rubromarginata egg masses with a size ranging from one to 55 eggs were used table 1 3 calculation the model consists in a succession of three different modules fig 1 a holling s functional response a host selection and a competition model in order to estimate the competition outcome as a function of the number of eggs offered and the order of parasitoid arrival as the number of eggs on an egg mass was a random variable we estimated the number of eggs attacked as a function of eggs offered consequently several functional response models were used on the other hand we used the thurstone bradley terry thurstone 1927 bradley and terry 1952 to model the outcome of competition under different conditions these models are used for creating the elo rating system in sports elo 1978 that is also used in animal behavior to create dominance ratings between species and or individuals of the same species neumann et al 2011 we divided the competitive behavior into three dimensions competitive rating as is used in sports and other animal behavior studies advantage effect for the first arriving parasitoid and a host selection behavior as an estimator of the degree of utilization of already parasitized hosts after creating the models we performed a stepwise selection of the proposed models in order to find which one had the best balance between explanation of the data in terms of the likelihood function and complexity in terms of number of parameters the proposed models are the following 3 1 models of functional response 1 1 type i functional response it is the simplest model the number of parasitoids emerging from each species is directly proportional to the number of eggs offered holling 1959 1 2 roger s type ii functional response rogers 1972 1 3 holling s type ii functional response 1 4 holling s type iii functional response 3 2 models of competition 3 2 1 models of functional response without competitive interactions the functional response models enumerated above were used to test the possible outcome of the experiments under the hypothesis that no competitive interactions occurred 3 2 2 models of functional response without host selection behavior competition between the parasitoids can be explained as a combination of functional response and a competition for eggs in which both species oviposited here the eggs can be classified into four categories attacked by species a attacked by species b not attacked and attacked by both as shown in fig 2 the expected number of individuals emerged on each experiment as a function of preys p was 1 e a b p r a r a p r b p 1 w ab where e a b p is the expected number species a emerged given that species b also attacked the same egg masses ra p is the functional response of species a rb p is the functional response of species b and w ab is the proportion of times in which species a won in the competition against species b the number of eggs that was attacked by both species and the number of eggs in which the competition occurs is assumed to be the product of random superposition and estimated as the product of the proportion of eggs parasitized by a and b species multiplied by the total number of eggs offered which simplifying gives 2 r a p r b p r a p r b p where p is the total number of eggs offered on the other hand the w ab proportion can be calculated according to thurstone s model case v thurstone 1927 using the following equation 3 w ab p s a s b where s a and s b are the strength in terms of competitive power of species a and b respectively p s a s b is the proportion of times in which the strength of a is superior to strength of b and therefore wins the competition given that the strength is not a constant number but a normally distributed random variable 4 s a n μ a σ a s b n μ b σ b thus p s a s b is the difference of two gaussian distributions so 5 p a b n μ ab 1 μ ab μ a μ b σ ab 2 σ a 2 σ b 2 1 where μ ab is the mean competitive strength difference between species a and b in thurstone s case v model σ a σ b it is possible to assume that σ a 2 2 so σ a 2 σ b 2 0 5 so σ ab 2 1 then the expected proportion of times in which a overcompetes with b within the host is as in eq 5 this model was combined with the models described above so we obtained another four models with random interference and functional response type i ii rogers ii holling and iii 3 2 3 models of functional response without host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host this is essentially the same series of models as those explained above but now a constant value is added to the first arriving species in order to estimate the increase or decrease in its competitive strength so the resulting competitive interaction term of equations 3 5 is modified as follows 6 w ab p s a s b n μ a h a t μ b 1 where t is the interval in days between the oviposition of the two competing parasitoids and ha the first arrival term which shows the change in competitive strength for the first arriving parasitoid hvattum and arntzen 2010 if the term is positive the first arriving parasitoid has an advantage in the competition and if it is negative the advantage is for the second species this term is species specific if the term is positive the first arriving parasitoid has the advantage the competition is mostly intrinsic competition between immature stages within the host meaning that the older bigger larvae wins whereas if the term is negative the second arriving parasitoid has the advantage the competition might be mostly extrinsic the female by some means kills the competitor s larvae meaning that the second female has the opportunity to kill the competitor s larvae in the already parasitized hosts 3 2 4 models of functional response with host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host in the series of models explained above there is an assumption that both female parasitoids choose their hosts at random so when the second parasitoid arrives female host selection is not influenced by whether the eggs were already parasitized or not this behavior does not necessarily have a biological meaning it is known that some parasitoids have the ability to discriminate between parasitized and unparasitized hosts wylie 1965 van lenteren 1981 thereby deciding whether to attack parasitized hosts or not in those cases where multiparasitism succeeds it becomes a viable strategy hamelin et al 2007 therefore we proposed a different host selection model in which we considered different host selection behavior multiparasitism avoidance the parasitoid avoids already parasitized eggs so the parasitoid first uses the available free hosts and only after they are completely depleted does the female use the eggs parasitized by the previous species so eq 2 can now be modified as 7 r a p r b p r a p r b p p if r a p r b p p 0 otherwise multiparasitism preference the inverse of the avoidance the parasitoid prefers the parasitized eggs the female uses these eggs first and after they are completely depleted it switches to the free hosts now the number of eggs attacked by both species follows the equation 8 r a p r b p r b p if r a p r b p r a p if r a p r b p multparasitism index since the behavior of avoidance random preference is species specific the best way to integrate the three models into a single one and thus avoid the necessity of creating a huge amount of models with all the combinations of behaviors in the studied species was to create an index of multiparasitism that index is similar to the correlation coefficient with a range from 0 to 1 where 0 means complete avoidance 0 5 means random without host selection behavior similar to model 3 2 3 and 1 means complete preference for parasitized eggs as the index can take intermediate values the proportion of preference or avoidance vs random can be averaged for example an index of 0 4 means that the estimated number of eggs attacked by both species is a weighted average between random 0 8 weight and preference 0 2 also an index of 0 7 is a weighted average in the number of eggs attacked by both species between random 0 4 and avoidance 0 6 so the final equation describing the number of eggs attacked putting together eqs 2 7 and 8 is 9 r a p r b p n r 1 2 i n s 2 i if i 0 5 n r 1 2 i n a 2 i if i 0 5 n r otherwise where i is the multiparasitism index which varies from 0 to 1 n r is the expected number of hosts attacked by both species under a completely random assumption as in eq 2 n s is the same variable under complete superposition assumption as in eq 8 and n a is the same variable but now under complete avoidance assumption as in eq 7 the consequences in terms of functional response of these behaviors are shown in fig 3 a d fig 3b is a case with complete superposition i 1 the number of hosts attacked by both species is maximum fig 3c is a case with random superposition i 0 5 and fig 3d is complete avoidance i 0 where the number of hosts attacked by both species is minimal this index translates into a proportion of attacked parasitized or non parasitized eggs under an excess of hosts where i is the expected proportion of eggs laid into parasitized hosts and 1 i is the expected proportion of eggs laid into non parasitized hosts 3 2 5 models of increased mortality host feeding the models described above assumed that the mortality was constant and independent of the number of parasitoids that attacked an egg that all the eggs were equally suitable and that the parasitoid does not perform host feeding all three phenomena must be taken into account or they could flatten the functional response curve because some hosts are consumed dead or cannot support the physiological stress of multiple parasitoid attacks and therefore no parasitoid would emerge from such hosts that would underestimate the proportion of attacked hosts if the response variable was the number of successfully parasitized hosts as in this study models of increased mortality caused by multiple parasitism a simple parameter of mortality caused by the action of the oviposition of the female was added to test whether the competition between parasitoids caused an increase in the mortality rate of the hosts 10 e a b p e a b p 1 m n where the model from eq 1 now has an extra parameter m which is the extra mortality caused by the parasitoids and n is the number of parasitoids that attacked a given host this mortality parameter also includes mortality by host feeding models with rejection of non suitable hosts the models described above assumed that all the hosts are considered equally suitable and or the parasitoid is not able to differentiate between suitable and non suitable hosts eggs that do not enable parasitoid development simple parameter of proportion of not suitable hosts was therefore added to test whether the presence of that host influences the results 11 e a b p e a b p 1 s where the model from eq 1 now has an extra parameter s which is the proportion of hosts considered unsuitable or eaten by the parasitoids models with rejection of non suitable hosts host feeding plus increased mortality caused by multiple parasitism finally a model combining models 3 and 4 was also tested 12 e a b p e a b p 1 s 1 m n 3 3 model fitting and selection all the proposed models were used for a stepwise bayesian model selection instead of fitting a model and then calculating an information index such as aic dic or bic we performed the model selection procedure using the algorithm reversible jump markov chain monte carlo in which the routine automatically jumped from one model to another and then selected the best model balancing information and fitting to achieve this in each jump for each additional parameter the log likelihood function was penalized with a value of minus two this procedure produces better results in cases in which there are ties in the above mentioned indexes and its results are ready to be used in model averaging the first 40 000 iterations of the reversible procedure were discarded as a burn in model selection and the last 20 000 were used to calculate the weight of each model in the model averaging procedure also 1000 iterations of markov chain monte carlo were performed for each iteration of the reversible jump algorithm gelman et al 2003 resulting in a total of 60 000 000 iterations the last 20 000 000 iterations were used to calculate the a posteriori distributions of the parameters expected vs observed values were compared using a binomial likelihood function for the number of the parasitoids emerged in relation to the total offered the a priori distribution of the parameters of the functional response curves were non informative uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the same for the multiparasitism index on the other hand for the competition parameters the a priori distribution was a normal distribution with mean zero and deviance ten for all the parameters since we did not have a priori information of the variables distribution because the competitive strength is an interval scale and therefore does not have an origin ordinate stevens 1946 that variable of the species g annulicornis was arbitrarily fixed as 0 and used as a reference of the competitive strength of the others so the ordinate of origin was the g annulicornis strength and the interval unit the standard deviation of that species strength on the selected models convergence was tested using geweke plots and visual inspections of the variable traces geweke et al 1991 gelman et al 2003 all analysis were performed using a pymc library for bayesian estimation patil et al 2010 in the python programming language 4 results the results of the laboratory competition experiments without fitting the models are shown in table 1 from the 64 tested models six models were selected depending on the dic value and model complexity table 2 these integrated models comprise between 15 19 parameters that explain the insect behavior all the models selected indicated that the species competed among themselves when the components of the six selected models were analyzed we found that in terms of functional response the models with holling s type ii functional response were the most frequently selected with 69 15 of the iterations and the models with type iii functional response were the remaining 30 85 table 2 therefore as both models of functional response were selected it is possible that the studied species had a functional response which was neither type ii nor type iii instead it could be something in between but closer to type ii as shown in fig 4 a c regarding competition models those that incorporated host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host were selected in 100 of the iterations in reference to the models of increased mortality caused by multiparasitism they were selected in 37 79 of the iterations this result suggests that the hosts die as a direct effect of the parasitoid attack and that the increase in mortality was 0 0617 0 033 in the first attack and 0 1196 0 037 in the second attack regardless if they were attacked by one or two different females during the study we did not observe host feeding in any of the parasitoids studied also some models with rejection of non suitable hosts were selected in 78 91 of the iterations this result indicates that some proportion of 0 1851 0 0506 between 1 5 and 1 6 of the hosts offered were rejected by all the species of parasitoids the parameters of the models calculated from the iterations are shown in table 3 the parameters from the functional response models were similar in both kinds of response type g virlai was the most efficient and g near tuberculifemur the least efficient although the differences were small in terms of manipulation time g near tuberculifemur was the fastest and and g annulicornis the slowest all three functional responses are shown together in fig 4a gonatocerus virlai is the most effective species with host densities below 60 and above that number g near tuberculifemur is superior g near tuberculifemur is also the least effective in lower prey densities in terms of competitive power g near tuberculifemur was the strongest and the weakest was g annulicornis using the thurstone model with the parameters in table 3 it is possible to infer the proportion of times in which each species wins if arriving simultaneously with a proportion of 0 3266 0 6734 for g annulicornis vs g virlai respectively 0 1791 0 8209 for g annulicornis vs g near tuberculifemur and finally 0 3194 0 6806 for g virlai vs g near tuberculifemur there was an inverse relationship between competitive power and manipulation time the fastest attacking species was also the strongest one table 3 all the species have an enormous advantage when arriving first to the host and after 24 h the weakest species was almost as strong as the strongest gonatocerus annulicornis was able to win a proportion of 0 5518 and 0 3673 against g virlai and g near tuberculifemur respectively if arriving 24 h earlier on the other hand g virlai was the species which benefited most from being the first to arrive with an increase in strength of nearly two standard deviations table 3 now that species was able to win an estimated proportion of 0 9707 and 0 8578 against g annulicornis and g near tuberculifemur respectively finally g near tuberculifemur was the least benefited if it arrived first nevertheless its advantage was important about a half of standard deviation in strength and because it was also the strongest competitive species it was able to win a proportion of 0 9255 and 0 8397 against g annulicornis and g virlai respectively 5 discussion usually biological control candidates are evaluated using either their functional response parameters or their competitive behavior but never both together in the same study de villemereuil and lópez sepulcre 2011 our results showed that the three parasitoid species larvae interacted negatively affecting their survival when they coexisted regardless of the sequence of exposure of parasitoids and the differences in arrival time the parasitoid species of genus gonatocerus that attack t rubromarginata eggs competed among them and showed different competition strategies the studied species differed in terms of competitive power advantage of the first to arrive and their oviposition behavior with a group of parasitized and non parasitized eggs reflecting different host selection behavior also they differed in functional response parameter values attack rate and manipulation time in our study we did not observe host feeding on any of the three parasitoids for this reason the mortality increase caused by multiparasitism is the consequence of the female stings for oviposition and not for feeding table 2 as many parasitoid species hubbard et al 1987 outreman et al 2001 castillo et al 2004 g virlai g near tuberculifemur and g annulicornis showed a host discrimination ability and different behaviours regarding multipleparasitism they were able to differentiate non viable hosts and eggs which had already been parasitized we found asymmetric interference type of competitive interaction among the studied species some species were better competitors than others as in mahmoud and lim 2008 gonatocerus annulicornis the weakest species was expected to avoid parasitized hosts which could hinder its competitiveness however this species did not have a host selection behavior a possible explanation might be that avoidance of multiparasitism depends on some other factors such as the physiological state of the parasitoid like egg load and life expectancy which are mainly determined by a balance between egg and time limitation sirot et al 1997 also multiparasitism avoidance is a subject of learning and therefore can change during the parasitoid lifetime hubbard et al 1999 by using naive females we avoided the learning effect another factor that produces multiparasitism avoidance can be the presence of some viruses reynolds and hardy 2004 as in hubbard and cook 1978 g near tuberculifemur the strongest species preferred to use parasitized eggs behaving like a facultative hyperparasitoid while g virlai who presented the greatest advantage by arriving first to the host tended to avoid using parasitized eggs in terms of functional response parameters the less aggressive competitor is expected to be the most efficient consumer attack rate and or handling time vance 1985 fellers 1987 interestingly the best competitor g near tuberculifemur species also had the shortest manipulation times on the other hand gonatocerus virlai was the species that had the highest attack rate while g annulicornis had the longest manipulation time and a high attack rate a pattern that is congruent with abrams 1980 who postulated that in systems with type 2 functional response negative correlations between handling time and attack rate result in a reduced level of competition in the community gonatocerus annulicornis compensate its reduced competitive ability with a higher attack rate but not with a faster prey manipulation therefore this species might be the best at lower prey densities and perhaps the best discovering hosts in the field the advantage of arriving first expressed in days 1 almost compensates the difference in competitive power between the strongest and weakest species g annulicornis and g near tuberculifermur from one day to the next considering that the difference in strength of two species that are within the same host is zero the probability of winning of each species is 50 the female behavior of attacking an already parasitized host is meaningful only if the strength of the second arriving species is higher than the species whose larva is already inside the host strand and godfray 1989 but as the time passes the first arriving parasitoid increases its strength until it is more capable from a competitive point of view than any of the species arriving later strand and godfray 1989 viser 1993 so there is a window of opportunity which is the average time in which the first arriving species equals the strength of the second species 13 0 s b h b t s a 14 t s a s b h b therefore using the values provided by table 3 it is possible to calculate that window of opportunity for example for g near tuberculifemur to successfully attack an egg already parasitized by g virlai the time window in hours is 0 3 days or 7 h 19 m on the other hand if the egg was parasitized by a g annulicornis the window is now 1 58 days or 38 h 2 m finally the window of opportunity for g virlai against g annulicornis is 18 h 36 m these results coincide with field observations in which the eggs are attacked mostly the same day they were laid virla unpublished data since these species are purely diurnal a window of opportunity over twelve hours means the whole day we also found using this approach that the multiparasitism increases the death probability of the host as it was observed in other parasitoids steiner and piek 1986 bernardo et al 2006 another female behavior found was the parasitoid rejection of unsuitable hosts as postulated by godfray 1994 we developed a series of models which describe the competition process of a community of endoparasitoids at a behavioral level in a comprehensive way these models provide insights beyond those expected by a conventional setup consisting in a factorial experiment and its corresponding parametric data analysis we gained insights in the mechanism of competition both on interference which species is a better interference competitor if the competitor has an advantage by arriving first and if arriving second whether the parasitoid avoided or not the already parasitized hosts given that arriving first gave it enormous competitive advantage and exploitation if there are differences in terms of functional response between species of different fighting strength all in a single analysis acknowledgements this research was funded in part by by the argentina agency for the promotion of

25217,intraguild competition is a complex phenomenon that shapes parasitoid communities when several species of parasitoids oviposit within the same individual host a complex phenomenon of larval competitive interaction occurs within the same guild there is a specialization in competitive strategies sometimes multiparasitism is avoided but some species are facultative hyperparasitoids predators of their competitors as these interactions occur within a very small host and during a brief period of time and that direct observation is very difficult to achieve we used an alternative methodological approach we analyzed intraguild host competition mechanisms via the combination of a series of competitive behavioral and functional response models thurstonian competition model and set theory these models were fitted via a reversible jump bayesian model selection procedure to a series of competition experiments data using larvae of three species of gonatocerus spp hymenoptera mymaridae egg parasitoids of the sharpshooter tapajosa rubromarginata hemiptera cicadellidae as a case of study this study tests the influence of intrinsic interspecific competition between inmature stages within on an individual host and parasitoid arrival order among the three parasitoid species the results showed that the species differed in competitive behavior some species were better competitors than others individuals arriving earlier had a competitive advantage the weaker species were able to outcompete the stronger ones if the time advantage was longer than 18 h all the species avoided already parasitized hosts but in different degrees the functional response was also different with the best competitors having shorter estimated handling times using this analytical approach on a conventional experimental setup we gained insights in the mechanism of competition both on interference and exploitation and in terms of host selection all in a single analysis keywords thurstone model functional response gonatocerus sp tapajosa rubromarginata biological control egg parasitoid 1 introduction intraguild competition is a key phenomenon for parasitoid communities polis et al 1989 most solitary or gregarious endophagous parasitoids require a full host insect to complete their own development vinson and ables 1980 so if there are more than one parasitoid species within the same host a complex phenomenon of competitive interference and predation takes place volkoff and colazza 1992 pennacchio and strand 2006 competition between parasitoids can be extrinsic adult adult or intrinsic adult larva or larva larva godfray 1994 the analysis of this interaction has two aspects of interest 1 it helps to understand how parasitoid insect communities are structured and 2 it is important when designing a biological control program with several controlling species competing with each other among the most common difficulties found among studies of competition among parasitoids are those of observing competition within the host harvey et al 2013 if this is also very small as in the case of egg parasitoids and the interactions occur in a very short time direct observation of this phenomenon is very difficult then complex experimental designs and modeling are alternative procedures being the second option more readily available in the existing infrastructure in the laboratories it is known that different species have different competitive strategies and within the same guild there is a specialization in competition strategies for example some species eliminate the competitors via physiological suppression chen et al 2006 other species are facultative hyperparasitoids brodeur and rosenheim 2000 hindayana et al 2001 lucas 2005 cusumano et al 2011 as a consequence it has been suggested that interaction between parasitoid guilds should be considered in all biological control programs since competitive effects among them may change the reproductive success of each parasitoid species and thus may affect the host mortality nechols et al 1992 follett et al 2000 although females of many parasitoid families have the ability to discriminate between unparasitized and parasitized hosts wylie 1965 van lenteren 1981 ruschioni et al 2015 in natural systems multiple species of parasitoids commonly attack the same host price 1971 hawkins 1990 hawkins and mills 1996 producing multiparasitism and competition between immature stages fisher 1961 vinson and ables 1980 cusumano et al 2011 multiparasitism occurrence depends on the behavior reproductive capacity and phenological synchronization of the female parasitoid with the host van alphen and visser 1990 tumlinson et al 1993 if the female does not avoid or even prefers a parasitized host the successful larvae produce adult parasitoids which changes the population dynamics of the parasitoid species involved and plays a role in sizing and shaping the community godfray 1994 an interesting approach to analyzing interference competition among parasitoids is the elo competition model from chess elo 1978 which is already used as a black box model to analyze animal competitive interactions albers and de vries 2001 de vries et al 2006 neumann et al 2011 intraguild competition between parasitoids may be strongly related to functional response mostly because the number of hosts attacked depends on the amount available when there is an excess of hosts the overlap of different parasitoids within the same host is expected to be less frequent than when their availability is low if there is an excess of parasitoids the competition is almost unavoidable some authors have combined competition with functional response at population level skalski and gilliam 2001 and others incorporate interference under intra and inter specific competition de villemereuil and lópez sepulcre 2011 yet no models integrated functional response and behavioral model of the competition process one problem with these models is their complexity which hinders their analysis the use of a stepwise model of proposal and selection is a powerful tool to identify the best model that explains a dataset using the fewest parameters possible gelman et al 2003 using a novel approach we analyzed negative interactions between parasitoids adults and immatures and their hosts via a series of models using three egg parasitoid species as a study case for this purpose we studied the following interactions indirect extrinsic competition when two females arrived at the same host at different times regardless of the female detecting if the host was parasitized or not intrinsic direct competition when a female tried to kill the larvae of other parasitoid species that arrived first to the host intrinsic direct competition between larvae coming from different species we conducted black box laboratory experiments to investigate 1 the effect of sequential ovipositions of different parasitoid species on the outcome of multiparasitism 2 the existence of host selection behavior in parasitoid females 3 the larval competition strength 4 the effect of interval between ovipositions on the multiparasitism competition outcome we analyzed the outcome of the experiments by combining functional response models with different variations of the elo model and set theory 2 methods 2 1 study system tapajosa rubromarginata signoret cicadellidae proconiini the most frequent and ubiquitous sharpshooter species in argentina paradell et al 2012 is one of the vectors of the bacteria xylella fastidiosa that causes citrus variegated chlorosis cvc to citrus plants dellapé and paradell 2013 in order to identify biological control candidates to control this vector we conducted surveys in argentina between 2003 and 2009 and found 25 species of parasitoid hymenoptera during the surveys we noticed that specimens belonging to three parasitoid families mymaridae trichogrammatidae and aphelinidae emerged from a single egg mass of t rubromarginata but the co emergence of different species of the genus gonatocerus mymaridae was more frequent possibly related to its higher abundance logarzo et al 2004 2005 virla et al 2005 2009 2 2 insect collection and rearing laboratory studies were carried out with three egg parasitoids species gonatocerus virlai triapitsyn logarzo and de leon g near tuberculifemur clade 1 and g annulicornis ogloblin de león et al 2008 reared in proimi planta piloto de procesos industriales microbiológicos laboratory at san miguel de tucumán tucumán province specimens of g virlai and g near tuberculifemur clade 1 were obtained from egg masses of t rubromarginata collected on johnson grass sorghum halepense pers in a field at el manantial 26 49 50 2 s 65 16 59 4 w elevation 495 m and san miguel de tucumán 26 48 35 7 s 65 16 25 3 w elevation 470 m from january to march 2004 gonatocerus annulicornis was obtained from egg masses of the same sharpshooter species on lemon leaves in horco molle tucumán province 26 46 50 1 s 65 19 38 3 w elevation 703 m during december 2003 in both areas parasitoid species were sympatric in the laboratory the colonies were cultured on eggs of t rubromarginata following the methodology established in virla et al 2005 field collected females of t rubromarginata were placed in polyethylene terephthalate pet cylindrical vented cages 35 cm high 18 cm diam on lemon plant leaves to obtain host eggs potted citrus lemon plants pot of 6 3 l were checked daily for eggs when egg masses were detected the sharpshooters and the pet cages were removed and a leaf with the eggs was ready to be used in the experiments about 10 of the egg masses were used as control not parasitized and maintained until complete development all the colonies and the experiments were conducted in the summer at room temperature 26 3 c at 70 80 rh with natural photoperiod 2 3 competition experiment the experiment consisted of a sequential exposure of leafhopper eggs to parasitoids in an arena which comprised a 10 cm 1 5 cm culture tube with a cotton plug an egg mass of t rubromaginata was exposed to the female of one parasitoid species g virlai g near tuberculifemur clade 1 or g annulicornis for 24 hs at the end of which the female was removed and the egg mass was exposed to a second female of a different species for another 24 hs after the second wasp was removed the exposed egg mass was transferred to a petri dish with wet tissue paper and covered with clear plastic food wrap to prevent desiccation and to keep wasps from escaping the egg masses were checked daily and the number of wasps of both species and leafhopper nymphs emerged was recorded the six possible parasitoid combinations were performed g annulicornis vs g near tuberculifemur clade 1 g annulicornis vs g virlai g near tuberculifemur clade 1 vs g virlai and their reciprocal 24 58 replicates were conducted table 1 as the number of eggs in each egg mass of t rubromarginata was highly variable 1 55 eggs each the egg mass size was used as a random variable and therefore was randomly assigned to all the experiments all female parasitoids used in the experiment were 24 48 hs old mated with no previous oviposition experience and were used only once egg masses used were up to 24 hs old 2 4 functional response estimation as shown in fig 1 simultaneously to the competition experiment we needed to estimate the number of eggs attacked as a function of eggs offered in the absence of competition ie the functional response the functional response curve was then used as a control to the treatments of consecutive exposures to different parasitoids this curve also served as a null model in which the absence of interference between hosts was postulated see section 3 2 1 so to estimate each species functional response an experimental design similar to that explained above was used with the difference that egg masses were not exposed to a second female for each parasitoid species between 81 and 90 t rubromarginata egg masses with a size ranging from one to 55 eggs were used table 1 3 calculation the model consists in a succession of three different modules fig 1 a holling s functional response a host selection and a competition model in order to estimate the competition outcome as a function of the number of eggs offered and the order of parasitoid arrival as the number of eggs on an egg mass was a random variable we estimated the number of eggs attacked as a function of eggs offered consequently several functional response models were used on the other hand we used the thurstone bradley terry thurstone 1927 bradley and terry 1952 to model the outcome of competition under different conditions these models are used for creating the elo rating system in sports elo 1978 that is also used in animal behavior to create dominance ratings between species and or individuals of the same species neumann et al 2011 we divided the competitive behavior into three dimensions competitive rating as is used in sports and other animal behavior studies advantage effect for the first arriving parasitoid and a host selection behavior as an estimator of the degree of utilization of already parasitized hosts after creating the models we performed a stepwise selection of the proposed models in order to find which one had the best balance between explanation of the data in terms of the likelihood function and complexity in terms of number of parameters the proposed models are the following 3 1 models of functional response 1 1 type i functional response it is the simplest model the number of parasitoids emerging from each species is directly proportional to the number of eggs offered holling 1959 1 2 roger s type ii functional response rogers 1972 1 3 holling s type ii functional response 1 4 holling s type iii functional response 3 2 models of competition 3 2 1 models of functional response without competitive interactions the functional response models enumerated above were used to test the possible outcome of the experiments under the hypothesis that no competitive interactions occurred 3 2 2 models of functional response without host selection behavior competition between the parasitoids can be explained as a combination of functional response and a competition for eggs in which both species oviposited here the eggs can be classified into four categories attacked by species a attacked by species b not attacked and attacked by both as shown in fig 2 the expected number of individuals emerged on each experiment as a function of preys p was 1 e a b p r a r a p r b p 1 w ab where e a b p is the expected number species a emerged given that species b also attacked the same egg masses ra p is the functional response of species a rb p is the functional response of species b and w ab is the proportion of times in which species a won in the competition against species b the number of eggs that was attacked by both species and the number of eggs in which the competition occurs is assumed to be the product of random superposition and estimated as the product of the proportion of eggs parasitized by a and b species multiplied by the total number of eggs offered which simplifying gives 2 r a p r b p r a p r b p where p is the total number of eggs offered on the other hand the w ab proportion can be calculated according to thurstone s model case v thurstone 1927 using the following equation 3 w ab p s a s b where s a and s b are the strength in terms of competitive power of species a and b respectively p s a s b is the proportion of times in which the strength of a is superior to strength of b and therefore wins the competition given that the strength is not a constant number but a normally distributed random variable 4 s a n μ a σ a s b n μ b σ b thus p s a s b is the difference of two gaussian distributions so 5 p a b n μ ab 1 μ ab μ a μ b σ ab 2 σ a 2 σ b 2 1 where μ ab is the mean competitive strength difference between species a and b in thurstone s case v model σ a σ b it is possible to assume that σ a 2 2 so σ a 2 σ b 2 0 5 so σ ab 2 1 then the expected proportion of times in which a overcompetes with b within the host is as in eq 5 this model was combined with the models described above so we obtained another four models with random interference and functional response type i ii rogers ii holling and iii 3 2 3 models of functional response without host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host this is essentially the same series of models as those explained above but now a constant value is added to the first arriving species in order to estimate the increase or decrease in its competitive strength so the resulting competitive interaction term of equations 3 5 is modified as follows 6 w ab p s a s b n μ a h a t μ b 1 where t is the interval in days between the oviposition of the two competing parasitoids and ha the first arrival term which shows the change in competitive strength for the first arriving parasitoid hvattum and arntzen 2010 if the term is positive the first arriving parasitoid has an advantage in the competition and if it is negative the advantage is for the second species this term is species specific if the term is positive the first arriving parasitoid has the advantage the competition is mostly intrinsic competition between immature stages within the host meaning that the older bigger larvae wins whereas if the term is negative the second arriving parasitoid has the advantage the competition might be mostly extrinsic the female by some means kills the competitor s larvae meaning that the second female has the opportunity to kill the competitor s larvae in the already parasitized hosts 3 2 4 models of functional response with host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host in the series of models explained above there is an assumption that both female parasitoids choose their hosts at random so when the second parasitoid arrives female host selection is not influenced by whether the eggs were already parasitized or not this behavior does not necessarily have a biological meaning it is known that some parasitoids have the ability to discriminate between parasitized and unparasitized hosts wylie 1965 van lenteren 1981 thereby deciding whether to attack parasitized hosts or not in those cases where multiparasitism succeeds it becomes a viable strategy hamelin et al 2007 therefore we proposed a different host selection model in which we considered different host selection behavior multiparasitism avoidance the parasitoid avoids already parasitized eggs so the parasitoid first uses the available free hosts and only after they are completely depleted does the female use the eggs parasitized by the previous species so eq 2 can now be modified as 7 r a p r b p r a p r b p p if r a p r b p p 0 otherwise multiparasitism preference the inverse of the avoidance the parasitoid prefers the parasitized eggs the female uses these eggs first and after they are completely depleted it switches to the free hosts now the number of eggs attacked by both species follows the equation 8 r a p r b p r b p if r a p r b p r a p if r a p r b p multparasitism index since the behavior of avoidance random preference is species specific the best way to integrate the three models into a single one and thus avoid the necessity of creating a huge amount of models with all the combinations of behaviors in the studied species was to create an index of multiparasitism that index is similar to the correlation coefficient with a range from 0 to 1 where 0 means complete avoidance 0 5 means random without host selection behavior similar to model 3 2 3 and 1 means complete preference for parasitized eggs as the index can take intermediate values the proportion of preference or avoidance vs random can be averaged for example an index of 0 4 means that the estimated number of eggs attacked by both species is a weighted average between random 0 8 weight and preference 0 2 also an index of 0 7 is a weighted average in the number of eggs attacked by both species between random 0 4 and avoidance 0 6 so the final equation describing the number of eggs attacked putting together eqs 2 7 and 8 is 9 r a p r b p n r 1 2 i n s 2 i if i 0 5 n r 1 2 i n a 2 i if i 0 5 n r otherwise where i is the multiparasitism index which varies from 0 to 1 n r is the expected number of hosts attacked by both species under a completely random assumption as in eq 2 n s is the same variable under complete superposition assumption as in eq 8 and n a is the same variable but now under complete avoidance assumption as in eq 7 the consequences in terms of functional response of these behaviors are shown in fig 3 a d fig 3b is a case with complete superposition i 1 the number of hosts attacked by both species is maximum fig 3c is a case with random superposition i 0 5 and fig 3d is complete avoidance i 0 where the number of hosts attacked by both species is minimal this index translates into a proportion of attacked parasitized or non parasitized eggs under an excess of hosts where i is the expected proportion of eggs laid into parasitized hosts and 1 i is the expected proportion of eggs laid into non parasitized hosts 3 2 5 models of increased mortality host feeding the models described above assumed that the mortality was constant and independent of the number of parasitoids that attacked an egg that all the eggs were equally suitable and that the parasitoid does not perform host feeding all three phenomena must be taken into account or they could flatten the functional response curve because some hosts are consumed dead or cannot support the physiological stress of multiple parasitoid attacks and therefore no parasitoid would emerge from such hosts that would underestimate the proportion of attacked hosts if the response variable was the number of successfully parasitized hosts as in this study models of increased mortality caused by multiple parasitism a simple parameter of mortality caused by the action of the oviposition of the female was added to test whether the competition between parasitoids caused an increase in the mortality rate of the hosts 10 e a b p e a b p 1 m n where the model from eq 1 now has an extra parameter m which is the extra mortality caused by the parasitoids and n is the number of parasitoids that attacked a given host this mortality parameter also includes mortality by host feeding models with rejection of non suitable hosts the models described above assumed that all the hosts are considered equally suitable and or the parasitoid is not able to differentiate between suitable and non suitable hosts eggs that do not enable parasitoid development simple parameter of proportion of not suitable hosts was therefore added to test whether the presence of that host influences the results 11 e a b p e a b p 1 s where the model from eq 1 now has an extra parameter s which is the proportion of hosts considered unsuitable or eaten by the parasitoids models with rejection of non suitable hosts host feeding plus increased mortality caused by multiple parasitism finally a model combining models 3 and 4 was also tested 12 e a b p e a b p 1 s 1 m n 3 3 model fitting and selection all the proposed models were used for a stepwise bayesian model selection instead of fitting a model and then calculating an information index such as aic dic or bic we performed the model selection procedure using the algorithm reversible jump markov chain monte carlo in which the routine automatically jumped from one model to another and then selected the best model balancing information and fitting to achieve this in each jump for each additional parameter the log likelihood function was penalized with a value of minus two this procedure produces better results in cases in which there are ties in the above mentioned indexes and its results are ready to be used in model averaging the first 40 000 iterations of the reversible procedure were discarded as a burn in model selection and the last 20 000 were used to calculate the weight of each model in the model averaging procedure also 1000 iterations of markov chain monte carlo were performed for each iteration of the reversible jump algorithm gelman et al 2003 resulting in a total of 60 000 000 iterations the last 20 000 000 iterations were used to calculate the a posteriori distributions of the parameters expected vs observed values were compared using a binomial likelihood function for the number of the parasitoids emerged in relation to the total offered the a priori distribution of the parameters of the functional response curves were non informative uniform distribution between 0 and 1 the same for the multiparasitism index on the other hand for the competition parameters the a priori distribution was a normal distribution with mean zero and deviance ten for all the parameters since we did not have a priori information of the variables distribution because the competitive strength is an interval scale and therefore does not have an origin ordinate stevens 1946 that variable of the species g annulicornis was arbitrarily fixed as 0 and used as a reference of the competitive strength of the others so the ordinate of origin was the g annulicornis strength and the interval unit the standard deviation of that species strength on the selected models convergence was tested using geweke plots and visual inspections of the variable traces geweke et al 1991 gelman et al 2003 all analysis were performed using a pymc library for bayesian estimation patil et al 2010 in the python programming language 4 results the results of the laboratory competition experiments without fitting the models are shown in table 1 from the 64 tested models six models were selected depending on the dic value and model complexity table 2 these integrated models comprise between 15 19 parameters that explain the insect behavior all the models selected indicated that the species competed among themselves when the components of the six selected models were analyzed we found that in terms of functional response the models with holling s type ii functional response were the most frequently selected with 69 15 of the iterations and the models with type iii functional response were the remaining 30 85 table 2 therefore as both models of functional response were selected it is possible that the studied species had a functional response which was neither type ii nor type iii instead it could be something in between but closer to type ii as shown in fig 4 a c regarding competition models those that incorporated host selection behavior and advantage for the first arriving host were selected in 100 of the iterations in reference to the models of increased mortality caused by multiparasitism they were selected in 37 79 of the iterations this result suggests that the hosts die as a direct effect of the parasitoid attack and that the increase in mortality was 0 0617 0 033 in the first attack and 0 1196 0 037 in the second attack regardless if they were attacked by one or two different females during the study we did not observe host feeding in any of the parasitoids studied also some models with rejection of non suitable hosts were selected in 78 91 of the iterations this result indicates that some proportion of 0 1851 0 0506 between 1 5 and 1 6 of the hosts offered were rejected by all the species of parasitoids the parameters of the models calculated from the iterations are shown in table 3 the parameters from the functional response models were similar in both kinds of response type g virlai was the most efficient and g near tuberculifemur the least efficient although the differences were small in terms of manipulation time g near tuberculifemur was the fastest and and g annulicornis the slowest all three functional responses are shown together in fig 4a gonatocerus virlai is the most effective species with host densities below 60 and above that number g near tuberculifemur is superior g near tuberculifemur is also the least effective in lower prey densities in terms of competitive power g near tuberculifemur was the strongest and the weakest was g annulicornis using the thurstone model with the parameters in table 3 it is possible to infer the proportion of times in which each species wins if arriving simultaneously with a proportion of 0 3266 0 6734 for g annulicornis vs g virlai respectively 0 1791 0 8209 for g annulicornis vs g near tuberculifemur and finally 0 3194 0 6806 for g virlai vs g near tuberculifemur there was an inverse relationship between competitive power and manipulation time the fastest attacking species was also the strongest one table 3 all the species have an enormous advantage when arriving first to the host and after 24 h the weakest species was almost as strong as the strongest gonatocerus annulicornis was able to win a proportion of 0 5518 and 0 3673 against g virlai and g near tuberculifemur respectively if arriving 24 h earlier on the other hand g virlai was the species which benefited most from being the first to arrive with an increase in strength of nearly two standard deviations table 3 now that species was able to win an estimated proportion of 0 9707 and 0 8578 against g annulicornis and g near tuberculifemur respectively finally g near tuberculifemur was the least benefited if it arrived first nevertheless its advantage was important about a half of standard deviation in strength and because it was also the strongest competitive species it was able to win a proportion of 0 9255 and 0 8397 against g annulicornis and g virlai respectively 5 discussion usually biological control candidates are evaluated using either their functional response parameters or their competitive behavior but never both together in the same study de villemereuil and lópez sepulcre 2011 our results showed that the three parasitoid species larvae interacted negatively affecting their survival when they coexisted regardless of the sequence of exposure of parasitoids and the differences in arrival time the parasitoid species of genus gonatocerus that attack t rubromarginata eggs competed among them and showed different competition strategies the studied species differed in terms of competitive power advantage of the first to arrive and their oviposition behavior with a group of parasitized and non parasitized eggs reflecting different host selection behavior also they differed in functional response parameter values attack rate and manipulation time in our study we did not observe host feeding on any of the three parasitoids for this reason the mortality increase caused by multiparasitism is the consequence of the female stings for oviposition and not for feeding table 2 as many parasitoid species hubbard et al 1987 outreman et al 2001 castillo et al 2004 g virlai g near tuberculifemur and g annulicornis showed a host discrimination ability and different behaviours regarding multipleparasitism they were able to differentiate non viable hosts and eggs which had already been parasitized we found asymmetric interference type of competitive interaction among the studied species some species were better competitors than others as in mahmoud and lim 2008 gonatocerus annulicornis the weakest species was expected to avoid parasitized hosts which could hinder its competitiveness however this species did not have a host selection behavior a possible explanation might be that avoidance of multiparasitism depends on some other factors such as the physiological state of the parasitoid like egg load and life expectancy which are mainly determined by a balance between egg and time limitation sirot et al 1997 also multiparasitism avoidance is a subject of learning and therefore can change during the parasitoid lifetime hubbard et al 1999 by using naive females we avoided the learning effect another factor that produces multiparasitism avoidance can be the presence of some viruses reynolds and hardy 2004 as in hubbard and cook 1978 g near tuberculifemur the strongest species preferred to use parasitized eggs behaving like a facultative hyperparasitoid while g virlai who presented the greatest advantage by arriving first to the host tended to avoid using parasitized eggs in terms of functional response parameters the less aggressive competitor is expected to be the most efficient consumer attack rate and or handling time vance 1985 fellers 1987 interestingly the best competitor g near tuberculifemur species also had the shortest manipulation times on the other hand gonatocerus virlai was the species that had the highest attack rate while g annulicornis had the longest manipulation time and a high attack rate a pattern that is congruent with abrams 1980 who postulated that in systems with type 2 functional response negative correlations between handling time and attack rate result in a reduced level of competition in the community gonatocerus annulicornis compensate its reduced competitive ability with a higher attack rate but not with a faster prey manipulation therefore this species might be the best at lower prey densities and perhaps the best discovering hosts in the field the advantage of arriving first expressed in days 1 almost compensates the difference in competitive power between the strongest and weakest species g annulicornis and g near tuberculifermur from one day to the next considering that the difference in strength of two species that are within the same host is zero the probability of winning of each species is 50 the female behavior of attacking an already parasitized host is meaningful only if the strength of the second arriving species is higher than the species whose larva is already inside the host strand and godfray 1989 but as the time passes the first arriving parasitoid increases its strength until it is more capable from a competitive point of view than any of the species arriving later strand and godfray 1989 viser 1993 so there is a window of opportunity which is the average time in which the first arriving species equals the strength of the second species 13 0 s b h b t s a 14 t s a s b h b therefore using the values provided by table 3 it is possible to calculate that window of opportunity for example for g near tuberculifemur to successfully attack an egg already parasitized by g virlai the time window in hours is 0 3 days or 7 h 19 m on the other hand if the egg was parasitized by a g annulicornis the window is now 1 58 days or 38 h 2 m finally the window of opportunity for g virlai against g annulicornis is 18 h 36 m these results coincide with field observations in which the eggs are attacked mostly the same day they were laid virla unpublished data since these species are purely diurnal a window of opportunity over twelve hours means the whole day we also found using this approach that the multiparasitism increases the death probability of the host as it was observed in other parasitoids steiner and piek 1986 bernardo et al 2006 another female behavior found was the parasitoid rejection of unsuitable hosts as postulated by godfray 1994 we developed a series of models which describe the competition process of a community of endoparasitoids at a behavioral level in a comprehensive way these models provide insights beyond those expected by a conventional setup consisting in a factorial experiment and its corresponding parametric data analysis we gained insights in the mechanism of competition both on interference which species is a better interference competitor if the competitor has an advantage by arriving first and if arriving second whether the parasitoid avoided or not the already parasitized hosts given that arriving first gave it enormous competitive advantage and exploitation if there are differences in terms of functional response between species of different fighting strength all in a single analysis acknowledgements this research was funded in part by by the argentina agency for the promotion of

25218,human activities continue to expand in marine and terrestrial environments leading to increased interactions with wildlife that can have negative impacts on population dynamics approaches for quantifying how these interactions translate to population level effects are therefore crucial for effective management practices and balancing human wildlife tradeoffs we developed a method using state dependent behavioral theory implemented via stochastic dynamic programming sdp for predicting the population consequences of disturbance on the physiology and reproductive behavior of an income breeding mammal using california sea lions zalophus californianus as a motivating species emergent properties of the model included reproductive characteristics associated with long lived species such as variation in the age at first reproduction early termination of pregnancy and skipped breeding in undisturbed model simulations reproductive rates and the average wean date were consistent with empirically derived estimates from sea lions and other marine mammals highlighting the utility of this model for quantifying fecundity estimates of data deficient species and addressing fundamental ecological processes in disturbed model simulations exposure to prolonged repetitive disturbances negatively impacted population growth in addition short infrequent disturbances had the potential for adverse effects depending on the behavioral response of sea lions and the probability of being disturbed the adverse effect of disturbance on population dynamics was due to a combination of reduced pup recruitment survival to age one resulting from a lower wean mass and increased abortion rates that led to skipped reproductive years both of which have been documented for marine mammal populations experiencing natural fluctuations in prey availability the derivation of state and time dependent reproductive decisions using an sdp model is an effective approach that links behavioral and energetic effects at the individual level to changes at the population level and one that serves a dual purpose in the ability to quantify basic biological parameters and address ecological questions irrespective of disturbance keywords stochastic dynamic programming pcod marine mammals life history acoustic disturbance 1 introduction wildlife populations face increasing pressure from human activities that can result in direct mortality or indirect effects including behavioral changes or disruption of life histories knowlton and kraus 2001 shannon et al 2016 smith et al 2015 stankowich 2008 a growing human footprint in the marine environment has led to increased interactions between humans and marine mammals resulting in concern about the impact of these activities on populations that already face a myriad of other threats davidson et al 2012 exposure to disturbance from naval exercises and vessel traffic associated with ecotourism results in short term disruptions of natural behavior castellote et al 2012 deruiter et al 2013 goldbogen et al 2013 melcón et al 2012 pirotta et al 2015 williams et al 2006 but these disruptions do not necessarily translate to biologically meaningful effects on population dynamics gill et al 2001 despite the growing need to understand the consequences of disturbance on marine mammal populations there have been comparatively few studies that have attempted to quantify the potential long term effects of disturbance for this taxonomic group christiansen and lusseau 2015 king et al 2015 new et al 2014 2013 villegas amtmann et al 2017 2015 early efforts towards understanding the population level effects of acoustic disturbance led to the development of the population consequences of acoustic disturbance pcad framework by a us national research council committee in 2005 wartzok et al 2005 further development of these ideas led to the population consequences of disturbance pcod framework which conceptualizes how disturbance translates from the individual to the population level through a series of transfer functions that link a behavioral or physiological response by an individual often modeled as a change in energy with changes in health vital rates and population dynamics new et al 2014 applications of the pcod framework have been limited costa et al 2016 nabe nielsen et al 2018 new et al 2014 due to the combination of a lack of basic life history data for many species and the challenges of quantifying some of these transfer functions for species that are long lived and often wide ranging and elusive mchuron et al 2017a proposed that state dependent behavioral theory implemented via stochastic dynamic programming sdp mangel and clark 1988 houston and mcnamara 1999 clark and mangel 2000 is a viable method for quantifying the functions that link behavior with vital rates thereby enabling implementation of the pcod framework sdp models have been applied across a broad range of taxonomic groups for quantifying the effects of natural environmental disturbance bull et al 1996 denis et al 2012 satterthwaite and mangel 2012 tenhumberg et al 2000 but until recently had not been applied in the context of anthropogenic disturbance mchuron et al 2017a pirotta et al 2018 this approach originates from the tenant that behavior is an evolutionary trait and allows for different behavioral responses to disturbance conditioned on the environment and an individual s physiological state initial efforts to model the effects of disturbance on marine mammals using sdp models focused on the impact of disturbance on expected reproductive success within a single year and did not explicitly model transitions between reproductive states individuals either remained in a fixed reproductive state throughout that time period mchuron et al 2017a or transitioned between two reproductive states pregnant or not pregnant based on a simple threshold value pirotta et al 2018 the incorporation of reproductive transitions into sdp models is an important next step that will facilitate species specific applications particularly for income breeding species that have the potential for simultaneous gestation and lactation necessitating an approach that can capture transitions among reproductive states i e early weaning and abortion in a way that is more akin to how these transitions likely occur in nature income breeding is a reproductive strategy used by many mammalian and non mammalian species bonnet et al 1998 costa 1991 jönsson 1997 oftedal 1997 schulz and bowen 2004 that may increase the susceptibility of individuals and populations to energetic disruptions costa et al 2016 mchuron et al 2017a this reproductive strategy complicates pcod models because as females rely on energy gained throughout lactation to support offspring growth the timing of disturbance becomes a more complicated subject and requires an approach that goes beyond bioenergetic models costa et al 2016 villegas amtmann et al 2017 2015 sdp models represent a natural framework in which to address these issues however as will be seen below modeling the transitions among multiple reproductive states is not a trivial addition we present an sdp model expanding on mchuron et al 2017a that includes many of the biologically relevant extensions that would be desired to model the population consequences of disturbance for an income breeding marine mammal we illustrate these extensions using california sea lions zalophus californianus as a case study because their physiology behavior and demographics have been well studied compared with many other marine mammals in addition to describing the derivation of the sdp equations we simulated a variety of hypothetical disturbance scenarios to examine how variability in 1 an individual s response to exposure 2 the timing of exposure within the year 3 the duration of exposure and 4 the repetitiveness of the exposure affected pup recruitment and population growth rates we focus on highlighting the utility of this approach in implementing the pcod framework and how it can be used to identify and prioritize research needs but also discuss its application in addressing key ecological questions and processes irrespective of disturbance 2 methods sdp models involve two primary components a backward iteration where optimal behavioral decisions are identified assuming individuals act to maximize some metric of darwinian fitness and an individual based forward simulation where the state dynamics and behavioral decisions of a population are simulated anthropogenic disturbance can be introduced in the forward simulation under the assumption that it is not in the evolutionary history of the organism and thus does not influence the behavioral decisions generated in the backward iteration clark and mangel 2000 mangel and clark 1988 mchuron et al 2017a the backward iteration consists of 1 identification of a time horizon 2 characterization of physiological state variables and how they change in response to the environment and behavior 3 definition of a function that links the state variables s to a measure of darwinian fitness referred to as the terminal fitness function and 4 derivation of the sdp equations that predict the behavior of individuals based on state and time the sections below follow this progression a conceptual diagram of the backward iteration and forward simulation as described below is shown in fig 1 2 1 life cycle california sea lions typically give birth to a single pup annually in late may through june peterson and bartholomew 1967 the majority of the us population breeds in the channel islands in southern california on one of two islands san miguel and san nicolas islands breeding occurs 6 weeks after birth in july and august peterson and bartholomew 1967 but implantation of the embryo is delayed for several months greig et al 2007 female sea lions are income breeders and central place foragers during the 10 11 month lactation period harris 2016 melin et al 2000 during this time they alternate foraging trips to sea 2 to 7 days with short periods onshore nursing their pup 1 2 days supporting their metabolic needs and those of their pup using energy gained on each foraging trip costa et al 1991 mchuron et al 2016 melin et al 2000 weaning can be initiated by either the female or the pup after weaning females may continue to frequent the rookery or leave the area for more productive foraging areas before returning to give birth melin et al 2000 in contrast to nursing females juvenile sea lions and non lactating females are not tied to a central place and may forage throughout the california current system mchuron et al 2018 melin et al 2000 orr et al 2012 pregnancy and reproductive failure rates of california sea lions are unknown but age specific birth and survival rates the probability of a female surviving and being seen with a pup the following year provide evidence of reproductive senescence in this species hernández camacho et al 2008a melin et al 2012 2 2 model timeline in nature there is variability in the timing of life history events but for simplicity we assumed either a fixed date birth implantation death or a maximum fixed date weaning for each of these events pups were born on day t b which we set to be calendar date june 15 and model day t 1 365 etc we assumed that implantation occurred on day t i which we set to be calendar date october 15 and model date t 125 490 etc pups were weaned on or before day t w which we set to be calendar date may 15 in the year following birth and model date t 335 700 etc once weaned surviving pups recruited into the population as juveniles on calendar date june 15 in the year following their birth we set the age in years of juvenile sea lions as a 1 2 am or the age of first possible implantation and the age in years of an adult female sea lion as a am n where n 1 2 3 n is the number of years a female can be reproductively active thus reproductive senescence occurs at age am n years we set the age of death in years at 25 t t and model date t 9489 a female died just before she turned 26 the timing of each life history event for a pup born in year y to a female in her nth reproductive year can be calculated as 1 t b y a m n 365 t i y 125 t b y t w y 1 335 t b y based on data we set am 4 years and n 17 years so that a female was 21 years old when she weaned her last pup hernández camacho et al 2008a melin et al 2012 there are four reproductive states possible for adult females and one reproductive state possible for juveniles fig 2 non reproductive state 1 pregnant state 2 lactating state 3 and lactating and pregnant state 4 in the year of reproductive senescence a female can only be in state 1 or state 3 and after weaning is continually in a non reproductive state until the time of her death ad the transition from state 2 to state 3 can only occur at tb and transitions from either state 1 to state 2 or state 3 to state 4 can only occur at ti in contrast transitions from a higher to a lower reproductive state can occur between transition periods due to aborting a pregnancy or early weaning of the pup fig 2 2 3 physiological dynamics we characterized non reproductive and pregnant females states 1 and 2 by a single physiological state mass in kg x f t at time t within a period of total time t a female s mass was bounded by a maximum value x max f and a minimum value x min f such that she died if she fell below this critical level we chose 120 kg for x max f based on data from the age specific morphometric study by laake et al 2016 we used a single value for all age classes because the primary purpose of this bound is to operationalize the model because we modeled sea lions throughout their life i e at varying ages and masses we calculated x min f as a function of age figs s1 s3 supp text adult females in states 3 lactating and 4 lactating and pregnant were characterized by an additional physiological state x p t the mass in kg of their dependent pup the pup s mass was also bounded by x max p 36 kg and x min p which was again an age specific value figs s2 s3 supp text the energy requirements of a sea lion at each time step consist of energy needed for maintenance digestion thermoregulation and locomotion collectively referred to as field metabolic rate or fmr and reproduction where applicable growth costs were not explicitly included in the energy budget but were instead addressed when estimating the energy gain from foraging supp text we calculated mass specific fmrs based on metabolic measurements collected from free ranging and captive adult female california sea lions mchuron et al 2017b williams et al 2007 table 1 we did not have similar data for juveniles but a comparison of data from free ranging juvenile and adult australian sea lions neophoca cinerea revealed that the mean mass specific at sea fmr of juveniles was 1 4 times the value for adult females during the same time of year costa and gales 2003 fowler et al 2007 thus we assumed that the mass specific fmr of juvenile sea lions was 1 4 times adult rates the cost of lactation was calculated using data from oftedal et al 1987 a study that measured milk energy intake and mass changes of sea lion pups during the first two months of lactation we used the values from mchuron et al 2017b to calculate the daily cost of gestation α g in table 1 we show values used in the calculation of the physiological dynamics the time step across which energy requirements and mass dynamics were assessed differed between females that were non lactating states 1 and 2 and lactating states 3 and 4 we assumed a time step 1 day for non lactating females which contrasts with the natural behavior of sea lions and the approach used for lactating females that consists of alternating foraging trips at sea with periods resting onshore we chose not to model this additional complexity for these two reproductive states because unlike lactating females non lactating females can 1 use multiple haul outs that may in fact be close or far from foraging grounds making it difficult to predict the duration of foraging trips and 2 exploit the most profitable foraging grounds moving considerable distances to find new foraging patches if they have poor foraging success on any given day additionally there are very few empirical data on trip and haul out durations for juvenile and non lactating california sea lions and there is no apparent fitness implication associated with this assumption as the length of the foraging trip primarily affects pup but not female condition costa et al 1989 the time step for lactating females varied as a function of foraging trip length which was determined using a negative binomial nb foraging model see nb foraging model the mass dynamics for non lactating females states 1 and 2 were as follows if a female did not find prey on any given day which happened with probability 1 λ1 or 2 her mass declined as a function of mass specific fmr mj day 1 kg 0 75 kleiber 1961 and daily gestation costs when applicable α g 2 x f t 1 x f t f m r l a n d s e a x f t 0 75 α g 33 where 33 mj kg 1 is the energy density of blubber kuhnleini and soueida 1992 assuming that all mass changes occur through the deposition or metabolism of blubber at no additional cost if a female did find prey on any given day which happened with probability λ1 or 2 mass was added after accounting for the costs of maintenance and gestation 3 x f t 1 x f t f m r l a n d s e a x f t 0 75 α g 33 e p r e y x f p m e 33 where e p r e y x f is the energy gain from foraging in mj day 1 for a female of mass xf see foraging environment and p m e is the proportion of energy available for metabolism costa 1986 the state dynamics for lactating females states 3 and 4 were as follows after birth females spent an extended duration ashore with the pup termed the perinatal period before they undertook their first foraging trip to sea we used a fixed duration for the time spent ashore during this period d p n 8 days based on data from heath et al 1991 and assumed that a female lost 2 of her body mass for each day of fasting costa and trillmich 1988 thus the mass dynamics for a lactating female during the perinatal period were 4 x f t b a m n d p n x f t b a m n 0 02 x f t b a m n d p n the mass dynamics for a lactating female during the rest of lactation were similar to eq 3 although maintenance costs were divided into sea and land periods and there was an added cost associated with providing energy to the pup 5 x f t d m c x f t f m r s e a d s e a f m r l a n d d l a n d x f t 0 75 e p u p α g d

energy allocated to the pup in mj trip 1 see below and e p r e y x f x p is the energy gained from foraging in mj trip 1 we calculated the energy required by the pup to grow at an average mass gain of 0 085 kg day 1 mcclatchie et al 2016a oftedal et al 1987 based on mass specific estimates of daily gross energy intake e m i l k and the average duration of the maternal cycle d m c 6 e p u p e m i l k d m c we calculated e m i l k by solving the equation from fig 2b in oftedal et al 1987b that describes daily mass gain as a function of daily gross energy intake for example to grow at a rate of 0 085 kg day 1 a 15 kg pup would require 11 7 mj day 1 e m i l k or 94 8 early or 79 6 late mj trip 1 e p u p assuming the trip was of average duration the resulting value of e m i l k was used in conjunction with a series of milk allocation rules fig s4 supp text to calculate e m i l k and thus e p u p based on the actual length of the maternal cycle for example when a foraging trip was one day longer than expected a female would need to allocate an additional 11 7 mj to the pup to maintain pup growth at 0 085 kg day 1 the milk energy allocation rules supp text dictated how much energy a female delivered to her pup and the resulting growth rate when her foraging trip was shorter longer than expected these rules account for that fact that in nature pups do not always grow at the average rate particularly during periods of above average or reduced prey availability mcclatchie et al 2016b during the perinatal period we assumed that the pup gained a fixed rate of 0 1 kg day 1 ono et al 1987 so that 7 x p t b a m n d p n x p t b a m n 0 1 d p n during the rest of lactation the pup mass dynamics were 8 x p t d m c x p t e p u p g 1000 where e p u p g represents the conversion of e p u p from mj trip 1 to kcal kg 0 83 day 1 so that daily mass gain in g could be calculated using the equation in fig 2b in oftedal et al 1987b and then rescaled back to the entire

foraging e p r e y and the daily age specific risk of mortality β a the fine scale temporal and spatial dynamics of sea lion prey are not well characterized making it difficult to parameterize λ r and e p r e y using empirical data instead for non lactating females where the time step was one day we assumed that λ r was 0 55 juveniles and 0 6 adults and used satellite tracking and diving data to estimate λ r for lactating females states 3 and 4 see nb foraging model table 1 we calculated e p r e y following mchuron et al 2017b 9 e p r e y e x f x p y r t where e x f x p is the average gross energy requirement for a female given her mass and the mass of her pup when applicable and y r t is the profitability associated with foraging y r t 1 table 1 supp text thus the energy gained from successful foraging was a fixed multiple of a female s gross energy requirements for a non lactating female this always resulted in a net mass gain when she found prey dictated by λ r because the time step was always a single day and she had no dependent pup in contrast the magnitude and direction of mass changes for a lactating female depended on whether the length of her foraging trip was shorter longer or equivalent to the average duration supp text we used the annual survival estimates from hernández camacho et al 2008b for different age classes to calculate age specific daily mortality βa

model for lactating females in the case of lactating females states 3 and 4 we used the nb model described in mchuron et al 2017b to calculate λ r and determine the time steps in the backward iteration and the duration of each foraging trip in the forward simulation the nb distribution describes the probability of waiting for a fixed number of successes in this scenario it describes the probability distribution of the number of days at sea needed before a female has s days of successful foraging the remaining days spent at sea are comprised of travel time to a foraging patch τ and

assumed that d s e a and τ during early lactation were the same as measured during late lactation based on satellite telemetry of a limited number of sea lions tracked in both periods s melin unpublished data we also assumed that the behavior of lactating females was equivalent 2 6 stochastic dynamic programming equations when solving the sdp equations we assume that individuals act in such a way to maximize their lifetime reproductive fitness the fitness of females in all states is defined as the expected maximum accumulated pup recruitment taken over stochastic events of mortality

reproductive state for t t were calculated moving backwards through time and are described in detail below if at any time a female s mass fell below x min f she was presumed dead and all future fitness goes to zero similarly a female with a pup whose mass fell below x min p did not receive any credit for that pup because the probability of pup recruitment was zero for all fitness comparisons we assumed that if the fitness values of two different states were equivalent a female transitioned to the less energetically expensive state for example if a female in state 3 had a pup that fell below x min p she would have a future expected fitness value equal to a female in state 1 thus transitioning between the two states 2 6 1 reproductive state 1 juveniles or non pregnant non lactating

exposure scenarios we assessed the fitness and population consequences of disturbance by simulating a population of california sea lions initial size n 250 non pups across 15 years under different disturbance exposure scenarios assuming that individuals followed the optimal decisions based on eqs 12 21 we initialized the simulations with a stable age structure representing a well established population figs s7 s8 supp text we used data from melin et al 2012 that described the probability that a female of a given age range would survive and give birth the following year to assign a reproductive state to all reproductive aged females at the start of each simulation at the first time step in the simulation all pregnant females gave birth thus the initial population size was 250 we assigned initial masses to each individual from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation based on their age calculated from von bertalanffy parameters in table 4 of laake et al 2016 for simplicity we replaced e β a by its taylor expansion in the forward simulation at the beginning of each time step we compared βa to a random number drawn from a uniform distribution i e ũ 0 1 to determine if a female survived that time step she survived if ũ βa a similar approach was used to determine if non lactating females states 1 and 2 found food on any given day she found food if ũ λ the appropriate equations eqs 2 5 7 and 8 were used to calculate x f and x p when applicable at the next time step and reproductive state determined from the optimal decision at the time of birth which was the first time step in the simulation pups were assigned a mass based on a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation from table 4 in ono et al 1987 with a 50 50 sex ratio for lactating females we randomly drew the duration of a foraging trip from a distribution of values based on the probabilities from the nb model fig s9 in addition to early weaning determined from the sdp model we assumed that early weaning was initiated if a female had such a long foraging trip that she delivered no milk energy to her pup female pups recruited into the population on june 15th in the year following birth at their wean mass if ũ φ p x p for each year of the simulation we calculated the probability of pup recruitment i e the number of female pups that survived divided by the number of female pups born and the population size at the start of each year based on the number of adult and juvenile females alive plus the number of male and female pups born this allowed us to determine the mean pup recruitment across all years and the population growth rate which was calculated based on the initial and final population size we replicated each simulation 100 times to calculate a mean pup recruitment and population growth rate for each disturbance exposure scenario we simulated a total of 60 scenarios to determine how the 1 response of individuals to exposure 2 timing of exposure early vs late lactation 3 duration of exposure 1 3 or 6 months and 4 frequency of exposure the first year of the simulation vs all years of the simulation affected pup recruitment and population growth rates we assumed that when exposed to a disturbance on any given day an individual female responded by increasing her foraging trip duration either because foraging was disrupted or because she left the area to forage in a new location we modeled four fixed responses where all sea lions increased their trip duration by 0 undisturbed scenario 1 4 or 12 h for each day they were exposed and one variable response where the increase in foraging trip duration for each day of exposure was drawn from a truncated normal distribution from 0 h no response to 1 day strong response with a mean and standard deviation of 12 h the daily probability of exposure edist was arbitrarily set at 0 3 a sea lion was disturbed on a given foraging day if ũ edist we chose not to model disturbance for non lactating females because if exposed to a potential disturbance these individuals have the flexibility to forage outside of the disturbed area for extended periods of time we used cohen s d to determine the impact of exposure to disturbance on pup recruitment and population growth rates which is the difference between two means scaled by their pooled standard deviation cohen 1992 mchuron et al 2017a white et al 2014 we computed mean values by averaging the mean pup recruitment and population growth rates across simulation replicates we compared mean values from each scenario to values obtained with no disturbance the resulting values for cohen s d are a measure of the reduction in pup recruitment or population growth rate that can be attributed to disturbance in multiples of the common standard deviation in addition to the actual values we used values of 0 2 small effect 0 5 moderate effect and 0 8 large effect to qualitatively assess the impact of exposure to disturbance cohen 1992 1977 because the probability of disturbance was arbitrarily chosen we examined how changes in this parameter affected cohen s d by altering it by 50 for two scenarios that resulted in either a small or large effect of disturbance as determined using cohen s d we implemented the model using r version 3 4 1 r core development team 2017 3 results the model captured many of the complexities of the sea lion reproductive cycle including variability in the timing of life history events fig 3 juveniles were more likely to die than adults from both starvation and other sources of mortality with an average age at death of 3 2 years for sea lions that survived to reproductive age the majority of females first gave birth at ages 5 or 6 but some delayed reproduction up to 12 years of age pregnancy rates were high within any given year with an average of 92 of mature females becoming pregnant however many of these pregnancies were aborted as only 68 of mature females gave birth to a pup the following year when faced with periods of poor foraging success that resulted in loss of mass sea lions in state 4 lactating and pregnant generally aborted their fetus before weaning their current pup fig 3 the average wean date was april 8th 37 days before the weaning deadline of may 15th with female pups weaning at an average mass of 32 4 kg and a minimum mass of 9 1 kg on average 70 of pups weaned before the deadline largely because the pup had reached or was very close to x max p 70 of early weaning events with the remaining 30 of early weaning due to the combination of female and pup mass in the absence of disturbance the average pup recruitment was 0 70 0 09 with values ranging from 0 37 to 0 82 for individual replicates the mean population size in the last simulation year was 871 48 resulting in a mean population growth rate of 0 05 0 04 with values ranging from 58 to 1885 and 0 12 to 0 11 for individual replicates respectively in the presence of disturbance mean values for each scenario ranged from 0 48 to 0 72 pup recruitment 402 to 926 population size in last year and 0 09 to 0 05 population growth rate mean values for individual replicates in the presence of disturbance were 0 18 to 0 82 pup recruitment and 0 05 to 0 11 population growth with a minimum population size at the last time period across all scenarios and replicates of 2 sea lions disturbance that was recurrent in each year resulted in reductions in pup recruitment and population sizes even when sea lions had relatively mild behavioral responses to the disturbance 1 h or when the disturbance occurred for a relatively short duration 1 month fig 4 table s3 s4 the effect of a recurrent disturbance on population growth trajectories was not apparent for several years under less severe disturbance conditions fig 5 a the effect of disturbance on population size and growth rate was driven not only by changes in pup recruitment resulting from an earlier wean date and a lighter wean mass figs 4c and 5b but also from changes in pregnancy rates birth rates and the inter pup birth interval fig 5b there was a slight trend towards increased age at first reproduction with disturbance severity but the magnitude of the change was relatively small compared with the other parameters fig 5b disturbance had a similar effect on pup recruitment and population growth rates with cohen s d values for individual scenarios ranging from 0 3 to 2 8 and mean values across all disturbance scenarios of 0 39 for both variables changes in the duration frequency and behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance all had a strong effect on cohen s d whereas changes in the timing of disturbance during the year had relatively little effect on cohen s d fig s10 table s3 s4 for example there was an 11 increase in cohen s d for population growth rate when a disturbance occurred in late vs early lactation but a 700 increase when it occurred in every year vs just the first year of the model there was a relatively small effect of disturbance on pup recruitment or population growth when the behavioral response and duration of disturbance was short 4 h and 3 months regardless of the frequency of the disturbance cohen s d 0 5 although the probability of disturbance had a large effect on absolute values of cohen s d table s5 when the effect of disturbance as measured by cohen s d was relatively small changes in the probability of disturbance had a larger impact on the percentage change in cohen s d than when the effect of disturbance was large for example a 50 decrease in the probability of disturbance resulted in a 62 or 58 reduction in cohen s d with respect to population growth whereas a 50 increase resulted in a 123 or 30 increase in the value of cohen s d 4 discussion our model captured many of the reproductive complexities of a long lived income breeder using california sea lions as a motivating species these complexities which were emergent properties of the model included variation in the age at first reproduction termination of pregnancy and skipped breeding years and variation in the timing of weaning this ability to capture variation in reproductive behaviors is crucial for ecological models because changes in reproductive success are a primary driver of population dynamics while no model can capture all of the intricacies of a natural population the fecundity estimates from undisturbed scenarios were generally consistent with empirically derived data for california sea lions and other pinnipeds hammill and gosselin 1995 hernández camacho et al 2008a lima and paez 1995 mckenzie et al 2005 pitcher and calkins 1981 shero et al 2018 we calculated that on average 92 of mature females were pregnant in any given year with an annual abortion rate around 25 which is within the range of birth rate estimates of california sea lions from the gulf of mexico hernández camacho et al 2008a similarly studies on steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus and new zealand fur seals arctocephalus forsteri found pregnancy rates as high as 96 with an average of 32 of these pregnancies ending in early termination mckenzie et al 2005 pitcher and calkins 1981 once pups were born in the forward simulation some females nursed up until the weaning deadline but the average length of lactation was approximately 10 months with 59 of pups weaned before may 1st these findings are similar to a mark recapture study of branded california sea lion pups that found a minimum of 40 of pups were still nursing by the end of april with the majority of weaning occurring during a one month period starting at the end of april harris 2016 the earlier time of weaning estimated from our model compared with estimates from harris 2016 may have been due to differences in energy availability i e greater energy return to females from foraging in our model or energy allocation to pups i e greater energy allocated to pups in our model this could represent inaccuracies in our model but it also may simply reflect that we simulated better foraging conditions than the actual conditions experienced by the mothers of pups resighted in harris 2016 measurements of reproductive characteristics such as reproductive rates and weaning dates are important for understanding population dynamics and in quantifying population responses to environmental variability empirical measurements can however be difficult to obtain as they typically require time intensive resighting effort of marked individuals which is particularly challenging for species that have extended periods of maternal care and reproduce in remote areas the similarities between the model output from the forward simulations and empirically derived estimates suggests that the state transitions derived from the backward iteration are consistent with the behavioral decisions of sea lions in nature thus while our primary goal was to highlight the use of sdp models in the context of anthropogenic disturbance the model we developed here could be used to estimate these variables as well as address fundamental ecological processes and the mechanisms that give rise to these processes clark and mangel 2000 houston and mcnamara 1999 mangel and clark 1988 for example several otariid species including california sea lions can exhibit extended lactation durations 1 year higgins and gass 1993 trillmich and wolf 2008 and a modified version of our model could be used to investigate the environmental conditions that give rise to this phenomena these modifications include a relaxation or elimination of the weaning deadline as well as the inclusion of an additional reproductive state s to allow a female to nurse a juvenile practical application of our approach requires knowledge of the disturbance and dose response curve which are exogenous to the behavioral and life history modeling lacking those for california sea lions we were still able to quantify the consequences of a general anthropogenic disturbance on pup recruitment and population dynamics via analysis of a wide range of scenarios we modelled the behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance as an increase in foraging trip duration as such the results from our disturbance scenarios are comparable with natural environmental fluctuations because female otariids often alter their foraging trip duration in response to changes in prey availability and distribution costa 2008 in our model disturbance had a negative impact on population dynamics primarily through reproductive changes and not adult mortality which is in accordance with life history theory roff 1993 stearns 1992 while reduced pup recruitment due to a lower mass at weaning was an important driver of negative impacts of disturbance on population dynamics alterations in other reproductive characteristics also contributed to this trend pregnancy rates declined slightly but there were much larger changes in birth rates and the inter pup interval indicating that disturbance increased abortion rates and led to skipped reproductive years pups that weaned at a lower mass were more likely to delay reproduction but the magnitude of this change compared with undisturbed scenarios was relatively ssmall these results are consistent with the response of otariid populations to el niño events and other time periods of prey depletion lunn et al 1994 soto et al 2004 trillmich et al 1991 further validating that our model captured some of the reproductive complexity of california sea lions our focus was largely on model development and the disturbance scenarios should not be interpreted as representative of a specific disturbance situation we do however show the utility of using sdp models to fully implement the pcod framework by using a range of disturbance scenarios in the undisturbed case combining backward iteration and forward simulation allows us to both simulate the trajectories of populations and compute the entries for a stage or age structured matrix model of population dynamics when anthropogenic disturbance not in the evolutionary history of the animals is added forward simulation becomes essential because we do not know a priori how disturbance will affect them for marine mammals approaches for determining the effects of disturbance on vital rates and population dynamics have largely focused on bioenergetic models which are primarily limited to capital breeding species costa et al 2016 villegas amtmann et al 2017 2015 or individual based models solely comprised of a forward simulation king et al 2015 nabe nielsen et al 2018 new et al 2014 our approach is also individual based and uses forward simulation however it is the combination of backward iteration with the sdp model and forward simulation that makes it so powerful the backward iteration links environment and reproductive success through physiology and leads to state and time dependent behavioral decisions by implementing those rules in the forward simulation we are able to obtain estimates of annual reproductive success and survival in the absence and presence of disturbance it is those estimates that allow us to reach the objective of population consequences the trajectory in fig 5 pirotta et al 2018 provides another example of the power of the backward iteration and forward simulation particularly as it relates to differential responses to natural environmental fluctuations that are in the evolutionary history of a species and an anthropogenic or other environmental disturbance that is not using cohen s d allowed us to assess the relative influence of disturbance scenario parameters which can help prioritize future data collection efforts and provide insight into planning activities that create disturbance for example characteristics of the disturbance such as how often and how long the disturbance occurred had a relatively strong impact on whether disturbance affected vital rates and population dynamics repetitive disturbances had the largest impact on pup recruitment even when the behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance was relatively mild or the duration of the disturbance was relatively short while our disturbance scenarios were not meant to represent a disturbance specific to sea lions potential repetitive disturbances that may be experienced by wild populations across the durations we simulated include ecotourism seismic surveys road and vessel noise annual naval exercises and development of renewable energy sources e g wind or tidal turbines for the probability of disturbance that we simulated disturbance scenarios that only occurred in the first year of the simulation generally did not affect pup recruitment or population growth however the animals sensitivity to disturbance probability of being disturbed and behavioral response also had a strong impact on the effect of disturbance on these parameters this suggests that income breeding populations may be vulnerable to even short infrequent disturbances such as sonar or construction nabe nielsen et al 2018 although the results from our model indicated that it may take several years after the initial disturbance to detect its effect on population growth rates this lag is likely due to the delay between recruitment and reproductive maturity as it took a minimum of three years for sea lions that were pups at the time of the initial disturbance to reach reproductive maturity on the other hand the timing of disturbance during lactation had a relatively small influence on cohen s d however it is important to consider that this may not be a general characteristic across species if there are significant temporal changes in prey availability that co occur with an anthropogenic disturbance while not included here temporal changes in prey availability are straightforward to incorporate into sdp models pirotta et al 2018 in addition to characteristics of the disturbance itself the behavioral response of an individual to disturbance was influential highlighting the importance of short term behavioral response studies that attempt to measure just this collectively these results suggest that caution should be applied in making blanket conclusions about the robustness of income breeding species to anthropogenic disturbance since types of disturbance e g naval sonar seismic surveys may differ in their characteristics and individuals may not exhibit the same behavioral response to all types of anthropogenic disturbance as the human footprint continues to expand in the natural world the ability to assess the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance by linking behavioral and energetic effects at the individual to the population level becomes essential for accurate prediction of population trajectories the challenges raised by human wildlife interactions are a global problem common to both terrestrial and marine environments and understanding the population effects of human related disturbances on wildlife has been identified as a conservation priority francis and barber 2013 the methods we have developed here and illustrated with california sea lions are a natural framework for studying the linkages between disturbance and population consequences we have shown that characteristics of the disturbance itself and animal behavior are both important components of understanding when a disturbance results in biologically meaningful effects which underscores the importance of research efforts to understand the short term behavioral responses of species to a disturbance and more general ecological studies that quantify animal movements and habitat use our results indicate that while prolonged repetitive exposures are more likely to have an effect even relatively short infrequent disturbances can adversely affect population dynamics of an income breeding species the derivation of state and time dependent reproductive decisions using an sdp model captures many of the important aspects of an income breeders life history strategy and while parameterized for california sea lions could be adapted to model reproductive decisions in a wide range of mammalian species the structure of sdp models is also flexible allowing for the incorporation of additional state variables or biological parameters that may be of interest for specific applications such as density dependent effects age specific reproductive rates and desensitization of individuals that are repetitively disturbed in addition to reproductive decisions foraging location is likely to be an important state variable for anthropogenic applications and this model serves as a stepping stone towards the development of

25218,human activities continue to expand in marine and terrestrial environments leading to increased interactions with wildlife that can have negative impacts on population dynamics approaches for quantifying how these interactions translate to population level effects are therefore crucial for effective management practices and balancing human wildlife tradeoffs we developed a method using state dependent behavioral theory implemented via stochastic dynamic programming sdp for predicting the population consequences of disturbance on the physiology and reproductive behavior of an income breeding mammal using california sea lions zalophus californianus as a motivating species emergent properties of the model included reproductive characteristics associated with long lived species such as variation in the age at first reproduction early termination of pregnancy and skipped breeding in undisturbed model simulations reproductive rates and the average wean date were consistent with empirically derived estimates from sea lions and other marine mammals highlighting the utility of this model for quantifying fecundity estimates of data deficient species and addressing fundamental ecological processes in disturbed model simulations exposure to prolonged repetitive disturbances negatively impacted population growth in addition short infrequent disturbances had the potential for adverse effects depending on the behavioral response of sea lions and the probability of being disturbed the adverse effect of disturbance on population dynamics was due to a combination of reduced pup recruitment survival to age one resulting from a lower wean mass and increased abortion rates that led to skipped reproductive years both of which have been documented for marine mammal populations experiencing natural fluctuations in prey availability the derivation of state and time dependent reproductive decisions using an sdp model is an effective approach that links behavioral and energetic effects at the individual level to changes at the population level and one that serves a dual purpose in the ability to quantify basic biological parameters and address ecological questions irrespective of disturbance keywords stochastic dynamic programming pcod marine mammals life history acoustic disturbance 1 introduction wildlife populations face increasing pressure from human activities that can result in direct mortality or indirect effects including behavioral changes or disruption of life histories knowlton and kraus 2001 shannon et al 2016 smith et al 2015 stankowich 2008 a growing human footprint in the marine environment has led to increased interactions between humans and marine mammals resulting in concern about the impact of these activities on

a us national research council committee in 2005 wartzok et al 2005 further development of these ideas led to the population consequences of disturbance pcod framework which conceptualizes how disturbance translates from the individual to the population level through a series of transfer functions that link a behavioral or physiological response by an individual often modeled as a change in energy with changes in health vital rates and population dynamics new et al 2014 applications of the pcod framework have been limited costa et al 2016 nabe nielsen et al 2018 new et al 2014 due to the combination of a lack of basic life history data for many species and the challenges of quantifying some of these transfer functions for species that are long lived and often wide ranging and elusive mchuron et al 2017a proposed that state dependent behavioral theory implemented via stochastic dynamic programming sdp mangel and clark 1988 houston and mcnamara 1999 clark and mangel 2000 is a viable method for quantifying the functions that link behavior with vital rates thereby enabling implementation of the pcod framework sdp models have been applied across a broad range of taxonomic groups for quantifying the effects of natural environmental disturbance bull et al 1996 denis et al 2012 satterthwaite and mangel 2012 tenhumberg et al 2000 but until recently had not been applied in the context of anthropogenic disturbance mchuron et al 2017a pirotta et al 2018 this approach originates from the tenant that behavior is an evolutionary trait and allows for different behavioral responses to disturbance conditioned on the environment and an individual s physiological state initial efforts to model the effects of disturbance on marine mammals using sdp models focused on the impact of disturbance on expected reproductive success within a single year and did not explicitly model transitions between reproductive states individuals either remained in a fixed reproductive state throughout that time period mchuron et al 2017a or transitioned between two reproductive states pregnant or not pregnant based on a simple threshold value pirotta et al 2018 the incorporation of reproductive transitions into sdp models is an important next step that will facilitate species specific applications particularly for income breeding species that have the potential for simultaneous gestation and lactation necessitating an approach that can capture transitions among reproductive states i e early weaning and abortion in a way that is more akin to how these transitions likely occur in nature income breeding is a reproductive strategy used by many mammalian and non mammalian species bonnet et al 1998 costa 1991 jönsson 1997 oftedal 1997 schulz and bowen 2004 that may increase the susceptibility of individuals and populations to energetic disruptions costa et al 2016 mchuron et al 2017a this reproductive strategy complicates pcod models because as females rely on energy gained throughout lactation to support offspring growth the timing of disturbance becomes a more complicated subject and requires an approach that goes beyond bioenergetic models costa et al 2016 villegas amtmann et al 2017 2015 sdp models represent a natural framework in which to address these issues however as will be seen below modeling the transitions among multiple reproductive states is not a trivial addition we present an sdp model expanding on mchuron et al 2017a that includes many of the biologically relevant extensions that would be desired to model the population consequences of disturbance for an income breeding marine mammal we illustrate these extensions using california sea lions zalophus californianus as a case study because their physiology behavior and demographics have been well studied compared with many other marine mammals in addition to describing the derivation of the sdp equations we simulated a variety of hypothetical disturbance scenarios to examine how variability in 1 an individual s response to exposure 2 the timing of exposure within the year 3 the duration of exposure and 4 the repetitiveness of the exposure affected pup recruitment and population growth rates we focus on highlighting the utility of this approach in implementing the pcod framework and how it can be used to identify and prioritize research needs but also discuss its application in addressing key ecological questions and processes irrespective of disturbance 2 methods sdp models involve two primary components a backward iteration where optimal behavioral decisions are identified assuming individuals act to maximize some metric of darwinian fitness and an individual based forward simulation where the state dynamics and behavioral decisions of a population are simulated anthropogenic disturbance can be introduced in the forward simulation under the assumption that it is not in the evolutionary history of the organism and thus does not influence the behavioral decisions generated in the backward iteration clark and mangel 2000 mangel and clark 1988 mchuron et al 2017a the backward iteration consists of 1 identification of a time horizon 2 characterization of physiological state variables and how they change in response to the environment and behavior 3 definition of a function that links the state variables s to a measure of darwinian fitness referred to as the terminal fitness function and 4 derivation of the sdp equations that predict the behavior of individuals based on state and time the sections below follow this progression a conceptual diagram of the backward iteration and forward simulation as described below is shown in fig 1 2 1 life cycle california sea lions typically give birth to a single pup annually in late may through june peterson and bartholomew 1967 the majority of the us population breeds in the channel islands in southern california on one of two islands san miguel and san nicolas islands breeding occurs 6 weeks after birth in july and august peterson and bartholomew 1967 but implantation of the embryo is delayed for several months greig et al 2007 female sea lions are income breeders and central place foragers during the 10 11 month lactation period harris 2016 melin et al 2000 during this time they alternate foraging trips to sea 2 to 7 days with short periods onshore nursing their pup 1 2 days supporting their metabolic needs and those of their pup using energy gained on each foraging trip costa et al 1991 mchuron et al 2016 melin et al 2000 weaning can be initiated by either the female or the pup after weaning females may continue to frequent the rookery or leave the area for more productive foraging areas before returning to give birth melin et al 2000 in contrast to nursing females juvenile sea lions and non lactating females are not tied to a central place and may forage throughout the california current system mchuron et al 2018 melin et al 2000 orr et al 2012 pregnancy and reproductive failure rates of california sea lions are unknown but age specific birth and survival rates the probability of a female surviving and being seen with a pup the following year provide evidence of reproductive senescence in this species hernández camacho et al 2008a melin et al 2012 2 2 model timeline in nature there is variability in the timing of life history events but for simplicity we assumed either a fixed date birth implantation death or a maximum fixed date weaning for each of these events pups were born on day t b which we set to be calendar date june 15 and model day t 1 365 etc we assumed that implantation occurred on day t i which we set to be calendar date october 15 and model date t 125 490 etc pups were weaned on or before day t w which we set to be calendar date may 15 in the year following birth and model date t 335 700 etc once weaned surviving pups recruited into the population as juveniles on calendar date june 15 in the year following their birth we set the age in years of juvenile sea lions as a 1 2 am or the age of first possible implantation and the age in years of an adult female sea lion as a am n where n 1 2 3 n is the number of years a female can be reproductively active thus reproductive senescence occurs at age am n years we set the age of death in years at 25 t t and model date t 9489 a female died just before she turned 26 the timing of each life history event for a pup born in year y to a female in her nth reproductive year can be calculated as 1 t b y a m n 365 t i y 125 t b y t w y 1 335 t b y based on data we set am 4 years and n 17 years so that a female was 21 years old when she weaned her last pup hernández camacho et al 2008a melin et al 2012 there are four reproductive states possible for adult females and one reproductive state possible for juveniles fig 2 non reproductive state 1 pregnant state 2 lactating state 3 and lactating and pregnant state 4 in the year of reproductive senescence a female can only be in state 1 or state 3 and after weaning is continually in a non reproductive state until the time of her death ad the transition from state 2 to state 3 can only occur at tb and transitions from either state 1 to state 2 or state 3 to state 4 can only occur at ti in contrast transitions from a higher to a lower reproductive state can occur between transition periods due to aborting a pregnancy or early weaning of the pup fig 2 2 3 physiological dynamics we characterized non reproductive and pregnant females states 1 and 2 by a single physiological state mass in kg x f t at time t within a period of total time t a female s mass was bounded by a maximum value x max f and a minimum value x min f such that she died if she fell below this critical level we chose 120 kg for x max f based on data from the age specific morphometric study by laake et al 2016 we used a single value for all age classes because the primary purpose of this bound is to operationalize the model because we modeled sea lions throughout their life i e at varying ages and masses we calculated x min f as a function of age figs s1 s3 supp text adult females in states 3 lactating and 4 lactating and pregnant were characterized by an additional physiological state x p t the mass in kg of their dependent pup the pup s mass was also bounded by x max p 36 kg and x min p which was again an age specific value figs s2 s3 supp text the energy requirements of a sea lion at each time step consist of energy needed for maintenance digestion thermoregulation and locomotion collectively referred to as field metabolic rate or fmr and reproduction where applicable growth costs were not explicitly included in the energy budget but were instead addressed when estimating the energy gain from foraging supp text we calculated mass specific fmrs based on metabolic measurements collected from free ranging and captive adult female california sea lions mchuron et al 2017b williams et al 2007 table 1 we did not have similar data for juveniles but a comparison of data from free ranging juvenile and adult australian sea lions neophoca cinerea revealed that the mean mass specific at sea fmr of juveniles was 1 4 times the value for adult females during the same time of year costa and gales 2003 fowler et al 2007 thus we assumed that the mass specific fmr of juvenile sea lions was 1 4 times adult rates the cost of lactation was calculated using data from oftedal et al 1987 a study that measured milk energy intake and mass changes of sea lion pups during the first two months of lactation we used the values from mchuron et al 2017b to calculate the daily cost of gestation α g in table 1 we show values used in the calculation of the physiological dynamics the time step across which energy requirements and mass dynamics were assessed differed between females that were non lactating states 1 and 2 and lactating states 3 and 4 we assumed a time step 1 day for non lactating females which contrasts with the natural behavior of sea lions and the approach used for lactating females that consists of alternating foraging trips at sea with periods resting onshore we chose not to model this additional complexity for these two reproductive states because unlike lactating females non lactating females can 1 use multiple haul outs that may in fact be close or far from foraging grounds making it difficult to predict the duration of foraging trips and 2 exploit the most profitable foraging grounds moving considerable distances to find new foraging patches if they have poor foraging success on any given day additionally there are very few empirical data on trip and haul out durations for juvenile and non lactating california sea lions and there is no apparent fitness implication associated with this assumption as the length of the foraging trip primarily affects pup but not female condition costa et al 1989 the time step for lactating females varied as a function of foraging trip length which was determined using a negative binomial nb foraging model see nb foraging model the mass dynamics for non lactating females states 1 and 2 were as follows if a female did not find prey on any given day which happened with probability 1 λ1 or 2 her mass declined as a function of mass specific fmr mj day 1 kg 0 75 kleiber 1961 and daily gestation costs when applicable α g 2 x f t 1 x f t f m r l a n d s e a x f t 0 75 α g 33 where 33 mj kg 1 is the energy density of blubber kuhnleini and soueida 1992 assuming that all mass changes occur through the deposition or metabolism of blubber at no additional cost if a female did find prey on any given day which happened with probability λ1 or 2 mass was added after accounting for the costs of maintenance and gestation 3 x f t 1 x f t f m r l a n d s e a x f t 0 75 α g 33 e p r e y x f p m e 33 where e p r e y x f is the energy gain from foraging in mj day 1 for a female of mass xf see foraging environment and p m e is the proportion of energy available for metabolism costa 1986 the state dynamics for lactating females states 3 and 4 were as follows after birth females spent an extended duration ashore with the pup termed the perinatal period before they undertook their first foraging trip to sea we used a fixed duration for the time spent ashore during this period d p n 8 days based on data from heath et al 1991 and assumed that a female lost 2 of her body mass for each day of fasting costa and trillmich 1988 thus the mass dynamics for a lactating female during the perinatal period were 4 x f t b a m n d p n x f t b a m n 0 02 x f t b a m n d p n the mass dynamics for a lactating female during the rest of lactation were similar to eq 3 although maintenance costs were divided into sea and land periods and there was an added cost associated with providing energy to the pup 5 x f t d m c x f t f m r s e a d s e a f m r l a n d d l a n d x f t 0 75 e p u p α g d

energy allocated to the pup in mj trip 1 see below and e p r e y x f x p is the energy gained from foraging in mj trip 1 we calculated the energy required by the pup to grow at an average mass gain of 0 085 kg day 1 mcclatchie et al 2016a oftedal et al 1987 based on mass specific estimates of daily gross energy intake e m i l k and the average duration of the maternal cycle d m c 6 e p u p e m i l k d m c we calculated e m i l k by solving the equation from fig 2b in oftedal et al 1987b that describes daily mass gain as a function of daily gross energy intake for example to grow at a rate of 0 085 kg day 1 a 15 kg pup would require 11 7 mj day 1 e m i l k or 94 8 early or 79 6 late mj trip 1 e p u p assuming the trip was of average duration the resulting value of e m i l k was used in conjunction with a series of milk allocation rules fig s4 supp text to calculate e m i l k and thus e p u p based on the actual length of the maternal cycle for example when a foraging trip was one day longer than expected a female would need to allocate an additional 11 7 mj to the pup to maintain pup growth at 0 085 kg day 1 the milk energy allocation rules supp text dictated how much energy a female delivered to her pup and the resulting growth rate when her foraging trip was shorter longer than expected these rules account for that fact that in nature pups do not always grow at the average rate particularly during periods of above average or reduced prey availability mcclatchie et al 2016b during the perinatal period we assumed that the pup gained a fixed rate of 0 1 kg day 1 ono et al 1987 so that 7 x p t b a m n d p n x p t b a m n 0 1 d p n during the rest of lactation the pup mass dynamics were 8 x p t d m c x p t e p u p g 1000 where e p u p g represents the conversion of e p u p from mj trip 1 to kcal kg 0 83 day 1 so that daily mass gain in g could be calculated using the equation in fig 2b in oftedal et al 1987b and then rescaled back to the entire trip g trip 1 2 4 foraging environment the foraging environment for each reproductive state r was characterized by the long term probability of finding prey on any given day λ r the energy gain from foraging e p r e y and the daily age specific risk of mortality β a the fine scale temporal and spatial dynamics of sea lion prey are not well characterized making it difficult to parameterize λ r and e p r e y using empirical data instead for non lactating females where the time step was one day we assumed that λ r was 0 55 juveniles and 0 6 adults and used satellite tracking and diving data to estimate λ r for lactating females states 3 and 4 see nb foraging model table 1 we calculated e p r e y following mchuron et al 2017b 9 e p r e y e x f x p y r t where e x f x p is the average gross energy requirement for a female given her mass and the mass of her pup when applicable and y r t is the profitability associated with foraging y r t 1 table 1 supp text thus the energy gained from successful foraging was a fixed multiple of a female s gross energy requirements for a non lactating female this always resulted in a net mass gain when she found prey dictated by λ r because the time step was always a single day and she had no dependent pup in contrast the magnitude and direction of mass changes for a lactating female depended on whether the length of her foraging trip was shorter longer or equivalent to the average duration supp text we used the annual survival estimates from hernández camacho et al 2008b for different age classes to calculate age specific daily mortality βa fig s5 supp text which likely already includes some level of anthropogenic disturbance our effects of disturbance are thus in addition to these baseline values 2 5 the negative binomial nb foraging model for lactating females in the case of lactating females states 3 and 4 we used the nb model described in mchuron et al 2017b to calculate λ r and determine the time steps in the backward iteration and the duration of each foraging trip in the forward simulation the nb distribution describes the probability of waiting for a fixed number of successes in this scenario it describes the probability distribution of the number of days at sea needed before a female has s days of successful foraging the remaining days spent at sea are comprised of travel time to a foraging patch τ and unsuccessful days of foraging k such that the average trip duration is 10 d s e a s k 2 τ the average number of successful foraging days s is determined by λ r mchuron et al 2017b 11 λ r s d s e a 2 τ we used existing tracking and diving data of lactating adult females collected during early and late lactation to estimate s τ d s e a and d l a n d and calculated λ r from these values table 1 we assumed that d s e a and τ during early lactation were the same as measured during late lactation based on satellite telemetry of a limited number of sea lions tracked in both periods s melin unpublished data we also assumed that the behavior of lactating females was equivalent 2 6 stochastic dynamic programming equations when solving the sdp equations we assume that individuals act in such a way to maximize their lifetime reproductive fitness the fitness of females in all states is defined as the expected maximum accumulated pup recruitment taken over stochastic events of mortality and finding prey pup recruitment is defined as survival to age one the output of the sdp equations is both fitness and the optimal behavioral decision for each reproductive state d 1 x f t d 2 x f t d 3 x f x p t d 4 x f x p t we generically denote these by d at the time of weaning in the year of reproductive senescence t there are two possible reproductive states the terminal fitness of a non pregnant female states 1 and 3 is 12 f 1 x f t 0 f 3 x f x p t φ p x p where φ p x p describes the probability of pup recruitment into the population at age one as a function of mass at weaning fig s6 supp text after t the future fitness of all females is 0 i e we ignore any grandparental effects and all females transition to state 1 until death the fitness and optimal decisions for each reproductive state for t t were calculated moving backwards through time and are described in detail below if at any time a female s mass fell below x min f she was presumed dead and all future fitness goes to zero similarly a female with a pup whose mass fell below x min p did not receive any credit for that pup because the probability of pup recruitment was zero for all fitness comparisons we assumed that if the fitness values of two different states were equivalent a female transitioned to the less energetically expensive state for example if a female in state 3 had a pup that fell below x min p she would have a future expected fitness value equal to a female in state 1 thus transitioning between the two states 2 6 1 reproductive state 1 juveniles or non pregnant non lactating adults for times less than t the fitness of females in state 1 is find food does not find food f 1 x f t e β a λ 1 f 1 x f t 1 1 λ 1 f 1 x f t 1 where x f is the future expected mass calculated using eq 2 for the second term on the right hand side of eq 13 and eq 3 for the first term on the right hand side of eq 13 to simplify notation we denote the right hand side of eq 13 as f 1 x f t 1 λ 1 β a y 1 in future equations at the time of the next possible implantation a female either implants in which case she moves to state 2 or remains in a non reproductive state this decision depends on a

described in eqs 4 and 7 respectively between the end of the perinatal period and the time step before weaning the nb foraging model applies so that fitness depends on the probability distribution of the number of unsuccessful foraging days k given the probability of finding prey p k λ 3 t and a binomial variable s k i x f 0 or 1 describing whether a female would fall below x min f if all

exposure scenarios we assessed the fitness and population consequences of disturbance by simulating a population of california sea lions initial size n 250 non pups across 15 years under different disturbance exposure scenarios assuming that individuals followed the optimal decisions based on eqs 12 21 we initialized the simulations with a stable age structure representing a well established population figs s7 s8 supp text we used data from melin et al 2012 that described the probability that a female of a given age range would survive and give birth the following year to assign a reproductive state to all reproductive aged females at the start of each simulation at the first time step in the simulation all pregnant females gave birth thus the initial population size was 250 we assigned initial masses to each individual from a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation based on their age calculated from von bertalanffy parameters in table 4 of laake et al 2016 for simplicity we replaced e β a by its taylor expansion in the forward simulation at the beginning of each time step we compared βa to a random number drawn from a uniform distribution i e ũ 0 1 to determine if a female survived that time step she survived if ũ βa a similar approach was used to determine if non lactating females states 1 and 2 found food on any given day she found food if ũ λ the appropriate equations eqs 2 5 7 and 8 were used to calculate x f and x p when applicable at the next time step and reproductive state determined from the optimal decision at the time of birth which was the first time step in the simulation pups were assigned a mass based on a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation from table 4 in ono et al 1987 with a 50 50 sex ratio for lactating females we randomly drew the duration of a foraging trip from a distribution of values based on the probabilities from the nb model fig s9 in addition to early weaning determined from the sdp model we assumed that early weaning was initiated if a female had such a long foraging trip that she delivered no milk energy to her pup female pups recruited into the population on june 15th in the year following birth at their wean mass if ũ φ p x p for each year of the simulation we calculated the probability of pup recruitment i e the number of female pups that survived divided by the number of female pups born and the population size at the start of each year based on the number of adult and juvenile females alive plus the number of male and female pups born this allowed us to determine the mean pup recruitment across all years and the population growth rate which was calculated based on the initial and final population size we replicated each simulation 100 times to calculate a mean pup recruitment and population growth rate for each disturbance exposure scenario we simulated a total of 60 scenarios to determine how the 1 response of individuals to exposure 2 timing of exposure early vs late lactation 3 duration of exposure 1 3 or 6 months and 4 frequency of exposure the first year of the simulation vs all years of the simulation affected pup recruitment and population growth rates we assumed that when exposed to a disturbance on any given day an individual female responded by increasing her foraging trip duration either because foraging was disrupted or because she left the area to forage in a new location we modeled four fixed responses where all sea lions increased their trip duration by 0 undisturbed scenario 1 4 or 12 h for each day they were exposed and one variable response where the increase in foraging trip duration for each day of exposure was drawn from a truncated normal distribution from 0 h no response to 1 day strong response with a mean and standard deviation of 12 h the daily probability of exposure edist was arbitrarily set at 0 3 a sea lion was disturbed on a given foraging day if ũ edist we chose not to model disturbance for non lactating females because if exposed to a potential disturbance these individuals have the flexibility to forage outside of the disturbed area for extended periods of time we used cohen s d to determine the impact of exposure to disturbance on pup recruitment and population growth rates which is the difference between two means scaled by their pooled standard deviation cohen 1992 mchuron et al 2017a white et al 2014 we computed mean values by averaging the mean pup recruitment and population growth rates across simulation replicates we compared mean values from each scenario to values obtained with no disturbance the resulting values for cohen s d are a measure of the reduction in pup recruitment or population growth rate that can be attributed to disturbance in multiples of the common standard deviation in addition to the actual values we used values of 0 2 small effect 0 5 moderate effect and 0 8 large effect to qualitatively assess the impact of exposure to disturbance cohen 1992 1977 because the probability of disturbance was arbitrarily chosen we examined how changes in this parameter affected cohen s d by altering it by 50 for two scenarios that resulted in either a small or large effect of disturbance as determined using cohen s d we implemented the model using r version 3 4 1 r core development team 2017 3 results the model captured many of the complexities of the sea lion reproductive cycle including variability in the timing of life history events fig 3 juveniles were more likely to die than adults from both starvation and other sources of mortality with an average age at death of 3 2 years for sea lions that survived to reproductive age the majority of females first gave birth at ages 5 or 6 but some delayed reproduction up to 12 years of age pregnancy rates were high within any given year with an average of 92 of mature females becoming pregnant however many of these pregnancies were aborted as only 68 of mature females gave birth to a pup the following year when faced with periods of poor foraging success that resulted in loss of mass sea lions in state 4 lactating and pregnant generally aborted their fetus before weaning their current pup fig 3 the average wean date was april 8th 37 days before the weaning deadline of may 15th with female pups weaning at an average mass of 32 4 kg and a minimum mass of 9 1 kg on average 70 of pups weaned before the deadline largely because the pup had reached or was very close to x max p 70 of early weaning events with the remaining 30 of early weaning due to the combination of female and pup mass in the absence of disturbance the average pup recruitment was 0 70 0 09 with values ranging from 0 37 to 0 82 for individual replicates the mean population size in the last simulation year was 871 48 resulting in a mean population growth rate of 0 05 0 04 with values ranging from 58 to 1885 and 0 12 to 0 11 for individual replicates respectively in the presence of disturbance mean values for each scenario ranged from 0 48 to 0 72 pup recruitment 402 to 926 population size in last year and 0 09 to 0 05 population growth rate mean values for individual replicates in the presence of disturbance were 0 18 to 0 82 pup recruitment and 0 05 to 0 11 population growth with a minimum population size at the last time period across all scenarios and replicates of 2 sea lions disturbance that was recurrent in each year resulted in reductions in pup recruitment and population sizes even when sea lions had relatively mild behavioral responses to the disturbance 1 h or when the disturbance occurred for a relatively short duration 1 month fig 4 table s3 s4 the effect of a recurrent disturbance on population growth trajectories was not apparent for several years under less severe disturbance conditions fig 5 a the effect of disturbance on population size and growth rate was driven not only by changes in pup recruitment resulting from an earlier wean date and a lighter wean mass figs 4c and 5b but also from changes in pregnancy rates birth rates and the inter pup birth interval fig 5b there was a slight trend towards increased age at first reproduction with disturbance severity but the magnitude of the change was relatively small compared with the other parameters fig 5b disturbance had a similar effect on pup recruitment and population growth rates with cohen s d values for individual scenarios ranging from 0 3 to 2 8 and mean values across all disturbance scenarios of 0 39 for both variables changes in the duration frequency and behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance all had a strong effect on cohen s d whereas changes in the timing of disturbance during the year had relatively little effect on cohen s d fig s10 table s3 s4 for example there was an 11 increase in cohen s d for population growth rate when a disturbance occurred in late vs early lactation but a 700 increase when it occurred in every year vs just the first year of the model there was a relatively small effect of disturbance on pup recruitment or population growth when the behavioral response and duration of disturbance was short 4 h and 3 months regardless of the frequency of the disturbance cohen s d 0 5 although the probability of disturbance had a large effect on absolute values of cohen s d table s5 when the effect of disturbance as measured by cohen s d was relatively small changes in the probability of disturbance had a larger impact on the percentage change in cohen s d than when the effect of disturbance was large for example a 50 decrease in the probability of disturbance resulted in a 62 or 58 reduction in cohen s d with respect to population growth whereas a 50 increase resulted in a 123 or 30 increase in the value of cohen s d 4 discussion our model captured many of the reproductive complexities of a long lived income breeder using california sea lions as a motivating species these complexities which were emergent properties of the model included variation in the age at first reproduction termination of pregnancy and skipped breeding years and variation in the timing of weaning this ability to capture variation in reproductive behaviors is crucial for ecological models because changes in reproductive success are a primary driver of population dynamics while no model can capture all of the intricacies of a natural population the fecundity estimates from undisturbed scenarios were generally consistent with empirically derived data for california sea lions and other pinnipeds hammill and gosselin 1995 hernández camacho et al 2008a lima and paez 1995 mckenzie et al 2005 pitcher and calkins 1981 shero et al 2018 we calculated that on average 92 of mature females were pregnant in any given year with an annual abortion rate around 25 which is within the range of birth rate estimates of california sea lions from the gulf of mexico hernández camacho et al 2008a similarly studies on steller sea lions eumetopias jubatus and new zealand fur seals arctocephalus forsteri found pregnancy rates as high as 96 with an average of 32 of these pregnancies ending in early termination mckenzie et al 2005 pitcher and calkins 1981 once pups were born in the forward simulation some females nursed up until the weaning deadline but the average length of lactation was approximately 10 months with 59 of pups weaned before may 1st these findings are similar to a mark recapture study of branded california sea lion pups that found a minimum of 40 of pups were still nursing by the end of april with the majority of weaning occurring during a one month period starting at the end of april harris 2016 the earlier time of weaning estimated from our model compared with estimates from harris 2016 may have been due to differences in energy availability i e greater energy return to females from foraging in our model or energy allocation to pups i e greater energy allocated to pups in our model this could represent inaccuracies in our model but it also may simply reflect that we simulated better foraging conditions than the actual conditions experienced by the mothers of pups resighted in harris 2016 measurements of reproductive characteristics such as reproductive rates and weaning dates are important for understanding population dynamics and in quantifying population responses to environmental variability empirical measurements can however be difficult to obtain as they typically require time intensive resighting effort of marked individuals which is particularly challenging for species that have extended periods of maternal care and reproduce in remote areas the similarities between the model output from the forward simulations and empirically derived estimates suggests that the state transitions derived from the backward iteration are consistent with the behavioral decisions of sea lions in nature thus while our primary goal was to highlight the use of sdp models in the context of anthropogenic disturbance the model we developed here could be used to estimate these variables as well as address fundamental ecological processes and the mechanisms that give rise to these processes clark and mangel 2000 houston and mcnamara 1999 mangel and clark 1988 for example several otariid species including california sea lions can exhibit extended lactation durations 1 year higgins and gass 1993 trillmich and wolf 2008 and a modified version of our model could be used to investigate the environmental conditions that give rise to this phenomena these modifications include a relaxation or elimination of the weaning deadline as well as the inclusion of an additional reproductive state s to allow a female to nurse a juvenile practical application of our approach requires knowledge of the disturbance and dose response curve which are exogenous to the behavioral and life history modeling lacking those for california sea lions we were still able to quantify the consequences of a general anthropogenic disturbance on pup recruitment and population dynamics via analysis of a wide range of scenarios we modelled the behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance as an increase in foraging trip duration as such the results from our disturbance scenarios are comparable with natural environmental fluctuations because female otariids often alter their foraging trip duration in response to changes in prey availability and distribution costa 2008 in our model disturbance had a negative impact on population dynamics primarily through reproductive changes and not adult mortality which is in accordance with life history theory roff 1993 stearns 1992 while reduced pup recruitment due to a lower mass at weaning was an important driver of negative impacts of disturbance on population dynamics alterations in other reproductive characteristics also contributed to this trend pregnancy rates declined slightly but there were much larger changes in birth rates and the inter pup interval indicating that disturbance increased abortion rates and led to skipped reproductive years pups that weaned at a lower mass were more likely to delay reproduction but the magnitude of this change compared with undisturbed scenarios was relatively ssmall these results are consistent with the response of otariid populations to el niño events and other time periods of prey depletion lunn et al 1994 soto et al 2004 trillmich et al 1991 further validating that our model captured some of the reproductive complexity of california sea lions our focus was largely on model development and the disturbance scenarios should not be interpreted as representative of a specific disturbance situation we do however show the utility of using sdp models to fully implement the pcod framework by using a range of disturbance scenarios in the undisturbed case combining backward iteration and forward simulation allows us to both simulate the trajectories of populations and compute the entries for a stage or age structured matrix model of population dynamics when anthropogenic disturbance not in the evolutionary history of the animals is added forward simulation becomes essential because we do not know a priori how disturbance will affect them for marine mammals approaches for determining the effects of disturbance on vital rates and population dynamics have largely focused on bioenergetic models which are primarily limited to capital breeding species costa et al 2016 villegas amtmann et al 2017 2015 or individual based models solely comprised of a forward simulation king et al 2015 nabe nielsen et al 2018 new et al 2014 our approach is also individual based and uses forward simulation however it is the combination of backward iteration with the sdp model and forward simulation that makes it so powerful the backward iteration links environment and reproductive success through physiology and leads to state and time dependent behavioral decisions by implementing those rules in the forward simulation we are able to obtain estimates of annual reproductive success and survival in the absence and presence of disturbance it is those estimates that allow us to reach the objective of population consequences the trajectory in fig 5 pirotta et al 2018 provides another example of the power of the backward iteration and forward simulation particularly as it relates to differential responses to natural environmental fluctuations that are in the evolutionary history of a species and an anthropogenic or other environmental disturbance that is not using cohen s d allowed us to assess the relative influence of disturbance scenario parameters which can help prioritize future data collection efforts and provide insight into planning activities that create disturbance for example characteristics of the disturbance such as how often and how long the disturbance occurred had a relatively strong impact on whether disturbance affected vital rates and population dynamics repetitive disturbances had the largest impact on pup recruitment even when the behavioral response of sea lions to disturbance was relatively mild or the duration of the disturbance was relatively short while our disturbance scenarios were not meant to represent a disturbance specific to sea lions potential repetitive disturbances that may be experienced by wild populations across the durations we simulated include ecotourism seismic surveys road and vessel noise annual naval exercises and development of renewable energy sources e g wind or tidal turbines for the probability of disturbance that we simulated disturbance scenarios that only occurred in the first year of the simulation generally did not affect pup recruitment or population growth however the animals sensitivity to disturbance probability of being disturbed and behavioral response also had a strong impact on the effect of disturbance on these parameters this suggests that income breeding populations may be vulnerable to even short infrequent disturbances such as sonar or construction nabe nielsen et al 2018 although the results from our model indicated that it may take several years after the initial disturbance to detect its effect on population growth rates this lag is likely due to the delay between recruitment and reproductive maturity as it took a minimum of three years for sea lions that were pups at the time of the initial disturbance to reach reproductive maturity on the other hand the timing of disturbance during lactation had a relatively small influence on cohen s d however it is important to consider that this may not be a general characteristic across species if there are significant temporal changes in prey availability that co occur with an anthropogenic disturbance while not included here temporal changes in prey availability are straightforward to incorporate into sdp models pirotta et al 2018 in addition to characteristics of the disturbance itself the behavioral response of an individual to disturbance was influential highlighting the importance of short term behavioral response studies that attempt to measure just this collectively these results suggest that caution should be applied in making blanket conclusions about the robustness of income breeding species to anthropogenic disturbance since types of disturbance e g naval sonar seismic surveys may differ in their characteristics and individuals may not exhibit the same behavioral response to all types of anthropogenic disturbance as the human footprint continues to expand in the natural world the ability to assess the consequences of anthropogenic disturbance by linking behavioral and energetic effects at the individual to the population level becomes essential for accurate prediction of population trajectories the challenges raised by human wildlife interactions are a global problem common to both terrestrial and marine environments and understanding the population effects of human related disturbances on wildlife has been identified as a conservation priority francis and barber 2013 the methods we have developed here and illustrated with california sea lions are a natural framework for studying the linkages between disturbance and population consequences we have shown that characteristics of the disturbance itself and animal behavior are both important components of understanding when a disturbance results in biologically meaningful effects which underscores the importance of research efforts to understand the short term behavioral responses of species to a disturbance and more general ecological studies that quantify animal movements and habitat use our results indicate that while prolonged repetitive exposures are more likely to have an effect even relatively short infrequent disturbances can adversely affect population dynamics of an income breeding species the derivation of state and time dependent reproductive decisions using an sdp model captures many of the important aspects of an income breeders life history strategy and while parameterized for california sea lions could be adapted to model reproductive decisions in a wide range of mammalian species the structure of sdp models is also flexible allowing for the incorporation of additional state variables or biological parameters that may be of interest for specific applications such as density dependent effects age specific reproductive rates and desensitization of individuals that are repetitively disturbed in addition to reproductive decisions foraging location is likely to be an important state variable for anthropogenic applications and this model serves as a stepping stone towards the development of these more complex models that incorporate reproductive and foraging decisions acknowledgements this work was supported by the office of naval research onr grant n00014 13 1 0314 and contract jip 22

25219,the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf with random effects has been widely used to estimate growth parameters incorporating individual variability of length at age trajectories of individual growth can be inferred using either mark recapture or back calculation of length at age from growth marks in hard body parts such as otoliths modern statistical methods evaluate individual variation usually from mark recapture data and the parameters describing this function are estimated using empirical bayes methods assuming gaussian error in this paper we combine recent studies in non gaussian distributions and a bayesian approach to model growth variability using back calculated data in harvested fish populations we presumed that errors in the vbgf can be assumed as a student t distribution given the abundance of individuals with extreme length values the proposed method was applied and compared to the standard methods using back calculated length at age data for pink cusk eel genypterus blacodes off chile considering several information criteria and comparing males and females we have found that males grow significantly faster than females and that length at age for both sexes exhibits extreme length observations comparisons indicated that a student t model with mixed effects describes best back calculated data regarding pink cusk eel this framework merged the strengths of different approaches to estimate growth parameters in harvested fish populations considering modeling of individual variability of length at age bayesian inference and distribution of errors from the student t model keywords individual variability von bertalanffy model student t distribution pink cusk eel chile 1 introduction growth variability among individuals stems from genetic and environmental factors genetic variability in teleost fish is well documented and remarkably high mitton and lewis 1989 year class fish can be exposed to differential environmental characteristics which amplify differences among individuals at a given age mccauley and kilgour 1990 growth rate also varies with age as environmental characteristics supersede differential genetic ones francis 1990 yet despite the importance of growth variability it lacks consideration in the estimation of growth parameters in fish species rather expected growth parameters in the population are usually estimated using maximum likelihood with normal distributed errors these methods rest on the assumption that variability found of length at given age is treated as observational error the main reason to avoid modeling growth variability explicitly is related to the type of data available in most teleost fish species age determination is conducted by otolith reading meaning that a sampled individual is killed its pair of otoliths extracted and age is assigned by counting the number of observed rings this sort of data precludes a straightforward modeling of variability in growth rate because growth trajectory of one specific individual is unknown on the other hand data from mark recapture studies provide trajectories of growth in individuals in time thus rendering it suitable for modeling growth variability wang and thomas 1995 wang and ellis 1998 pilling et al 2002 cope and punt 2007 shelton and mangel 2012 vincenzi et al 2014 however mark recapture studies in fish populations are available in only a few stocks mainly because of prohibitive cost and lack of reliable assumptions in stocks subjected to study e g closed population metcalfe and arnold 1997 back calculation constitutes another approach to infer growth trajectories in teleost fish it involves using measurements taken from otolith radius of each ring to infer and back calculate the body length at ages prior to capture this approach was originally proposed by lea 1910 and has been routinely applied in fishery science ever since francis 1990 back calculation helps to control the bias produced by the usually low representation of young small individuals in a sample as a result of fishing selectivity however inferred trajectories from back calculation can be used to model growth variability in fish similarly to how mark recapture data is used therefore measuring otolith radii in teleost fish species for back calculation is an established method to infer individual trajectories thus promising to assess growth variability francis 1990 araya and cubillos 2002 since the pioneering work of sainsbury 1980 several approaches to model growth variability have been proposed wang and thomas 1995 recent studies dealing with that task consider intensive computation methods including random effects cope and punt 2007 proposed a model with random effects to incorporate error in age assignments on the vgb estimates and accounting for the effects of selectivity on growth vincenzi et al 2014 proposed more efficient statistical computational algorithms in random effects models to account for individual variability using an empirical bayes approach these methods have in common that age at given length is modeled using gaussian distributed errors however gaussian assumption of growth in harvested fish populations studies is inadequate due to the presence of extreme observations as result of fishing selectivity contreras reyes et al 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a b spence and turtle 2017 recently lópez quintero et al 2017a estimated the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf using student t distribution and a bayesian approach they concluded that boundary restrictions on prior density associated to each vb parameter can be incorporated in bayesian analysis chambers et al 2017 whereas the exclusion of these restrictions produces nonsensical parameters like negative length values and meaninless t 0 estimates lópez quintero et al 2017a demonstrated the usefulness of modeling growth via log skew student t and bayesian approach using data regarding only age at capture e g one data point per fish sampled thus not explicitly accounting for growth variability therefore the main aim of this paper is to combine recent studies in student t distribution and a bayesian approach while further explicitly modeling growth variability using back calculated data in harvested fish populations random effect models provide several advantages especially flexibility for understanding fish growth dynamics in comparison with models that focus only on fixed effects vincenzi et al 2014 proposed models were applied to the extensive database available for growth in pink cusk eel genypterus blacodes harvested off chile pink cusk eel is a fish species confined to the southern hemisphere and important in terms of landings and target intention supporting fisheries in australia new zealand argentina and chile according to compiled logbooks pink cusk eel fishery in chile takes place between talcahuano 36 44ls and south of cape horn 57 00ls though the most important exploitation area is the austral zone off chile 41 28 6ls 57 00ls pink cusk eel populations are divided into northern and southern stocks each with significantly different life history traits baker et al 2014 basic biological knowledge of this species regarding growth wiff et al 2007 reproduction baker et al 2014 mortality wiff et al 2011 and food consumption wiff et al 2015 is available in chile growth estimates in wiff et al 2007 are based on back calculation and the assumption of gaussian distributed errors with no evaluation of individual variability on this paper we evaluate the proposed model using data from the southern stock 2 methods 2 1 back calculation the fraser lee back calculation method has been proposed as the most appropriate to model growth of pink cusk eel wiff et al 2007 this method describes the relationship of otolith radii and total length starting with the assumption that each otolith growth is in exact proportion to fish length thus we have 1 l i l c r i r c where l i and r i represent total length and otolith length of ith individual respectively l c is the total length of the fish at time of observation and r c the respective otolith length araya and cubillos 2002 carlander 1982 generalized the model in 1 by adding an intercept accounting for the increments of otolith growth as constant proportion of expected increments in fish growth 2 l i α r i r c l c α where intercept α is fish length at time of otolith formation to reduce the variance produced by sampling bias absence of young individuals carlander 1982 proposes a standard intercept value for each species intercept α is usually obtained from a linear regression of lengths versus widest otolith radius using the complete population sample ogle 2016 2 2 von bertalanffy growth function with mixed effects length at age of each individual from eq 2 can be estimated by assuming a simple linear regression with independent normal errors the application of such linear model will produce an unbalanced data set consisting of jth age group for ith individual i 1 n j 1 n i following the notation of de la cruz 2014 let l i l i 1 l in i denotes the random vector of length for the ith individual and η ϕ i t i η ϕ i t i 1 η ϕ i t in i is the vbgf von bertalanffy 1938 registered at known times t i t i 1 t in i where each jth is an age group and ith individual given by 3 η ϕ i t i l i 1 e k i t i t 0 i where ϕ i is the subject specific vector regression of the parameters l i k i t 0i l i 0 k i 0 i 1 n eq 3 represents the simplest formulation of the vbgf for each individual described by three parameters l i the asymptotic length in length units e g cm k i the growth rate coefficient expressed in per unit time and t 0i the theoretical age usually in years at length zero then a nonlinear mixed effects nlme of model 3 and its mixed effects parameter can be expressed as 4 l i η ϕ i t i ϵ i and 5 ϕ i x i β b i respectively where ϵ i ϵ i 1 ϵ in i denotes the vector of within subject errors for the ith subject usually assumed independent identically distributed iid i e the uncorrelated errors ϵ i iid n n i 0 τ i n i i d is the identity matrix of dimension d d b i represents a q dimensional vector of unobservable random effects b i iid n q 0 ψ β is a p dimensional vector of unknown fixed effects parameters x i a known design matrix of dimension q p associated with β τ the precision parameter and ψ constitutes a covariance matrix of dimension q q 2 3 bayesian inference the nlme models with normality distributed random effects and within subject errors are the most commonly used ones in the fishery science literature helser and lai 2004 cope and punt 2007 vincenzi et al 2014 however normality assumptions may not adequately respond to the presence of a skewed distribution and extreme observations related to selectivity in harvested populations contreras reyes et al 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a which could affect the estimation of fixed effects and variance components therefore the non standardized multivariate student t distribution is usually considered to provide more flexible tails than the normal distribution de la cruz 2014 kotz and nadarajah 2004 from eqs 4 and 5 the subject length and its mixed effects parameter based on student t distribution are denoted as 6 l i ϕ i ind t n i η ϕ i t i τ i n i ν ϕ i ind t q x i β ψ 1 η respectively taking advantage of the scale of mixture representation andrews and mallows 1974 it is possible to express the model in 6 as 7 l i ϕ i λ i ind n n i η ϕ i t i λ i 1 τ i n i λ i gamma ν 2 ν 2 ϕ i ρ i ind n q x i β ρ i 1 ψ 1 ρ i gamma η 2 η 2 where λ and ρ are latent mutually independent variables this representation is computationally more convenient because it turns the likelihood function into a combination of very well established distributions such as normal and gamma easier to implement in well established statistical softwares lunn et al 2012 to complete the specification in model 7 a prior distribution is needed for all unknown parameters chambers et al 2017 for parameters in the first equation precision τ follows a gamma distribution gamma a 0 b 0 and degree of freedom ν te 2 5 0 5 where te a b denotes the exponential distribution truncated at the interval a with parameter b for the second equation which contains the random effect η also follows a te 2 5 0 5 distribution and ψ w r 0 r 0 where w denotes the wishart distribution de la cruz 2014 usually matrix r 0 is assumed an identity matrix reflecting the ignorance about covariance among ϕ i parameters whereas r 0 is often taken as a number close to the dimension of ψ p parameter β is frequently sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with not restrictions such as β n p β 0 b 0 helser and lai 2004 particular values for the center vector β 0 and precision matrix b 0 depend on the specific problem and purpose of the research priors are usually non informative to allow the likelihood dominate over the prior posterior distribution under these characteristics can be written as 8 p ϕ β ψ σ 2 ν η v w y i 1 n l i y i ϕ i v i w i β ψ σ 2 ν η p β p ψ p σ 2 p ν p η where parameters ψ σ 2 η and v can be estimated by using gibbs sampling but other procedures such as metropolis hastings algorithm must be used for parameters β and ν because they belong to unknown distributions de la cruz 2014 eq 8 will be optimized to obtain the estimated parameters in other cases it is more convenient to use strategic transformations of parameter β or sampling directly from distributions which comply with the wanted constraints tang et al 2014 in this study we used the latter approach seizing the information about parameters which exist about the specie under study wiff et al 2007 in particular we used normal distributions for all parameters β 1 β 2 β 3 l k t 0 however for l and t 0 we truncated their range i e l tn 0 c 1 d 1 k n c 2 d 2 and t 0 tn c 3 d 3 where tn 0 c 1 d 1 denotes the truncated normal density at interval 0 with zero mean c 1 and precision d 1 the particular values of c k and d k k 1 2 3 are species specific and will be assigned in section 3 2 an interesting aspect of model 6 and 7 is the use of just one parameter of degree of freedom for p elements in parameter β de la cruz 2014 to add flexibility to each random parameter component we allow each component its own univariate student t distribution assuming ψ is the identity matrix thus we can sample each parameter separately from an univariate student t distribution using an inverse gamma distribution as prior for each precision parameter τ k k 1 2 3 specifically 9 ϕ ik ρ ik ind n β k ρ ik 1 τ k ρ ik gamma η k 2 η k 2 where ρ ik and η k are analogous to ρ i and η in the second eq of 7 i 1 n i and k 1 2 3 corresponds to l k and t 0 respectively an equivalent normal model for ϵ i and b i that handles three independent random effect vectors is as follows 10 b i ind n 0 τ k 2 4 sensitivity analysis in this section we will explore global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua we study the results of the variance based methods see chap 4 in saltelli et al 2008 because they indicate which parameters drive the output in the system i e vbgf in terms of its own parameters these methods focus on the variance of model outputs specifically on how input variability influences variance outputs thus gsua serves to quantify the influence of each parameter on the variability of the model s output making it key for model performance the gsua procedure includes simulating input parameters named input factors and how the propagation of their uncertainty will impact the model s outputs according to saltelli et al 2004 the influence of input factors can be evaluated using weighting function 11 f l k t 0 1 σ m 2 α m 1 m where σ m 2 n 2 i 1 n η ˆ ϕ m t i l i 2 α controls the weight given to good runs of simulated factors 1 1 that is when prediction is good due to appropriated values of input factors the value of f will stand out n is the number of observations η ˆ is a simplification of eq 3 ignoring the subject specific parameters and t i l i are observed age lengths of each fish notation ϕ m signifies the mth simulated parameter for first argument of η in our experiments we set m 2000 for sake of simplicity gsua is only assessed for the main input factor of the model i e l k and t 0 our analysis rests on variance based sensitivity analysis known as sobol indices and can be used for first order s or total s t versions the first order index evaluates the importance of a single input factor for the models while the total index assesses the overall importance of an input factor accounting also for its interaction with all other possible inputs among the many possibilities to compute the indices we chose martinez 2011 s approach see estimation details in saltelli et al 2004 2008 in general the variance of the model output can be decomposed or attributed to each input factor i through the expressions s i v e y x i v y and s t i e v y x i v y where x i represents the array of all inputs excluding x i and v and e denote the variance and expectation operators respectively weighting function in eq 11 was computed using the full variance decomposition method assuming all input factors as independent when input factors were dependent helser and lai 2004 one possibility included the information theory based gsua lüdtke et al 2008 3 implementation 3 1 data we evaluated the performance of the proposed models using the available data for pink cusk eel off chile this dataset corresponds to 443 individuals collected between 1997 and 2014 by the instituto de fomento pesquero ifop chile http www ifop cl in the austral zone off chile 41 28 6ls 57 00ls random samples of fish were collected by onboard scientific observers heeding established protocol all samples were measured to the nearest centimeter and age was determined by reading annual growth increment in the saggita otoliths in fish up to 13 years radius of each ring in each otolith was measured and age treated as discrete variable with a one year interval range of observed ages in the catch included fish between 1 and 13 years with a length range between 41 and 127 cm fish with ages 14 in years lack ring radius information and corresponded only to 2 3 total sample thus for further analysis we considered 391 individuals up to 13 years old because the database is available with fish trajectories to perform back calculation for each group males females or both sexes individual samples of sizes n 250 were taken independently on each group obtaining 1511 observations of males 1792 of females and 1657 of both sexes 3 2 computational aspects and bayesian inference to compare the parameters estimated using the proposed model we considered two classical frequentist models which appear at the top in table 1 particularly the first considers only fixed effects ffr while the second incorporated both random and fixed effects fre they were estimated using the procedure described in ogle 2016 and pinheiro and bates 2000 respectively the fre model reports the non diagonal values of re correlation matrix instead of non diagonal values of re covariance matrix the general framework of the bayesian normal random effects model bnre i is described in section 2 2 prior distributions for all bayesian models were set to l tn 0 115 0 001 k n 0 2 0 001 siegfried and sansó 2006 and t 0 tn 2 1 0 001 lópez quintero et al 2017a note that t 0 is restricted to a minimum value of 1 as a likely age of pink cusk eel when length is zero a similar model is used by helser and lai 2004 although they employed a non informative multivariate normal distribution specification of ϕ in eq 5 is given by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution given the values of β according to helser and lai 2004 prior for ψ has a wishart distribution with parameters r 0 10 and r 0 10i 3 all precision parameters follow a gamma distribution with parameters 0 001 0 001 bnre ii refers to a model of eq 10 with random effects instead of b i iid n q 0 ψ we implemented two bayesian t random effects models the first btre i is based on eqs 6 or 7 btre ii a model with independent random effects is described in the final paragraph in section 2 3 with eq 9 the prior for τ ν η was established in section 2 3 as gamma and truncated exponential distributions for all models 2000 iterations reached convergence after using 1000 as burn in period model selection followed lópez quintero et al 2017a considering the deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 and the widely applicable information criterion waic gelman et al 2014 in contrast to dic waic is defined by posterior density averaging instead of replacing the mean according to gelman et al 2014 waic has the advantage of being more numerically stable than dic because it averages separately for each observation note that for waic computation each estimate was used in the chain after reaching convergence statistical methods used in this paper were implemented with software r core team 2015 through jags plummer 2003 and stan stan development team 2016 libraries 4 results back calculation in section 2 1 was implemented using a linear regression model 2 fig 1 illustrates the relationship between maximum otolith radius and total fish lengths whose intercept is α ˆ 15 702 s e 0 332 p value 0 01 and slope β ˆ 1 368 s e 0 004 p value 0 01 these estimates are related to population otolith major radius the assumption of linear model is appropriate given the high coefficient of determination r 2 70 the vbgf with mixed effects was applied to pink cusk eel dataset described above fig 2 left summarized these data for males females panels a and b and combined sexes panel e respectively lower and upper hinges of these boxplots correspond to the first and third quartiles the 25th and 75th percentiles the upper whisker spans from the hinge to the largest value limited to 1 5 times the inter quartile range and the lowest whisker does the same in the opposite direction data above the whiskers appear with a dot and are called outliers the line inside the box represents the median in males and females empirical distributions of the length at age in young individuals 5 years present atypical lengths i e high occurrences of heavy tails females reached larger asymptotic sizes with smaller intrinsic growth rates than males thus the growth rate of males is significantly higher than of females the lengths related to oldest ages 10 13 years tend to have similar medians stabilizing the asymptotic length comparing both sexes the oldest observed ages correspond to 12 in males and 13 in females note the oldest age is defined by fish with otolith radius measurements and not oldest age sampled mcmc algorithm seems to be reached the convergence in all parameter estimates across different models profile plots in fig 2 right show the observed trajectories of both sexes gray lines and the solid and dotted lines represent the marginal effect for all models females show some large outlier individuals with lengths 100 cm i e the lengths regarding age estimation based on back calculation could be student t distributed given the presence of heavy tails panel d these observations could influence the estimation of fixed and random effects parameters indeed estimated growth parameters showed strong differences among proposed models in table 2 we will be focused in model btre ii see table 3 which indicates the estimated intrinsic growth rate is high but with small asymptotic length compared to the other models note that the estimated degree of freedom parameter is allocated around 15 whose credible intervals are 9 15 17 26 9 55 18 75 10 25 20 06 for males females and box sexes respectively corroborating heavy tails presence by the large lengths aforementioned considering both sexes the results resemble the female cases showing the influence of females extreme lengths additionally btre ii parameter estimates are similar to those estimated using the bnre ii model with differences only in the degree of freedom parameter related with extreme observations considering the information criteria aic bic dic and waic presented in table 3 the bnre ii model presents the smallest aic value among all competitors and among bayesian models with random effects the btre ii model has the smallest dic and waic values bic criterion shows that fre model should be selected for convenience we defined σ and σ as the inverted values of ψ and τ respectively note that bnre i and btre i models present values of σ kk k 1 2 3 close to zero this could signal that these models are influenced only by fixed effects however among all competitors the btre ii model should be selected as it has the smallest information criteria across models implemented for both sexes table 4 shows the sobol individual and combined indices for the sexes as expected the three outputs are similar for the first order indices values for factor t 0 are close enough to 0 suggest a weak influence on the model s output whereas k factor has the greatest impact followed by l on the total indices s t factor k became the most important one suggesting this factor alone accounts for the interaction with the rest of the growth parameters k parameter has a clearer impact than shown in the first order indices and in comparison with l and t 0 factors the latter ones having a similar contribution hence to emulate the model s output we should focus on the parameter k alone 5 discussion we presented a novel method to estimate growth parameters in fish considering individual variability using otolith radii and back calculation the proposed method allows modeling the growth trajectories obtained by back calculation as a mixed effect and thus to assess growth variability of length at age using the student t distribution therefore this model provides an alternative to established mixed effects models based on gaussian error helser and lai 2004 cope and punt 2007 vincenzi et al 2014 we also considered several and flexible statements for prior distributions about growth parameters and the associated covariance matrix in modeling errors information criteria dic and waic indicate the best model to describe the data is based on gamma prior distribution for each correlation ρ i of subject specific vector regression ϕ i ρ i of growth parameter vincenzi et al 2014 considered a bayesian approach to estimate individual somatic growth among homogeneous groups and selected the best models using aic and bic criteria however we focused model selection on dic and waic because these measurements are defined specifically to deal with bayesian models particularly those criteria consider the posterior density mean and the effective number of parameters instead of usual aic and bic criteria gelman et al 2014 bayesian hierarchical growth models that consider correlation between random effect parameters bnre i and btre i showed a smaller value in comparison to their frequentist equivalent fre hence the size of these correlations allowed us to evaluate models with random effects independent of each other bnre ii and btre ii and they generally produced credibility intervals narrower than confidence intervals for all growth parameters suggesting more precision along the proposed approach the best model to describe pink cusk eel data in both sexes was btre ii which produced different results than in wiff et al 2007 using frequentist fixed effect model with gaussian error assumptions the btre ii model gives estimates of growth parameters which have smaller asymptotic sizes higher intrinsic growth rates and higher t 0 in comparison with wiff et al 2007 although these results refer only to pink cusk eel they can be generalized and understood in a broader context of fish growth differences stem from the incorporation of individual variability but also from constraints imposed on t 0 using informative priors the literature contains estimates of t 0 smaller than 1 as in wiff et al 2007 however this lacks biological meaning because it implies that the developmental time between egg and larvae exceeds one year controlling the estimation of t 0 as in the btre ii model will also influence the asymptotic size and the intrinsic growth rate because parameters of the vbgf are highly correlated among them this highlighted the usefulness of bayesian inference when estimating the vbfg and allowing addressing the t 0 estimation thus avoiding the problems of biological meaning discussed in pardo et al 2013 in most fish populations growth parameters are estimated using either otolith reading or age assignment based on length structures for otolith reading a fish is killed otoliths are extracted and age assignment is based on the number of rings likewise age assignment using length structures is based on mixture of distributions each one representing an age class treated as a latent variable roa ureta 2010 in the first case each datapoint of length at age is composed of one individual sample whereas in the second case each datapoint of age at length is the median of each identified cohort in both cases when fitting parameters of the vbgf in such second stage process the underlying assumption is that growth equation is average across all individuals in the population thus individual variability is ignored and treated as observational error it is however unlikely that all individuals will share the same set of growth parameters sainsbury 1980 when individual variability is not explicitly considered in the model bias is incorporated in the estimation of the vbgf alós et al 2009 from a theoretical viewpoint the underpinning assumption of ignoring fish variability on the vbfg is that all fish at a given age class will have the same vital rates e g maturation spawn grow which is unrealistic lowerre barbieri et al 1998 fast growing fish in a given age class will mature earlier but will also reach a lower asymptotic size in comparison with the slower growing counterpart despite the importance of acknowledging individual variability when estimating the vbfg this has only been assessed in few fish species because the data needed to assess individual variability requires knowledge of fish trajectories using either mark recapture or measuring otoliths radii via back calculation mark recapture is expensive to apply in large fisheries and requires specific protocols about sample size handling tagged fish and a program to recover marks metcalfe and arnold 1997 back calculation presents a cheaper alternative but still consumes time because the measurement of each otolith radius is not straightforward and becomes particularly complicated in long lived species with a large number of radii age classes and lack of clear definition among them however back calculation of the length at age is considered to be one of the most reliable methods of obtaining information on individual growth when mark recapture data are unavailable pilling et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 even though the method was applied to just one species stock we think these results can be extended to fish with similar characteristics as pink cusk eel such as lengthy time series of data average lifespan and a good range of observed age length classes for fish species with unusual characteristics like very small or very large lifespan and or truncated observation of length classes the back calculation method and therefore the evaluation of individual variability may no apply further application of this method should thus include fish species with rare or unique biologies to assess and test the general assumptions of the proposed framework we propose a methodological framework to estimate vbgf assessing individual variability when growth trajectories are available from back calculation this framework merges the strength of three different approaches to estimate growth parameters in harvested fish populations first individual variability of the length at age is explicitly incorporated using a mixed effect model second individual variability is modeled using student t distribution which describes better the error structure when fitting the vbgf in harvested populations given the presence of extreme observations in age at length data kotz and nadarajah 2004 contreras reyes et al 2014 de la cruz 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a b the inclusion of heavy tailed distribution such as student t provides unbiased estimates of growth parameters in harvested fish populations contreras reyes et al 2014 third estimation is based on bayesian analysis which has several advantages over the frequentist counterpart alós et al 2009 lópez quintero et al 2017a bayesian analysis allows the incorporation of prior information which results in the estimation of biologically meaningful parameters and diminished uncertainty because bayesian modeled observed and unobserved latent variables permit accounting for all uncertainty within the entire growth phenomena more theoretical extensions of this framework should consider a model simplification accommodating the number of inputs according to the results in section 2 4 although computation of these models was tractable sensitivity analysis in situations with more complex models and or larger sample size should include more extensive gsua methods convertino and valverde 2013 convertino et al 2011 2014 this general framework proved to be robust to model the data of back calculation of pink cusk eel off chile extending

25219,the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf with random effects has been widely used to estimate growth parameters incorporating individual variability of length at age trajectories of individual growth can be inferred using either mark recapture or back calculation of length at age from growth marks in hard body parts such as otoliths modern statistical methods evaluate individual variation usually from mark recapture data and the parameters describing this function are estimated using empirical bayes methods assuming gaussian error in this paper we combine recent studies in non gaussian distributions and a bayesian approach to model growth variability using back calculated data in harvested fish populations we presumed that errors in the vbgf can be assumed as a student t distribution given the abundance of individuals with extreme length values the proposed method was applied and compared to the standard methods using back calculated length at age data for pink cusk eel genypterus blacodes off chile considering several information criteria and comparing males and females we have found that males grow significantly faster than females and that length at age for both sexes exhibits extreme length observations comparisons indicated that a student t model with mixed effects describes best back calculated data regarding pink cusk eel this framework merged the strengths of different approaches to estimate growth parameters in harvested fish populations considering modeling of individual variability of length at age bayesian inference and distribution of errors from the student t model keywords individual variability von bertalanffy model student t distribution pink cusk eel chile 1 introduction growth variability among individuals stems from genetic and environmental factors genetic variability in teleost fish is well documented and remarkably high mitton and lewis 1989 year class fish can be exposed to differential environmental characteristics which amplify differences among individuals at a given age mccauley and kilgour 1990 growth rate also varies with age as environmental characteristics supersede differential genetic ones francis 1990 yet despite the importance of growth variability it lacks consideration in the estimation of growth parameters in fish species rather expected growth parameters in the population are usually estimated using maximum likelihood with normal distributed errors these methods rest on the assumption that variability found of length at given age is treated as observational error the main reason to avoid modeling growth variability explicitly is related to the type of data available in most teleost fish species age determination is conducted by otolith reading meaning that a sampled individual is killed its pair of otoliths extracted and age is assigned by counting the number of observed rings this sort of data precludes a straightforward modeling of variability in growth rate because growth trajectory of one specific individual is unknown on the other hand data from mark recapture studies provide trajectories of growth in individuals in time thus rendering it suitable for modeling growth variability wang and thomas 1995 wang and ellis 1998 pilling et al 2002 cope and punt 2007 shelton and mangel 2012 vincenzi et al 2014 however mark recapture studies in fish populations are available in only a few stocks mainly because of prohibitive cost and lack of reliable assumptions in stocks subjected to study e g closed population metcalfe and arnold 1997 back calculation constitutes another approach to infer growth trajectories in teleost fish it involves using measurements taken from otolith radius of each ring to infer and back calculate the body length at ages prior to capture this approach was originally proposed by lea 1910 and has been routinely applied in fishery science ever since francis 1990 back calculation helps to control the bias produced by the usually low representation of young small individuals in a sample as a result of fishing selectivity however inferred trajectories from back calculation can be used to model growth variability in fish similarly to how mark recapture data is used therefore measuring otolith radii in teleost fish species for back calculation is an established method to infer individual trajectories thus promising to assess growth variability francis 1990 araya and cubillos 2002 since the pioneering work of sainsbury 1980 several approaches to model growth variability have been proposed wang and thomas 1995 recent studies dealing with that task consider intensive computation methods including random effects cope and punt 2007 proposed a model with random effects to incorporate error in age assignments on the vgb estimates and accounting for the effects of selectivity on growth vincenzi et al 2014 proposed more efficient statistical computational algorithms in random effects models to account for individual variability using an empirical bayes approach these methods have in common that age at given length is modeled using gaussian distributed errors however gaussian assumption of growth in harvested fish populations studies is inadequate due to the presence of extreme observations as result of fishing selectivity contreras reyes et al 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a b spence and turtle 2017 recently lópez quintero et al 2017a estimated the von bertalanffy growth function vbgf using student t distribution and a bayesian approach they concluded that boundary restrictions on prior density associated to each vb parameter can be incorporated in bayesian analysis chambers et al 2017 whereas the exclusion of these restrictions produces nonsensical parameters like negative length values and meaninless t 0 estimates lópez quintero et al 2017a demonstrated the usefulness of modeling growth via log skew student t and bayesian approach using data regarding only age at capture e g one data point per fish sampled thus not explicitly accounting for growth variability therefore the main aim of this paper is to combine recent studies in student t distribution and a bayesian approach while further explicitly modeling growth variability using back calculated data in harvested fish populations random effect models provide several advantages especially flexibility for understanding fish growth dynamics in comparison with models that focus only on fixed effects vincenzi et al 2014 proposed models were applied to the extensive database available for growth in pink cusk eel genypterus blacodes harvested off chile pink cusk eel is a fish species confined to the southern hemisphere and important in terms of landings and target intention supporting fisheries in australia new zealand argentina and chile according to compiled logbooks pink cusk eel fishery in chile takes place between talcahuano 36 44ls and south of cape horn 57 00ls though the most important exploitation area is the austral zone off chile 41 28 6ls 57 00ls pink cusk eel populations are divided into northern and southern stocks each with significantly different life history traits baker et al 2014 basic biological knowledge of this species regarding growth wiff et al 2007 reproduction baker et al 2014 mortality wiff et al 2011 and food consumption wiff et al 2015 is available in chile growth estimates in wiff et al 2007 are based on back calculation and the assumption of gaussian distributed errors with no evaluation of individual variability on this paper we evaluate the proposed model using data from the southern stock 2 methods 2 1 back calculation the fraser lee back calculation method has been proposed as the most appropriate to model growth of pink cusk eel wiff et al 2007 this method describes the relationship of otolith radii and total length starting with the assumption that each otolith growth is in exact proportion to fish length thus we have 1 l i l c r i r c where l i and r i represent total length and otolith length of ith individual respectively l c is the total length of the fish at time of observation and r c the respective otolith length araya and cubillos 2002 carlander 1982 generalized the model in 1 by adding an intercept accounting for the increments of otolith growth as constant proportion of expected increments in fish growth 2 l i α r i r c l c α where intercept α is fish length at time of otolith formation to reduce the variance produced by sampling bias absence of young individuals carlander 1982 proposes a standard intercept value for each species intercept α is usually obtained from a linear regression of lengths versus widest otolith radius using the complete population sample ogle 2016 2 2 von bertalanffy growth function with mixed effects length at age of each individual from eq 2 can be estimated by assuming a simple linear regression with independent normal errors the application of such linear model will produce an unbalanced data set consisting of jth age group for ith individual i 1 n j 1 n i following the notation of de la cruz 2014 let l i l i 1 l in i denotes the random vector of length for the ith individual and η ϕ i t i η ϕ i t i 1 η ϕ i t in i is the vbgf von bertalanffy 1938 registered at known times t i t i 1 t in i where each jth is an age group and ith individual given by 3 η ϕ i t i l i 1 e k i t i t 0 i where ϕ i is the subject specific vector regression of the parameters l i k i t 0i l i 0 k i 0 i 1 n eq 3 represents the simplest formulation of the vbgf for each individual described by three parameters l i the asymptotic length in length units e g cm k i the growth rate coefficient expressed in per unit time and t 0i the theoretical age usually in years at length zero then a nonlinear mixed effects nlme of model 3 and its mixed effects parameter can be expressed as 4 l i η ϕ i t i ϵ i and 5 ϕ i x i β b i respectively where ϵ i ϵ i 1 ϵ in i denotes the vector of within subject errors for the ith subject usually assumed independent identically distributed iid i e the uncorrelated errors ϵ i iid n n i 0 τ i n i i d is the identity matrix of dimension d d b i represents a q dimensional vector of unobservable random effects b i iid n q 0 ψ β is a p dimensional vector of unknown fixed effects parameters x i a known design matrix of dimension q p associated with β τ the precision parameter and ψ constitutes a covariance matrix of dimension q q 2 3 bayesian inference the nlme models with normality distributed random effects and within subject errors are the most commonly used ones in the fishery science literature helser and lai 2004 cope and punt 2007 vincenzi et al 2014 however normality assumptions may not adequately respond to the presence of a skewed distribution and extreme observations related to selectivity in harvested populations contreras reyes et al 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a which could affect the estimation of fixed effects and variance components therefore the non standardized multivariate student t distribution is usually considered to provide more flexible tails than the normal distribution de la cruz 2014 kotz and nadarajah 2004 from eqs 4 and 5 the subject length and its mixed effects parameter based on student t distribution are denoted as 6 l i ϕ i ind t n i η ϕ i t i τ i n i ν ϕ i ind t q x i β ψ 1 η respectively taking advantage of the scale of mixture representation andrews and mallows 1974 it is possible to express the model in 6 as 7 l i ϕ i λ i ind n n i η ϕ i t i λ i 1 τ i n i λ i gamma ν 2 ν 2 ϕ i ρ i ind n q x i β ρ i 1 ψ 1 ρ i gamma η 2 η 2 where λ and ρ are latent mutually independent variables this representation is computationally more convenient because it turns the likelihood function into a combination of very well established distributions such as normal and gamma easier to implement in well established statistical softwares lunn et al 2012 to complete the specification in model 7 a prior distribution is needed for all unknown parameters chambers et al 2017 for parameters in the first equation precision τ follows a gamma distribution gamma a 0 b 0 and degree of freedom ν te 2 5 0 5 where te a b denotes the exponential distribution truncated at the interval a with parameter b for the second equation which contains the random effect η also follows a te 2 5 0 5 distribution and ψ w r 0 r 0 where w denotes the wishart distribution de la cruz 2014 usually matrix r 0 is assumed an identity matrix reflecting the ignorance about covariance among ϕ i parameters whereas r 0 is often taken as a number close to the dimension of ψ p parameter β is frequently sampled from a multivariate normal distribution with not restrictions such as β n p β 0 b 0 helser and lai 2004 particular values for the center vector β 0 and precision matrix b 0 depend on the specific problem and purpose of the research priors are usually non informative to allow the likelihood dominate over the prior posterior distribution under these characteristics can be written as 8 p ϕ β ψ σ 2 ν η v w y i 1 n l i y i ϕ i v i w i β ψ σ 2 ν η p β p ψ p σ 2 p ν p η where parameters ψ σ 2 η and v can be estimated by using gibbs sampling but other procedures such as metropolis hastings algorithm must be used for parameters β and ν because they belong to unknown distributions de la cruz 2014 eq 8 will be optimized to obtain the estimated parameters in other cases it is more convenient to use strategic transformations of parameter β or sampling directly from distributions which comply with the wanted constraints tang et al 2014 in this study we used the latter approach seizing the information about parameters which exist about the specie under study wiff et al 2007 in particular we used normal distributions for all parameters β 1 β 2 β 3 l k t 0 however for l and t 0 we truncated their range i e l tn 0 c 1 d 1 k n c 2 d 2 and t 0 tn c 3 d 3 where tn 0 c 1 d 1 denotes the truncated normal density at interval 0 with zero mean c 1 and precision d 1 the particular values of c k and d k k 1 2 3 are species specific and will be assigned in section 3 2 an interesting aspect of model 6 and 7 is the use of just one parameter of degree of freedom for p elements in parameter β de la cruz 2014 to add flexibility to each random parameter component we allow each component its own univariate student t distribution assuming ψ is the identity matrix thus we can sample each parameter separately from an univariate student t distribution using an inverse gamma distribution as prior for each precision parameter τ k k 1 2 3 specifically 9 ϕ ik ρ ik ind n β k ρ ik 1 τ k ρ ik gamma η k 2 η k 2 where ρ ik and η k are analogous to ρ i and η in the second eq of 7 i 1 n i and k 1 2 3 corresponds to l k and t 0 respectively an equivalent normal model for ϵ i and b i that handles three independent random effect vectors is as follows 10 b i ind n 0 τ k 2 4 sensitivity analysis in this section we will explore global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis gsua we study the results of the variance based methods see chap 4 in saltelli et al 2008 because they indicate which parameters drive the output in the system i e vbgf in terms of its own parameters these methods focus on the variance of model outputs specifically on how input variability influences variance outputs thus gsua serves to quantify the influence of each parameter on the variability of the model s output making it key for model performance the gsua procedure includes simulating input parameters named input factors and how the propagation of their uncertainty will impact the model s outputs according to saltelli et al 2004 the influence of input factors can be evaluated using weighting function 11 f l k t 0 1 σ m 2 α m 1 m where σ m 2 n 2 i 1 n η ˆ ϕ m t i l i 2 α controls the weight given to good runs of simulated factors 1 1 that is when prediction is good due to appropriated values of input factors the value of f will stand out n is the number of observations η ˆ is a simplification of eq 3 ignoring the subject specific parameters and t i l i are observed age lengths of each fish notation ϕ m signifies the mth simulated parameter for first argument of η in our experiments we set m 2000 for sake of simplicity gsua is only assessed for the main input factor of the model i e l k and t 0 our analysis rests on variance based sensitivity analysis known as sobol indices and can be used for first order s or total s t versions the first order index evaluates the importance of a single input factor for the models while the total index assesses the overall importance of an input factor accounting also for its interaction with all other possible inputs among the many possibilities to compute the indices we chose martinez 2011 s approach see estimation details in saltelli et al 2004 2008 in general the variance of the model output can be decomposed or attributed to each input factor i through the expressions s i v e y x i v y and s t i e v y x i v y where x i represents the array of all inputs excluding x i and v and e denote the variance and expectation operators respectively weighting function in eq 11 was computed using the full variance decomposition method assuming all input factors as independent when input factors were dependent helser and lai 2004 one possibility included the information theory based gsua lüdtke et al 2008 3 implementation 3 1 data we evaluated the performance of the proposed models using the available data for pink cusk eel off chile this dataset corresponds to 443 individuals collected between 1997 and 2014 by the instituto de fomento pesquero ifop chile http www ifop cl in the austral zone off chile 41 28 6ls 57 00ls random samples of fish were collected by onboard scientific observers heeding established protocol all samples were measured to the nearest centimeter and age was determined by reading annual growth increment in the saggita otoliths in fish up to 13 years radius of each ring in each otolith was measured and age treated as discrete variable with a one year interval range of observed ages in the catch included fish between 1 and 13 years with a length range between 41 and 127 cm fish with ages 14 in years lack ring radius information and corresponded only to 2 3 total sample thus for further analysis we considered 391 individuals up to 13 years old because the database is available with fish trajectories to perform back calculation for each group males females or both sexes individual samples of sizes n 250 were taken independently on each group obtaining 1511 observations of males 1792 of females and 1657 of both sexes 3 2 computational aspects and bayesian inference to compare the parameters estimated using the proposed model we considered two classical frequentist models which appear at the top in table 1 particularly the first considers only fixed effects ffr while the second incorporated both random and fixed effects fre they were estimated using the procedure described in ogle 2016 and pinheiro and bates 2000 respectively the fre model reports the non diagonal values of re correlation matrix instead of non diagonal values of re covariance matrix the general framework of the bayesian normal random effects model bnre i is described in section 2 2 prior distributions for all bayesian models were set to l tn 0 115 0 001 k n 0 2 0 001 siegfried and sansó 2006 and t 0 tn 2 1 0 001 lópez quintero et al 2017a note that t 0 is restricted to a minimum value of 1 as a likely age of pink cusk eel when length is zero a similar model is used by helser and lai 2004 although they employed a non informative multivariate normal distribution specification of ϕ in eq 5 is given by sampling from a multivariate normal distribution given the values of β according to helser and lai 2004 prior for ψ has a wishart distribution with parameters r 0 10 and r 0 10i 3 all precision parameters follow a gamma distribution with parameters 0 001 0 001 bnre ii refers to a model of eq 10 with random effects instead of b i iid n q 0 ψ we implemented two bayesian t random effects models the first btre i is based on eqs 6 or 7 btre ii a model with independent random effects is described in the final paragraph in section 2 3 with eq 9 the prior for τ ν η was established in section 2 3 as gamma and truncated exponential distributions for all models 2000 iterations reached convergence after using 1000 as burn in period model selection followed lópez quintero et al 2017a considering the deviance information criterion dic spiegelhalter et al 2002 and the widely applicable information criterion waic gelman et al 2014 in contrast to dic waic is defined by posterior density averaging instead of replacing the mean according to gelman et al 2014 waic has the advantage of being more numerically stable than dic because it averages separately for each observation note that for waic computation each estimate was used in the chain after reaching convergence statistical methods used in this paper were implemented with software r core team 2015 through jags plummer 2003 and stan stan development team 2016 libraries 4 results back calculation in section 2 1 was implemented using a linear regression model 2 fig 1 illustrates the relationship between maximum otolith radius and total fish lengths whose intercept is α ˆ 15 702 s e 0 332 p value 0 01 and slope β ˆ 1 368 s e 0 004 p value 0 01 these estimates are related to population otolith major radius the assumption of linear model is appropriate given the high coefficient of determination r 2 70 the vbgf with mixed effects was applied to pink cusk eel dataset described above fig 2 left summarized these data for males females panels a and b and combined sexes panel e respectively lower and upper hinges of these boxplots correspond to the first and third quartiles the 25th and 75th percentiles the upper whisker spans from the hinge to the largest value limited to 1 5 times the inter quartile range and the lowest whisker does the same in the opposite direction data above the whiskers appear with a dot and are called outliers the line inside the box represents the median in males and females empirical distributions of the length at age in young individuals 5 years present atypical lengths i e high occurrences of heavy tails females reached larger asymptotic sizes with smaller intrinsic growth rates than males thus the growth rate of males is significantly higher than of females the lengths related to oldest ages 10 13 years tend to have similar medians stabilizing the asymptotic length comparing both sexes the oldest observed ages correspond to 12 in males and 13 in females note the oldest age is defined by fish with otolith radius measurements and not oldest age sampled mcmc algorithm seems to be reached the convergence in all parameter estimates across different models profile plots in fig 2 right show the observed trajectories of both sexes gray lines and the solid and dotted lines represent the marginal effect for all models females show some large outlier individuals with lengths 100 cm i e the lengths regarding age estimation based on back calculation could be student t distributed given the presence of heavy tails panel d these observations could influence the estimation of fixed and random effects parameters indeed estimated growth parameters showed strong differences among proposed models in table 2 we will be focused in model btre ii see table 3 which indicates the estimated intrinsic growth rate is high but with small asymptotic length compared to the other models note that the estimated degree of freedom parameter is allocated around 15 whose credible intervals are 9 15 17 26 9 55 18 75 10 25 20 06 for males females and box sexes respectively corroborating heavy tails presence by the large lengths aforementioned considering both sexes the results resemble the female cases showing the influence of females extreme lengths additionally btre ii parameter estimates are similar to those estimated using the bnre ii model with differences only in the degree of freedom parameter related with extreme observations considering the information criteria aic bic dic and waic presented in table 3 the bnre ii model presents the smallest aic value among all competitors and among bayesian models with random effects the btre ii model has the smallest dic and waic values bic criterion shows that fre model should be selected for convenience we defined σ and σ as the inverted values of ψ and τ respectively note that bnre i and btre i models present values of σ kk k 1 2 3 close to zero this could signal that these models are influenced only by fixed effects however among all competitors the btre ii model should be selected as it has the smallest information criteria across models implemented for both sexes table 4 shows the sobol individual and combined indices for the sexes as expected the three outputs are similar for the first order indices values for factor t 0 are close enough to 0 suggest a weak influence on the model s output whereas k factor has the greatest impact followed by l on the total indices s t factor k became the most important one suggesting this factor alone accounts for the interaction with the rest of the growth parameters k parameter has a clearer impact than shown in the first order indices and in comparison with l and t 0 factors the latter ones having a similar contribution hence to emulate the model s output we should focus on the parameter k alone 5 discussion we presented a novel method to estimate growth parameters in fish considering individual variability using otolith radii and back calculation the proposed method allows modeling the growth trajectories obtained by back calculation as a mixed effect and thus to assess growth variability of length at age using the student t distribution therefore this model provides an alternative to established mixed effects models based on gaussian error helser and lai 2004 cope and punt 2007 vincenzi et al 2014 we also considered several and flexible statements for prior distributions about growth parameters and the associated covariance matrix in modeling errors information criteria dic and waic indicate the best model to describe the data is based on gamma prior distribution for each correlation ρ i of subject specific vector regression ϕ i ρ i of growth parameter vincenzi et al 2014 considered a bayesian approach to estimate individual somatic growth among homogeneous groups and selected the best models using aic and bic criteria however we focused model selection on dic and waic because these measurements are defined specifically to deal with bayesian models particularly those criteria consider the posterior density mean and the effective number of parameters instead of usual aic and bic criteria gelman et al 2014 bayesian hierarchical growth models that consider correlation between random effect parameters bnre i and btre i showed a smaller value in comparison to their frequentist equivalent fre hence the size of these correlations allowed us to evaluate models with random effects independent of each other bnre ii and btre ii and they generally produced credibility intervals narrower than confidence intervals for all growth parameters suggesting more precision along the proposed approach the best model to describe pink cusk eel data in both sexes was btre ii which produced different results than in wiff et al 2007 using frequentist fixed effect model with gaussian error assumptions the btre ii model gives estimates of growth parameters which have smaller asymptotic sizes higher intrinsic growth rates and higher t 0 in comparison with wiff et al 2007 although these results refer only to pink cusk eel they can be generalized and understood in a broader context of fish growth differences stem from the incorporation of individual variability but also from constraints imposed on t 0 using informative priors the literature contains estimates of t 0 smaller than 1 as in wiff et al 2007 however this lacks biological meaning because it implies that the developmental time between egg and larvae exceeds one year controlling the estimation of t 0 as in the btre ii model will also influence the asymptotic size and the intrinsic growth rate because parameters of the vbgf are highly correlated among them this highlighted the usefulness of bayesian inference when estimating the vbfg and allowing addressing the t 0 estimation thus avoiding the problems of biological meaning discussed in pardo et al 2013 in most fish populations growth parameters are estimated using either otolith reading or age assignment based on length structures for otolith reading a fish is killed otoliths are extracted and age assignment is based on the number of rings likewise age assignment using length structures is based on mixture of distributions each one representing an age class treated as a latent variable roa ureta 2010 in the first case each datapoint of length at age is composed of one individual sample whereas in the second case each datapoint of age at length is the median of each identified cohort in both cases when fitting parameters of the vbgf in such second stage process the underlying assumption is that growth equation is average across all individuals in the population thus individual variability is ignored and treated as observational error it is however unlikely that all individuals will share the same set of growth parameters sainsbury 1980 when individual variability is not explicitly considered in the model bias is incorporated in the estimation of the vbgf alós et al 2009 from a theoretical viewpoint the underpinning assumption of ignoring fish variability on the vbfg is that all fish at a given age class will have the same vital rates e g maturation spawn grow which is unrealistic lowerre barbieri et al 1998 fast growing fish in a given age class will mature earlier but will also reach a lower asymptotic size in comparison with the slower growing counterpart despite the importance of acknowledging individual variability when estimating the vbfg this has only been assessed in few fish species because the data needed to assess individual variability requires knowledge of fish trajectories using either mark recapture or measuring otoliths radii via back calculation mark recapture is expensive to apply in large fisheries and requires specific protocols about sample size handling tagged fish and a program to recover marks metcalfe and arnold 1997 back calculation presents a cheaper alternative but still consumes time because the measurement of each otolith radius is not straightforward and becomes particularly complicated in long lived species with a large number of radii age classes and lack of clear definition among them however back calculation of the length at age is considered to be one of the most reliable methods of obtaining information on individual growth when mark recapture data are unavailable pilling et al 2002 zhang et al 2009 even though the method was applied to just one species stock we think these results can be extended to fish with similar characteristics as pink cusk eel such as lengthy time series of data average lifespan and a good range of observed age length classes for fish species with unusual characteristics like very small or very large lifespan and or truncated observation of length classes the back calculation method and therefore the evaluation of individual variability may no apply further application of this method should thus include fish species with rare or unique biologies to assess and test the general assumptions of the proposed framework we propose a methodological framework to estimate vbgf assessing individual variability when growth trajectories are available from back calculation this framework merges the strength of three different approaches to estimate growth parameters in harvested fish populations first individual variability of the length at age is explicitly incorporated using a mixed effect model second individual variability is modeled using student t distribution which describes better the error structure when fitting the vbgf in harvested populations given the presence of extreme observations in age at length data kotz and nadarajah 2004 contreras reyes et al 2014 de la cruz 2014 lópez quintero et al 2017a b the inclusion of heavy tailed distribution such as student t provides unbiased estimates of growth parameters in harvested fish populations contreras reyes et al 2014 third estimation is based on bayesian analysis which has several advantages over the frequentist counterpart alós et al 2009 lópez quintero et al 2017a bayesian analysis allows the incorporation of prior information which results in the estimation of biologically meaningful parameters and diminished uncertainty because bayesian modeled observed and unobserved latent variables permit accounting for all uncertainty within the entire growth phenomena more theoretical extensions of this framework should consider a model simplification accommodating the number of inputs according to the results in section 2 4 although computation of these models was tractable sensitivity analysis in situations with more complex models and or larger sample size should include more extensive gsua methods convertino and valverde 2013 convertino et al 2011 2014 this general framework proved to be robust to model the data of back calculation of pink cusk eel off chile extending
