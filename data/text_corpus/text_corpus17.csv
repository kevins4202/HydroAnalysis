85,precise information about the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity k in an aquifer is essential for the reliable modeling of groundwater flow and transport processes in this study we present results of a new inversion procedure for induced polarization ip data that incorporates petrophysical relations between electrical and hydraulic parameters and therefore allows for the direct computation of k this novel approach was successfully implemented for the bolstern aquifer analog by performing synthetic ip experiments with a combined surface and cross borehole setup from these data the distribution of k was retrieved with high accuracy and resolution showing a similar quality compared to images achieved by hydraulic tomography to further improve the quantitative estimates of k we use synthetic pumping test data to inform two novel calibration strategies for the ip inversion results both calibrations are especially helpful for correcting a possible bias of the ip inversion e g due to resolution limitations and or to bias in the underlying petrophysical relations the simulation of tracer experiments on the retrieved tomograms highlights the accuracy of the inversion results as well as the significant role of the proposed calibrations keywords induced polarization hydraulic tomography hydraulic conductivity inversion data availability the original bolstern data set as well as all ht and ip inversion results are available through https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6361423 1 introduction tomographic methods have evolved as a promising family of hydrogeological field investigation techniques for imaging the hydraulic conductivity k distribution yeh and liu 2000 vasco et al 2000 jimenez et al 2013 zhao and illman 2018 pouladi et al 2021 they rely on sending and recording multiple signals at different positions of an aquifer by processing all signals together the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters is reconstructed the choice of a tomographic configuration for identification of subsurface structures is rooted in geophysical exploration gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and lee 2007 accordingly tomographic concepts based on classical hydrogeological field techniques with hydraulic stimulation or tracer signals often adopt data inversion principles that are established in geophysics hu et al 2011 kong et al 2018 ringel et al 2021 vice versa especially near surface geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar electrical resistivity tomography or electromagnetic induction are tuned to not only identify geological but also hydraulic structures slater 2007 linde et al 2006 mclachlan et al 2021 still hydraulic or tracer tomography is not fully established in practice a major reason is the rather high experimental demand for installation of field equipment and borehole devices bohling and butler 2010 brauchler et al 2013b cardiff et al 2013 klepikova et al 2020 fast applicability in the field is an advantage of many geophysical techniques however a common shortcoming is that aquifer heterogeneities are described by geophysical proxy parameters as classical geophysical exploration techniques do not test hydraulic properties directly their capacity to provide meaningful hydrogeological insight in aquifers is limited ideally geophysical and hydrogeological information is thus jointly processed for obtaining hydrogeophysical tomograms to benefit from the advantages of both approaches irving and singha 2010 vilhelmsen et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 in the growing research field of hydrogeophysics binley et al 2015 a strong focus is on electrical methods due to their ability of sensing pore space properties that govern the hydraulic parameters revil et al 2012a wang et al 2021 however imaging hydraulic conductivity requires the separation of pore volume and pore surface properties which cannot be achieved by conventional geoelectrical methods as a remedy the additional information contained in induced polarization ip measurements about electrical polarization effects at the pore matrix interface can be used to quantitatively separate these properties slater 2007 to link the electrical parameters of ip measurements with the hydrogeological parameters we mainly rely on empirical relations derived from laboratory measurements the first quantitative relation between ip parameters and k was established by börner et al 1996 since then a variety of other empirical laws has been derived by spectral induced polarization sip laboratory measurements slater and lesmes 2002 binley et al 2005 revil and florsch 2010 titov et al 2010 revil et al 2012b attwa and günther 2013 weller et al 2015 robinson et al 2018 most of the ip parameters that are valuable for estimating k are defined in the frequency domain as e g the cole cole parameters cole and cole 1941 pelton et al 1978 and can therefore be most easily derived from sip measurements however although some applications of sip in the field do exist kemna et al 2012 orozco et al 2012 gallistl et al 2018 this method is mainly used for the electrical characterization of rocks in the laboratory revil et al 2014 börner et al 2017 römhild et al 2019 whereas for field campaigns time domain ip tdip measurements are most common kemna et al 2004 gazoty et al 2012 doetsch et al 2015 this gap can be overcome by using a fourier transform within the ip inversion procedure so that tdip data can be inverted for frequency domain parameters such as cole cole parameters fiandaca et al 2012 2013 or other re parameterizations of the cole cole model fiandaca et al 2018a this approach yields results of a similar quality compared to frequency domain measurements madsen et al 2017 but often has an advantage in terms of acquisition time maurya et al 2018b martin et al 2020 in several studies k has already been estimated from these electrical parameters at field scale hördt et al 2009 attwa and günther 2013 maurya et al 2018a however the petrophysical relations mentioned above have always been applied after the inversion for ip parameters making the interpretation in terms of hydraulic parameters ambiguous instead incorporating the petrophysical laws into the inversion procedure allows the direct computation of the k distribution in the subsurface from the measured ip data although ambiguities might also be reduced with strong structural priors such as training images pirot et al 2017 a petrophysical inversion approach can have further advantages by introducing a new parameterization parameter correlations can be reduced and the direct inversion for k makes it easier to study its uncertainties and how data errors propagate to model errors it also allows to apply the regularization to the actual hydraulic parameters instead of the electrical parameters and simplifies the integration of prior models that are often given as a distribution of k petrophysical inversion strategies have already been applied in other contexts such as permafrost sites mollaret et al 2020 gas hydrate systems turco et al 2021 or reservoir characterization gao et al 2012 but mostly with the aim of establishing a joint inversion while our new ip k inversion approach has already been mentioned briefly in conference abstracts fiandaca et al 2021 martin et al 2021 we now present the complete methodology and a detailed assessment of the results for the first time we are aiming to show the abilities and limitations of this deterministic inversion for imaging k heterogeneities in near surface aquifers by performing synthetic modeling and inversion tests on aquifer analog data with a combined surface and cross borehole ip setup we compare those results with data derived from synthetic hydraulic tomography ht experiments using a similar setup our main goal is to achieve a distribution of k that would yield a correct solute transport simulation for this purpose a straightforward calibration strategy of complementing ip inversion with hydraulic information is introduced in the following we briefly explain the methodological concepts of ip and ht as well as our new ip k inversion approach as the study site for simulating a synthetic cross hole ht and ip application a sedimentary aquifer analog is implemented to compare the abilities of the two methods in imaging decimeter meter scale k heterogeneities with varying point spacing the performance of the new calibration strategy is evaluated and all findings are discussed with special emphasis on the applicability of the suggested methodology within field campaigns 2 materials and methods fig 1 gives an overview of the procedures applied in this study the bolstern aquifer analog heinz et al 2003 serves as the input data set for the forward modeling of ip data and the ht synthetic experiments the achieved data sets are then used for the respective inversion the new ip k inversion procedure and an ht travel time inversion additionally we achieve an effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f as an average value for the whole domain by a small set of seven pumping tests and use it to calibrate our inversion results to assess the quality of those calibrations and the performance of the two methods in general we finally conduct tracer transport simulations with the achieved k tomograms and evaluate them based on imaged tracer plumes as well as depth integrated tracer breakthrough curves 2 1 bolstern aquifer analog the bolstern aquifer analog data set heinz et al 2003 was derived from an outcrop analog study of fluvial deposits located near bolstern sw germany see fig 2a within the paleo discharge zone of the rhine glacier the analog study comprises a rectangular 20 m 7 m 2d cross section fig 2b which is built up by a mosaic of hydrofacies units that were delineated from the outcrop wall at a resolution of 0 05 m the hydrofacies units represent nearly hydraulically homogeneous units with k derived from grain size analysis as well as porosity information the hydrofacies accord with the sedimentary lithofacies and this is reflected in the structural features of the analog with heterogeneous layers and cross beddings as a common characteristic for many sedimentary unconsolidated aquifers the bolstern analog has already been used as a realistic test case for modeling contaminant transport in previous work höyng et al 2015 we use a section of the whole analog between x 0 m and 12 m which corresponds to x 6 m and 18 m in the original nomenclatures of heinz et al 2003 covering the whole depth range from z 0 m to 7 m red rectangle in fig 2b for all simulated virtual experiments we assume to have three boreholes at x 3 m 6 m and 9 m black lines in fig 2b 2 2 induced polarization 2 2 1 electrical rock properties the electrical conductivity σ of a rock is generally considered to be a frequency dependent and complex valued quantity olhoeft 1985 1 σ ω σ e l σ i n t ω consisting of electrolytic conductivity σ e l and interface conductivity σ i n t with ω 2 π f being the angular frequency and the denoting complex quantities it can be written in terms of real and imaginary part σ and σ respectively or as magnitude σ and phase angle φ 2 σ ω σ ω i σ ω σ e i φ where i is the imaginary unit the electrolytic part is controlled by the conduction through a rock s pore space and thus depends on pore volume properties as described by archie s law archie 1942 3 σ e l σ w f ϕ m σ w where σ w is the pore water conductivity f ϕ m is the formation factor ϕ is porosity and m is the empirical cementation exponent this formulation assumes fully saturated conditions the interface conductivity σ i n t however may contain contributions from a variety of electrical polarization phenomena that are mainly related to the interface between rock matrix and pore space if electronically conductive minerals such as graphite or pyrite are absent as it is mostly the case in sedimentary environments diffusion related polarization connected to the electrical double layer edl at the pore matrix interface is dominant marshall and madden 1959 schwarz 1962 while standard geoelectrical methods are only sensitive to the real part σ of the electrical conductivity ip measurements can retrieve information about the imaginary part σ as well this is either done by conducting spectral induced polarization sip measurements in the frequency domain and then converting the magnitude and phase angle information to a complex electrical conductivity or by performing time domain induced polarization tdip measurements and full decay spectral inversion fiandaca et al 2012 2013 madsen et al 2020 we will focus on the latter option since the acquisition time is smaller in the field maurya et al 2018b and a good retrieval of spectral properties is achievable when a wide time range is used in acquisition madsen et al 2017 for instance through the analysis of full waveform recordings olsson et al 2016 a typical tdip field setup is similar to a standard dc geoelectrics setup with a sequence of quadrupoles injecting a current with two electrodes a b and measuring the resulting voltage with two other electrodes m n a simplified setup is shown in fig 3a the sequence is typically distributed along a 2d profile on the surface e g following a gradient protocol i and can be complemented by cross borehole measurements ii or quadrupoles in a single borehole iii for the synthetic experiments carried out within this study a combination of the three options shown in fig 3a is used but a variety of other sequences is possible bing and greenhalgh 2000 while surface ip measurements are becoming a more widely used method field examples of cross borehole ip are still rare kemna et al 2004 binley et al 2016 bording et al 2019 to extract meaningful parameters from ip data the cole cole model is commonly used to describe the spectral behavior of σ cole and cole 1941 pelton et al 1978 tarasov and titov 2013 4 σ ω σ 0 1 m 0 1 m 0 1 1 1 i ω τ σ c here σ 0 is the dc conductivity m 0 the intrinsic chargeability as defined by seigel 1959 τ σ the relaxation time and c the frequency exponent based on petrophysical relations found in laboratory studies the electrical properties of a rock can be used to predict hydraulic conductivity k in the following we make use of two different approaches first revil et al 2012b found a relation for permeability k and hence hydraulic conductivity k based on relaxation time τ σ formation factor f and the diffusion coefficient of the stern layer d 5 k τ σ d 4 f a powerlaw fit of r 2 0 88 was reported for the used set of clean saturated sand samples the relation is based on the idea that τ σ can be treated as a measure for typical scale lengths e g pore throat size that in return govern the hydraulic conductivity the volumetric properties are accounted for by f as a measure for effective porosity at first sight this approach does not include any empirical parameters and should be straight forward to use however while τ σ and f can be directly derived from the ip measurements the diffusion coefficient d can only be estimated typically depending on the clay content revil et al 2015 give the following values for clean sand and clay 6 d s a n d 1 3 1 0 9 m s 2 7 d c l a y 3 8 1 0 12 m s 2 however other laboratory findings are raising doubt about the existence of two distinct values for d weller et al 2016 instead an apparent diffusion coefficient d a can be introduced that may cover a much wider range of values although its physical significance remains unclear in our study in which sand clay mixtures are actually reflected in a wide range of k values we still use the two values given by revil et al 2015 to compute a distribution of d directly from k by imposing an interpolation in logarithmic space however the purpose of this simplification is only the simulation of realistic τ σ values according to eq 5 within the forward modeling the second petrophysical approach was introduced by weller et al 2015 it uses the formation factor f and the imaginary part σ evaluated at a frequency of 1 hz for permeability estimation 8 k α f β σ 1 hz γ with the empirical parameters α 1 08 1 0 13 β 1 12 and γ 2 27 for unconsolidated and fully saturated sediments the coefficient of determination is reported as r 2 0 862 and an additional degree of uncertainty lays in the applicability of the empirical parameters α β and γ in the given geological setting furthermore we use a relationship between imaginary and real part of surface conductivity found by weller et al 2013 9 σ 1 hz l σ i n t 1 hz with l 0 042 0 022 but imposing the relation at the frequency f 2 π τ σ 1 fiandaca et al 2018b finally the conversion from permeability k to hydraulic conductivity k can be achieved by 10 k d g η k where d is the density of the pore fluid g the gravitational acceleration and η the dynamic viscosity of the pore fluid assuming a groundwater temperature of 10 c we use the approximation 11 k 7 5 1 0 6 k for more details on the petrophysical background we refer to fiandaca et al 2018b and the references therein clearly all petrophysical laws between hydraulic and electrical parameters are only approximations that bear a significant amount of uncertainty additionally due to the regularization applied within the inversion the petrophysical relationships of the tomograms are also resolution dependent hermans and irving 2017 although we will show how these regularization induced errors as well as a simple bias in the petrophysical relations can partly be corrected by our proposed calibrations their intrinsic scatter can barely be reduced by these procedures especially in strongly heterogeneous aquifers like the bolstern aquifer this uncertainty can be significant easily spanning one to two orders of magnitude e g hördt et al 2009 in addition further parameters like the cementation exponent m that are approximated as constants might be spatially variable schön 2015 yue 2019 therefore petrophysical relations actually present in the field are often far from the laws derived in the lab e g benoit et al 2019 so that not only the inherent uncertainty but also the applicability of those relations in a given field setting are limiting factors for the quality of the inversion result synthetic experiments should always be regarded as best case scenarios showing the upper limit of k prediction quality that may be achieved in a field application however even best case scenarios are anything but trivial and insights from synthetic studies are important means to judge the role of procedural assumptions for an inversion and the resolution capability of the proposed methods 2 2 2 forward modeling for defining the input data set used within the forward simulation the whycdf model space 12 m w h y c d f σ w k d f c was used the whycdf acronym indicates the model parameters i e water and hydraulic conductivity σ w and k respectively diffusion coefficient d and formation factor f the frequency exponent c is not specified in the acronym the idea of re parameterizing the model space is based on fiandaca et al 2018a now being extended by directly imposing the petrophysical relations eqs 1 2 4 5 8 9 and 11 onto the objective function therefore the conversion from hydrological to electrical parameters is part of the modeling process and not a separate procedure the two petrophysical approaches by revil et al 2012b and weller et al 2015 are simultaneously used by forcing them to yield the same permeability k the five different input parameters were set up in the following way water conductivity σ w was assumed to be constant at 100 ms m which is a realistic value for groundwater schön 2015 hydraulic conductivity k was directly imported from the bolstern data set heinz et al 2003 the diffusion coefficient d was derived from k by interpolation in log space from the sand clay values suggested by revil et al 2015 thereby imposing realistic τ σ values on the data the formation factor f was computed from the porosity information contained in the bolstern data set by assuming a constant cementation exponent of m 1 3 as a realistic value for unconsolidated sediments schön 2015 the frequency exponent of the cole cole model c was assumed to be constant at 0 5 the full data set hydraulic conductivity k diffusion coefficient d and bulk conductivity σ 0 including both f σ w and σ i n t is shown in appendix b the synthetic ip experiments are based on a setup consisting of one surface profile over the entire length of the data set x 0 12 m as well as electrodes in three hypothetical boreholes at x 3 m 6 m and 9 m we consider this to be a realistic setup within a field study that should allow resolving the heterogeneities of the aquifer within the whole domain furthermore the same setup of boreholes is expected to work well for ht so that the results of the two methods can be compared directly in practice the same boreholes could be used to conduct all the experiments to simulate realistic field conditions gaussian noise of 2 and 10 magnitude was added after the forward simulation to resistivity and ip data respectively field data can mostly be fitted with this level of error as for instance demonstrated in maurya et al 2018a some exemplary decay curves with added noise and error bars of the assumed standard deviation model are depicted in appendix b we run the forward simulation in 2d following fiandaca et al 2013 with three different electrode spacings 1 m 0 5 m and 0 25 m to assess the impact of varying spacings on the inversion in terms of computational performance and ability to image k heterogeneities the sequence follows a commonly used gradient protocol for the surface profile and borehole quadrupoles according to the cases i ii and iii shown in fig 3a with ip time gates ranging from 0 003 s to 12 s the total number of quadrupoles from which the total duration of a field experiment might be estimated are 162 for 1 m spacing 885 for 0 5 m spacing and 2866 for 0 25 m spacing 2 2 3 inversion the inversion was performed in the thycd model space 13 m t h y c d σ 0 k d c consisting of total dc conductivity σ 0 hydraulic conductivity k diffusion coefficient d and frequency exponent c all four parameters are space dependent and uncoupled during the inversion but the spatial variability of each parameter can be adjusted by setting horizontal and vertical constraints while a model space with five parameters like whycdf is convenient as input for a forward simulation it is not possible to invert for both the formation factor and the water conductivity since the effects of both parameters on dc conductivity cannot be separated consequently the water conductivity is considered a prior information in the inversion and the total dc conductivity is used for the parameterization of the inversion result this choice is supported by the results of markov chain monte carlo modeling performed with different parameterizations fiandaca et al 2021 where the thycd model space turned out to be the most suitable and is therefore used for this work again it should be stressed that the conversion from electrical to hydrological parameters is an inherent part of the inversion and not a separate procedure although we refer to the diffusion coefficient as d here it might also be interpreted as an apparent diffusion coefficient d a weller et al 2016 in the inversion results we also performed additional inversion tests with a different model space where d is replaced by τ σ so that eq 5 revil et al 2012b is actually not used the distribution of k remains almost identical which shows that eq 8 weller et al 2015 alone can also be sufficient for the inversion of tdip data the data space of the inversion consists of the dc data and the full decays of the quadrupole sequence the objective function which contains the squared data misfit and smoothness regularization terms for vertical and horizontal constraints is minimized through a iterative gauss newton approach fiandaca et al 2013 we ran all the codes on a standard desktop pc with an 8 core i7 9700k 3 6 ghz processor and 32 gb ram the runtime for one iteration is about one minute for the 1 m spacing electrode sequence 7 8 min for the 0 5 m sequence and around 30 min for the 0 25 m sequence which adds up to a total inversion runtime of several hours depending on the number of iterations in the last case this shows that also the inversion of field data can mostly be conducted on standard pc equipment 2 2 4 calibration with hydraulic data identification and resolution of k heterogeneity is in particular relevant for performing transport modeling therefore it is especially crucial to obtain accurate k estimates in the preferential flow paths and thus in areas of high k however the strongest ip signal e g in terms of chargeability is typically measured in materials with low k since they have a higher inner surface area and therefore a more pronounced polarization connected to the edl in contrast in the high k zones the ip signal is relatively weak so that the k estimates in the preferential flow paths are less supported by the ip data and might be less accurate considering these unfavorable properties of ip resulting tomograms may resolve structural features very well but they are not very reliable with respect to the hydraulic characterization of preferential flow paths additionally the uncertainties of the petrophysical relations linking electrical and hydraulic properties as well as regularization effects might produce a bias in k prediction as a remedy we suggest calibrating the ip inversion result by incorporating information gathered from pumping test data in the synthetic example we retrieve the effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f as a single value for the whole domain by performing synthetic pumping tests on the bolstern data set using feflow the procedure is inspired by the approach of wu et al 2005 a setup of seven pumping locations in the left borehole and seven observation points in the right borehole is used see appendix a part c the pumping tests are carried out in exactly the same way as the ht experiments see section 2 3 2 additionally we set up a model with homogeneous k and perform the same experiments the optimal k value of the homogeneous model is chosen by minimizing the cumulative rms misfit when comparing these hypothetical pressure response curves with those of the bolstern data set benchmarking we consider the value for k producing the smallest misfit to be the effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f and found the following value for the bolstern aquifer analog 14 k e f f 7 1 0 5 m s in practice k e f f may be inferred from the transmissivity that is estimated by conducting a single standard pumping test at the site we suggest two different approaches to use k e f f for calibrating the ip inversion results i calibration with a constant factor factor calibration and ii calibration with a flexible calibration matrix using an exponential relationship exponential calibration the first option consists of a simple multiplication of the inversion result k ip with the calibration coefficient c so that the geometric mean of the calibration result k fac will be equal to k e f f 15 k fac k ip c 16 c k e f f m e a n k ip this calibration is based on the assumption that k e f f should be close to the geometric mean of the k values of the original data set k o r i g considering only the inner part between the boreholes which for the bolstern aquifer analog is found to be 17 m e a n k orig 3 75 1 0 5 m s k e f f is slightly higher than this value because it is typically more sensitive to the preferential flow paths and therefore to areas with high k especially in a highly anisotropic medium with pronounced horizontal layering as present in the bolstern aquifer however we would still propose using the geometric mean of the k field since this does not require any a priori assumptions about structural features or anisotropy in a field setting the exponential calibration attempts taking into account the different sensitivities of ip experiments and pumping tests by introducing a flexible calibration matrix c α the concept of this approach is visualized in appendix a already including the results for different parameterizations the calibration matrix is made up by 18 c α e α k ip and the calibration result k exp is achieved by computing the hadamard product between c α and the inversion result k ip 19 k exp c α k ip for low k values strong ip effect the elements in c α will be close to one so that the inversion result is not changed by the calibration whereas for higher k values weak ip effect the impact of the calibration generally becomes stronger however the overall strength and direction of the calibration is determined by the exponent α which is chosen according to the pumping test data we iterate over a wide range of values for α in order to minimize the misfit between the geometric mean of the calibration result k exp and k e f f 20 m e a n k exp ξ 100 k e f f α r m i n since k e f f is often higher than the actual geometric mean of k as shown above for the bolstern aquifer we do not use the whole data set to compute the geometric mean within this calibration but neglect a certain percentile ξ with the lowest k values the impact of ξ is visualized in appendix a for very low values close to 0 the result is likely to be over corrected whereas for too high values an under correction will occur however we find that the optimal percentile ξ can be estimated by visual assessment of the uncalibrated inversion result and the function α ξ as shown in part b of appendix a allows for an evaluation of the impact of different ξ values on the calibration result typically the optimal value for ξ will rise with increasing electrode spacing since smoothing effects lead to more extensive areas of low k we finally choose ξ 30 for 0 25 m spacing ξ 35 for 0 5 m spacing and ξ 50 for 1 m spacing undoubtedly this choice is to some extent subjective and more experience and testing will be needed to choose the best value for ξ in other applications 2 3 hydraulic tomography 2 3 1 general concept hydraulic tomography ht requires hydraulic stimulation e g pumping or slug tests with several observation points at different locations to generate a tomographical configuration similar to many geophysical tomography methods fig 3b the pressure response measured at the observation point is used to invert the stratigraphic structure i e the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity hydraulic conductivity and specific storage the main inversion algorithms consist of geostatistics based and travel time based methods the geostatistical methods for ht inversions can be predicated on a variety of algorithms including simultaneous successive linear estimator berg and illman 2011 yeh and liu 2000 quasi linear estimator cardiff et al 2020 kitanidis 1995 or ensemble kalman filter sánchez león et al 2020 a common feature of these approaches is that they require a priori geostatistical models to assume the spatial correlation of the hydraulic parameters in contrast travel time methods used for ht inversion brauchler et al 2003 2013a are based on an eikonal equation which is transferred from the groundwater flow equation vasco et al 2000 and can be solved by ray tracing or particle tracking techniques compared to the first class of methods this approach requires much less computational effort since it does not simulate in a complete groundwater flow model additionally it does not require any prior assumptions about the geostatistical model which can be highly uncertain due to the sparse measurements and various application scales however the travel time based approach has limitations in reproducing the hydraulic parameters in low permeability areas due to the low ray coverage although many studies prove that the structure of the formation can be readily reconstructed a sequential inversion scheme is still required for a more accurate quantification of the hydraulic parameters hu et al 2015 2011 jimenez et al 2013 2 3 2 forward modeling the synthetic ht experiments were simulated using the software feflow diersch 2014 the model domain was discretized by irregular triangular meshing the initial hydraulic head in the whole domain is set to zero and we apply constant head boundaries at the two sides the hydraulic conductivity values were assigned to the mesh according to the values of the bolstern aquifer analog whereas the specific storage coefficient was assumed to be homogeneous at s s 1 0 4 m 1 according to typical values found in literature kuang et al 2020 source points were placed at the hypothetical borehole at x 3 m whereas receiver points were placed at x 6 m and x 9 m three different scenarios were simulated with varying vertical spacing of respectively 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m within the boreholes therefore the setups are similar to the ip experiments and the quality of the results can be directly compared at the receiver points the hydraulic head was recorded during the pumping tests which are sequentially carried out from top to bottom the pumping signal is a heaviside function with a constant rate of 1 l s as shown in fig 3e the resulting pressure response curves were imported to matlab for further processing all source receiver combinations with a ray path angle larger than 60 were filtered out since the layered stratigraphy typical for a shallow porous medium can be better resolved by reducing those large angle ray paths brauchler et al 2007 the 10 diagnostic brauchler et al 2003 is selected for the inversion meaning that the early time t α h is picked where the derivative value reached 10 of the maximum derivative at the observation point fig 3f hence the data space consists of all source and receiver coordinates except the filtered ones as well as the respective early times the travel time information was contaminated with a noise level of 3 similar to doetsch et al 2010 and hu et al 2017 2 3 3 inversion hydraulic travel time of a pumping test is defined as a line integral in which the pumping induced pressure is generated at the source point x 1 and travels along the path ɛ before reaching the receiver point x 2 21 t α h 1 6 f α h x 1 x 2 d ɛ d ɛ where t α h is the early time and f α h is a conversion factor brauchler et al 2003 the subscript h indicates the usage of a heaviside source similar to the seismic travel time inversion eq 21 is resolved using ray tracing techniques and the inverted slowness can be converted to the hydraulic diffusivity d in this study the open source framework pygimli is utilized to invert the hydraulic travel times which is based on the generalized gauss newton method rücker et al 2017 günther et al 2006 and where the forward operator for calculating the travel times uses dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 as a final step we use the factor calibration approach introduced for ip to translate the achieved diffusivities d to a hydraulic conductivity distribution k ht that is in agreement with k e f f this procedure replaces the common approach of multiplying with a specific storage coefficient s s k d s s which is typically also assumed as homogeneous 2 4 tracer experiments we want to assess the quality of the inversion results by performing synthetic tracer experiments using the achieved k images and compare the results to those obtained by modeling with the original bolstern data set the corresponding simulations were conducted using feflow in the area between the hypothetical boreholes x 3 m 9 m steady state hydraulic conditions were assumed and constant heads assigned to the model boundaries induce a hydraulic gradient of 0 001 between the inflow and outflow borders a conservative tracer was injected as a hypothetical line source with a constant rate of 1 mg l at the upstream border of the model domain x 3 m left borehole the longitudinal and vertical transverse dispersivities were set to 2 5 1 0 2 m and 2 5 1 0 4 m respectively according to the values given in höyng et al 2015 3 results 3 1 ht and ip inversion results fig 4c gives an overview of all the inversion results for the different methods and spacings the original bolstern data set is given at the top fig 4a where the grey numbers 1 5 indicate the most important highly permeable layers those layers are only subjectively defined to make it easier to refer to certain features in the text but we will also show that they are responsible for the major tracer fingers found in the transport simulation presented below also note that the k images derived from ht comprise only the domain between the boreholes between x 3 m and x 9 m whereas ip has the ability to image areas left and right of that domain as well although with decreasing sensitivity we show all the inversion results as images of k to allow a direct comparison the ht travel time inversion produced meaningful results that reveal the most important structures and overall good estimates of k with 0 25 m and 0 5 m spacing all the highly permeable layers 1 5 can be reconstructed at the correct locations and with well estimated k values however smaller heterogeneities as e g within layer 2 cannot be resolved and some inversion artifacts are visible in the results as e g a decrease in k in the direct vicinity of the left borehole the inversion result for 1 m spacing misses the uppermost layer 1 since no source and receiver locations are present in this part of the aquifer however the other layers 2 5 are still visible although smoothing effects are becoming more pronounced the travel time inversion typically yields integrated values along the different ray paths which in our case produces an offset between k values left and right of the central borehole although the general trend of the major layers is correct and the inversion results reflect the true behavior of the original data set local k heterogeneities are not always attributed to the exact location but are smeared along the respective section of the ray path creating a sharp border at the central borehole for ip we show the uncalibrated results for k as well as the images achieved by the new factor calibration and exponential calibration procedures note that the thycd inversion of ip data always yields a set of parameters of which only k is shown in fig 4 an example of the complete set of parameters is given in appendix b firstly we focus on the uncalibrated ip results with 0 25 m electrode spacing the aquifer heterogeneities are correctly reconstructed in terms of structural behavior and k quantification the highly permeable layers 1 4 are clearly retrieved by the inversion but layer 5 can hardly be reproduced obviously the sensitivity in this lowest part is small due to a very limited number of quadrupoles however when it comes to resolving smaller heterogeneities within the layers ip yields slightly better results than ht and the attribution of certain k heterogeneities to their exact location is more reliable when increasing the electrode spacing smoothing effects introduced by the regularization become more pronounced and this effect is much stronger compared to the ht results during ip measurements one quadrupole integrates over an area of at least three times the spacing also in vertical direction whereas for ht the integrative behavior is mainly related to the horizontal direction along the ray path therefore ht can resolve the borders between horizontal layers quite well while this becomes much more difficult for ip another effect of the regularization is that the k values especially in the highly permeable layers are typically under estimated for larger electrode spacing therefore we cannot expect to achieve correct transport simulations using those results this can be overcome by using the new calibration procedures employed in the following the factor calibration leads to an overall increase in k for all three spacings since the value for k e f f is higher than the geometric mean of the inversion results this yields an improvement in k estimation especially for the larger spacings 0 5 m and 1 m where the k values of the most permeable layers are now predicted more correctly however an over estimation of k can be observed in the less permeable zones this drawback can be overcome by the exponential calibration which leaves the lowest k values unchanged and only adjusts the permeable zones to the pumping test data as described in section 2 2 4 this effect is clearly visible in the results now the k estimates are very close to the original data set in all parts of the aquifer and for all three spacings the exponential calibration typically sharpens the contrast of the resulting image thereby diminishing the smoothing effects especially for larger electrode spacings to quantify the reproduction quality of aquifer structures we calculate the structural similarity index ssim for each inversion result compared to the original data set fig 4b this metric is commonly used in image processing and measures the similarity between two images by taking into account luminance contrast and structural information wang et al 2004 it is bounded between 0 and 1 while the latter value indicates perfect similarity we use the python package scikit image van der walt et al 2014 to calculate the ssim and find it to be a useful measure to assess the quality of the inversion results for all methods a decreasing ssim with increasing spacing can be observed due to lower data density and stronger smoothing effects this behavior is expected and corresponds to the visual assessment of the inversion results generally the lowest ssim is computed for the ht results between 0 17 and 0 05 although the major layers are retrieved correctly the method is not capable of retrieving the true structural behavior on smaller scales the ip results yield relatively high ssim values for the smallest spacing 0 30 indicating a good reproduction of the structural features however increasing the electrode spacing leads to a stronger decline of the ssim compared to ht showing again that smoothing effects are more pronounced for ip in this example the factor calibration can strongly improve the structural reproduction with the ssim slightly increasing for 0 25 m spacing and strongly increasing for 0 5 m and 1 m spacing while measurements with small spacing and therefore high data density cannot be improved much further by the calibration the results achieved with larger spacing strongly benefit from this procedure the exponential calibration is less successful in improving the structural information of the results but still yields higher ssim values compared to the uncalibrated ip tomograms to further evaluate the prediction quality of the k estimates we show histograms of the ratio between the estimated and the true value for each cell of the inversion result fig 5 to perform the comparison the values of the 0 05 m 0 05 m cells of the original data set had to be averaged within the corresponding bigger cells of the inversion results in the histograms values at 1 0 0 indicate a perfect prediction of k compared to the averaged value of the original data set we also show the median value of the ratio blue line as well as how much of the prediction is within one order of magnitude black lines and corresponding percentage and within two orders of magnitude red lines and corresponding percentage for the ht results a relatively broad distribution of prediction quality can be observed with approximately 90 of the values being within the 1 0 2 interval and between 67 and 75 within the 1 0 1 interval a significant number of cells is strongly over estimated leading to a slightly bimodal distribution of the investigated ratio with a smaller second maximum around 1 0 2 the median value is slightly smaller than 1 0 0 for all three spacings the uncalibrated ip results show a narrower distribution of prediction quality with 96 5 98 of the values within the 1 0 2 interval while the median value is close to 1 0 0 for the smallest electrode spacing it is shifted to lower values with increasing spacing at the same time the percentage of values within the 1 0 1 interval decreases from 77 5 to 59 9 due to the low data density and strong regularization effects a majority of the k values gets significantly under estimated with increasing spacing after performing the factor calibration this bias produced by the inversion is mostly corrected with all median values being very close to 1 0 0 and a much higher number of values can be found within the 1 0 1 interval however the growing range of the distribution with increasing spacing cannot be removed by the calibration the exponential calibration improves the prediction quality compared to the uncalibrated results but is less successful than the factor calibration in the same way a possible bias of the petrophysical laws underlying the inversion procedure might be corrected by the suggested calibration approaches while the ip method is very well capable of retrieving the structural information correctly and giving a rough estimation of the expected trend in the k values the calibration using hydraulic information is being used for a more exact k estimation still it is important to note that the inherent scatter of the petrophysical laws cannot be removed and the achieved k distribution remains an approximation of the reality within the limits of the accuracy of the petrophysical relations 3 2 transport simulation 3 2 1 snapshots of tracer plumes firstly we evaluate the results of the transport modeling by imaging the tracer plumes that are simulated using the different inversion results as input data for the k distribution fig 6 shows an overview of snapshots taken at a simulation time of 50 days after starting the tracer injection for the different methods and calibrations as well as point spacings arranged similarly to fig 4 the result for the original data set is given on the left side and we consider this to be the actual tracer concentration that would be observed in reality as a basis for comparison the highly permeable zones 1 5 identified in fig 4 have produced fingering tracer plumes that mostly extend as far as the center part of the domain x 6 7 m finger 2 inhibits some smaller variations due to the small scale k heterogeneities and finger 3 splits up into two thinner layers with high tracer concentration the ht results for 0 25 m and 0 5 m spacing correctly show all tracer fingers 1 5 with roughly the right extension and shape smaller features as e g the variations in finger 2 or the splitting of finger 3 however can hardly be made out with 1 m spacing the two uppermost tracer fingers disappeared due to smoothing effects and the lack of pumping locations at the very top and only the fingers 3 4 and 5 are modeled correctly using the ip inversion results for the tracer prediction correctly reproduces the fingers 1 3 and 4 with the right extension and shape some small scale features like the splitting of finger 3 are more realistic compared to ht however finger 2 gets strongly under estimated due to smoothing effects and layer 5 cannot be sensed due to the lack of quadrupoles in the lowest part of the domain with larger spacing the stronger influence of the smoothing effects becomes apparent the simulation with 1 m spacing can only reproduce the fingers 3 and 4 but they do not extend as far as they should this indicates that for cross hole ip measurements a small enough electrode spacing is crucial to obtain reliable results the tracer prediction resulting from the factor calibration shows a clear over estimation of k in the highly permeable layers with the fingers 1 3 and 4 extending too far to the right this effect is strongest for 0 25 m spacing where the plume is already extending out of the domain at this time step for the larger spacings the images are at least closer to the reality than the uncalibrated results although still somewhat over corrected the best prediction of tracer plumes is achieved by the exponential calibration for 0 25 m spacing the uncalibrated result has already been close to reality and it remains almost unchanged by the exponential calibration a stronger effect of the calibration is visible for 0 5 m spacing where the extension of the plumes is now predicted correctly for 1 m spacing the result is still quite far from reality since the calibration cannot compensate for the lack in identified structures and the strong smoothing effects even so there is a clear improvement compared to the uncalibrated result 3 2 2 tracer breakthrough curves the depth integrated relative tracer concentration over time at the central borehole x 6 m is depicted in fig 7a c the concentrations were also recorded in the right borehole x 9 m but all the main trends in the results are similar so they are not further detailed here the breakthrough curve btc for the original data set red line shows a relatively steep increase in tracer concentration within the first 150 days which is stimulated by the highly permeable layers in the aquifer layers 1 5 in figs 4 and 6 for later times we observe a much slower increase in concentration as a result of the delayed propagation in the less permeable parts as a basis for comparison we also show the btc of a hypothetical homogeneous model with k e f f 7 1 0 5 m s 1 red dashed line here we only observe a relatively quick incline of tracer concentration in the time span between 150 and 200 days however the true shape of the btc cannot be reproduced since no structural information on the sediments is processed in contrast all transport simulation results from ht and ip better approximate the true shape of the btc apparently the structural information gained from the two imaging techniques is valuable even when just looking at depth integrated btcs especially the tracer breakthrough at early times is strongly under estimated by the homogeneous model the ht results black lines are successful in reproducing the whole btc although we observe a slight under estimation of tracer breakthrough at early times and an over estimation at late times this can be interpreted as a result of smoothing effects leading to a less pronounced distinction between areas with higher or lower k it corresponds with the fact that this effect becomes stronger with increasing spacing where smoothing effects have more impact although the ip results dark blue lines correctly reproduce the general shape of the btc due to correctly retrieved structural information they strongly under estimate the tracer breakthrough within the entire time span apparently the tomograms are not accurate enough to be used for a transport simulation the exponential calibration cyan lines mainly corrects the early time behavior of the btc since only the highly permeable parts are changed by this calibration approach especially for the larger spacings 0 5 m and 1 m this brings an advantage compared to the uncalibrated result whereas for the smallest spacing 0 25 m almost no change can be observed this is in agreement with the findings for the inversion results fig 4 and the tracer plumes fig 6 for the late times the calibration does not compensate the under estimation of tracer breakthrough however this is not caused by an under estimation of k in the less permeable zones since the slope of the btc is correctly reproduced instead the extension of high k zones is underestimated due to regularization especially for large spacings and therefore the early time breakthrough reaches lower concentrations this offset remains for the whole time span and leads to an overall under prediction of tracer breakthrough the factor calibration green lines is more successful in correcting the ip results although the tracer concentration is over estimated for early times the long term behavior is correctly predicted with a quality that is at least similar to the ht results applying the k e f f value to the whole domain yields the best k prediction in terms of average values and therefore the best reproduction of the complete btc finally we assess the impact of the point spacing electrodes or pumping locations on the quality of the tracer breakthrough prediction for this purpose we pick a certain breakthrough time for all curves at the time where half of the relative concentration has been reached we calculate the difference to the breakthrough time of the original data set and call this the breakthrough delay considering it a rough measure for the error in the prediction of the btc the dependency of the delay on the spacing is shown in fig 7d for all methods we observe an increase of the delay for increasing spacing due to a lower data density and stronger smoothing effects this effect is only weakly pronounced for the ht results indicating again that the point spacing is not as crucial and relatively good results can also be achieved with fewer pumping tests on the other hand the dependency on electrode spacing of the uncalibrated ip results is very pronounced showing that a sufficiently small electrode spacing is particularly important to retrieve all the necessary structural information and gain good k estimates however acquiring cross borehole ip data with such small spacing in the field can be a very challenging task therefore we consider the calibration with hydraulic data to be valuable especially when a larger spacing has to be used and therefore important structural information is not well resolved while the exponential calibration can only slightly compensate for those problems the factor calibration is very successful in reducing the breakthrough delay here the results have a quality very similar to the ht data and the errors resulting from the large electrode spacing have been reduced significantly 4 conclusions we have shown that both ht and ip are valuable tools for imaging k heterogeneities in near surface aquifers the structural information of our test data set the bolstern aquifer analog has been reconstructed by the inversion procedures to a high degree of resolution and quantitative accuracy for the first time the distribution of k could be computed directly from the ip data with our new ip k inversion procedure and the general quality of the results is comparable to the ht travel time inversion however to achieve highly accurate k estimates that allow using the results for groundwater modeling we calibrate the results with hydraulic information after the factor calibration the depth integrated tracer btcs of the original data set could be reproduced imposing k e f f on the whole domain leads to a good prediction of the long term behavior of tracer breakthrough on the other hand the exponential calibration is more suitable to correctly predict the tracer plumes at early times therefore in practice it would be necessary to decide on one of the calibrations depending on how the data will be used later on both calibrations may not only correct regularization induced errors in k prediction but also a possible bias of the petrophysical laws that link electrical and hydrological parameters although we cannot account for the inherent scatter of the petrophysical relations we still consider those calibrations to be highly valuable tools within the processing of ip data while the structural features of an aquifer can be accurately retrieved with ip hydraulic information is essential for a reliable k quantification future research should focus on testing the suggested methodology within field experiments the new ip k inversion procedure for ip data has already been tested on borehole data fiandaca et al 2021 and 2d surface profiles from five different european countries martin et al 2021 giving k values within one decade from slug tests grain size analysis estimates however no benchmarking of the field k estimates for flow and transport modeling or tracer experiments have been conducted yet ideally future field experiments should follow a similar concept as presented in this study fig 1 conducting both ht and ip experiments at the same site would allow a direct comparison of the performance of the methods in the field furthermore the pumping tests carried out for the ht survey could provide the k e f f value needed for the ip calibrations finally the quality of the achieved k images might also be tested by tracer experiments on the other hand field campaigns with limited financial and time resources may now also rely on ip measurements alone together with one or just a few pumping tests for retrieving k e f f following the suggested calibration methodology while a full ht experiment is often very time consuming and costly ip measurements can mostly be conducted within a few hours in a setting similar to the example shown in this work therefore a detailed characterization of aquifer heterogeneities in the field might become more convenient by applying our ip k inversion procedure and the results can be expected to have a similar quality compared to ht however the two calibration approaches suggested in this work should only be regarded as a starting point in a real field environment further elaborated calibration methods might turn out to be more successful furthermore stronger data integration approaches between hydraulic and geophysical methods are expected to yield even better results while hydraulic methods are often most sensitive to preferential flow paths ip generates the strongest polarization response in areas of low k we therefore see a big potential in using the complementary sensitivities of the two methods by a stronger integration of the data ultimately a fully joint inversion of ht and ip data sets might open the door to an improved ability of imaging hydraulic conductivity in near surface aquifers credit authorship contribution statement

85,precise information about the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity k in an aquifer is essential for the reliable modeling of groundwater flow and transport processes in this study we present results of a new inversion procedure for induced polarization ip data that incorporates petrophysical relations between electrical and hydraulic parameters and therefore allows for the direct computation of k this novel approach was successfully implemented for the bolstern aquifer analog by performing synthetic ip experiments with a combined surface and cross borehole setup from these data the distribution of k was retrieved with high accuracy and resolution showing a similar quality compared to images achieved by hydraulic tomography to further improve the quantitative estimates of k we use synthetic pumping test data to inform two novel calibration strategies for the ip inversion results both calibrations are especially helpful for correcting a possible bias of the ip inversion e g due to resolution limitations and or to bias in the underlying petrophysical relations the simulation of tracer experiments on the retrieved tomograms highlights the accuracy of the inversion results as well as the significant role of the proposed calibrations keywords induced polarization hydraulic tomography hydraulic conductivity inversion data availability the original bolstern data set as well as all ht and ip inversion results are available through https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 6361423 1 introduction tomographic methods have evolved as a promising family of hydrogeological field investigation techniques for imaging the hydraulic conductivity k distribution yeh and liu 2000 vasco et al 2000 jimenez et al 2013 zhao and illman 2018 pouladi et al 2021 they rely on sending and recording multiple signals at different positions of an aquifer by processing all signals together the spatial distribution of hydraulic parameters is reconstructed the choice of a tomographic configuration for identification of subsurface structures is rooted in geophysical exploration gottlieb and dietrich 1995 yeh and lee 2007 accordingly tomographic concepts based on classical hydrogeological field techniques with hydraulic stimulation or tracer signals often adopt data inversion principles that are established in geophysics hu et al 2011 kong et al 2018 ringel et al 2021 vice versa especially near surface geophysical techniques such as ground penetrating radar electrical resistivity tomography or electromagnetic induction are tuned to not only identify geological but also hydraulic structures slater 2007 linde et al 2006 mclachlan et al 2021 still hydraulic or tracer tomography is not fully established in practice a major reason is the rather high experimental demand for installation of field equipment and borehole devices bohling and butler 2010 brauchler et al 2013b cardiff et al 2013 klepikova et al 2020 fast applicability in the field is an advantage of many geophysical techniques however a common shortcoming is that aquifer heterogeneities are described by geophysical proxy parameters as classical geophysical exploration techniques do not test hydraulic properties directly their capacity to provide meaningful hydrogeological insight in aquifers is limited ideally geophysical and hydrogeological information is thus jointly processed for obtaining hydrogeophysical tomograms to benefit from the advantages of both approaches irving and singha 2010 vilhelmsen et al 2014 ahmed et al 2016 in the growing research field of hydrogeophysics binley et al 2015 a strong focus is on electrical methods due to their ability of sensing pore space properties that govern the hydraulic parameters revil et al 2012a wang et al 2021 however imaging hydraulic conductivity requires the separation of pore volume and pore surface properties which cannot be achieved by conventional geoelectrical methods as a remedy the additional information contained in induced polarization ip measurements about electrical polarization effects at the pore matrix interface can be used to quantitatively separate these properties slater 2007 to link the electrical parameters of ip measurements with the hydrogeological parameters we mainly rely on empirical relations derived from laboratory measurements the first quantitative relation between ip parameters and k was established by börner et al 1996 since then a variety of other empirical laws has been derived by spectral induced polarization sip laboratory measurements slater and lesmes 2002 binley et al 2005 revil and florsch 2010 titov et al 2010 revil et al 2012b attwa and günther 2013 weller et al 2015 robinson et al 2018 most of the ip parameters that are valuable for estimating k are defined in the frequency domain as e g the cole cole parameters cole and cole 1941 pelton et al 1978 and can therefore be most easily derived from sip measurements however although some applications of sip in the field do exist kemna et al 2012 orozco et al 2012 gallistl et al 2018 this method is mainly used for the electrical characterization of rocks in the laboratory revil et al 2014 börner et al 2017 römhild et al 2019 whereas for field campaigns time domain ip tdip measurements are most common kemna et al 2004 gazoty et al 2012 doetsch et al 2015 this gap can be overcome by using a fourier transform within the ip inversion procedure so that tdip data can be inverted for frequency domain parameters such as cole cole parameters fiandaca et al 2012 2013 or other re parameterizations of the cole cole model fiandaca et al 2018a this approach yields results of a similar quality compared to frequency domain measurements madsen et al 2017 but often has an advantage in terms of acquisition time maurya et al 2018b martin et al 2020 in several studies k has already been estimated from these electrical parameters at field scale hördt et al 2009 attwa and günther 2013 maurya et al 2018a however the petrophysical relations mentioned above have always been applied after the inversion for ip parameters making the interpretation in terms of hydraulic parameters ambiguous instead incorporating the petrophysical laws into the inversion procedure allows the direct computation of the k distribution in the subsurface from the measured ip data although ambiguities might also be reduced with strong structural priors such as training images pirot et al 2017 a petrophysical inversion approach can have further advantages by introducing a new parameterization parameter correlations can be reduced and the direct inversion for k makes it easier to study its uncertainties and how data errors propagate to model errors it also allows to apply the regularization to the actual hydraulic parameters instead of the electrical parameters and simplifies the integration of prior models that are often given as a distribution of k petrophysical inversion strategies have already been applied in other contexts such as permafrost sites mollaret et al 2020 gas hydrate systems turco et al 2021 or reservoir characterization gao et al 2012 but mostly with the aim of establishing a joint inversion while our new ip k inversion approach has already been mentioned briefly in conference abstracts fiandaca et al 2021 martin et al 2021 we now present the complete methodology and a detailed assessment of the results for the first time we are aiming to show the abilities and limitations of this deterministic inversion for imaging k heterogeneities in near surface aquifers by performing synthetic modeling and inversion tests on aquifer analog data with a combined surface and cross borehole ip setup we compare those results with data derived from synthetic hydraulic tomography ht experiments using a similar setup our main goal is to achieve a distribution of k that would yield a correct solute transport simulation for this purpose a straightforward calibration strategy of complementing ip inversion with hydraulic information is introduced in the following we briefly explain the methodological concepts of ip and ht as well as our new ip k inversion approach as the study site for simulating a synthetic cross hole ht and ip application a sedimentary aquifer analog is implemented to compare the abilities of the two methods in imaging decimeter meter scale k heterogeneities with varying point spacing the performance of the new calibration strategy is evaluated and all findings are discussed with special emphasis on the applicability of the suggested methodology within field campaigns 2 materials and methods fig 1 gives an overview of the procedures applied in this study the bolstern aquifer analog heinz et al 2003 serves as the input data set for the forward modeling of ip data and the ht synthetic experiments the achieved data sets are then used for the respective inversion the new ip k inversion procedure and an ht travel time inversion additionally we achieve an effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f as an average value for the whole domain by a small set of seven pumping tests and use it to calibrate our inversion results to assess the quality of those calibrations and the performance of the two methods in general we finally conduct tracer transport simulations with the achieved k tomograms and evaluate them based on imaged tracer plumes as well as depth integrated tracer breakthrough curves 2 1 bolstern aquifer analog the bolstern aquifer analog data set heinz et al 2003 was derived from an outcrop analog study of fluvial deposits located near bolstern sw germany see fig 2a within the paleo discharge zone of the rhine glacier the analog study comprises a rectangular 20 m 7 m 2d cross section fig 2b which is built up by a mosaic of hydrofacies units that were delineated from the outcrop wall at a resolution of 0 05 m the hydrofacies units represent nearly hydraulically homogeneous units with k derived from grain size analysis as well as porosity information the hydrofacies accord with the sedimentary lithofacies and this is reflected in the structural features of the analog with heterogeneous layers and cross beddings as a common characteristic for many sedimentary unconsolidated aquifers the bolstern analog has already been used as a realistic test case for modeling contaminant transport in previous work höyng et al 2015 we use a section of the whole analog between x 0 m and 12 m which corresponds to x 6 m and 18 m in the original nomenclatures of heinz et al 2003 covering the whole depth range from z 0 m to 7 m red rectangle in fig 2b for all simulated virtual experiments we assume to have three boreholes at x 3 m 6 m and 9 m black lines in fig 2b 2 2 induced polarization 2 2 1 electrical rock properties the electrical conductivity σ of a rock is generally considered to be a frequency dependent and complex valued quantity olhoeft 1985 1 σ ω σ e l σ i n t ω consisting of electrolytic conductivity σ e l and interface conductivity σ i n t with ω 2 π f being the angular frequency and the denoting complex quantities it can be written in terms of real and imaginary part σ and σ respectively or as magnitude σ and phase angle φ 2 σ ω σ ω i σ ω σ e i φ where i is the imaginary unit the electrolytic part is controlled by the conduction through a rock s pore space and thus depends on pore volume properties as described by archie s law archie 1942 3 σ e l σ w f ϕ m σ w where σ w is the pore water conductivity f ϕ m is the formation factor ϕ is porosity and m is the empirical cementation exponent this formulation assumes fully saturated conditions the interface conductivity σ i n t however may contain contributions from a variety of electrical polarization phenomena that are mainly related to the interface between rock matrix and pore space if electronically conductive minerals such as graphite or pyrite are absent as it is mostly the case in sedimentary environments diffusion related polarization connected to the electrical double layer edl at the pore matrix interface is dominant marshall and madden 1959 schwarz 1962 while standard geoelectrical methods are only sensitive to the real part σ of the electrical conductivity ip measurements can retrieve information about the imaginary part σ as well this is either done by conducting spectral induced polarization sip measurements in the frequency domain and then converting the magnitude and phase angle information to a complex electrical conductivity or by performing time domain induced polarization tdip measurements and full decay spectral inversion fiandaca et al 2012 2013 madsen et al 2020 we will focus on the latter option since the acquisition time is smaller in the field maurya et al 2018b and a good retrieval of spectral properties is achievable when a wide time range is used in acquisition madsen et al 2017 for instance through the analysis of full waveform recordings olsson et al 2016 a typical tdip field setup is similar to a standard dc geoelectrics setup with a sequence of quadrupoles injecting a current with two electrodes a b and measuring the resulting voltage with two other electrodes m n a simplified setup is shown in fig 3a the sequence is typically distributed along a 2d profile on the surface e g following a gradient protocol i and can be complemented by cross borehole measurements ii or quadrupoles in a single borehole iii for the synthetic experiments carried out within this study a combination of the three options shown in fig 3a is used but a variety of other sequences is possible bing and greenhalgh 2000 while surface ip measurements are becoming a more widely used method field examples of cross borehole ip are still rare kemna et al 2004 binley et al 2016 bording et al 2019 to extract meaningful parameters from ip data the cole cole model is commonly used to describe the spectral behavior of σ cole and cole 1941 pelton et al 1978 tarasov and titov 2013 4 σ ω σ 0 1 m 0 1 m 0 1 1 1 i ω τ σ c here σ 0 is the dc conductivity m 0 the intrinsic chargeability as defined by seigel 1959 τ σ the relaxation time and c the frequency exponent based on petrophysical relations found in laboratory studies the electrical properties of a rock can be used to predict hydraulic conductivity k in the following we make use of two different approaches first revil et al 2012b found a relation for permeability k and hence hydraulic conductivity k based on relaxation time τ σ formation factor f and the diffusion coefficient of the stern layer d 5 k τ σ d 4 f a powerlaw fit of r 2 0 88 was reported for the used set of clean saturated sand samples the relation is based on the idea that τ σ can be treated as a measure for typical scale lengths e g pore throat size that in return govern the hydraulic conductivity the volumetric properties are accounted for by f as a measure for effective porosity at first sight this approach does not include any empirical parameters and should be straight forward to use however while τ σ and f can be directly derived from the ip measurements the diffusion coefficient d can only be estimated typically depending on the clay content revil et al 2015 give the following values for clean sand and clay 6 d s a n d 1 3 1 0 9 m s 2 7 d c l a y 3 8 1 0 12 m s 2 however other laboratory findings are raising doubt about the existence of two distinct values for d weller et al 2016 instead an apparent diffusion coefficient d a can be introduced that may cover a much wider range of values although its physical significance remains unclear in our study in which sand clay mixtures are actually reflected in a wide range of k values we still use the two values given by revil et al 2015 to compute a distribution of d directly from k by imposing an interpolation in logarithmic space however the purpose of this simplification is only the simulation of realistic τ σ values according to eq 5 within the forward modeling the second petrophysical approach was introduced by weller et al 2015 it uses the formation factor f and the imaginary part σ evaluated at a frequency of 1 hz for permeability estimation 8 k α f β σ 1 hz γ with the empirical parameters α 1 08 1 0 13 β 1 12 and γ 2 27 for unconsolidated and fully saturated sediments the coefficient of determination is reported as r 2 0 862 and an additional degree of uncertainty lays in the applicability of the empirical parameters α β and γ in the given geological setting furthermore we use a relationship between imaginary and real part of surface conductivity found by weller et al 2013 9 σ 1 hz l σ i n t 1 hz with l 0 042 0 022 but imposing the relation at the frequency f 2 π τ σ 1 fiandaca et al 2018b finally the conversion from permeability k to hydraulic conductivity k can be achieved by 10 k d g η k where d is the density of the pore fluid g the gravitational acceleration and η the dynamic viscosity of the pore fluid assuming a groundwater temperature of 10 c we use the approximation 11 k 7 5 1 0 6 k for more details on the petrophysical background we refer to fiandaca et al 2018b and the references therein clearly all petrophysical laws between hydraulic and electrical parameters are only approximations that bear a significant amount of uncertainty additionally due to the regularization applied within the inversion the petrophysical relationships of the tomograms are also resolution dependent hermans and irving 2017 although we will show how these regularization induced errors as well as a simple bias in the petrophysical relations can partly be corrected by our proposed calibrations their intrinsic scatter can barely be reduced by these procedures especially in strongly heterogeneous aquifers like the bolstern aquifer this uncertainty can be significant easily spanning one to two orders of magnitude e g hördt et al 2009 in addition further parameters like the cementation exponent m that are approximated as constants might be spatially variable schön 2015 yue 2019 therefore petrophysical relations actually present in the field are often far from the laws derived in the lab e g benoit et al 2019 so that not only the inherent uncertainty but also the applicability of those relations in a given field setting are limiting factors for the quality of the inversion result synthetic experiments should always be regarded as best case scenarios showing the upper limit of k prediction quality that may be achieved in a field application however even best case scenarios are anything but trivial and insights from synthetic studies are important means to judge the role of procedural assumptions for an inversion and the resolution capability of the proposed methods 2 2 2 forward modeling for defining the input data set used within the forward simulation the whycdf model space 12 m w h y c d f σ w k d f c was used the whycdf acronym indicates the model parameters i e water and hydraulic conductivity σ w and k respectively diffusion coefficient d and formation factor f the frequency exponent c is not specified in the acronym the idea of re parameterizing the model space is based on fiandaca et al 2018a now being extended by directly imposing the petrophysical relations eqs 1 2 4 5 8 9 and 11 onto the objective function therefore the conversion from hydrological to electrical parameters is part of the modeling process and not a separate procedure the two petrophysical approaches by revil et al 2012b and weller et al 2015 are simultaneously used by forcing them to yield the same permeability k the five different input parameters were set up in the following way water conductivity σ w was assumed to be constant at 100 ms m which is a realistic value for groundwater schön 2015 hydraulic conductivity k was directly imported from the bolstern data set heinz et al 2003 the diffusion coefficient d was derived from k by interpolation in log space from the sand clay values suggested by revil et al 2015 thereby imposing realistic τ σ values on the data the formation factor f was computed from the porosity information contained in the bolstern data set by assuming a constant cementation exponent of m 1 3 as a realistic value for unconsolidated sediments schön 2015 the frequency exponent of the cole cole model c was assumed to be constant at 0 5 the full data set hydraulic conductivity k diffusion coefficient d and bulk conductivity σ 0 including both f σ w and σ i n t is shown in appendix b the synthetic ip experiments are based on a setup consisting of one surface profile over the entire length of the data set x 0 12 m as well as electrodes in three hypothetical boreholes at x 3 m 6 m and 9 m we consider this to be a realistic setup within a field study that should allow resolving the heterogeneities of the aquifer within the whole domain furthermore the same setup of boreholes is expected to work well for ht so that the results of the two methods can be compared directly in practice the same boreholes could be used to conduct all the experiments to simulate realistic field conditions gaussian noise of 2 and 10 magnitude was added after the forward simulation to resistivity and ip data respectively field data can mostly be fitted with this level of error as for instance demonstrated in maurya et al 2018a some exemplary decay curves with added noise and error bars of the assumed standard deviation model are depicted in appendix b we run the forward simulation in 2d following fiandaca et al 2013 with three different electrode spacings 1 m 0 5 m and 0 25 m to assess the impact of varying spacings on the inversion in terms of computational performance and ability to image k heterogeneities the sequence follows a commonly used gradient protocol for the surface profile and borehole quadrupoles according to the cases i ii and iii shown in fig 3a with ip time gates ranging from 0 003 s to 12 s the total number of quadrupoles from which the total duration of a field experiment might be estimated are 162 for 1 m spacing 885 for 0 5 m spacing and 2866 for 0 25 m spacing 2 2 3 inversion the inversion was performed in the thycd model space 13 m t h y c d σ 0 k d c consisting of total dc conductivity σ 0 hydraulic conductivity k diffusion coefficient d and frequency exponent c all four parameters are space dependent and uncoupled during the inversion but the spatial variability of each parameter can be adjusted by setting horizontal and vertical constraints while a model space with five parameters like whycdf is convenient as input for a forward simulation it is not possible to invert for both the formation factor and the water conductivity since the effects of both parameters on dc conductivity cannot be separated consequently the water conductivity is considered a prior information in the inversion and the total dc conductivity is used for the parameterization of the inversion result this choice is supported by the results of markov chain monte carlo modeling performed with different parameterizations fiandaca et al 2021 where the thycd model space turned out to be the most suitable and is therefore used for this work again it should be stressed that the conversion from electrical to hydrological parameters is an inherent part of the inversion and not a separate procedure although we refer to the diffusion coefficient as d here it might also be interpreted as an apparent diffusion coefficient d a weller et al 2016 in the inversion results we also performed additional inversion tests with a different model space where d is replaced by τ σ so that eq 5 revil et al 2012b is actually not used the distribution of k remains almost identical which shows that eq 8 weller et al 2015 alone can also be sufficient for the inversion of tdip data the data space of the inversion consists of the dc data and the full decays of the quadrupole sequence the objective function which contains the squared data misfit and smoothness regularization terms for vertical and horizontal constraints is minimized through a iterative gauss newton approach fiandaca et al 2013 we ran all the codes on a standard desktop pc with an 8 core i7 9700k 3 6 ghz processor and 32 gb ram the runtime for one iteration is about one minute for the 1 m spacing electrode sequence 7 8 min for the 0 5 m sequence and around 30 min for the 0 25 m sequence which adds up to a total inversion runtime of several hours depending on the number of iterations in the last case this shows that also the inversion of field data can mostly be conducted on standard pc equipment 2 2 4 calibration with hydraulic data identification and resolution of k heterogeneity is in particular relevant for performing transport modeling therefore it is especially crucial to obtain accurate k estimates in the preferential flow paths and thus in areas of high k however the strongest ip signal e g in terms of chargeability is typically measured in materials with low k since they have a higher inner surface area and therefore a more pronounced polarization connected to the edl in contrast in the high k zones the ip signal is relatively weak so that the k estimates in the preferential flow paths are less supported by the ip data and might be less accurate considering these unfavorable properties of ip resulting tomograms may resolve structural features very well but they are not very reliable with respect to the hydraulic characterization of preferential flow paths additionally the uncertainties of the petrophysical relations linking electrical and hydraulic properties as well as regularization effects might produce a bias in k prediction as a remedy we suggest calibrating the ip inversion result by incorporating information gathered from pumping test data in the synthetic example we retrieve the effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f as a single value for the whole domain by performing synthetic pumping tests on the bolstern data set using feflow the procedure is inspired by the approach of wu et al 2005 a setup of seven pumping locations in the left borehole and seven observation points in the right borehole is used see appendix a part c the pumping tests are carried out in exactly the same way as the ht experiments see section 2 3 2 additionally we set up a model with homogeneous k and perform the same experiments the optimal k value of the homogeneous model is chosen by minimizing the cumulative rms misfit when comparing these hypothetical pressure response curves with those of the bolstern data set benchmarking we consider the value for k producing the smallest misfit to be the effective hydraulic conductivity k e f f and found the following value for the bolstern aquifer analog 14 k e f f 7 1 0 5 m s in practice k e f f may be inferred from the transmissivity that is estimated by conducting a single standard pumping test at the site we suggest two different approaches to use k e f f for calibrating the ip inversion results i calibration with a constant factor factor calibration and ii calibration with a flexible calibration matrix using an exponential relationship exponential calibration the first option consists of a simple multiplication of the inversion result k ip with the calibration coefficient c so that the geometric mean of the calibration result k fac will be equal to k e f f 15 k fac k ip c 16 c k e f f m e a n k ip this calibration is based on the assumption that k e f f should be close to the geometric mean of the k values of the original data set k o r i g considering only the inner part between the boreholes which for the bolstern aquifer analog is found to be 17 m e a n k orig 3 75 1 0 5 m s k e f f is slightly higher than this value because it is typically more sensitive to the preferential flow paths and therefore to areas with high k especially in a highly anisotropic medium with pronounced horizontal layering as present in the bolstern aquifer however we would still propose using the geometric mean of the k field since this does not require any a priori assumptions about structural features or anisotropy in a field setting the exponential calibration attempts taking into account the different sensitivities of ip experiments and pumping tests by introducing a flexible calibration matrix c α the concept of this approach is visualized in appendix a already including the results for different parameterizations the calibration matrix is made up by 18 c α e α k ip and the calibration result k exp is achieved by computing the hadamard product between c α and the inversion result k ip 19 k exp c α k ip for low k values strong ip effect the elements in c α will be close to one so that the inversion result is not changed by the calibration whereas for higher k values weak ip effect the impact of the calibration generally becomes stronger however the overall strength and direction of the calibration is determined by the exponent α which is chosen according to the pumping test data we iterate over a wide range of values for α in order to minimize the misfit between the geometric mean of the calibration result k exp and k e f f 20 m e a n k exp ξ 100 k e f f α r m i n since k e f f is often higher than the actual geometric mean of k as shown above for the bolstern aquifer we do not use the whole data set to compute the geometric mean within this calibration but neglect a certain percentile ξ with the lowest k values the impact of ξ is visualized in appendix a for very low values close to 0 the result is likely to be over corrected whereas for too high values an under correction will occur however we find that the optimal percentile ξ can be estimated by visual assessment of the uncalibrated inversion result and the function α ξ as shown in part b of appendix a allows for an evaluation of the impact of different ξ values on the calibration result typically the optimal value for ξ will rise with increasing electrode spacing since smoothing effects lead to more extensive areas of low k we finally choose ξ 30 for 0 25 m spacing ξ 35 for 0 5 m spacing and ξ 50 for 1 m spacing undoubtedly this choice is to some extent subjective and more experience and testing will be needed to choose the best value for ξ in other applications 2 3 hydraulic tomography 2 3 1 general concept hydraulic tomography ht requires hydraulic stimulation e g pumping or slug tests with several observation points at different locations to generate a tomographical configuration similar to many geophysical tomography methods fig 3b the pressure response measured at the observation point is used to invert the stratigraphic structure i e the spatial distribution of hydraulic diffusivity hydraulic conductivity and specific storage the main inversion algorithms consist of geostatistics based and travel time based methods the geostatistical methods for ht inversions can be predicated on a variety of algorithms including simultaneous successive linear estimator berg and illman 2011 yeh and liu 2000 quasi linear estimator cardiff et al 2020 kitanidis 1995 or ensemble kalman filter sánchez león et al 2020 a common feature of these approaches is that they require a priori geostatistical models to assume the spatial correlation of the hydraulic parameters in contrast travel time methods used for ht inversion brauchler et al 2003 2013a are based on an eikonal equation which is transferred from the groundwater flow equation vasco et al 2000 and can be solved by ray tracing or particle tracking techniques compared to the first class of methods this approach requires much less computational effort since it does not simulate in a complete groundwater flow model additionally it does not require any prior assumptions about the geostatistical model which can be highly uncertain due to the sparse measurements and various application scales however the travel time based approach has limitations in reproducing the hydraulic parameters in low permeability areas due to the low ray coverage although many studies prove that the structure of the formation can be readily reconstructed a sequential inversion scheme is still required for a more accurate quantification of the hydraulic parameters hu et al 2015 2011 jimenez et al 2013 2 3 2 forward modeling the synthetic ht experiments were simulated using the software feflow diersch 2014 the model domain was discretized by irregular triangular meshing the initial hydraulic head in the whole domain is set to zero and we apply constant head boundaries at the two sides the hydraulic conductivity values were assigned to the mesh according to the values of the bolstern aquifer analog whereas the specific storage coefficient was assumed to be homogeneous at s s 1 0 4 m 1 according to typical values found in literature kuang et al 2020 source points were placed at the hypothetical borehole at x 3 m whereas receiver points were placed at x 6 m and x 9 m three different scenarios were simulated with varying vertical spacing of respectively 0 25 m 0 5 m and 1 m within the boreholes therefore the setups are similar to the ip experiments and the quality of the results can be directly compared at the receiver points the hydraulic head was recorded during the pumping tests which are sequentially carried out from top to bottom the pumping signal is a heaviside function with a constant rate of 1 l s as shown in fig 3e the resulting pressure response curves were imported to matlab for further processing all source receiver combinations with a ray path angle larger than 60 were filtered out since the layered stratigraphy typical for a shallow porous medium can be better resolved by reducing those large angle ray paths brauchler et al 2007 the 10 diagnostic brauchler et al 2003 is selected for the inversion meaning that the early time t α h is picked where the derivative value reached 10 of the maximum derivative at the observation point fig 3f hence the data space consists of all source and receiver coordinates except the filtered ones as well as the respective early times the travel time information was contaminated with a noise level of 3 similar to doetsch et al 2010 and hu et al 2017 2 3 3 inversion hydraulic travel time of a pumping test is defined as a line integral in which the pumping induced pressure is generated at the source point x 1 and travels along the path ɛ before reaching the receiver point x 2 21 t α h 1 6 f α h x 1 x 2 d ɛ d ɛ where t α h is the early time and f α h is a conversion factor brauchler et al 2003 the subscript h indicates the usage of a heaviside source similar to the seismic travel time inversion eq 21 is resolved using ray tracing techniques and the inverted slowness can be converted to the hydraulic diffusivity d in this study the open source framework pygimli is utilized to invert the hydraulic travel times which is based on the generalized gauss newton method rücker et al 2017 günther et al 2006 and where the forward operator for calculating the travel times uses dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 as a final step we use the factor calibration approach introduced for ip to translate the achieved diffusivities d to a hydraulic conductivity distribution k ht that is in agreement with k e f f this procedure replaces the common approach of multiplying with a specific storage coefficient s s k d s s which is typically also assumed as homogeneous 2 4 tracer experiments we want to assess the quality of the inversion results by performing synthetic tracer experiments using the achieved k images and compare the results to those obtained by modeling with the original bolstern data set the corresponding simulations were conducted using feflow in the area between the hypothetical boreholes x 3 m 9 m steady state hydraulic conditions were assumed and constant heads assigned to the model boundaries induce a hydraulic gradient of 0 001 between the inflow and outflow borders a conservative tracer was injected as a hypothetical line source with a constant rate of 1 mg l at the upstream border of the model domain x 3 m left borehole the longitudinal and vertical transverse dispersivities were set to 2 5 1 0 2 m and 2 5 1 0 4 m respectively according to the values given in höyng et al 2015 3 results 3 1 ht and ip inversion results fig 4c gives an overview of all the inversion results for the different methods and spacings the original bolstern data set is given at the top fig 4a where the grey numbers 1 5 indicate the most important highly permeable layers those layers are only subjectively defined to make it easier to refer to certain features in the text but we will also show that they are responsible for the major tracer fingers found in the transport simulation presented below also note that the k images derived from ht comprise only the domain between the boreholes between x 3 m and x 9 m whereas ip has the ability to image areas left and right of that domain as well although with decreasing sensitivity we show all the inversion results as images of k to allow a direct comparison the ht travel time inversion produced meaningful results that reveal the most important structures and overall good estimates of k with 0 25 m and 0 5 m spacing all the highly permeable layers 1 5 can be reconstructed at the correct locations and with well estimated k values however smaller heterogeneities as e g within layer 2 cannot be resolved and some inversion artifacts are visible in the results as e g a decrease in k in the direct vicinity of the left borehole the inversion result for 1 m spacing misses the uppermost layer 1 since no source and receiver locations are present in this part of the aquifer however the other layers 2 5 are still visible although smoothing effects are becoming more pronounced the travel time inversion typically yields integrated values along the different ray paths which in our case produces an offset between k values left and right of the central borehole although the general trend of the major layers is correct and the inversion results reflect the true behavior of the original data set local k heterogeneities are not always attributed to the exact location but are smeared along the respective section of the ray path creating a sharp border at the central borehole for ip we show the uncalibrated results for k as well as the images achieved by the new factor calibration and exponential calibration procedures note that the thycd inversion of ip data always yields a set of parameters of which only k is shown in fig 4 an example of the complete set of parameters is given in appendix b firstly we focus on the uncalibrated ip results with 0 25 m electrode spacing the aquifer heterogeneities are correctly reconstructed in terms of structural behavior and k quantification the highly permeable layers 1 4 are clearly retrieved by the inversion but layer 5 can hardly be reproduced obviously the sensitivity in this lowest part is small due to a very limited number of quadrupoles however when it comes to resolving smaller heterogeneities within the layers ip yields slightly better results than ht and the attribution of certain k heterogeneities to their exact location is more reliable when increasing the electrode spacing smoothing effects introduced by the regularization become more pronounced and this effect is much stronger compared to the ht results during ip measurements one quadrupole integrates over an area of at least three times the spacing also in vertical direction whereas for ht the integrative behavior is mainly related to the horizontal direction along the ray path therefore ht can resolve the borders between horizontal layers quite well while this becomes much more difficult for ip another effect of the regularization is that the k values especially in the highly permeable layers are typically under estimated for larger electrode spacing therefore we cannot expect to achieve correct transport simulations using those results this can be overcome by using the new calibration procedures employed in the following the factor calibration leads to an overall increase in k for all three spacings since the value for k e f f is higher than the geometric mean of the inversion results this yields an improvement in k estimation especially for the larger spacings 0 5 m and 1 m where the k values of the most permeable layers are now predicted more correctly however an over estimation of k can be observed in the less permeable zones this drawback can be overcome by the exponential calibration which leaves the lowest k values unchanged and only adjusts the permeable zones to the pumping test data as described in section 2 2 4 this effect is clearly visible in the results now the k estimates are very close to the original data set in all parts of the aquifer and for all three spacings the exponential calibration typically sharpens the contrast of the resulting image thereby diminishing the smoothing effects especially for larger electrode spacings to quantify the reproduction quality of aquifer structures we calculate the structural similarity index ssim for each inversion result compared to the original data set fig 4b this metric is commonly used in image processing and measures the similarity between two images by taking into account luminance contrast and structural information wang et al 2004 it is bounded between 0 and 1 while the latter value indicates perfect similarity we use the python package scikit image van der walt et al 2014 to calculate the ssim and find it to be a useful measure to assess the quality of the inversion results for all methods a decreasing ssim with increasing spacing can be observed due to lower data density and stronger smoothing effects this behavior is expected and corresponds to the visual assessment of the inversion results generally the lowest ssim is computed for the ht results between 0 17 and 0 05 although the major layers are retrieved correctly the method is not capable of retrieving the true structural behavior on smaller scales the ip results yield relatively high ssim values for the smallest spacing 0 30 indicating a good reproduction of the structural features however increasing the electrode spacing leads to a stronger decline of the ssim compared to ht showing again that smoothing effects are more pronounced for ip in this example the factor calibration can strongly improve the structural reproduction with the ssim slightly increasing for 0 25 m spacing and strongly increasing for 0 5 m and 1 m spacing while measurements with small spacing and therefore high data density cannot be improved much further by the calibration the results achieved with larger spacing strongly benefit from this procedure the exponential calibration is less successful in improving the structural information of the results but still yields higher ssim values compared to the uncalibrated ip tomograms to further evaluate the prediction quality of the k estimates we show histograms of the ratio between the estimated and the true value for each cell of the inversion result fig 5 to perform the comparison the values of the 0 05 m 0 05 m cells of the original data set had to be averaged within the corresponding bigger cells of the inversion results in the histograms values at 1 0 0 indicate a perfect prediction of k compared to the averaged value of the original data set we also show the median value of the ratio blue line as well as how much of the prediction is within one order of magnitude black lines and corresponding percentage and within two orders of magnitude red lines and corresponding percentage for the ht results a relatively broad distribution of prediction quality can be observed with approximately 90 of the values being within the 1 0 2 interval and between 67 and 75 within the 1 0 1 interval a significant number of cells is strongly over estimated leading to a slightly bimodal distribution of the investigated ratio with a smaller second maximum around 1 0 2 the median value is slightly smaller than 1 0 0 for all three spacings the uncalibrated ip results show a narrower distribution of prediction quality with 96 5 98 of the values within the 1 0 2 interval while the median value is close to 1 0 0 for the smallest electrode spacing it is shifted to lower values with increasing spacing at the same time the percentage of values within the 1 0 1 interval decreases from 77 5 to 59 9 due to the low data density and strong regularization effects a majority of the k values gets significantly under estimated with increasing spacing after performing the factor calibration this bias produced by the inversion is mostly corrected with all median values being very close to 1 0 0 and a much higher number of values can be found within the 1 0 1 interval however the growing range of the distribution with increasing spacing cannot be removed by the calibration the exponential calibration improves the prediction quality compared to the uncalibrated results but is less successful than the factor calibration in the same way a possible bias of the petrophysical laws underlying the inversion procedure might be corrected by the suggested calibration approaches while the ip method is very well capable of retrieving the structural information correctly and giving a rough estimation of the expected trend in the k values the calibration using hydraulic information is being used for a more exact k estimation still it is important to note that the inherent scatter of the petrophysical laws cannot be removed and the achieved k distribution remains an approximation of the reality within the limits of the accuracy of the petrophysical relations 3 2 transport simulation 3 2 1 snapshots of tracer plumes firstly we evaluate the results of the transport modeling by imaging the tracer plumes that are simulated using the different inversion results as input data for the k distribution fig 6 shows an overview of snapshots taken at a simulation time of 50 days after starting the tracer injection for the different methods and calibrations as well as point spacings arranged similarly to fig 4 the result for the original data set is given on the left side and we consider this to be the actual tracer concentration that would be observed in reality as a basis for comparison the highly permeable zones 1 5 identified in fig 4 have produced fingering tracer plumes that mostly extend as far as the center part of the domain x 6 7 m finger 2 inhibits some smaller variations due to the small scale k heterogeneities and finger 3 splits up into two thinner layers with high tracer concentration the ht results for 0 25 m and 0 5 m spacing correctly show all tracer fingers 1 5 with roughly the right extension and shape smaller features as e g the variations in finger 2 or the splitting of finger 3 however can hardly be made out with 1 m spacing the two uppermost tracer fingers disappeared due to smoothing effects and the lack of pumping locations at the very top and only the fingers 3 4 and 5 are modeled correctly using the ip inversion results for the tracer prediction correctly reproduces the fingers 1 3 and 4 with the right extension and shape some small scale features like the splitting of finger 3 are more realistic compared to ht however finger 2 gets strongly under estimated due to smoothing effects and layer 5 cannot be sensed due to the lack of quadrupoles in the lowest part of the domain with larger spacing the stronger influence of the smoothing effects becomes apparent the simulation with 1 m spacing can only reproduce the fingers 3 and 4 but they do not extend as far as they should this indicates that for cross hole ip measurements a small enough electrode spacing is crucial to obtain reliable results the tracer prediction resulting from the factor calibration shows a clear over estimation of k in the highly permeable layers with the fingers 1 3 and 4 extending too far to the right this effect is strongest for 0 25 m spacing where the plume is already extending out of the domain at this time step for the larger spacings the images are at least closer to the reality than the uncalibrated results although still somewhat over corrected the best prediction of tracer plumes is achieved by the exponential calibration for 0 25 m spacing the uncalibrated result has already been close to reality and it remains almost unchanged by the exponential calibration a stronger effect of the calibration is visible for 0 5 m spacing where the extension of the plumes is now predicted correctly for 1 m spacing the result is still quite far from reality since the calibration cannot compensate for the lack in identified structures and the strong smoothing effects even so there is a clear improvement compared to the uncalibrated result 3 2 2 tracer breakthrough curves the depth integrated relative tracer concentration over time at the central borehole x 6 m is depicted in fig 7a c the concentrations were also recorded in the right borehole x 9 m but all the main trends in the results are similar so they are not further detailed here the breakthrough curve btc for the original data set red line shows a relatively steep increase in tracer concentration within the first 150 days which is stimulated by the highly permeable layers in the aquifer layers 1 5 in figs 4 and 6 for later times we observe a much slower increase in concentration as a result of the delayed propagation in the less permeable parts as a basis for comparison we also show the btc of a hypothetical homogeneous model with k e f f 7 1 0 5 m s 1 red dashed line here we only observe a relatively quick incline of tracer concentration in the time span between 150 and 200 days however the true shape of the btc cannot be reproduced since no structural information on the sediments is processed in contrast all transport simulation results from ht and ip better approximate the true shape of the btc apparently the structural information gained from the two imaging techniques is valuable even when just looking at depth integrated btcs especially the tracer breakthrough at early times is strongly under estimated by the homogeneous model the ht results black lines are successful in reproducing the whole btc although we observe a slight under estimation of tracer breakthrough at early times and an over estimation at late times this can be interpreted as a result of smoothing effects leading to a less pronounced distinction between areas with higher or lower k it corresponds with the fact that this effect becomes stronger with increasing spacing where smoothing effects have more impact although the ip results dark blue lines correctly reproduce the general shape of the btc due to correctly retrieved structural information they strongly under estimate the tracer breakthrough within the entire time span apparently the tomograms are not accurate enough to be used for a transport simulation the exponential calibration cyan lines mainly corrects the early time behavior of the btc since only the highly permeable parts are changed by this calibration approach especially for the larger spacings 0 5 m and 1 m this brings an advantage compared to the uncalibrated result whereas for the smallest spacing 0 25 m almost no change can be observed this is in agreement with the findings for the inversion results fig 4 and the tracer plumes fig 6 for the late times the calibration does not compensate the under estimation of tracer breakthrough however this is not caused by an under estimation of k in the less permeable zones since the slope of the btc is correctly reproduced instead the extension of high k zones is underestimated due to regularization especially for large spacings and therefore the early time breakthrough reaches lower concentrations this offset remains for the whole time span and leads to an overall under prediction of tracer breakthrough the factor calibration green lines is more successful in correcting the ip results although the tracer concentration is over estimated for early times the long term behavior is correctly predicted with a quality that is at least similar to the ht results applying the k e f f value to the whole domain yields the best k prediction in terms of average values and therefore the best reproduction of the complete btc finally we assess the impact of the point spacing electrodes or pumping locations on the quality of the tracer breakthrough prediction for this purpose we pick a certain breakthrough time for all curves at the time where half of the relative concentration has been reached we calculate the difference to the breakthrough time of the original data set and call this the breakthrough delay considering it a rough measure for the error in the prediction of the btc the dependency of the delay on the spacing is shown in fig 7d for all methods we observe an increase of the delay for increasing spacing due to a lower data density and stronger smoothing effects this effect is only weakly pronounced for the ht results indicating again that the point spacing is not as crucial and relatively good results can also be achieved with fewer pumping tests on the other hand the dependency on electrode spacing of the uncalibrated ip results is very pronounced showing that a sufficiently small electrode spacing is particularly important to retrieve all the necessary structural information and gain good k estimates however acquiring cross borehole ip data with such small spacing in the field can be a very challenging task therefore we consider the calibration with hydraulic data to be valuable especially when a larger spacing has to be used and therefore important structural information is not well resolved while the exponential calibration can only slightly compensate for those problems the factor calibration is very successful in reducing the breakthrough delay here the results have a quality very similar to the ht data and the errors resulting from the large electrode spacing have been reduced significantly 4 conclusions we have shown that both ht and ip are valuable tools for imaging k heterogeneities in near surface aquifers the structural information of our test data set the bolstern aquifer analog has been reconstructed by the inversion procedures to a high degree of resolution and quantitative accuracy for the first time the distribution of k could be computed directly from the ip data with our new ip k inversion procedure and the general quality of the results is comparable to the ht travel time inversion however to achieve highly accurate k estimates that allow using the results for groundwater modeling we calibrate the results with hydraulic information after the factor calibration the depth integrated tracer btcs of the original data set could be reproduced imposing k e f f on the whole domain leads to a good prediction of the long term behavior of tracer breakthrough on the other hand the exponential calibration is more suitable to correctly predict the tracer plumes at early times therefore in practice it would be necessary to decide on one of the calibrations depending on how the data will be used later on both calibrations may not only correct regularization induced errors in k prediction but also a possible bias of the petrophysical laws that link electrical and hydrological parameters although we cannot account for the inherent scatter of the petrophysical relations we still consider those calibrations to be highly valuable tools within the processing of ip data while the structural features of an aquifer can be accurately retrieved with ip hydraulic information is essential for a reliable k quantification future research should focus on testing the suggested methodology within field experiments the new ip k inversion procedure for ip data has already been tested on borehole data fiandaca et al 2021 and 2d surface profiles from five different european countries martin et al 2021 giving k values within one decade from slug tests grain size analysis estimates however no benchmarking of the field k estimates for flow and transport modeling or tracer experiments have been conducted yet ideally future field experiments should follow a similar concept as presented in this study fig 1 conducting both ht and ip experiments at the same site would allow a direct comparison of the performance of the methods in the field furthermore the pumping tests carried out for the ht survey could provide the k e f f value needed for the ip calibrations finally the quality of the achieved k images might also be tested by tracer experiments on the other hand field campaigns with limited financial and time resources may now also rely on ip measurements alone together with one or just a few pumping tests for retrieving k e f f following the suggested calibration methodology while a full ht experiment is often very time consuming and costly ip measurements can mostly be conducted within a few hours in a setting similar to the example shown in this work therefore a detailed characterization of aquifer heterogeneities in the field might become more convenient by applying our ip k inversion procedure and the results can be expected to have a similar quality compared to ht however the two calibration approaches suggested in this work should only be regarded as a starting point in a real field environment further elaborated calibration methods might turn out to be more successful furthermore stronger data integration approaches between hydraulic and geophysical methods are expected to yield even better results while hydraulic methods are often most sensitive to preferential flow paths ip generates the strongest polarization response in areas of low k we therefore see a big potential in using the complementary sensitivities of the two methods by a stronger integration of the data ultimately a fully joint inversion of ht and ip data sets might open the door to an improved ability of imaging hydraulic conductivity in near surface aquifers credit authorship contribution statement

from micro scale rock samples often return a non zero level of asymmetry since most studies dismiss these controversial observations as numerical errors this contribution looks more closely at the physical possibility of such behaviour asymmetry of the permeability tensor which induces a rotatory flow is manifested at the micro scale by tortuous streamlines conversely when considering a larger scale above the representative elementary volume for permeability these tortuous paths do not statistically affect the flow direction any longer at this point the homogenisation of stokes flow to

thought if the boundary layer effect is disregarded graphical abstract keywords permeability tensor upscaling microct scan asymmetry data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction permeability is arguably the most important rock property to determine for subsurface energy and resources engineering applications for example in the fields of groundwater resources petroleum engineering or geothermal energy which all critically depend on the behaviour of fluid flow through porous rocks in its most generic form the permeability of an anisotropic medium is expressed as a tensor yet it has for a long time been mostly characterised by its diagonal components only defined in the oil and gas industry as horizontal and vertical permeabilities the possibility of determining its off diagonal components was only enabled much later with the development of digital rock physics see dvorkin et al 2008 blunt et al 2013 this approach allows to numerically determine the rock permeability through upscaling of the flow simulated in a representative elementary volume rev from its digitalised microstructure note that reaching rev of the permeability tensor implies convergence of each of its components every component of the tensor can be derived by imposing some flow in a specific direction and measuring the resulting effective permeability along one of the three axes this workflow provides the full permeability tensor which is necessary for modelling anisotropic flow occurring in unconventional resources for instance on top of the flow anisotropy observed in some porous media an even more remarkable aspect has sometimes been detected during the evaluation of the permeability tensor its asymmetry this was reported for instance on cross bedded reservoirs zijl and stam 1992 king 1993 fracture networks long et al 1982 sagar and runchal 1982 baghbanan and jing 2007 lang et al 2014 sedaghat et al 2019 or rock microstructures manwart et al 2002 guibert et al 2015a b thovert and mourzenko 2020 however this observation raises controversy indeed it has been shown from homogenisation theories such as those based on asymptotic expansions auriault 1991 auriault et al 2000 that the permeability defined by darcy s law has to be symmetric provided that scale separation is satisfied lasseux and valdés parada 2017 thereby the asymmetry of the permeability tensor is often regarded as a numerical error stemming from the homogenisation procedure for example guibert et al 2015a showed for a periodic synthetic porous medium that most classic boundary conditions result in permeability asymmetry for this reason numerical modellers have been developing methods to remove or at least reduce this asymmetry sanchez palencia 1982 durlofsky 1991 lang et al 2014 guibert et al 2015a gerke et al 2019 they most often amount to enforcing the assumptions underpinning homogenisation even though they may not be satisfied in reality for instance by enforcing periodicity of the numerical domain through translation or symmetrisation or by employing periodic boundary conditions note that the classical set up is meant to reproduce the experimental conditions of the experimental permeameter i e with no slip boundary conditions on the external boundaries periodic boundary conditions can either be imposed on symmetric domains or embedded subdomains the latter being a technique that embeds the domain in an equivalently permeable medium stroud 1998 guibert et al 2015a onto which periodic boundary conditions are applied in that case while periodicity is not completely ensured in the embedded subdomain asymmetry is greatly reduced guibert et al 2015a and gerke et al 2019 propose a review of these different methods enforcing periodicity in that fashion is however artificial since induced by special numerical treatments specifically gerke et al 2019 showed that these numerical schemes could not reproduce the natural conditions that would surround the rock sample considered and even alter the real flow magnitude or direction furthermore thovert and mourzenko 2020 showed that all boundary conditions only affect a finite layer at the boundary of the computational domain based on this concept the consideration of a subdomain away from this boundary layer is the safest practice to remove the artificial boundary effect going further thovert and mourzenko 2020 proved that homogenisation procedures run on such a subdomain resulted in the same permeability tensor regardless of the boundary conditions employed interestingly in that case the homogenised tensor was shown to remain asymmetric reinforcing the idea that the numerical periodicity enforced is artificial rather than looking at permeability tensor asymmetry from a numerical error perspective we propose to focus on its physical implication the flow becomes rotatory i e follows curved streamlines indeed it was derived by stokes 1851 in the context of heat conduction and reminded by truesdell 1984 p 113 that the flow due to a gradient driving force follows curved streamlines whenever the antisymmetric part of the associated diffusion tensor is non zero such rotatory flow can also directly be induced by the rotation of the porous medium whereby fictitious forces coriolis centrifugal euler appear at the pore scale the homogenisation of the latter through asymptotic expansion yields a non zero k a auriault et al 2000 a rotatory darcy flow can also occur when the microstructure lacks reflectional symmetry as conceived of by koch and brady 1987 wherein the gradient of pressure is replaced by a gradient of concentration considering the dependency of permeability on the physical length scale of interest it is common to see permeability values converge with increasing sample size as it reaches the rev at that scale when scale separation is met before diverging again when the sample size increases past the threshold marking the start of the next length scale veveakis and regenauer lieb 2015 as such permeability studies are usually confined to specific scales either focusing on the micro structure μ m rock plugs c m or fractured media h m interestingly the presence of asymmetry in the permeability tensor is already an accepted concept in hydrogeology at that larger scale like in cross bedded reservoirs or fracture networks as mentioned previously additionally some studies showed that this asymmetry vanishes when reaching the rev size long et al 1982 baghbanan and jing 2007 pouya and fouché 2009 the deviation from the classical symmetric darcy law is therefore attributed to violating the homogenisation assumptions i e scale separation and domain s periodicity or equivalently for homogenisation purposes randomness auriault 1991 at the micro scale however since permeability asymmetry has traditionally been considered as an error this type of analysis is simply missing in this contribution we propose to fill in this gap and study permeability asymmetry for porous media at the micro scale where scale separation is not guaranteed since we operate too close to the grain length scale we suggest observing the asymmetry from a new perspective away from artificial boundaries and look at the parameters of the homogenisation procedure that can influence it those parametric studies are first made for simpler porous media in section 2 then the expected theoretical behaviour is assessed on real rock microstructures in section 3 2 theoretical study grain shape including roughness has a strong influence on permeability estimation from rock microstructures beard and weyl 1973 cox and budhu 2008 torskaya et al 2013 sources of heterogeneity such as this one could also be expected to produce or increase the asymmetry of the permeability tensor in this first section we check therefore for the presence of asymmetry on simple structures where this particular feature is excluded which can only be achieved in a random close packing rcp of perfectly round spheres 2 1 material and methods in order to obtain results representative of the porous medium selected we need to consider a number of spheres in our computational domain large enough to reach the rev size of permeability using the openmc package romano et al 2015 we generate a 3d sample that contains in average 80 spheres of constant radius per direction we assume this amount to be past rev size for permeability which is verified in the following subsections in order to reduce the memory consumption of simulations on such a large sample we consider only a 2d cross section of the rcp marafini et al 2020 showed that the added flow path connectivity obtained when considering the third dimension only amounts to decreasing the size of the rev still the nature of the flow remains unchanged and a 2d analysis remains sufficient to investigate the asymmetry evolution until rev the selected slice is meshed with triangles in gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 at a given mesh resolution the cross section obtained can be observed in fig 1 with the sliced spheres appearing in white the permeability tensor is obtained from the homogenisation of stokes flow solved within the pore space of the rcp lesueur et al 2017 at the pore grain interface classic no slip boundary conditions are imposed the selection of the external boundary conditions has been shown by thovert and mourzenko 2020 not to influence the results therefore we decide to specifically enforce slip boundary conditions i e the normal component of the fluid velocity at the boundary is null on the walls to revisit a set of boundary conditions from the study of guibert et al 2015a for which the symmetry of the permeability tensor was never reached even for a periodic synthetic porous medium at rev two stokes simulations are needed to obtain every component of the permeability tensor in 2d i e one for each direction x and y indicated respectively by exponents 1 and 2 the flow is resulting from a pressure gradient imposed across the domain denoted respectively as p x 1 and p y 2 for the two simulations following notations from guibert et al 2015a the velocity field simulated with the pressure gradient p x 1 can be visualised in fig 1 for each simulation every directional component of that velocity field is averaged volumetrically denoted by providing overall the four values v x 1 v y 1 and v x 2 v y 2 similarly we also average the pressure gradient in the transversal direction from which we can extract p y 1 and p x 2 the full permeability tensor is then obtained using all these quantities by formulating darcy s law as 1 k x x k x y k y x k y y p x 1 p x 2 p y 1 p y 2 μ v x 1 v x 2 v y 1 v y 2 we note that the velocity in eq 1 refers to the superficial velocity which is obtained by multiplying the velocity field obtained with the simulation of stokes flow by the porosity for eq 1 to yield values of permeability the meshed pore space needs to be above the percolation threshold for the purpose of this study it is unnecessary to compute that threshold precisely and percolation is more simply assessed by comparing the pressure gradient on the subsample with the average value for all simulations on that sample when the pressure gradient of a sub sample is too far away from the average value percolation is deemed not to exist for each sample analysed in this work the cut off values were selected by plotting the distribution of pressure gradients for all subsamples considered which showed clear discrepancies and often a gap between the values close to the average and the extremum values by definition a permeability tensor k is asymmetric if there exists a pair of indices i j where k i j k j i in order to study the evolution of this property in digital rocks it is convenient to define a quantitative asymmetry index in this article we use the normalised asymmetry vector whose components are defined as 2 k i j k j i 2 k m e a n f o r i j the vector is normalised by k m e a n which is the mean of the diagonal components of the permeability tensor shortened to mean permeability in the rest of the paper in 2d this is a scalar for i j x y in 3d it is a vector of x y x z and y z components a scalar index can easily be derived subsequently by taking the norm of that vector for instance thovert and mourzenko 2020 defines it as i j k i j k j i 2 2 while such an index has the advantage of being a scalar that captures the magnitude of the asymmetry in any dimension we find it more convenient in our study to work with the vector itself indeed its components can be positive or negative and the sign indicates the direction towards which the flow is deviated by the rotational element in the rest of the paper for simplification the term k asymmetry will refer directly to the component s of the vector of the asymmetry of the permeability tensor as thovert and mourzenko 2020 demonstrated one should check the extent of the boundary effect in the sample to carefully select a size fraction of the computational domain on which to postprocess the results i e homogenise the permeability tensor for that purpose the permeability computed on the rcp sample presented in fig 1 normalised by the final value is plotted versus the size fraction of the computational domain considered for the homogenisation growing from the centre of the full sample in fig 2a note that the rcp is isotropic so we can plot directly the mean permeability instead of one specific diagonal component similarly to what was observed by thovert and mourzenko 2020 the permeability displays a clear change of behaviour past the consideration of a volume fraction larger than 90 after having reached a constant value a sharp increase is noticed until considering the full computational domain we can therefore confirm the existence of a boundary layer in which boundary effects can be perceived consequently we recommend like thovert and mourzenko 2020 to postprocess results on a fraction of the total computational domain for more representative results in this article we select a maximum of 90 of the domain for that same rcp sample fig 2b shows the corresponding k asymmetry which displays stronger variations than the mean permeability it even changes sign sporadically and finally fluctuates around a non zero value if this result can be trusted it would confirm the observation of k asymmetry in digital rocks and we could declare that its existence is not due to any grain shape heterogeneity as we considered an idealisation of porous media with perfectly round spheres in the following section we therefore investigate whether the k asymmetry observed can be attributed to a simple numerical error as it is commonly believed in the literature 2 2 mesh convergence it is important to differentiate the various levels of convergence involved in this study the first at the highest level refers to the physical size of the sample analysed and is used to identify the rev size i e the minimum number of spheres required in the case of a rcp for the property of interest to be representative the second level corresponds to the mesh resolution used to simulate a given sample i e to the number of numerical elements used for a fixed number of spheres in the case a rcp in the third level we regroup all the numerical parameters related to the numerical convergence of the simulator towards a solution for a fixed physical size of the sample and given mesh resolution in this contribution all simulations were run using an absolute tolerance of 1e 9 on the residual to assess convergence which ensures a satisfactory rigour level for the third level before searching for the rev size first level mesh convergence has to be established for accurate results second level the resolution of the mesh is increased directly via the length of the triangles in gmsh fig 3a shows the evolution of the mean permeability with the number of elements in the mesh we observe visually an asymptotic convergence and set the mesh convergence at 5m 5e6 elements since it falls below one percent of deviation from the value with twice as many elements in parallel fig 3b displays the evolution of the k asymmetry with the mesh convergence and shows that the k asymmetry rapidly converges to its final value in our study it is already reached below 1m elements we note that the final value obtained after removing numerical error i e after having reached mesh convergence is not null this proves that the k asymmetry is not linked to a numerical error as commonly believed 2 3 representative elementary volume having confirmed the mesh convergence we now search for the rev of permeability for the rcp the rev is obtained when the mean permeability converges to a fixed value with increasing the sampling size for this a subsample of the computational domain of fig 1 is selected at a given position in the sample properties needed to solve for eq 1 are averaged on this subsample and the full tensor of permeability is calculated the process is repeated after increasing the subsample size until it reaches the full sample size in order to improve the statistical representativeness the process is repeated from different starting positions in the sample we select growing subsamples from the centre and the four corners outside the boundary layer unfortunately an overlap of the different subsamples considered exists past a subdomain relative size of 0 45 furthermore at a subdomain size of 0 9 every subsample is the same in order to keep statistical representativeness in the study a second rcp is considered generated exactly in the same manner with a different seed another set of curves is computed and added to the existing pool from the obtained dataset the average of the mean permeability and its fluctuations range of values are plotted in fig 4a past a size of 0 2 we observe that fluctuations consistently decrease with increasing subsample size this regime corresponds to the scale of statistical rev zhang et al 2000 where the fluctuations are bounded and some interpretations can already be made eventually the rev size is obtained above a size fraction of 0 75 after which the fluctuations in magnitude are negligible the corresponding evolution of the k asymmetry is plotted in fig 4b the k asymmetry displays a behaviour similar to the mean permeability converging rapidly to a steady value which seems to be zero or is at least undeniably negligible at the scale of the non zero k asymmetry of fig 4b given the ongoing narrowing of the fluctuation cone at a size of 0 9 the rev seems not to have been reached yet but it is expected to occur soon after interestingly while we confirmed the existence of k asymmetry in porous media at the micro scale from the computation on one sample of rcp shown in fig 2 we demonstrate that the average value when considering a large number of samples is zero proving the statistical non existence of the k asymmetry in porous media this result allows to reconcile those previous observations of k asymmetry in porous media with upscaling theories where we find it verified for an rev of the porous medium note that reaching that size is also a necessary assumption for the validity of stokes flow homogenisation to darcy s law furthermore we obtain a symmetric permeability tensor for a set of boundary conditions previously shown to only produce k asymmetry guibert et al 2015a which proves that the issue is not about enforcing the periodicity with special numerical methods but instead to assess the homogenised permeability tensor away from the boundaries this result can be understood in light of the flow rotation added by the k asymmetry in a random medium such as the rcp the chances that the tortuous flow path through the structure generates a slight rotation towards either one direction or the other corresponding to either positive or negative values of the k asymmetry are equal this means that given a large enough number of samples considered the average k asymmetry should be null and that the value for a sample that comprise a statistically large number of spheres should also be null at the micro scale the rotatory character of the flow is shown by the evolution of the averaged local vorticity see fig a 8 which displays a larger amplitude at subsample sizes where k asymmetry is considerable and decreases with increasing size this illustrates intuitively the theoretical point that k asymmetry induces rotatory flow 3 application to real microstructures the previous section predicted the expected theoretical behaviour of granular porous media regarding the k asymmetry we now verify for real rocks if the natural heterogeneities mostly included within grain shape properties may change the results with this purpose in mind this section focuses on the study of real rocks digitised the process of digital rock reconstruction applied follows lesueur et al 2017 pixel data of a stack of segmented 2d microct scan images of rock is translated to a 3d structured mesh of the rock s pore space onto which flow simulations can be run we consider two samples selected on purpose at the two extremes of natural heterogeneity the first one is the lv60 a sandpack imperial college consortium on pore scale modelling 2014b shown in fig 5a sandpacks are made of real grains of sands artificially consolidated while the grains themselves present classic heterogeneities of roughness and non sphericity the little consolidation pressure does not trigger much deformation of the grains being a monomineralic material grain shape and size also remains fairly homogeneous the pore space that can be observed in the figure is entirely connected throughout as typical of sandpacks mostaghimi et al 2012 showed that the lv60 a is essentially isotropic on the other end of the spectrum we selected a c2 carbonate imperial college consortium on pore scale modelling 2014a carbonate rocks are most commonly known for their high heterogeneity and this is displayed in fig 5b grain shapes and sizes vary considerably and the pore space displays many zones of non connected porosity neighbouring large pores for these samples we perform an rev convergence analysis using the same approach described in section 2 3 we perform the simulations with a mesh size twice the resolution of the image following the recommendation of guibert et al 2015b for adequate mesh convergence similarly to the previous study we consider two spatially independent samples for statistical representativeness on each four subsamples are selected for the analysis growing from different corners namely left bottom back right top back left top front right bottom front again an overlap starts at a subdomain relative size of 0 45 which will be discussed in the interpretation of the results results for the lv60 a sandpack are plotted in fig 6 rev is globally reached past 0 8 after which the amplitude of permeability variation remains constant we note that variations of the order of 10 are still present compared to the perfect convergence of the rcp which can be explained by the natural heterogeneity of the medium the values of permeability match with the ones obtained by mostaghimi et al 2012 with a similar method where rev convergence was assessed at 1 1 mm equivalent to a subdomain size fraction of 0 75 on fig 6 the three corresponding asymmetries x y x z and y z are plotted in fig 6b when the subdomains considered are too small i e inferior to 0 1 the k asymmetry values are random because the subsamples often do not percolate however past this threshold a more regular cone of convergence is observed and each of the components reaches an rev at a final value close to zero note that the difference to zero could be an artefact due to the lack of data at high subdomain size fraction and therefore of statistical representation despite the rev value approaching zero as predicted by the rcp we note that the cone of convergence of the k asymmetry presents an amplitude five times bigger than the one of the rcp we can conclude that heterogeneities of grain shape increase the magnitude of the k asymmetry results for the c2 carbonate are plotted in fig 7 since the carbonate is not necessarily isotropic we evaluate the permeability independently in its three directions instead of considering the mean value of the tensor s diagonal components the most noticeable difference with the rcp and the sandpack is that some carbonate subsamples still do not percolate at a size fraction of 0 75 therefore a cone of convergence does not exist until then and the window remaining between 0 75 to 0 9 is at that point too small to predict any convergence still the final value of permeability obtained in the x direction matches the one from mostaghimi et al 2012 mostaghimi et al 2012 themselves did not find any rev for the sample even at a size of 1 6 mm the corresponding k asymmetry also differs from the rcp and the sandpack the k asymmetry starts to stabilise only past a size fraction of 0 5 at this point the envelope of k asymmetry values has an amplitude five times larger than the sandpack s when its k asymmetry stabilised at a size fraction of 0 3 on fig 6 the range of k asymmetry then narrows down slowly until the consideration of the full domain noting that the overlapping of subsamples past 0 7 should dissuade us from over interpreting those results indeed the final value obtained on a full domain analysis reduces down to a statistic from two samples while we can assess without a doubt that the k asymmetry average value has stabilised an rev of k asymmetry has definitely not been reached and no prediction can be made on the size of the rev interestingly the final value corresponds to 50 times the one of the sandpack and 150 times of the rcp in conclusion this analysis shows that the k asymmetry of real rocks when it exists still vanishes past the rev size yet natural heterogeneities such as grain shape and size distribution contribute to a large k asymmetry increase up to that point 4 conclusion when scale separation is not present asymmetry of the permeability tensor at the micro scale is meant to exist the physical justification lies in the fact that tortuous paths through discretised grains can randomly affect the flow direction with proper homogenisation we recover the symmetry at rev size which reconciles with upscaling theories since statistically speaking asymmetry has equal chances to produce a deviation in any direction this was demonstrated in our statistical study where the average value of asymmetry remained approximately null enveloped by a cone of convergence narrowing down to zero as it reaches the rev size we note that the rev size of asymmetry may be larger than the rev size of the diagonal components of the permeability tensor as it also depends on the off diagonal components this study puts to rest the concept that asymmetry is purely a numerical error even though individual components of the permeability tensor follow a normal mesh convergence the asymmetry itself does not necessarily decrease when numerical error is reduced even though asymmetry can be numerically reduced with finer meshes because individual components of the permeability tensor follow a normal mesh convergence its existence below rev size is natural still even with a supposedly unfavourable type of boundary conditions prescribed guibert et al 2015a we prove that the symmetry is recovered at rev size away from the boundary as thovert and mourzenko 2020 recommends based on the latter study we suggest this result holds for any type of boundary conditions as detailed in this work the existence of an anti symmetric part of the permeability tensor indicates that the domain considered may simply not satisfy scale separation and or representativeness numerical homogenisation methods trying to force the symmetry may hide the fact that either some fundamental rev assumptions behind darcy s law are not always satisfied or the boundary layer is mistakenly included as detailed in this work the existence of an anti symmetric part of the permeability tensor indicates that the domain considered may simply not satisfy scale separation and or representativeness finally the presence of natural heterogeneities in rocks such as grain shape and size was shown to drastically increase the asymmetry compared to an assemblage of perfectly round spheres however that asymmetry still vanishes past the rev size interestingly as we transition through the scales asymmetry may reappear due to the presence of new heterogeneities in the rock veveakis and regenauer lieb 2015 such as fractures as it was shown that fracture networks can produce asymmetrical permeability tensor as well credit authorship contribution statement martin lesueur conceptualization methodology software investigation writing alexandre

finite layer at the boundary of the computational domain based on this concept the consideration of a subdomain away from this boundary layer is the safest practice to remove the artificial boundary effect going further thovert and mourzenko 2020 proved that homogenisation procedures run on such a subdomain resulted in the same permeability tensor regardless of the boundary conditions employed interestingly in that case the homogenised tensor was shown to remain asymmetric reinforcing the idea that the numerical periodicity enforced is artificial rather than looking at permeability tensor asymmetry from a numerical error perspective we propose to focus on its physical implication the flow becomes rotatory i e follows curved streamlines indeed it was derived by stokes 1851 in the context of heat conduction and reminded by truesdell 1984 p 113 that the flow due to a gradient driving force follows curved streamlines whenever the antisymmetric part of the associated diffusion tensor is non zero such rotatory flow can also directly be induced by the rotation of the porous medium whereby fictitious forces coriolis centrifugal euler appear at the pore scale the homogenisation of the latter through asymptotic expansion yields a non zero k a auriault et al 2000 a rotatory darcy flow can also occur when the microstructure lacks reflectional symmetry as conceived of by koch and brady 1987 wherein the gradient of pressure is replaced by a gradient of concentration considering the dependency of permeability on the physical length scale of interest it is common to see permeability values converge with increasing sample size as it reaches the rev at that scale when scale separation is met before diverging again when the sample size increases past the threshold marking the start of the next length scale veveakis and regenauer lieb 2015 as such permeability studies are usually confined to specific scales either focusing on the micro structure μ m rock plugs c m or fractured media h m interestingly the presence of asymmetry in the permeability tensor is already an accepted concept in hydrogeology at that larger scale like in cross bedded reservoirs or fracture networks as mentioned previously additionally some studies showed that this asymmetry vanishes when reaching the rev size long et al 1982 baghbanan and jing 2007 pouya and fouché 2009 the deviation from the classical symmetric darcy law is therefore attributed to violating the homogenisation assumptions i e scale separation and domain s periodicity or equivalently for homogenisation purposes randomness auriault 1991 at the micro scale however since permeability asymmetry has traditionally been considered as an error this type of analysis is simply missing in this contribution we propose to fill in this gap and study permeability asymmetry for porous media at the micro scale where scale separation is not guaranteed since we operate too close to the grain length scale we suggest observing the asymmetry from a new perspective away from artificial boundaries and look at the parameters of the homogenisation procedure that can influence it those parametric studies are first made for simpler porous media in section 2 then the expected theoretical behaviour is assessed on real rock microstructures in section 3 2 theoretical study grain shape including roughness has a strong influence on permeability estimation from rock microstructures beard and weyl 1973 cox and budhu 2008 torskaya et al 2013 sources of heterogeneity such as this one could also be expected to produce or increase the asymmetry of the permeability tensor in this first section we check therefore for the presence of asymmetry on simple structures where this particular feature is excluded which can only be achieved in a random close packing rcp of perfectly round spheres 2 1 material and methods in order to obtain results representative of the porous medium selected we need to consider a number of spheres in our computational domain large enough to reach the rev size of permeability using the openmc package romano et al 2015 we generate a 3d sample that contains in average 80 spheres of constant radius per direction we assume this amount to be past rev size for permeability which is verified in the following subsections in order to reduce the memory consumption of simulations on such a large sample we consider only a 2d cross section of the rcp marafini et al 2020 showed that the added flow path connectivity obtained when considering the third dimension only amounts to decreasing the size of the rev still the nature of the flow remains unchanged and a 2d analysis remains sufficient to investigate the asymmetry evolution until rev the selected slice is meshed with triangles in gmsh geuzaine and remacle 2009 at a given mesh resolution the cross section obtained can be observed in fig 1 with the sliced spheres appearing in white the permeability tensor is obtained from the homogenisation of stokes flow solved within the pore space of the rcp lesueur et al 2017 at the pore grain interface classic no slip boundary conditions are imposed the selection of the external boundary conditions has been shown by thovert and mourzenko 2020 not to influence the results therefore we decide to specifically enforce slip boundary conditions i e the normal component of the fluid velocity at the boundary is null on the walls to revisit a set of boundary conditions from the study of guibert et al 2015a for which the symmetry of the permeability tensor was never reached even for a periodic synthetic porous medium at rev two stokes simulations are needed to obtain every component of the permeability tensor in 2d i e one for each direction x and y indicated respectively by exponents 1 and 2 the flow is resulting from a pressure gradient imposed across the domain denoted respectively as p x 1 and p y 2 for the two simulations following notations from guibert et al 2015a the velocity field simulated with the pressure gradient p x 1 can be visualised in fig 1 for each simulation every directional component of that velocity field is averaged volumetrically denoted by providing overall the four values v x 1 v y 1 and v x 2 v y 2 similarly we also average the pressure gradient in the transversal direction from which we can extract p y 1 and p x 2 the full permeability tensor is then obtained using all these quantities by formulating darcy s law as 1 k x x k x y k y x k y y p x 1 p x 2 p y 1 p y 2 μ v x 1 v x 2 v y 1 v y 2 we note that the velocity in eq 1 refers to the superficial velocity which is obtained by multiplying the velocity field obtained with the simulation of stokes flow by the porosity for eq 1 to yield values of permeability the meshed pore space needs to be above the percolation threshold for the purpose of this study it is unnecessary to compute that threshold precisely and percolation is more simply assessed by comparing the pressure gradient on the subsample with the average value for all simulations on that sample when the pressure gradient of a sub sample is too far away from the average value percolation is deemed not to exist for each sample analysed in this work the cut off values were selected by plotting the distribution of pressure gradients for all subsamples considered which showed clear discrepancies and often a gap between the values close to the average and the extremum values by definition a permeability tensor k is asymmetric if there exists a pair of indices i j where k i j k j i in order to study the evolution of this property in digital rocks it is convenient to define a quantitative asymmetry index in this article we use the normalised asymmetry vector whose components are defined as 2 k i j k j i 2 k m e a n f o r i j the vector is normalised by k m e a n which is the mean of the diagonal components of the permeability tensor shortened to mean permeability in the rest of the paper in 2d this is a scalar for i j x y in 3d it is a vector of x y x z and y z components a scalar index can easily be derived subsequently by taking the norm of that vector for instance thovert and mourzenko 2020 defines it as i j k i j k j i 2 2 while such an index has the advantage of being a scalar that captures the magnitude of the asymmetry in any dimension we find it more convenient in our study to work with the vector itself indeed its components can be positive or negative and the sign indicates the direction towards which the flow is deviated by the rotational element in the rest of the paper for simplification the term k asymmetry will refer directly to the component s of the vector of the asymmetry of the permeability tensor as thovert and mourzenko 2020 demonstrated one should check the extent of the boundary effect in the sample to carefully select a size fraction of the computational domain on which to postprocess the results i e homogenise the permeability tensor for that purpose the permeability computed on the rcp sample presented in fig 1 normalised by the final value is plotted versus the size fraction of the computational domain considered for the homogenisation growing from the centre of the full sample in fig 2a note that the rcp is isotropic so we can plot directly the mean permeability instead of one specific diagonal component similarly to what was observed by thovert and mourzenko 2020 the permeability displays a clear change of behaviour past the consideration of a volume fraction larger than 90 after having reached a constant value a sharp increase is noticed until considering the full computational domain we can therefore confirm the existence of a boundary layer in which boundary effects can be perceived consequently we recommend like thovert and mourzenko 2020 to postprocess results on a fraction of the total computational domain for more representative results in this article we select a maximum of 90 of the domain for that same rcp sample fig 2b shows the corresponding k asymmetry which displays stronger variations than the mean permeability it even changes sign sporadically and finally fluctuates around a non zero value if this result can be trusted it would confirm the observation of k asymmetry in digital rocks and we could declare that its existence is not due to any grain shape heterogeneity as we considered an idealisation of porous media with perfectly round spheres in the following section we therefore investigate whether the k asymmetry observed can be attributed to a simple numerical error as it is commonly believed in the literature 2 2 mesh convergence it is important to differentiate the various levels of convergence involved in this study the first at the highest level refers to the physical size of the sample analysed and is used to identify the rev size i e the minimum number of spheres required in the case of a rcp for the property of interest to be representative the second level corresponds to the mesh resolution used to simulate a given sample i e to the number of numerical elements used for a fixed number of spheres in the case a rcp in the third level we regroup all the numerical parameters related to the numerical convergence of the simulator towards a solution for a fixed physical size of the sample and given mesh resolution in this contribution all simulations were run using an absolute tolerance of 1e 9 on the residual to assess convergence which ensures a satisfactory rigour level for the third level before searching for the rev size first level mesh convergence has to be established for accurate results second level the resolution of the mesh is increased directly via the length of the triangles in gmsh fig 3a shows the evolution of the mean permeability with the number of elements in the mesh we observe visually an asymptotic convergence and set the mesh convergence at 5m 5e6 elements since it falls below one percent of deviation from the value with twice as many elements in parallel fig 3b displays the evolution of the k asymmetry with the mesh convergence and shows that the k asymmetry rapidly converges to its final value in our study it is already reached below 1m elements we note that the final value obtained after removing numerical error i e after having reached mesh convergence is not null this proves that the k asymmetry is not linked to a numerical error as commonly believed 2 3 representative elementary volume having confirmed the mesh convergence we now search for the rev of permeability for the rcp the rev is obtained when the mean permeability converges to a fixed value with increasing the sampling size for this a subsample of the computational domain of fig 1 is selected at a given position in the sample properties needed to solve for eq 1 are averaged on this subsample and the full tensor of permeability is calculated the process is repeated after increasing the subsample size until it reaches the full sample size in order to improve the statistical representativeness the process is repeated from different starting positions in the sample we select growing subsamples from the centre and the four corners outside the boundary layer unfortunately an overlap of the different subsamples considered exists past a subdomain relative size of 0 45 furthermore at a subdomain size of 0 9 every subsample is the same in order to keep statistical representativeness in the study a second rcp is considered generated exactly in the same manner with a different seed another set of curves is computed and added to the existing pool from the obtained dataset the average of the mean permeability and its fluctuations range of values are plotted in fig 4a past a size of 0 2 we observe that fluctuations consistently decrease with increasing subsample size this regime corresponds to the scale of statistical rev zhang et al 2000 where the fluctuations are bounded and some interpretations can already be made eventually the rev size is obtained above a size fraction of 0 75 after which the fluctuations in magnitude are negligible the corresponding evolution of the k asymmetry is plotted in fig 4b the k asymmetry displays a behaviour similar to the mean permeability converging rapidly to a steady value which seems to be zero or is at least undeniably negligible at the scale of the non zero k asymmetry of fig 4b given the ongoing narrowing of the fluctuation cone at a size of 0 9 the rev seems not to have been reached yet but it is expected to occur soon after interestingly while we confirmed the existence of k asymmetry in porous media at the micro scale from the computation on one sample of rcp shown in fig 2 we demonstrate that the average value when considering a large number of samples is zero proving the statistical non existence of the k asymmetry in porous media this result allows to reconcile those previous observations of k asymmetry in porous media with upscaling theories where we find it verified for an rev of the porous medium note that reaching that size is also a necessary assumption for the validity of stokes flow homogenisation to darcy s law furthermore we obtain a symmetric permeability tensor for a set of boundary conditions previously shown to only produce k asymmetry guibert et al 2015a which proves that the issue is not about enforcing the periodicity with special numerical methods but instead to assess the homogenised permeability tensor away from the boundaries this result can be understood in light of the flow rotation added by the k asymmetry in a random medium such as the rcp the chances that the tortuous flow path through the structure generates a slight rotation towards either one direction or the other corresponding to either positive or negative values of the k asymmetry are equal this means that given a large enough number of samples considered the average k asymmetry should be null and that the value for a sample that comprise a statistically large number of spheres should also be null at the micro scale the rotatory character of the flow is shown by the evolution of the averaged local vorticity see fig a 8 which displays a larger amplitude at subsample sizes where k asymmetry is considerable and decreases with increasing size this illustrates intuitively the theoretical point that k asymmetry induces rotatory flow 3 application to real microstructures the previous section predicted the expected theoretical behaviour of granular porous media regarding the k asymmetry we now verify for real rocks if the natural heterogeneities mostly included within grain shape properties may change the results with this purpose in mind this section focuses on the study of real rocks digitised the process of digital rock reconstruction applied follows lesueur et al 2017 pixel data of a stack of segmented 2d microct scan images of rock is translated to a 3d structured mesh of the rock s pore space onto which flow simulations can be run we consider two samples selected on purpose at the two extremes of natural heterogeneity the first one is the lv60 a sandpack imperial college consortium on pore scale modelling 2014b shown in fig 5a sandpacks are made of real grains of sands artificially consolidated while the grains themselves present classic heterogeneities of roughness and non sphericity the little consolidation pressure does not trigger much deformation of the grains being a monomineralic material grain shape and size also remains fairly homogeneous the pore space that can be observed in the figure is entirely connected throughout as typical of sandpacks mostaghimi et al 2012 showed that the lv60 a is essentially isotropic on the other end of the spectrum we selected a c2 carbonate imperial college consortium on pore scale modelling 2014a carbonate rocks are most commonly known for their high heterogeneity and this is displayed in fig 5b grain shapes and sizes vary considerably and the pore space displays many zones of non connected porosity neighbouring large pores for these samples we perform an rev convergence analysis using the same approach described in section 2 3 we perform the simulations with a mesh size twice the resolution of the image following the recommendation of guibert et al 2015b for adequate mesh convergence similarly to the previous study we consider two spatially independent samples for statistical representativeness on each four subsamples are selected for the analysis growing from different corners namely left bottom back right top back left top front right bottom front again an overlap starts at a subdomain relative size of 0 45 which will be discussed in the interpretation of the results results for the lv60 a sandpack are plotted in fig 6 rev is globally reached past 0 8 after which the amplitude of permeability variation remains constant we note that variations of the order of 10 are still present compared to the perfect convergence of the rcp which can be explained by the natural heterogeneity of the medium the values of permeability match with the ones obtained by mostaghimi et al 2012 with a similar method where rev convergence was assessed at 1 1 mm equivalent to a subdomain size fraction of 0 75 on fig 6 the three corresponding asymmetries x y x z and y z are plotted in fig 6b when the subdomains considered are too small i e inferior to 0 1 the k asymmetry values are random because the subsamples often do not percolate however past this threshold a more regular cone of convergence is observed and each of the components reaches an rev at a final value close to zero note that the difference to zero could be an artefact due to the lack of data at high subdomain size fraction and therefore of statistical representation despite the rev value approaching zero as predicted by the rcp we note that the cone of convergence of the k asymmetry presents an amplitude five times bigger than the one of the rcp we can conclude that heterogeneities of grain shape increase the magnitude of the k asymmetry results for the c2 carbonate are plotted in fig 7 since the carbonate is not necessarily isotropic we evaluate the permeability independently in its three directions instead of considering the mean value of the tensor s diagonal components the most noticeable difference with the rcp and the sandpack is that some carbonate subsamples still do not percolate at a size fraction of 0 75 therefore a cone of convergence does not exist until then and the window remaining between 0 75 to 0 9 is at that point too small to predict any convergence still the final value of permeability obtained in the x direction matches the one from mostaghimi et al 2012 mostaghimi et al 2012 themselves did not find any rev for the sample even at a size of 1 6 mm the corresponding k asymmetry also differs from the rcp and the sandpack the k asymmetry starts to stabilise only past a size fraction of 0 5 at this point the envelope of k asymmetry values has an amplitude five times larger than the sandpack s when its k asymmetry stabilised at a size fraction of 0 3 on fig 6 the range of k asymmetry then narrows down slowly until the consideration of the full domain noting that the overlapping of subsamples past 0 7 should dissuade us from over interpreting those results indeed the final value obtained on a full domain analysis reduces down to a statistic from two samples while we can assess without a doubt that the k asymmetry average value has stabilised an rev of k asymmetry has definitely not been reached and no prediction can be made on the size of the rev interestingly the final value corresponds to 50 times the one of the sandpack and 150 times of the rcp in conclusion this analysis shows that the k asymmetry of real rocks when it exists still vanishes past the rev size yet natural heterogeneities such as grain shape and size distribution contribute to a large k asymmetry increase up to that point 4 conclusion when scale separation is not present asymmetry of the permeability tensor at the micro scale is meant to exist the physical justification lies in the fact that tortuous paths through discretised grains can randomly affect the flow direction with proper homogenisation we recover the symmetry at rev size which reconciles with upscaling theories since statistically speaking asymmetry has equal chances to produce a deviation in any direction this was demonstrated in our statistical study where the average value of asymmetry remained approximately null enveloped by a cone of convergence narrowing down to zero as it reaches the rev size we note that the rev size of asymmetry may be larger than the rev size of the diagonal components of the permeability tensor as it also depends on the off diagonal components this study puts to rest the concept that asymmetry is purely a numerical error even though individual components of the permeability tensor follow a normal mesh convergence the asymmetry itself does not necessarily decrease when numerical error is reduced even though asymmetry can be numerically reduced with finer meshes because individual components of the permeability tensor follow a normal mesh convergence its existence below rev size is natural still even with a supposedly unfavourable type of boundary conditions prescribed guibert et al 2015a we prove that the symmetry is recovered at rev size away from the boundary as thovert and mourzenko 2020 recommends based on the latter study we suggest this result holds for any type of boundary conditions as detailed in this work the existence of an anti symmetric part of the permeability tensor indicates that the domain considered may simply not satisfy scale separation and or representativeness numerical homogenisation methods trying to force the symmetry may hide the fact that either some fundamental rev assumptions behind darcy s law are not always satisfied or the boundary layer is mistakenly included as detailed in this work the existence of an anti symmetric part of the permeability tensor indicates that the domain considered may simply not satisfy scale separation and or representativeness finally the presence of natural heterogeneities in rocks such as grain shape and size was shown to drastically increase the asymmetry compared to an assemblage of perfectly round spheres however that asymmetry still vanishes past the rev size interestingly as we transition through the scales asymmetry may reappear due to the presence of new heterogeneities in the rock veveakis and regenauer lieb 2015 such as fractures as it was shown that fracture networks can produce asymmetrical permeability tensor as well credit authorship contribution statement martin lesueur conceptualization methodology software investigation writing alexandre

past two decades global warming and climate change concerns caused by excessive carbon dioxide co2 emission owing to the abundance of fossil fuels have triggered global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric co2 haszeldine 2009 rahman et al 2017 hassanpouryouzband et al 2021 to address these environmental issues strategy of a long term sequestrating co2 in the subsurface such as in deep saline aquifers depleted oil and gas reservoirs salt unmineable coal seams and tight gas shales has been proposed and examined for its potential storage capability wang and huang 2019 bai et al 2020 from an economic perspective sequestrating co2 in oil gas bearing reservoirs while simultaneously enhancing recovery of oil and gas also referred as the carbon capture utilization and sequestration ccus technology is considered as the most attractive strategy middleton et al 2017 qin et al 2021 storing co2 in depleted or abandoned oil or gas reservoirs and utilizating it later is a highly desirable procedure as massive information and geological characterization are available at the same time the costs of capturing and treating the co2 may be reduced volatile gas prices also encourage the injection and storage of gas like methane ch4 underground to cope with the economic cycle when co2 and ch4 are pressurized in these processes the characteristics of gas phase can be converted into either a liquid or supercritical state depending on the temperature and pressure variation ranges this state change may be of great importanceto the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of co2 ch4 will which affect the injectivity storage capacity and transportation kaldi and gibson poole 2008 lu et al 2009 oh et al 2013 martinze and hesse 2016 li et al 2013 bender

et al 1989 bouchaour et al 2003 el banbi et al 2018 finney and jacobs 2019 gan and gan 2020 zhu et al 2021 under these conditions the injected fluid may be treated as pure gas but a liquid like density must be used once these critical conditions are surpassed compressed co2 and ch4 can be desirable for high sequestrating and storage capacity but the changing temperature and pressure may trigger a coupled thm response albeit bing transient that raises safety issues we emphasize that different phases change subject to various critical conditions of 100 molar of ch4 and co2 as each fig 1 may trigger significant hydraulic and thermal th property changes these changes may occur with pressure and temperature variations when gas is injected into the porous media in turn these th property changes may affect the pressure temperature perturbation and other critical conditions thus these temperature and pore pressure changes are of great concerns both for the primary storage purpose and wellbore integrity during the injection long term sequestration and post injection period pruess and garcia 2002 one may find more accurate data of ch4 and co2 from https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid leaking caused by hydraulic fracturing of a wellbore and rupturing through a caprock by shear and tensile failure has been extensively studies however it will not be the focus of in this paper shukla et al 2010 other than hydraulic and thermal properties changes fluids with different temperatures injected into a porous formation may also trigger solid skeleton deformation responses underground when heating or cooling a porous rock saturated with a fluid causes the solid skeleton and fluid inside the pores may either expand or shrink the restriction to such hydraulic and mechanical expansion or shrinkage from adjacent rigid solid material and pore volume wall may induce pore pressure and stress changes measured by a temperature change characterized in an energy conservation equation such a heating cooling process may change temporally and spatially in the vicinity of a wellbore depending on the thermal and hydraulic conditions of the porous medium which also influences the mechanical deformation of the porous skeleton thus an energy transfer process through the specific phase solid or fluid and an additional transporting component from the moving fluid inside the porous skeleton must be coupled to the entire thm system simultaneously consequently each characteristic changes in the thm system must be evaluated to study its impact on any of the thm responses the understanding of thm behaviors of fluid saturated porous rock is important in various fields of study in addition to the previously mentioned ccus and ch4 injection design including drilling and production during geothermal energy extraction bear and corapcioglu 1981 lacirignola and blanc 2013 zimmermann and reinicke 2010 goldscheider et al 2010 xu et al 2015 gao et al 2021 and in enhanced oil recovery eor processes such as steam assisted gravity drainage sagd and steam flooding of heating up a reservoir to reduce heavy oil viscosity butler and stephens 1981 irani and cokar

al 2021 forsyth and shao 1992 vidonisha et al 2016 and extraction of geothermal energy by circulating cold fluid to the surface one of the most critical parameters in the porous media that has been evaluated in the above studies is the mobility κ k μ where k is the formation permeability and μ is the fluid viscosity a formation with a low permeability but high mobility is of great interest for co2 sequestration it is also a typical characteristics of hdr on the other hand a porous formation with high permeability but low mobility is often encountered in eor processes and underground gas storage formations with different mobilities may allow different energy transporting mechanisms during injection and production i e conductive during eor a conductive convective heat transfer may dominate the energy transporting process in a high permeability rock energy is transported both with conduction over the entire bulk skeleton solid and fluid and convection carried by the mobile fluid in some circumstances whether the heat transfer process is dominated by conductive or convective mechanisms depends on the stage of the project the two mechanisms can also co exist in different phases or systems inside the media early stage steaming and injection in a heavy oil reservoir normally only allows for a conductive heat transfer inside the high permeability yet low mobility reservoirs once the steam penetrates into a high permeability formation the convective mechanism may dominate the process conductive and convective mechanisms may prevail in the rock matrix and fractured network respectively in naturally fractured formations wang et al 2021 other than the impacts mentioned above the circulation velocity heat exchange and temperature difference between the wellbore fluid and that of the saturated porous formation may also dictate both the entire energy transfer inside the formation and the heat extraction efficiency the focus of the latter one is on heat power defined by an integration of returned temperature change over time in a closed loop or open geothermal system wu et al 2012 2017 for design efficiency in an enhanced geothermal system egs various parameters such as circulating velocity v inter phase heat transfer coefficient htc hw hydraulic and thermal diffusivities c and c0 respectively are considered as the key parameters a maximized thermal energy extractedfrom the formation to the surface is highly desirable for heat extraction from the economical perspetive an minmized heat loss is preferred for steam or hot water injected downhole high steam quality and temperature of hot water must be maintained to bring down the operating cost hence a study on wellbore and temporal spatial temperature changes inside the porous formation during these operations is of great importance in theory the thermal properties of saturated porous materials and hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions applied are the key components in controlling the wellbore and formation temperature changes such a controlling process may be simulated with a model incorporating these physical parameters and boundary conditions consequently a coupled thm model and formulation was presented in this paper semi analytical solution for formations with a high and low permeabilityis developed for the high permeability case the temporal pore pressure response inside the porous media was neglected as the transient term can be much smaller as a steady state condition may be reached rapidly during injection and production the energy transport in such a formation is dominated by conductive and convective mechanisms for the low mobility case a transient fluid flow with full thm coupling was considered while only the conductive heat transfer was incorporated analytical solutions developed by several researchers are under postulations of conductive heat and hydrostatic loading with wellbore pressure flow rate and a constant well temperature change solutions for convective conductive heat transfer subject to a constant velocity and steady state fluid flow with a constant wellbore pressure and temperature change are also derived wang and dusseault 2003 the wellbore temperature at the porous formation is typically assumed to equal that inside the wellbore whereas the former is normally time dependent and timely approaching the latter all these factors are considered in thispaper and sensitivity studies will be performed by highlighting the htc and injection velocity research on non local equilibrium temperature under non hydrostatic far field loading with a constant wellbore pressure and hydraulic flux in the fractured formations is performed by li et al 2018 and wang et al 2021 will not be studied as the fluid density and viscosity may change significantly due to phase change inside a borehole and inside the porous formation owing to temperature and pressure changes particularly after the critical point of a supercritical state their implications to gas injectivity and storage capacity design have been analyzed investigations and simulations in this study are based the assumption that no chemical reaction shall take place changing the fluid pressure in different rocks will change the geochemical equilibria which can impact fluid chemistry and thus their physical properties this important subject is beyond the scope of this research and one may refer to hassanpouryouzband et al 2022 for a detailed study 2 problem description and boundary conditions in this section solutions for temperature and pore pressure in two extreme cases are addressed transient pore pressure changes in a low permeability case with conductive heat transfer and a steady state fluid flow with a constant fluid flow velocity in high permeability case with coupled conductive convective heat transfer for a cylindrical borehole subject to uniform far field stresses in an infinite medium the displacement

constant wellbore temperature the temperature at the wellbore wall under a constant flux in a saturated porous media gradually reaches the applied wellbore temperature depending on their average velocity and htc such a temperature change at the wellbore with time can disappear for a porous media with a high heat transfer coefficient fig 1 such a phenomenon can also be observed from eq 19c

wellbore temperature of 105 5 c before hydraulic fracturing were considered wang and dusseault 2003 wang and papamichos 1999 for comparison purpose with different boundary conditions in this study reservoir pore pressures of 15 and 0 mpa with corresponding wellbore pressures of 0 and 15 mpa for production and injection respectively were imposed simulating a case with an average in situ stress of 45 mpa and a wellbore reservoir temperature change of 100 c a maximum temperature change of 100 c was chosen to avoid complexity of the fluid phase change the steady state fluid flow condition imposed in the above solution apparently impairs the solution applicability fortunately in high permeability formations steady state fluid flow is usually achieved in a short of period thus the applicability impairment can be less extensive the issue of transient diffusive type stress development and important in low permeability formations will be addressed in the following section high

flux mctigue 1990 constant temperature with a constant wellbore temperature and fluid flux wang and papamichos 1994 1999 and constant fluid and heat flux zhai and atefi monfared 2020 note that all solutions mentioned above only consider conductive heat flux 4 result simulation discussions and implications to cold water circulation for energy extractions in general energy extraction or injection is critically associated with the temperature changes along the wellbore and inside the formation a schematic diagram of the simulated problem with applied boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 the solution developed under a steady state flux in eq 10 shows that the thermal conductivity thermal diffusivity inter phase heat transfer coefficient average velocity and type of applied boundary condition are all influential to the temperature perturbation and heat extraction efficiency a typical temperature change profile during production and injection is shown in fig 3 and the thm parameters used are shown in table ii in fig 3 a comparison is made between the simulation results and the case of a constant wellbore pressure the solid and dashed lines are marked with tw for constant wellbore pressure and flux for a constant velocity respectively 100 heat exchange took place between the wellbore fluid and that at the wellbore wall it is interesting to note only 80 and 68 temperature changes are found at the wellbore wall for injection and production respectively such differences between those under constant wellbore temperature and heat flux are because htc hw 0 1 w m2k was used such differences can be narrowed down as shown in fig 4 furthermore the discrepancies of the wellbore temperature change at the formation is caused by the fluid velocity vector toward and away from the wellbore convective components exists during production and injection respectively the rols and contributions of these parameters to theperformance of the wellbore formation temperature changes as well as energy transport and energy extraction are discussed in more details in the following sections inter phase heat transfer coefficient hw htc hw is a key parameter for energy transport and heat extraction subject to a constant heat flux supported by various analysis performed in previous studies few experimental works for this coefficients measured between fluid and sand particles show 2 8 and 12 16 w m2k pecker and deresiewicz 1973 jiang et al 2006 typical values ranging from 10 to 1000 w m2k nield and bejan 2006 correlations of the solid to fracture fluid heat transfer coefficient hw have been made in past research either with the nusselt number wakao and kaguei 1982 or using a capillary tube model zanotti and carbonell 1984 considering fluid circulation problem in a wellbore reservoir model hw 0 16 255 w m2k was calculated for a wellbore circulating rate of 0 14 kg s and 1 000 4 000 w m2k were used in their simulations wu et al 2012 2017 simulating fractured hdr in fenton hill and rosemanowes geothermal reservoirs by a dual porosity model gelet 2012 reported that hw for solid to fracture fluid varies between 33 and 120 w m2k which are later adjusted by gelet and khalili 2012 to become 10 19 1458 65 w m2k in their simulations from these previous investigations it is difficult to identify one specific value for each different rocks thus hw 0 1 1 000 w m2k is used in our simulations a larger hw replicates a more rapid heat exchange between two systems and a large temperature perturbation is observed on the wellbore and inside formations fig 4 no distinctions of the heat transfer process between solid and fluid is made in these previous studies hence these htc can only be considered in the average sense consequently instead identifying a data range for a specific formation the average htc may be approximated by hw ϕ hf 1 ϕ hs fig 4 shows the htc effect on temperature changes with time in a high permeability conductive convective case formation intuitively hw may dictate the wellbore temperature change whereas va dominates the heat transport process inside the porous formation such a conjecture is also supported by results in fig 5 where a higher hw corresponds to a more rapid energy exchange primarily at the wellbore in addition a higher va allows the temperature perturbationto occur further away from the wellbore due the mobile fluid penetration into the porous formations the implications of heat extraction from a geothermal formation are that the formation permeability or fluid velocity controls energy recovery rate and formation thermal sweeping degree whereas hw determines the efficiency of heat exchange or the rate for achieving local equilibrium condition between energy inside the wellbore fluid and energy from a combined energy contribution extracted from both the solid skeleton and fluid inside the solid porous skeleton although an integration of the returned wellbore temperature with time is defined as heat power and such a temperature perturbation is closely tied up with hw yet unconvincingly with other thermal parameters such as formation diffusivity and average velocity therefore a complete tubing annulus reservoir system must be established to evaluate the heat extraction efficiency for a rigorous study on energy transport its impact on pressure and conductive heat exchange and the coupling between a tubing annulus and poroelastic formations during fluid circulation one may refer to wu et al 2017 the htc characterizes the magnitude and degree of the heat exchange between contacted wellbore fluid and the saturated solid skeleton whereas the average velocity reflects the spatial and temporal locations where the perturbed energy fronts are located the heat power adsorbed or extracted from a geothermal reservoir may be defined as an integral over time of the perturbed temperature change thus a higher permeability with a large htc will eventually permit the maximum heat extraction analyzing coefficients in eq 19 we noticed the magnitude of heat transfer coefficient hw can be significantly higher than that of the average thermal diffusivity c0 thus if we only consider the first term one may obtain a solution like that by wang and dusseault 2003 where a constant wellbore temperature and pressure are assumed the proposed solution for a constant heat flux may be equivalent to that under a constant well temperature condition when the hw is much larger than both the thermal diffusivity and the average velocity i e hw becomes infinitely high so that a thermal equilibrium condition between wellbore fluid and those in porous skeleton can be reached instantaneously this can also be observed from the comparison made between results with a constant flux boundary condition with a steady state fluid flow when hw 10 w m2k and solutions from wang and dusseault 2003 as shown in fig 4 where a temperature perturbation with different hw subject to a constant heat flux is compared and validated by those under a constant wellbore temperature given a typical thermal diffusivity of 1 64 10 6 m2 sused in high permeability berea sandstone as an example kurashige 1989 the second term may produce a number with an order of magnitude of 10 5 if the same order input for ϖ and hw are taken thus no analysis and discussion on the conductive heat contribution in high permeability formation are given where convective heat transfer dominates the process in such an medium fluid velocity and permeability on convective and conductive heat transport fluid velocity and permeability are considered as a co existing factor to determine whether a convective heat transfer component may be dropped considering the coupled conductive convective heat transfer case another example using berea sandstone rice and cleary 1976 representing high permeability cases is shown in table i a the temperature perturbation as expected is profound in high permeability formations due to the convective heat transfer component in which energy is carried by the mobile fluid results from a constant bottomhole temperature and heat flux under typical thm parameters are presented in figs 3 5 representing injection and production case respectively the average velocity into a porous formation is estimated to be 10 7 10 3 m s evans et al 2009 elthword 1989 wang and papamichos 1999 sensitivity test of the velocity on temperature perturbation is shown in fig 5 while the apparent velocity may affect distance where the thermal peak front is reached inside the formation it is the htc hw that controls the equilibrium condition between the wellbore fluid temperature and those inside the formation dominating the conductive heat transfer process thermal diffusivity which is defined by λ ρc where λ ρ c are the thermal conductivity density and specific heat of the system is used for energy transport studies in low permeability formation the thermal conductivity in the water and porous rock is reported as 0 6 and 2 2 3 3 w m2k respectively morgan and west 1983 mctigue 1986 with thermal and hydraulic diffusivity ratio c c0 of 13 4 and 20 in westerly granite kurashige 1989 and mctigue 1986 1990 what suggest a thermal diffusion is lagging the hydraulic perturbation a recent study of the effective thermal conductivity etc of

medium an etc of 2 2 2 44 w m k is reported when the pore pressure varies between 2 76 and 13 79 mpa with an effective stress of 0 10 mpa etc varies between 2 20 and 4 15 w m k when temperature change from 10 to 10 c farahani et al 2020 due to a lagging between the thermal and hydraulic diffusion and the difference in thermal conductivity a temperature difference between the solid and fluid at each representative element volume rev exists although in theory either the thermal properties or the transporting mechanisms along the porous solid skeleton and the mobile fluid can be significantly different an overall thermal conductivity on the bulk porous skeleton and fluid inside can be assumed in practice in addition to postulating an average thermal conductivity and local thermal equilibrium the characteristics of thm coupling in low permeability formation is that the energy transport is assumed to be independent of those hm coupling the thermal effect however is coupled in both hydraulic tem and the mechanical responses in most of the previous studies in a high permeability formation the hydraulic conveyed energy contribution convective in the porous rock may not be negligible the convective process of the saturated porous medium may take place with the moving fluid unlike the coupling process in a low permeability formation the hydraulic system is replicated as a drained process so that neither thermal nor mechanical responses affect the hydraulic responses whether a solution developed under a conductive heat transport assumption can be applied to the medium depends on the magnitude of the average fluid velocity through the porous formation which is measured by the peclet number the peclet number is a dimensionless number relating the rate of forced convection over thermal diffusion for a specific fluid which is defined as lva c0 where l va c0 are the characteristic length scale of pore size and average pore velocity and thermal diffusivity respectively gelet 2012 the study also emphasizes that a rock with very tight structure possesses extreme low pore size thus having a small peclet number whereas a naturally or stimulated heavily fractured formation may have a much high peclet number therefore in a high permeable formation the convective heat transfer mechanism can be the key component over the entire heat transfer process considering a general energy equation through a saturated porous medium both conductive and convective heat transport components must be incorporated into the conservation equation when the peclet number is high comparing the convective component to the conductive term by normalizing the temperature changes peclet number which is also defined as pe vt c0δt kurashige 1989 wang and papamichos

mctigue 1986 karashige 1989 wang and papamichos 1999 gelet 2012 the dimensionless apparent velocity n defined in eq 13 varies from 1 8 10 3 3 88 and n 2 4 6 is used in the simulations correspond to average fluid velocities of 8 93 10 3 1 41x x10 2 and 1 95 10 2 m s respectively as expected a high fluid velocity allows more cold hot energy transporting into a formation wellbore for an injecting producing process fig 5 from the boundary conditions eq 19 a sign change can be made for the average velocities correlating production and injection processes for the same fluid velocity different temperature profile may be produced during production and injection respectively this is because flow towards a wellbore occurs during production whereas the flow is away from the wellbore during injection as explained earlier a slower temperature change at the wellbore during production shown in fig 3 is interpreted as a process of formation energy carried by toward wellbore fluid flow similarly a sharper temperature decline during injection is due to the fact that of a cold water flow may transport colder energy into the formation figs 3 and 5 thermal conductivity effect on temperature changes the ultimate parameters defining the heat transport through the porous media are the convective coefficient k ϕ and the thermal diffusivity c0 λ ρcp where λ ρ and cp are the thermal conductivity density and specific heat of the medium respectively consider heat conduction the thermal diffusivities from variety of rocks and fluid are significantly different varying between 10 6 to 10 12 m2 s kurashige 1989 mctigue 1990 gelet 2012 although the conductive heat transfer may dominate the energy transport process in a low permeability formation its contribution to a temperature change may be minimum in high permeability sandstone or along the natural fracture channels particularly under a higher heat transfer coefficient i e hw 10 w m2 k this is shown in the

near the wellbore is noticeable the justification of boundary conditions and their effects on the temperature perturbation three types of boundary conditions are commonly applied in simulations among them solutions of a constant pressure or temperature change the dirichlet 1st type boundary condition were developed in the past and therefore will only be used for comparison purposes mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 wang and papamichos 1994 wang 1998 wang and dusseault 2003 this type of boundary condition is commonly applied for drilling and injection with an unchanged wellbore pressure or temperature alternatively while simulating a constant pumping or producing case a neumann 2nd type boundary condition with a constant hydraulic heat flux is utilized wang and papamichos 1999 zhai and atefi monfared 2020 mctigue 1990 following carslaw and jaeger 1959 a third type called a cauchy robin boundary condition involves both the primary variable and derivative in this study for a high permeability formation a modified cauchy robin type boundary condition similar to the classic is applied for temperature calculations a constant heat flux equals to the combined energy components from a constant fluid velocity and a temperature difference between the fluid temperature inside a wellbore and that at the wall of the porous formation instead of a typical cauchy robin type boundary condition 3rd type for the temperature change a constant heat flux defined proportional to a fixed wellbore fluid temperature is applied therefore both conductive and convective energy transfer contributions from the boundary through the wellbore into the formation are incorporated this shown in eqs 10 and 51 for conductive convective case and conductive cases corresponding to media with high and low permeability respectively eq 10 may be simplified into eq 51 if a zero hydraulic flux or velocity is assumed the justifications for the modified cauchy robin type boundary for the high permeability case are that i the thermal energy may be transmitted through a wellbore wall via both the moving fluid and contacted solid skeleton and fluid through conduction wu et al 2017 ii the conductive component is also required to be defined at the wellbore boundary unlike the situations from literatures mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 wang 1994 and papamichos 1999 the temperature on the solid skeleton and pore fluid right at the wellbore wall may change gradually with time solutions with a similar boundary condition considering conductive heat flow only are provided in zhai and atefi monfared 2020 and whether the energy equilibrium condition between wellbore and formation temperature can be reached the time duration required depends on the htc hw for example the maximum temperature during injection is only 68 ofthe maximum temperature in the wellbore fluid yet approximately 100 when hw 10 w m2 k fig 4 different boundary conditions can be defined for different physical situations a constant wellbore temperature case is normally replicated for an injection with a constant fluid temperature i e hydraulic fracturing process a constant heat flux condition with a conductive or combined convective conductive heat transfer considered may be applicable for fluid circulation in low permeability and high permeability cases respectively although the temperature change near the wellbore is believed to be primarily associated with wellbore conditions the size of the external radius and thermal conditions applied can also affect the results this can be observed from the sensitivity analysis for different velocities in fig 5 they are also defined in the boundary condition and the corresponding solutions eqs 10 28 40 42 temperature pressure changes and implications to co2 ch4 storage and injectivity although no nonlinear hydraulic and thermal properties change of co2 ch4 under different temperatures and pressures are characterized we emphasize a solution with coupled nonlinear effects on density thermal conductivity and viscosity as it is essential for co2 ch4 injectivity and storage capacity design a gaseous viscosity but liquid like density of supercritical co2 allows a higher injectivity which permits a high storage efficiency yet a drastic increase on storage capacity underground once the critical point t 31 1 c p 7 38 mpa is surpassed density changes inside a wellbore have been widely studied fig 7 shows two examples based on data from kaldi and gibson poole 2008 and pruess and garcia 2002 navy blue blue and red solid dashed lines represent the density viscosity change with depth of ch4 water and co2 respectively a cube with different numbers assuming the volume at the surface is 100 represents the volume change of co2 at different depths the co2 density at a standard atmospheric condition is 1 78 kg m3 whereas its supercritical density ranges between 150 800 kg m3 between 84 27 449 43 times of that at the standard condition lower temperature and pressure are required for ch4 to reach the supercritical condition and densities of 0 544 77 44 and 1 495 217 7 kg m3 for ch4 and co2 are reported for temperature of 3 57 c under pressures of 0 1 10 mpa higgoda et al 2019 such a density change implies that a volume of 100 m3 co2 at the surface only occupies 0 27 m3 at a depth of 2 000 m the aforementioned studies of depth are not as common at the vicinity of a wellbore inside a porous formation since it is more complicated we used a schematic diagram to display the conceptual characteristics of density pressure and temperature change in the vicinity of a wellbore during injection and production of co2 fig 8 as indicated in fig 8a gas in a supercritical state may exist inside formation away from the wellbore once the well pressure and temperature are below the supercritical conditions which may be maintained in the vicinity of the wellbore for injection when the injection pressure temperature are above the supercritical condition fig 8 b we emphasize htat quantitative and accurate calculations on density temperature and pressure distribution are critically important for the determination of the th property changes of co2 and their corresponding impacts on mechanical responses which are crucial for co2 sequestration and ch4 storage design additional research on the effects of these property changes on the injectivity capacity and safety of co2 ch4 are recommended in the future 5 summary and conclusions in summary we developed closed form solutions for temperature perturbation on and near a cylindrical wellbore subject to a constant heat flux under a steady state fluid flow condition in high permeability formations with conductive convective heat transfer calculated results were compared to those with a constant wellbore temperature and such comparisons were extended to temperature perturbation near a cylindrical wellbore subject to a constant heat flux and a constant bottomhole pressure in low permeability formation where only a conductive heat transfer was considered unlike the results from a constant wellbore fluid temperature case depending on the overall inter phase htc between the wellbore fluid to those from the fluid inside a porous rock and the solid skeleton itself the temperature at the wellbore wall may change gradually to reach the stable condition such a coefficient dictates the heat exchange process both at the wellbore wall and inside formation only 68 wellbore wall temperature change is allowed when hw 0 1 w m2k the average mobile fluid velocity can dominate the thermal front radius in a high permeability formation when the peclet number is larger than 0 1 depending on the thermal diffusivity and formation mobility ratio although a high hw may allow for rapid heat exchange at the wellbore wall in a low permeability formation heat transfer via conductive mechanism alone may not permit an efficient heat transfer thus having a slower heat exchange and energy transfer can be expected in addition to the co2 sequestration and ch2 storage design applications the energy recovery rate and extraction or losses may be evaluated by the proposed solution before a heat extraction and egs can be designed and developed we concluded the following 1 a conductive heat flow may be assumed and coupled to a fluid flow in low permeability formation and different mechanical and pore pressure responses are expected depending on the applied boundary condition a conductive convective heat flow must be coupled for temperature change and thm responses in a high permeability formation when the peclet number is 0 1 2 the thermal conductivity and diffusivity ratio of the formation are conventionally used to characterize porous rocks under non isothermal conditions and may dominate the energy transport processes in a low permeability formation on the other hand htc average fluid flow velocity and thm boundary conditions applied to a wellbore are the major factors that control the energy transport process change the temperature perturbation and determine the thm response 3 different thermal boundary conditions applied at a wellbore may affect the wellbore and formation temperature change and thus the heat extraction efficiency temperature changes with time at the wellbore wall of the formation must be considered and corresponding boundary must be defined 4 the temperature and pore pressure perturbations in the vicinity of a wellbore may change the ch4 co2 phase and their th properties significantly the implication of such changes is that both hydraulic mass and thermal energy transport process will be affected significantly and eventually impacting the safety design and economic evaluation of gas

past two decades global warming and climate change concerns caused by excessive carbon dioxide co2 emission owing to the abundance of fossil fuels have triggered global efforts to reduce the concentration of atmospheric co2 haszeldine 2009 rahman et al 2017 hassanpouryouzband et al 2021 to address these environmental issues strategy of a long term sequestrating co2 in the subsurface such as in deep saline aquifers depleted oil and gas reservoirs salt unmineable coal seams and tight gas shales has been proposed and examined for its potential storage capability wang and huang 2019 bai et al 2020 from an economic perspective sequestrating co2 in oil gas bearing reservoirs while simultaneously enhancing recovery of oil and gas also referred as the carbon capture utilization and sequestration ccus technology is considered as the most attractive strategy middleton et al 2017 qin et al 2021 storing co2 in depleted or abandoned oil or gas reservoirs and utilizating it later is a highly desirable procedure as massive information and geological characterization are available at the same time the costs of capturing and treating the co2 may be reduced volatile gas prices also encourage the injection and storage of gas like methane ch4 underground to cope with the economic cycle when co2 and ch4 are pressurized in these processes the characteristics of gas phase can be converted into either a liquid or supercritical state depending on the temperature and pressure variation ranges this state change may be of great importanceto the thermal and hydraulic characteristics of co2 ch4 will which affect the injectivity storage capacity and transportation kaldi and gibson poole 2008 lu et al 2009 oh et al 2013 martinze and hesse 2016 li et al 2013 bender and akin 2017 kim et al 2019 as shown in fig 1 b and c a temperature pressure of 31 1 c 7 39 mpa and 82 c 4 64 mpa are required for co2 and ch4 respectively to reach the supercritical condition friend et al 1989 bouchaour et al 2003 el banbi et al 2018 finney and jacobs 2019 gan and gan 2020 zhu et al 2021 under these conditions the injected fluid may be treated as pure gas but a liquid like density must be used once these critical conditions are surpassed compressed co2 and ch4 can be desirable for high sequestrating and storage capacity but the changing temperature and pressure may trigger a coupled thm response albeit bing transient that raises safety issues we emphasize that different phases change subject to various critical conditions of 100 molar of ch4 and co2 as each fig 1 may trigger significant hydraulic and thermal th property changes these changes may occur with pressure and temperature variations when gas is injected into the porous media in turn these th property changes may affect the pressure temperature perturbation and other critical conditions thus these temperature and pore pressure changes are of great concerns both for the primary storage purpose and wellbore integrity during the injection long term sequestration and post injection period pruess and garcia 2002 one may find more accurate data of ch4 and co2 from https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid leaking caused by hydraulic fracturing of a wellbore and rupturing through a caprock by shear and tensile failure has been extensively studies however it will not be the focus of in this paper shukla et al 2010 other than hydraulic and thermal properties changes fluids with different temperatures injected into a porous formation may also trigger solid skeleton deformation responses underground when heating or cooling a porous rock saturated with a fluid causes the solid skeleton and fluid inside the pores may either expand or shrink the restriction to such hydraulic and mechanical expansion or shrinkage from adjacent rigid solid material and pore volume wall may induce pore pressure and stress changes measured by a temperature change characterized in an energy conservation equation such a heating cooling process may change temporally and spatially in the vicinity of a wellbore depending on the thermal and hydraulic conditions of the porous medium which also influences the mechanical deformation of the porous skeleton thus an energy transfer process through the specific phase solid or fluid and an additional transporting component from the moving fluid inside the porous skeleton must be coupled to the entire thm system simultaneously consequently each characteristic changes in the thm system must be evaluated to study its impact on any of the thm responses the understanding of thm behaviors of fluid saturated porous rock is important in various fields of study in addition to the previously mentioned ccus and ch4 injection design including drilling and production during geothermal energy extraction bear and corapcioglu 1981 lacirignola and blanc 2013 zimmermann and reinicke 2010 goldscheider et al 2010 xu et al 2015 gao et al 2021 and in enhanced oil recovery eor processes such as steam assisted gravity drainage sagd and steam flooding of heating up a reservoir to reduce heavy oil viscosity butler and stephens 1981 irani and cokar 2016 chen et al 2020 other applications include frictional heating and fault reactivation rutledge et al 2004 gana and lei 2020 nuclear waste disposal in which the interaction of heat producing canisters with surrounding repository rocks is the prime concern mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 rutqvist 2020 cleanup of contaminant site remediation through flushing out dissolving hazard solutes tao et al 2021 forsyth and shao 1992 vidonisha et al 2016 and extraction of geothermal energy by circulating cold fluid to the surface one of the most critical parameters in the porous media that has been evaluated in the above studies is the mobility κ k μ where k is the formation permeability and μ is the fluid viscosity a formation with a low permeability but high mobility is of great interest for co2 sequestration it is also a typical characteristics of hdr on the other hand a porous formation with high permeability but low mobility is often encountered in eor processes and underground gas storage formations with different mobilities may allow different energy transporting mechanisms during injection and production i e conductive during eor a conductive convective heat transfer may dominate the energy transporting process in a high permeability rock energy is transported both with conduction over the entire bulk skeleton solid and fluid and convection carried by the mobile fluid in some circumstances whether the heat transfer process is dominated by conductive or convective mechanisms depends on the stage of the project the two mechanisms can also co exist in different phases or systems inside the media early stage steaming and injection in a heavy oil reservoir normally only allows for a conductive heat transfer inside the high permeability yet low mobility reservoirs once the steam penetrates into a high permeability formation the convective mechanism may dominate the process conductive and convective mechanisms may prevail in the rock matrix and fractured network respectively in naturally fractured formations wang et al 2021 other than the impacts mentioned above the circulation velocity heat exchange and temperature difference between the wellbore fluid and that of the saturated porous formation may also dictate both the entire energy transfer inside the formation and the heat extraction efficiency the focus of the latter one is on heat power defined by an integration of returned temperature change over time in a closed loop or open geothermal system wu et al 2012 2017 for design efficiency in an enhanced geothermal system egs various parameters such as circulating velocity v inter phase heat transfer coefficient htc hw hydraulic and thermal diffusivities c and c0 respectively are considered as the key parameters a maximized thermal energy extractedfrom the formation to the surface is highly desirable for heat extraction from the economical perspetive an minmized heat loss is preferred for steam or hot water injected downhole high steam quality and temperature of hot water must be maintained to bring down the operating cost hence a study on wellbore and temporal spatial temperature changes inside the porous formation during these operations is of great importance in theory the thermal properties of saturated porous materials and hydraulic and thermal boundary conditions applied are the key components in controlling the wellbore and formation temperature changes such a controlling process may be simulated with a model incorporating these physical parameters and boundary conditions consequently a coupled thm model and formulation was presented in this paper semi analytical solution for formations with a high and low permeabilityis developed for the high permeability case the temporal pore pressure response inside the porous media was neglected as the transient term can be much smaller as a steady state condition may be reached rapidly during injection and production the energy transport in such a formation is dominated by conductive and convective mechanisms for the low mobility case a transient fluid flow with full thm coupling was considered while only the conductive heat transfer was incorporated analytical solutions developed by several researchers are under postulations of conductive heat and hydrostatic loading with wellbore pressure flow rate and a constant well temperature change solutions for convective conductive heat transfer subject to a constant velocity and steady state fluid flow with a constant wellbore pressure and temperature change are also derived wang and dusseault 2003 the wellbore temperature at the porous formation is typically assumed to equal that inside the wellbore whereas the former is normally time dependent and timely approaching the latter all these factors are considered in thispaper and sensitivity studies will be performed by highlighting the htc and injection velocity research on non local equilibrium temperature under non hydrostatic far field loading with a constant wellbore pressure and hydraulic flux in the fractured formations is performed by li et al 2018 and wang et al 2021 will not be studied as the fluid density and viscosity may change significantly due to phase change inside a borehole and inside the porous formation owing to temperature and pressure changes particularly after the critical point of a supercritical state their implications to gas injectivity and storage capacity design have been analyzed investigations and simulations in this study are based the assumption that no chemical reaction shall take place changing the fluid pressure in different rocks will change the geochemical equilibria which can impact fluid chemistry and thus their physical properties this important subject is beyond the scope of this research and one may refer to hassanpouryouzband et al 2022 for a detailed study 2 problem description and boundary conditions in this section solutions for temperature and pore pressure in two extreme cases are addressed transient pore pressure changes in a low permeability case with conductive heat transfer and a steady state fluid flow with a constant fluid flow velocity in high permeability case with coupled conductive convective heat transfer for a cylindrical borehole subject to uniform far field stresses in an infinite medium the displacement

1986 1990 eq 2 can be decoupled if one considers either convective condutive or conductive transport most previous coupled solutions for energy transport were developed based on this approximation but are suitable for conductive heat mechanisms only a solution for stresses and heat flow with convective heat transport is the focus of the following calculations for a borehole with radius a and external radius b in a porous medium assuming constant bottomhole pressure change pw and fixed wellbore temperature tw initial and boundary conditions may be written as follows 10 t r 0 p r 0 σ r r r

are the fluid and solid respectively considering the boundary condition of temperature change in the wellbore the terms at lhs eq 10 represent the heat conduction the terms at the rhs demonstrate temperature difference between wellbore fluid temperature and the average temperature at the porous skeleton if we distinguish those conductive heat components from those in the solid skeleton and fluid inside the porous medium we may extend those in eq 10 in terms of individual phases which will be addressed elsewhere depending on thermal and hydraulic conditions the sign for the conductive and convective terms are associated with cold fluid injected or warm fluid produced for example the sign is positive for cold fluid production yet negative for warm fluid injection solutions subject to these conditions represent the changes in temperature and pore pressure the stresses calculated from the solutions presented here can be superimposed to stresses from solutions that account for pre existing and non hydrostatic in situ stresses pore pressure and temperature fields allowing complete analysis kurashige 1989 mctigue 1986 wang and papamichos 1994 wang and dusseault 2003 3 conductive and convective heat flow solution for intermediate permeability reservoirs with a steady state fluid flow excluding certain cases it is difficult to solve eq 2 analytically two typical assumptions are

13 r x c o s where s and v are the laplace operator and average fluid velocity respectively applying the laplace transformation with respect to time the above equation may be transformed into the modified hyperbolic the bessel differential equation is as follows 14 x 2 d 2 s d x 2 x d s d x x 2 n 2 s 0 where the dimensionless apparent velocity is as follows 15 n ϖ 2 2 ϖ v a 2 c 0 2 v a c 0 16 v 2 c 0 a 1 1 n 2 the average velocity v can be positive or negative depending on whether it is an injecting negative or producing positive process on the other hand the apparent average velocity n remains positive and is a parameter that reflects the contribution of convective heat component in the entire heat transport process from a wellbore in the porous media the solution for eq 15 may be obtained as follows 17 s a s i n x b s k n x where in x and kn x are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind of order n for a case with a finite external boundary and using the

constant wellbore temperature the temperature at the wellbore wall under a constant flux in a saturated porous media gradually reaches the applied wellbore temperature depending on their average

wellbore temperature of 105 5 c before hydraulic fracturing were considered wang and dusseault 2003 wang and papamichos 1999 for comparison purpose with different boundary conditions in this study reservoir pore pressures of 15 and 0 mpa with corresponding wellbore pressures of 0 and 15 mpa for production and injection respectively were imposed simulating a case with an average in situ stress of 45 mpa and a wellbore reservoir temperature change of 100 c a maximum temperature change of 100 c was chosen to avoid complexity of the fluid phase change the steady state fluid flow condition imposed in the above solution apparently impairs the solution applicability fortunately in high permeability formations steady state fluid flow is usually achieved in a short of period thus the applicability impairment can be less extensive the issue of transient diffusive type stress development and important in low permeability formations will be addressed in the following section high

constant bottomhole pressure and heat flux one may also refer to those solutions that are subject to various boundary conditions from previous works such as constant wellbore pressure with zero heat flux mctigue 1990 constant temperature with a constant wellbore temperature and fluid flux wang and papamichos 1994 1999 and constant fluid and heat flux zhai and atefi monfared 2020 note that all solutions mentioned above only consider conductive heat flux 4 result simulation discussions and implications to cold water circulation for energy extractions in general energy extraction or injection is critically associated with the temperature changes along the wellbore and inside the formation a schematic diagram of the simulated problem with applied boundary conditions is shown in fig 2 the solution developed under a steady state flux in eq 10 shows that the thermal conductivity thermal diffusivity inter phase heat transfer coefficient average velocity and type of applied boundary condition are all influential to the temperature perturbation and heat extraction efficiency a typical temperature change profile during production and injection is shown in fig 3 and the thm parameters used are shown in table ii in fig 3 a comparison is made between the simulation results and the case of a constant wellbore pressure the solid and dashed lines are marked with tw for constant wellbore pressure and flux for a constant velocity respectively 100 heat exchange took place between the wellbore fluid and that at the wellbore wall it is interesting to note only 80 and 68 temperature changes are found at the wellbore wall for injection and production respectively such differences between those under constant wellbore temperature and heat flux are because htc hw 0 1 w m2k was used such differences can be narrowed down as shown in fig 4 furthermore the discrepancies of the wellbore temperature change at the formation is caused by the fluid velocity vector toward and away from the wellbore convective components exists during production and injection respectively the rols and contributions of these parameters to theperformance of the wellbore formation temperature changes as well as energy transport and energy extraction are discussed in more details in the following sections inter phase heat transfer coefficient hw htc hw is a key parameter for energy transport and heat extraction subject to a constant heat flux supported by various analysis performed in previous studies few experimental works for this coefficients measured between fluid and sand particles show 2 8 and 12 16 w m2k pecker and deresiewicz 1973 jiang et al 2006 typical values ranging from 10 to 1000 w m2k nield and bejan 2006 correlations of the solid to fracture fluid heat transfer coefficient hw have been made in past research either with the nusselt number wakao and kaguei 1982 or using a capillary tube model zanotti and carbonell 1984 considering fluid circulation problem in a wellbore reservoir model hw 0 16 255 w m2k was calculated for a wellbore circulating rate of 0 14 kg s and 1 000 4 000 w m2k were used in their simulations wu et al 2012 2017 simulating fractured hdr in fenton hill and rosemanowes geothermal reservoirs by a dual porosity model gelet 2012 reported that hw for solid to fracture fluid varies between 33 and 120 w m2k which are later adjusted by gelet and khalili 2012 to become 10 19 1458 65 w m2k in their simulations from these previous investigations it is difficult to identify one specific value for each different rocks thus hw 0 1 1 000 w m2k is used in our simulations a larger hw replicates a more rapid heat exchange between two systems and a large temperature perturbation is observed on the wellbore and inside formations fig 4 no distinctions of the heat transfer process between solid and fluid is made in these previous studies hence these htc can only be considered in the average sense consequently instead identifying a data range for a specific formation the average htc may be approximated by hw ϕ hf 1 ϕ hs fig 4 shows the htc effect on temperature changes with time in a high permeability conductive convective case formation intuitively hw may dictate the wellbore temperature change whereas va dominates the heat transport process inside the porous formation such a conjecture is also supported by results in fig 5 where a higher hw corresponds to a more rapid energy exchange primarily at the wellbore in addition a higher va allows the temperature perturbationto occur further away from the wellbore due the mobile fluid penetration into the porous formations the implications of heat extraction from a geothermal formation are that the formation permeability or fluid velocity controls energy recovery rate and formation thermal sweeping degree whereas hw determines the efficiency of heat exchange or the rate for achieving local equilibrium condition between energy inside the wellbore fluid and energy from a combined energy contribution extracted from both the solid skeleton and fluid inside the solid porous skeleton although an integration of the returned wellbore temperature with time is defined as heat power and such a temperature perturbation is closely tied up with hw yet unconvincingly with other thermal parameters such as formation diffusivity and average velocity therefore a complete tubing annulus reservoir system must be established to evaluate the heat extraction efficiency for a rigorous study on energy transport its impact on pressure and conductive heat exchange and the coupling between a tubing annulus and poroelastic formations during fluid circulation one may refer to wu et al 2017 the htc characterizes the magnitude and degree of the heat exchange between contacted wellbore fluid and the saturated solid skeleton whereas the average velocity reflects the spatial and temporal locations where the perturbed energy fronts are located the heat power adsorbed or extracted from a geothermal reservoir may be defined as an integral over time of the perturbed temperature change thus a higher permeability with a large htc will eventually permit the maximum heat extraction analyzing coefficients in eq 19 we noticed the magnitude of heat transfer coefficient hw can be significantly higher than that of the average thermal diffusivity c0 thus if we only consider the first term one may obtain a solution like that by wang and dusseault 2003 where a constant wellbore temperature and pressure are assumed the proposed solution for a constant heat flux may be equivalent to that under a constant well temperature condition when the hw is much larger than both the thermal diffusivity and the average velocity i e hw becomes infinitely high so that a thermal equilibrium condition between wellbore fluid and those in porous skeleton can be reached instantaneously this can also be observed from the comparison made between results with a constant flux boundary condition with a steady state fluid flow when hw 10 w m2k and solutions from wang and dusseault 2003 as shown in fig 4 where a temperature perturbation with different hw subject to a constant heat flux is compared and validated by those under a constant wellbore temperature given a typical thermal diffusivity of 1 64 10 6 m2 sused in high permeability berea sandstone as an example kurashige 1989 the second term may produce a number with an order of magnitude of 10 5 if the same order input for ϖ and hw are taken thus no analysis and discussion on the conductive heat contribution in high permeability formation are given where convective heat transfer dominates the process in such an medium fluid velocity and permeability on convective and conductive heat transport fluid velocity and permeability are considered as a co existing factor to determine whether a convective heat transfer component may be dropped considering the coupled conductive convective heat transfer case another example using berea sandstone rice and cleary 1976 representing high permeability cases is shown in table i a the temperature perturbation as expected is profound in high permeability formations due to the convective heat transfer component in which energy is carried by the mobile fluid results from a constant bottomhole temperature and heat flux under typical thm parameters are presented in figs 3 5 representing injection and production case respectively the average velocity into a porous formation is estimated to be 10 7 10 3 m s evans et al 2009 elthword 1989 wang and papamichos 1999 sensitivity test of the velocity on temperature perturbation is shown in fig 5 while the apparent velocity may affect distance where the thermal peak front is reached inside the formation it is the htc hw that controls the equilibrium condition between the wellbore fluid temperature and those inside the formation dominating the conductive heat transfer process thermal diffusivity which is defined by λ ρc where λ ρ c are the thermal conductivity density and specific heat of the system is used for energy transport studies in low permeability formation the thermal conductivity in the water and porous rock is reported as 0 6 and 2 2 3 3 w m2k respectively morgan and west 1983 mctigue 1986 with thermal and hydraulic diffusivity ratio c c0 of 13 4 and 20 in westerly granite kurashige 1989 and mctigue 1986 1990 what suggest a thermal diffusion is lagging the hydraulic perturbation a recent study of the effective thermal conductivity etc of sand grain reported to be 6 86 w m k yet the etc varies with the pore pressure effective overburden stress temperature change saturation and pore structure in either a saturated or unsaturated porous medium an etc of 2 2 2 44 w m k is reported when the pore pressure varies between 2 76 and 13 79 mpa with an effective stress of 0 10 mpa etc varies between 2 20 and 4 15 w m k when temperature change from 10 to 10 c farahani et al 2020 due to a lagging between the thermal and hydraulic diffusion and the difference in thermal conductivity a temperature difference between the solid and fluid at each representative element volume rev exists although in theory either the thermal properties or the transporting mechanisms along the porous solid skeleton and the mobile fluid can be significantly different an overall thermal conductivity on the bulk porous skeleton and fluid inside can be assumed in practice in addition to postulating an average thermal conductivity and local thermal equilibrium the characteristics of thm coupling in low permeability formation is that the energy transport is assumed to be independent of those hm coupling the thermal effect however is coupled in both hydraulic tem and the mechanical responses in most of the previous studies in a high permeability formation the hydraulic conveyed energy contribution convective in the porous rock may not be negligible the convective process of the saturated porous medium may take place with the moving fluid unlike the coupling process in a low permeability formation the hydraulic system is replicated as a drained process so that neither thermal nor mechanical responses affect the hydraulic responses whether a solution developed under a conductive heat transport assumption can be applied to the medium depends on the magnitude of the average fluid velocity through the porous formation which is measured by the peclet number the peclet number is a dimensionless number relating the rate of forced convection over thermal diffusion for a specific fluid which is defined as lva c0 where l va c0 are the characteristic length scale of pore size and average pore velocity and thermal diffusivity respectively gelet 2012 the study also emphasizes that a rock with very tight structure possesses extreme low pore size thus having a small peclet number whereas a naturally or stimulated heavily fractured formation may have a much high peclet number therefore in a high permeable formation the convective heat transfer mechanism can be the key component over the entire heat transfer process considering a general energy equation through a saturated porous medium both conductive and convective heat transport components must be incorporated into the conservation equation when the peclet number is high comparing the convective component to the conductive term by normalizing the temperature changes peclet number which is also defined as pe vt c0δt kurashige 1989 wang and papamichos 1999 the thm responses of a borehole and coupling effects are the major focus the associated thermal data are listed in table i rice and cleary 1976 mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 wang and papamichos

flow velocity and permeability effects on the temperature perturbation the fluid velocity through a porous media between 4 10 4 10 11 m s in high and low permeable formations rice and cleary 1976 mctigue 1986 karashige 1989 wang and papamichos 1999 gelet 2012 the dimensionless apparent velocity n defined in eq 13 varies from 1 8 10 3 3 88 and n 2 4 6 is used in the simulations correspond to average fluid velocities of 8 93 10 3 1 41x x10 2 and 1 95 10 2 m s respectively as expected a high fluid velocity allows more cold hot energy transporting into a formation wellbore for an injecting producing process fig 5 from the boundary conditions eq 19 a sign change can be made for the average velocities correlating production and injection processes for the same fluid velocity different temperature profile may be produced during production and injection respectively this is because flow towards a wellbore occurs during production whereas the flow is away from the wellbore during injection as explained earlier a slower temperature change at the wellbore during production shown in fig 3 is interpreted as a process of formation energy carried by toward wellbore fluid flow similarly a sharper temperature decline during injection is due to the fact that of a cold water flow may transport colder energy into the formation figs 3 and 5 thermal conductivity effect on temperature changes the ultimate parameters defining the heat transport through the porous media are the convective coefficient k ϕ and the thermal diffusivity c0 λ ρcp where λ ρ and cp are the thermal conductivity density and specific heat of the medium respectively consider heat conduction the thermal diffusivities from variety of rocks and fluid are significantly different varying between 10 6 to 10 12 m2 s kurashige 1989 mctigue 1990 gelet 2012 although the conductive heat transfer may dominate the energy transport process in a low permeability formation its contribution to a temperature change may be minimum in high permeability sandstone or along the natural fracture channels particularly under a higher heat transfer coefficient i e hw 10 w m2 k this is shown in the solution from eq 19 and in figs 4 and 5 where results from constant heat flux and wellbore temperature cases are compared typical thermal data used are listed in table i along with the thermal conductivity λw of 0 68 w m2k in water λs 2 2 3 3 w m2k in porous rocks gelet 2012 λs 1 02 6 6 w m2k in clay salt and fractured formation including the run segment and rosemanowes hdr mctigue 1986

diffusivity of 5 1 10 6 is listed in table ii for those solution with conductive heat transfer only where no fluid velocity effect is expected fig 6 typical low permeability material properties for shale are shown in table i b wang et al 1996 thm coupling is highlighted by the transient fluid flow and the diffusivity ratios are listed in tables ii and iii negative thermally induced pore pressure near the wellbore is noticeable the justification of boundary conditions and their effects on the temperature perturbation three types of boundary conditions are commonly applied in simulations among them solutions of a constant pressure or temperature change the dirichlet 1st type boundary condition were developed in the past and therefore will only be used for comparison purposes mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 wang and papamichos 1994 wang 1998 wang and dusseault 2003 this type of boundary condition is commonly applied for drilling and injection with an unchanged wellbore pressure or temperature alternatively while simulating a constant pumping or producing case a neumann 2nd type boundary condition with a constant hydraulic heat flux is utilized wang and papamichos 1999 zhai and atefi monfared 2020 mctigue 1990 following carslaw and jaeger 1959 a third type called a cauchy robin boundary condition involves both the primary variable and derivative in this study for a high permeability formation a modified cauchy robin type boundary condition similar to the classic is applied for temperature calculations a constant heat flux equals to the combined energy components from a constant fluid velocity and a temperature difference between the fluid temperature inside a wellbore and that at the wall of the porous formation instead of a typical cauchy robin type boundary condition 3rd type for the temperature change a constant heat flux defined proportional to a fixed wellbore fluid temperature is applied therefore both conductive and convective energy transfer contributions from the boundary through the wellbore into the formation are incorporated this shown in eqs 10 and 51 for conductive convective case and conductive cases corresponding to media with high and low permeability respectively eq 10 may be simplified into eq 51 if a zero hydraulic flux or velocity is assumed the justifications for the modified cauchy robin type boundary for the high permeability case are that i the thermal energy may be transmitted through a wellbore wall via both the moving fluid and contacted solid skeleton and fluid through conduction wu et al 2017 ii the conductive component is also required to be defined at the wellbore boundary unlike the situations from literatures mctigue 1986 kurashige 1989 wang 1994 and papamichos 1999 the temperature on the solid skeleton and pore fluid right at the wellbore wall may change gradually with time solutions with a similar boundary condition considering conductive heat flow only are provided in zhai and atefi monfared 2020 and whether the energy equilibrium condition between wellbore and formation temperature can be reached the time duration required depends on the htc hw for example the maximum temperature during injection is only 68 ofthe maximum temperature in the wellbore fluid yet approximately 100 when hw 10 w m2 k fig 4 different boundary conditions can be defined for different physical situations a constant wellbore temperature case is normally replicated for an injection with a constant fluid temperature i e hydraulic fracturing process a constant heat flux condition with a conductive or combined convective conductive heat transfer considered may be applicable for fluid circulation in low permeability and high permeability cases respectively although the temperature change near the wellbore is believed to be primarily associated with wellbore conditions the size of the external radius and thermal conditions applied can also affect the results this can be observed from the sensitivity analysis for different velocities in fig 5 they are also defined in the boundary condition and the corresponding solutions eqs 10 28 40 42 temperature pressure changes and implications to co2 ch4 storage and injectivity although no nonlinear hydraulic and thermal properties change of co2 ch4 under different temperatures and pressures are characterized we emphasize a solution with coupled nonlinear effects on density thermal conductivity and viscosity as it is essential for co2 ch4 injectivity and storage capacity design a gaseous viscosity but liquid like density of supercritical co2 allows a higher injectivity which permits a high storage efficiency yet a drastic increase on storage capacity underground once the critical point t 31 1 c p 7 38 mpa is surpassed density changes inside a wellbore have been widely studied fig 7 shows two examples based on data from kaldi and gibson poole 2008 and pruess and garcia 2002 navy blue blue and red solid dashed lines represent the density viscosity change with depth of ch4 water and co2 respectively a cube with different numbers assuming the volume at the surface is 100 represents the volume change of co2 at different depths the co2 density at a standard atmospheric condition is 1 78 kg m3 whereas its supercritical density ranges between 150 800 kg m3 between 84 27 449 43 times of that at the standard condition lower temperature and pressure are required for ch4 to reach the supercritical condition and densities of 0 544 77 44 and 1 495 217 7 kg m3 for ch4 and co2 are reported for temperature of 3 57 c under pressures of 0 1 10 mpa higgoda et al 2019 such a density change implies that a volume of 100 m3 co2 at the surface only occupies 0 27 m3 at a depth of 2 000 m the aforementioned studies of depth are not as common at the vicinity of a wellbore inside a porous formation since it is more complicated we used a schematic diagram to display the conceptual characteristics of density pressure and temperature change in the vicinity of a wellbore during injection and production of co2 fig 8 as indicated in fig 8a gas in a supercritical state may exist inside formation away from the wellbore once the well pressure and temperature are below the supercritical conditions which may be maintained in the vicinity of the wellbore for injection when the injection pressure temperature are above the supercritical condition fig 8 b we emphasize htat quantitative and accurate calculations on density temperature and pressure distribution are critically important for the determination of the th property changes of co2 and their corresponding impacts on mechanical responses which are crucial for co2 sequestration and ch4 storage design additional research on the effects of these property changes on the injectivity capacity and safety of co2 ch4 are recommended in the future 5 summary and conclusions in summary we developed closed form solutions for temperature perturbation on and near a cylindrical wellbore subject to a constant heat flux under a steady state fluid flow condition in high permeability formations with conductive convective heat transfer calculated results were compared to those with a constant wellbore temperature and such comparisons were extended to temperature perturbation near a cylindrical wellbore subject to a constant heat flux and a constant bottomhole pressure in low permeability formation where only a conductive heat transfer was considered unlike the results from a constant wellbore fluid temperature case depending on the overall inter phase htc between the wellbore fluid to those from the fluid inside a porous rock and the solid skeleton itself the temperature at the wellbore wall may change gradually to reach the stable condition such a coefficient dictates the heat exchange process both at the wellbore wall and inside formation only 68 wellbore wall temperature change is allowed when hw 0 1 w m2k the average mobile fluid velocity can dominate the thermal front radius in a high permeability formation when the peclet number is larger than 0 1 depending on the thermal diffusivity and formation mobility ratio although a high hw may allow for rapid heat exchange at the wellbore wall in a low permeability formation heat transfer via conductive mechanism alone may not permit an efficient heat transfer thus having a slower heat exchange and energy transfer can be expected in addition to the co2 sequestration and ch2 storage design applications the energy recovery rate and extraction or losses may be evaluated by the proposed solution before a heat extraction and egs can be designed and developed we concluded the following 1 a conductive heat flow may be assumed and coupled to a fluid flow in low permeability formation and different mechanical and pore pressure responses are expected depending on the applied boundary condition a conductive convective heat flow must be coupled for temperature change and thm responses in a high permeability formation when the peclet number is 0 1 2 the thermal conductivity and diffusivity ratio of the formation are conventionally used to characterize porous rocks under non isothermal conditions and may dominate the energy transport processes in a low permeability formation on the other hand htc average fluid flow velocity and thm boundary conditions applied to a wellbore are the major factors that control the energy transport process change the temperature perturbation and determine the thm response 3 different thermal boundary conditions applied at a wellbore may affect the wellbore and formation temperature change and thus the heat extraction efficiency temperature changes with time at the wellbore wall of the formation must be considered and corresponding boundary must be defined 4 the temperature and pore pressure perturbations in the vicinity of a wellbore may change the ch4 co2 phase and their th properties significantly the implication of such changes is that both hydraulic mass and thermal energy transport process will be affected significantly and eventually impacting the safety design and economic evaluation of gas

88,this study presents droplet dynamics due to capillarity wettability interaction through a constricted capillary channel previous research has investigated the droplet motion in a constricted capillary channel with a two dimensional geometry and uniform wettability to determine the critical pressure necessary for the droplet to pass through the constriction but did not consider the change of pressure as the droplet crosses through a constricted geometry to explore the dynamic behavior of droplet motion across a constriction a direct numerical simulation of a droplet in a three dimensional fractionally wet constricted channel is performed where we have two different contact angles on opposing faces of the constriction the results show that the fractional wettability condition significantly affects the evolution of fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces pressure drop and displacement patterns we show that droplet dynamics in a fractionally wet channel do not necessarily follow the same behavior as in a uniform capillary channel and cannot be predicted using uniform wettability surfaces depicted by an average contact angle in particular the pressure difference needed to push the droplet through the restriction with fractional wettability is lower than that for a uniform channel with a constant contact angle representing the less favorable wettability state the fluid fluid meniscus often forms saddle shaped interfaces with curvature of opposite sign in orthogonal directions moreover the effects of droplet size capillary number viscosity ratio and constriction shape are elucidated the pressure difference increases with droplet size and capillary number triangular cross sections can be accessed at a lower pressure because of wetting layer flow keywords 3 d wettability capillarity droplet data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the physics of multiphase flow in porous media is crucial to many real world applications geological carbon sequestration andrew et al 2014 enhanced oil recovery dang et al 2018 and groundwater soil remediation abdel moghny et al 2012 are only a few examples making well informed decisions on the overall system control and effective operation necessitates a thorough grasp of pore scale phenomena as a result many experimental and numerical research has concentrated on multiphase flow in a simplified porous medium with a single constricted capillary channel the dynamics of a droplet in a capillary channel with constrictions has gained more attention due to its wide application for instance in the design of modern lab on a chip devices many microfluidic networks contain constricted channels larger bubbles can be trapped at the constriction entrance obstructing the flow to unclog the blocked channel an external pressure has to be supplied to force the bubble out of the channel in oil and gas applications the change of droplet location and shape leads to a variation of the pressure drop required to maintain a constant flow rate a large pressure drop is required to deform the drop sufficiently to squeeze through the constriction and in many cases the droplet will be trapped in the pore space some pertinent studies in this field have been performed gardescu 1930 studied analytically the minimum pressure necessary to drive a gas bubble through a constriction and established a mathematical description of resistance based on the interface pressure by solving numerically a generalized washburn equation legait et al 1983 investigated the minimum pressure difference necessary to push a bubble throughout a constricted channel their results have demonstrated that the pressure drop depends on the ratio of the reynolds number to the capillary number based on the boundary integral method martinez and udell 1990 studied drop motion through a constricted capillary channel later tsai and miksis 1994 used a constricted channel to analyze snap off of the droplet lundstrom 1996 theoretically and experimentally examined the movement of bubbles as they passed through a capillary channel that had some restrictions and discussed how pressure drop affected the movement of the bubbles based on energy balance jensen et al 2004 performed a theoretical and numerical analysis of droplet motion in a hydrophilic constriction cobos et al 2008 and later roca and carvalho 2013 investigated the dynamics of emulsion drops through a constricted capillary channel including the trapping of droplets at small capillary numbers they discovered that compared to a single phase fluid an extra driving pressure is necessary to drive the drops out of the constricted channel to examine the mobilization of a trapped discontinuous phase simon et al 2012 built a lab on a chip with a restriction based on the morphological configuration of bubbles at different stages in the contraction liang et al 2015 studied the threshold pressure to drive the droplet through an inclined constricted channel recently liu et al 2021 established the critical pressure for droplets to move through the pore space cerdeira et al 2020 and singla and ray 2021 provided a review of drop dynamics in various microchannel geometrical structures in our recent work we quantitatively determined the minimum pressure required to force an oil droplet through a constriction imani et al 2022 nevertheless all the aforementioned studies were conducted with a two dimensional model these two dimensional simulations may differ significantly from real world applications especially for irregular microchannels in addition to that in two dimensional models it is challenging to precisely represent the interface topography and flow behavior due to complicated droplet shape and dynamics in irregular microchannels two dimensional models could not accurately and effectively characterize the droplet deformation harvie et al 2008 ngo et al 2015 few studies have used three dimensional models to investigate droplet dynamics the investigation of most relevance to the present study is that conducted by zhang et al 2014 who investigated the pressure behavior in different three dimensional contractions other pertinent investigations include the three dimensional simulations of hoang et al 2017 who studied the droplet dynamics in a constricted microchannel using a three dimensional model of a constricted channel zhang et al 2021 elucidated the snap off process based on energy conservation ansari and nobes 2021 carried out an experimental investigation of droplet motion in a constricted channel in order to calculate the pressure field by analyzing the flow field however these studies have focused on a homogeneous wettability with a constant contact angle in the channel while due to their uneven surface chemistry the wettability of the majority of rocks is naturally heterogeneous surface wettability controls multiphase flow blunt 2017 for example in contrast to homogeneous porous media in which the entire rock has the same affinity for the phases in contact heterogeneous porous media have varying fluid affinities in different regions alyafei and blunt 2016 piri and blunt 2005 it is possible for reservoirs to be partially oil wet and partially water wet due to changes in the wettability of the surface that has contacted crude oil salathiel 1973 this is generally known as heterogeneous wettability laroche et al 1999 two types of heterogeneous wettability have been reported in the literature mixed wettability blunt et al 2013 dixit et al 1999 raeesi and piri 2009 and fractional wettability bradford and leij 1995 in the mixed wet condition the surfaces may contain both water wet and oil wet patches which connect across the pore space while the fractionally wet condition is more general and there are surfaces that may either be water wet or oil wet by combining various fractions of oil wet and water wet grains fractionally wet porous media can be reproduced in the laboratory which represent for instance soils containing organic material as first demonstrated by brown and fatt 1956 mcdougall and sorbie 1993 investigated the effectiveness of water injection in fractionally wet porous media to create fractionally wet porous media specific fractions of water and oil wet pores were considered motealleh et al 2008 studied the stability of the fluid fluid meniscus in fractionally wet porous media using cylindrical tubes zheng et al 2021 developed a pore network model to compute the capillary pressure for fractional wet porous media in general previous research lacks a discussion of the impact of heterogeneous wettability as the droplet crosses through the constriction on a 3d three dimensional model assessing the impact of wettability heterogeneity at the pore scale is essential for the development of macroscopic flow models in addition the mechanisms governing the pore scale dynamics of fluid interfaces and their evolution are still unclear most oil reservoirs are heterogeneous meaning they are neither fully water wet nor fully oil wet so our work is necessary to understand displacement processes including pore invasion the wettability heterogeneity of reservoir rocks might result from their internal surface which is made up of a variety of minerals having various surface chemistry and absorption characteristics anderson 1986 studies have shown that the contact angle varies when crude oil and brine are allowed to mature on a solid surface also in electrochemical devices naturally water wet carbon fibres are coated in ptfe to make them partially hydrophobic creating a mixed wet state several works in the past have investigated multiphase flow in heterogeneous wet porous media and discovered clear differences in the fluid behavior in uniform wet systems and in heterogeneous wet systems this study investigates in particular how the deviation from uniform wetting conditions affects the jamin effect the jamin effect is the resistance to the flow due to the change of droplet morphology liu et al 2021 it plays a critical role in the improvement of waterflooding recovery in this work direct numerical simulations dns were used to study the droplet dynamics through a fractionally wet constricted capillary channel we have built a 3d capillary channel with a constriction and simulated both uniform and non uniform types of wettability we investigated the impact of wettability on the evolution of the fluid fluid interface the fluid solid interface and the minimum pressure necessary to drive the droplet through the constricted capillary channel this work makes a contribution by methodically illustrating how important it is to include contact angle distribution in pore network simulations to accurately describe the behavior of multiphase flow dynamics particularly in non uniform porous media moreover the effect of capillary number viscosity ratio and change on the pressure drop across different shapes of constriction was investigated we will demonstrate that the fractional distribution of contact angle affects the droplet dynamics in multiphase flow 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 phase field method the computational fluid dynamics cfd software comsol multiphysics was used to solve the navier stokes n s equation coupled with the phase field method for incompressible fluids the governing equations are 1 u 0 2 ρ u t u u p i μ u u t f s t f e x t here ρ denotes the density kg m3 μ equals the dynamic viscosity ns m2 u represents the velocity m s p denotes the pressure pa f st is the surface tension force acting at the oil water interface and f ext is the external force yue et al 2004 established the phase field variable with range 1 1 to identify the concentration of fluid that changes continuously over the thin interface but keeps constant in the bulk phases to avoid confusion with the viscous dissipation we denote the phase field variable as α in this study α 1 represents the oil phase α 1 represents the water phase and 1 α 1the oil water interface on the solid surfaces the wetted wall condition is set and a contact angle is specified because the no slip boundary condition is not sufficient to characterize the three phase contact line at the surface qian et al 2006 the navier slip has been set bai et al 2017 and it is equal to the mesh element size at the inlet a normal inflow velocity boundary condition b c is assigned and at the outlet a fixed pressure of 0 pa is established considering that both the capillary channel and the flow characteristics are symmetric only one half of the entire system has been simulated in order to reduce computation costs the model adopted a tetrahedral mesh near the inlet and the hexahedral mesh for the remaining parts after a mesh resolution study described in the supplementary material we have adopted a fine mesh with 2317 866 domain elements the selection of a time step of 10 6 s meets the requirements of the courant number and it has been set to adjust automatically depending on backward differentiation to ensure convergence we chose a relative tolerance of 0 001 the model adopted the multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver to compute the simulation variables 2 2 model verification a comparison of the results of the present simulation with the analytical model of lucas washburn liu et al 2014 is carried out to verify the model the mathematical formulation is evaluated using a capillary tube to determine if it can replicate multiphase flow in a porous medium the wetting fluid invasion in a capillary channel is dictated by the capillary and viscous forces neglecting the influence of inertia and gravitation the displacement of the meniscus can be determined by 3 σ cos θ 6 r μ w x μ n l x d x d t where θindicates the contact angle σindicates the interfacial tension n m rrepresents the width of the capillary channel µm ldenotes the length of the capillary channel µm μ w andμ n represent the wetting blue and non wetting red phase viscosities pa s after integration eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 μ w μ n 2 x 2 x 0 2 μ n l x x o r σ cos θ 6 t consider a domain with a length of 500 µm and a width of 10 µm and different section lengths l1 150 µm l2 200 µm l3 150 µm l4 75 µm see fig 1 the wetted wall boundary conditions have been set with a specified contact angle of 60 periodic top and bottom boundary conditions are applied to the leftmost l1 and rightmost l3 parts of the system as well as at both ends of the domain to ensure the conservation of mass in the system the fluid viscosities are μ w 10mpa s blue phase and μ n 1mpa s red phase respectively the fluids have been assigned the same density of 1000 kg m3 the interfacial tension is 0 04 n m for the specified fluid flow conditions we demonstrate how the meniscus location changes with time according to fig 2 the displacement of the meniscus determined by the numerical model agrees well with the theoretical solution validating the correctness of the numerical method the droplet motion in a capillary channel is referred to as a piston like displacement we further validate our model by considering two parallel capillaries where a blue phase wetting is injected to displace a red phase non wetting as shown in fig 3 the top and bottom capillary radii are r1 and r2 with r1 r2 respectively the width of the channel is 100 µm the height is 72 µm the top capillary radius is 15 µm and the bottom capillary radius is 12 µm the interfacial tension wetting wall condition and capillary radius are the three variables that must be considered to calculate the capillary pressures using the young laplace equation 5 p c 1 2 σ cos θ r 1 p c 2 2 σ cos θ r 2 the pressure differential between an inlet and an outlet δp pin pout and the capillary pressure determine the displacement behavior from eq 16 we obtain pc1 3333 pa and pc2 2667 pa it can be observed in fig that when δp pc2 the invading phase cannot enter both capillaries at the same time when pc2 δp pc1 see fig 4 b the invading phase flows only into the large capillary even though the invading water phase flows into both capillaries when the differential pressure is such that δp pc1 fig 4 c the displacement is much faster in the larger capillaries fig 5 shows the recovery factor for different pressure drops the recovery factor is zero when δp pc2 as the applied pressure is insufficient to displace oil it increases with the increase of the applied pressure difference it can be shown that these results are in line with the conceptual model which is what for instance pore network simulators are based on 3 discussion and results 3 1 model description the three dimensional geometrical structure of a constricted channel is shown in fig 6 the channel has a square cross section to represent corners and roughness in the pore space legait 1983 the width of this microchannel system is denoted by l which is also regarded as the system s characteristic length one inlet is located upstream and one outlet is located downstream having both a square cross sectional geometry a constriction with a width of 0 34 l is used to connect both parts of the channel the droplet oil phase is positioned in a water filled capillary channel the water phase is injected from the inlet in order to produce sufficient pressure to displace the droplet which is first positioned at the center of l from the entrance having a diameter of d 0 3 l the oil phase viscosity is denoted by μ o while the water phase is μ w similarly the oil and water densities are ρ o and ρ w respectively the properties of fluids are reported in table 1 in this work the flow is characterized by the capillary number ca μv σ where v is the inlet velocity which is the ratio of viscous and capillary forces since the fluids have the same density gravitational effects can be ignored the flow is sufficiently slow that inertial effects encapsulated in the reynolds numbers are also insignificant the characteristic flow time is defined as τ l v note that in the manuscript pressure drop is scaled by σ l time is scaled by τ and surface free energy δf pressure work w and viscous dissipation ϕ are scaled by σl 3 2 dynamics of a droplet in a fractionally wet constricted channel our main focus is the change of droplet morphology as well as the associated change of pressure difference under various wettability conditions a preliminary series of numerical simulations were conducted to comprehend the physics underlying the droplet motion on the surface with uniform and non uniform wettability fig 7 shows the droplet behavior in a homogeneous wettability capillary channel and in a fractionally wetted channel which is obtained by setting the upper wall as strongly water wet contact angle of 45 iglauer et al 2014 and the lower wall as strongly non wetting to water 135 the side walls were also kept in the same condition as the upper walls the aim of this work is to show that the droplet would behave differently in a homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting condition for a fractional wettability case fig 7 b as soon as the droplet reaches the entrance of constriction it is attracted to the lower wall due to its strong affinity for oil at the same time more water flows into the upper wall corners the formation of a thin film at the upper wall entrance indicates that the advancing meniscus does not touch the upper wall as the droplet moves forward the contact line at the lower wall advances faster while the interface at the upper wall is delayed as more water enters the constriction t 0 64 the backward meniscus stretches the meniscus stretch increases as the droplet moves toward the constriction exit therefore on the backward meniscus water and oil flow simultaneously while near the front meniscus water still flows at the channel corners for a uniform wettability the droplet behaves differently for a water wet condition fig 7 a the advancing and receding meniscus are concave at t 0 48 oil bulges into water as the droplet advances inside the constriction the receding meniscus flattens and water can flow into the corners of the channel this is the behavior that would be expected with a hemispherical advancing meniscus as the droplet crosses the restriction the pressure drop increases indicating that external work is being done to force the droplet through the constricted channel fig 8 illustrates the change of pressure drop with time for different surface wettabilities the pressure drop is the difference between the pressures at the inlet and outlet this pressure corresponds to the pressure necessary to squeeze the droplet through a constricted channel it should be noted that for all the cases in this section the fluid has been injected at the same constant velocity for a fractional wettability case the pressure drop keeps constant as the droplet approaches the constriction then oscillates as it enters the constriction due to entrance effects and finally increases sharply to reach the critical value at t 0 56 at this time the droplet has fully entered the constriction interestingly it can be shown that a lower critical pressure drop is required to displace the droplet on a fractionally wetted surface than on a homogeneous surface a similar conclusion has been reported in the work of jahanbakhsh et al 2021 additionally the pressure drop decreases with an increase of channel heterogeneity as shown in fig 8 b another important observation is that the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet is positive this indicates that the positive external work supplied by the injection of water is greater than the surface energy implying that some energy has been dissipated the energy balance can be used to gain more insights into this behavior for isothermal flow the energy balance equation can be obtained directly from the momentum equation thus by integration of eq 2 over the whole computational domain ω the energy conservation law for the multiphase flow process is given as 6 d e k d t d f d t ρ f u t u ϕ d ω where ek is the bulk kinetic energy ek ω 1 2 ρ u 2 dω f is the surface free energy df σ daow cos θ1 da os top cos θ2 da os bottom cos θ2 da os side with aow aos top aos bottom and aos side indicating the fluid fluid interfacial area the oil phase upper wall interfacial area the oil phase lower wall interfacial area and the oil phase side wall interfacial area respectively on the right hand side the first term represents the energy from the external body force such as buoyancy forces which are negligible in this work the second term is the contribution of the work done by the pressure which can be estimated as w δpqdt where w denotes the work done through the flow domain the last term expresses the viscous dissipation energy which can be given by 7 ϕ 2 μ u x 2 v x 2 w x 2 μ u y v x 2 v z w y 2 u z w x 2 where u v and w are the velocities component in x y and z coordinates respectively by the integration of the viscous dissipation energy over the whole volume the viscous dissipation rate can be obtained as φ ωϕdωdt therefore the total energy balance eq 6 can be rewritten as ferrari and lunati 2014 8 d e k d t d f d t d w d t φ if we select two typical times for the mobilization event the energy conservation equation for this time frame can be written as follows 9 δ f w δ e k φ where δf and δek indicates the change of surface and kinetic energies respectively it has been shown that the amount of energy converted to kinetic energy in a slow process is negligible zhu et al 2021 therefore eq 8 is simplified to w δf φ morrow 1970 this implies that the work done on the system is equal to the change of surface free energy and some dissipated energy the driving pressure drop that pushes the discontinuous phase through the constriction can be expressed as 10 δ p w q δ f φ q where q the flow rate can be computed as q vac ac is the cross sectional area of the inlet the injection flow rate being constant the contribution of the energy surface and the viscous dissipation can help to understand the difference in behavior between the homogeneous and the fractional wettability cases first we measure the surface areas between the fluid fluid interface and the solid fluid interface the fluid fluid interface is divided into three sections see fig 9 at the first stage as the droplet enters the constriction the droplet meniscus reconfigures to fit in the constriction and the fluid fluid interface area decreases steeply the fractional wettability case shows the largest drop in area at the second stage during its passage through the constriction the fluid fluid interface area in the fractionally wet constriction keeps increasing while the area is approximately constant in the homogeneous case finally at the last stage the fluid fluid interface increases as the droplet begins to leave the constriction on the other hand the contact area of the droplet with the side wall increases more for fractional wettability the evolution of the fluid top wall is shown in fig 9 b it can be shown that the contact area of the fluid top wall in the homogeneous case increases more than in the fractionally wet example the fluid top wall contact area aos top of the fractionally wet case will further decrease this is justified by the strong adhesion on the lower walls for the same reason the area contacting the lower walls aos bottom is larger in the fractional wetted surface than in homogeneous as be shown by the inserts in fig 9 b the temporal evolution of surface energy for a homogeneous and fractional wetted case is depicted in fig 10 a initially the energy surface keeps constant as the droplet gets closer to the constriction as it passes through the constriction a decrease in surface energy is observed in the fractionally wet case while a slight increase is observed for the homogeneous case the total viscous dissipation energy increases during the motion of droplets inside the constriction moreover more energy is dissipated in the homogeneous case furthermore as the channel becomes more heterogeneous see fig 10 b the viscous dissipation does not change significantly but the increase in surface energy which is negative results in a lower pressure drop as the droplet moves through the constriction furthermore fig 9 b shows that as the positive work is done the droplet advances until it reaches the local pressure maximum at t 0 56 continuous injection will lead to different equilibrium states a much larger pressure is required to be applied to push the droplet out of constriction at t 0 8 we therefore conclude that the critical pressure drop is the maximum of the local pressure maxima at t 0 56 and t 0 8 which correspond to the entrance and exit times the maximum entry pressure decreases with the increase of heterogeneity while the maximum exit pressure keeps constant in their study due to the complexity of water air surfaces in soils bauters et al 2000 suggested the use of an effective contact angle having the same surface energy as the real meniscus an interesting case would be to look at different wettability pairs with their average contact angle therefore according to the characterization of wettability by iglauer et al 2014 we can construct four pairs mix of complete wetting and complete non wetting 0 180 strongly wetting condition and strongly non wetting condition 30 150 mix of weakly wetting condition and weakly non wetting condition 60 120 and their homogeneous average wetting condition 90 in two dimensional models a simplified capillary pressure expression in a fractionally wetted capillary channel can be written as see appendix a 11 p c σ w cos θ t o p cos θ b o t t o m thus all the wetting conditions above would have zero capillary pressure this is not correct however as an assessment of the capillary pressure necessary for droplet to pass through the system moreover this conclusion is applicable to 3d cases under specific conditions fig 11 shows the droplet evolution in constriction with different wetting conditions the top walls are water wet while the lower walls are oil wet because of its strong affinity for oil the droplet is attracted to the lower wall as soon as it approaches the constriction entrance in the complete wetting pair fig 11 a at the same time more water flows into the upper wall corners a nonsymmetric advancing meniscus shape is observed during the capillary flow due to the alternate contact angle as the droplet moves forward the contact line at the lower wall advances faster while the interface at the upper wall delays as more water enters the constriction t 0 64 the backward meniscus of the droplet stretches the meniscus flattens and enlarges as the droplet moves toward the exit of the constriction covering the whole lower surface therefore water and oil flow simultaneously in the constriction a similar behavior is observed in strongly wetting and strongly non wetting pairs fig 11 b it can be observed that at the entrance the spread of the droplet on the lower wall is reduced compared to the case in a furthermore during droplet reconfiguration the receding meniscus stretches more than the advancing meniscus while a greater stretching has been observed in the advancing meniscus for both complete wetting and non wetting pairs later the moving contact line on the backward meniscus will remain pinned on the bottom wall while the advancing meniscus is advancing leading to a similar configuration to the previous case as the droplet is about to break through however the droplet behaves differently in a case of uniform average contact angle 90 at t 0 48 the advancing meniscus shape accommodates the wettability of the surface however it doesn t completely flatten the receding meniscus is convex the droplet inside of the constriction touches the upper and lower walls when the droplet reaches the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus keeps its curvature while the receding meniscus becomes concave at the exit of the constriction the advancing meniscus becomes convex while the receding meniscus becomes less concave at t 0 48 the advancing meniscus shape accommodates the wettability of the surface however it does not completely flatten the receding meniscus is convex the droplet inside the constriction touches the upper and lower walls when the droplet reaches the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus keeps its curvature while the receding meniscus becomes concave at the constriction exit the advancing meniscus becomes convex while the receding meniscus becomes less concave moreover in the fractional wet case different pairs of wettability would behave differently from fig 11 c it can be shown that in the case of 60 120 the droplet contacted all the walls leading to a suppression of corner flow additionally the spread of the droplet on the lower wall is reduced compared to the case of 30 150 as the droplet advances to the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus is a flat surface instead of a curve and the receding meniscus shows a kind of saddle shape with curvatures in principal directions of different sign at the exit of the constriction as the advancing meniscus breaks through water flows through the corners till the droplet completely leaves the constriction the corresponding two dimensional pictures are given in the appendix b to further investigate the difference between the fractionally wet surfaces and their average contact angle the change of pressure during droplet motion is shown in fig 12 as shown previously the wettability greatly influences the pressure distribution in the capillary channel both wettability and pressure drop are critical parameters in multiphase flow for the complete wetting and complete non wetting pairs as the droplet reaches the constriction entrance the pressure drop increases sharply which is followed by a decrease as the droplet spreads on the bottom wall due to the strong adhesion of the droplet a similar behavior is observed for strongly wetting and strongly non wetting pairs however the pressure drop increases in a step wise manner in this case as the droplet enters completely into the constriction the pressure drop decreases significantly in the complete wetting and completely non wetting pair then increases and reaches the maximum value as the advancing meniscus breaks through on the other hand the pressure decreases to a negative value as the droplet enters the constriction then increases to reach a steady state as the droplet has fully entered the constriction the first maximum pressure is reached as the advancing front breaks through the constriction while the second maximum pressure drop occurs because the droplet has fully occupied the exit of the constriction and has blocked the water therefore to balance the constant injected water velocity the pressure drop increases interestingly as shown in fig 12 b the weakly wetting and weakly non wetting pairs behave similarly to the average contact angle case 3 3 effect of droplet size we have shown previously that two parameters are critical while investigating the critical pressure drop the maximum entry pressure and the maximum exit pressure fig 13 shows the maximum entry pressure and exit pressure for different droplet radii the droplet radius is non dimensionalized by the characteristic length l r d r d l as expected the pressure increased with the droplet radius in both cases 30 120 and 45 120 the maximum entry pressure is lower than the maximum exit pressure however when the droplet size becomes large the maximum entrance pressure is suppressed the fluid fluid contact area fig 13 a shows the total filling of the constriction for the larger droplet with the long decrease in fluid fluid interface area with time indicating that the advancing meniscus of the larger droplet breaks through before the receding meniscus can enter through the constriction which means that the entrance pressure remains at zero therefore we can conclude that at ca 2 10 4 a critical pressure drop in a fractionally wetted rectangular channel is dictated by the maximum exit pressure it should also be noted that the droplet experiences a larger critical pressure drop in the case of 45 120 in addition to that the difference between the maximum entrance pressure and exit pressure drop is greater at 45 120 to elucidate the mechanism behind this phenomenon we first quantify the amount of viscous dissipation in each droplet fig 14 shows the ratio of viscous dissipation in the droplet ϕd to the total viscous dissipation ϕ for different droplet radii it should be noted that the capillary number is kept constant for a smaller droplet the viscous dissipation is zero at the beginning of the process a slight increase occurs as the droplet reaches the constriction entrance and decreases as soon as the droplet touches the lower wall of the constriction a similar behavior is observed for a larger droplet this indicates that the droplet deformation does not contribute to the viscous dissipation however as shown in the insert in fig 14 the viscous forces depend on the droplet size for a smaller droplet the water flowing in the corners of the capillary channel leads to a decrease in the flow resistance thus the viscous forces are lower compared to the larger droplet the water phase works as a low viscosity fluid to lubricate the droplet flow on the meniscus in the water channel allowing the droplet to detach from the inner walls because of this the pushing force on the geometrical structure and the viscous force of the water phase channel against the oil water interface both help the droplets move the increase in pressure drop is therefore dependent on the fluid wall contacts the increase in maximum exit pressure may be due to the adhesive forces which become more important at the exit of the constriction thus looking at the contact area between the droplet and the top side and bottom walls it is noticeable that for the larger droplet the maximum contact area of the droplet with the walls is reached when the droplet is about to leave the constriction thus a higher exit pressure drop is required to push the droplet out of the constriction see fig 15 at the same time the fluid fluid interface area decreases as the droplet passes through the constriction and becomes steady when the leading interface breaks through although the smaller droplet shows similar behavior the steady contact area is longer than for the larger droplet resulting in the existence of both maximum entry pressure and maximum exit pressure more importantly the reduced contact area with the walls results in a lower critical pressure drop for a smaller droplet compared to a larger droplet 3 4 effect of capillary number and viscosity ratio we have shown previously that at a fixed low ca the maximum exit pressure dominates the flow behavior however this is not always true for every injection velocity in this section we investigate the effects of viscosity ratio rη on the dynamics of a droplet as it passes through the constriction the viscosity ratio is changed by holding water viscosity constant and changing oil viscosity the viscosity affects the behavior of the pressure drops fig 16 shows the pressure drop change at different viscosity ratios at low viscosity the maximum entry pressure is larger than the maximum exit pressure at a viscosity ratio of log rη 0 1 both pressure drops are almost equal when the viscosity ratio becomes larger than log rη 0 1 the maximum exit pressure drop becomes larger than the maximum entrance pressure drop another crossing point is reached at a viscosity ratio of log rη 2 5 therefore there is a lower critical point and a higher critical point with a further increase in viscosity ratio the maximum entry pressure dominates the maximum exit pressure the behavior of a droplet for different capillary numbers is investigated different capillary numbers are obtained by changing the inlet velocity at a fixed viscosity ratio of 1 both the maximum entry pressure drop and the maximum exit pressure drop increase linearly with the capillary number as shown in fig 17 in fact when two phases flow simultaneously in porous media at lower ca the mobilizing pressure drop and viscous force are smaller resulting in lower flow resistance on the other hand for the fluids flowing at higher ca the mobilizing pressure drop and the viscous force would be higher leading to higher flow resistance moreover the viscous force that is translated to the drag force on the interface increases as ca increases allowing the other phase to remove more oil from the wall contact while displacing the droplet the maximum exit pressure is always greater than the maximum entry pressure at large capillary numbers the difference between the maximum entrance pressure and the maximum exit pressure decreases we can finally write that the critical pressure drop δp can be expressed as follows 11 δ p max e n t r p r e s s e x p r e s s the primary objective of this study was to systematically assess the two phase behavior from numerical simulations of droplet motion for parameters including wettability viscosity ratio and capillary number on the temporal evolution of wetted area fig 18 shows the change in the contact area between fluid fluid and fluid solid for different capillary numbers and viscosity ratios at a fixed ca 3 375 10 3 the fluid fluid interface area decreases more for a small viscosity ratio than for a larger viscosity ratio as the droplet enters the constriction while the contact area slightly remains constant for the small viscosity the fluid fluid interfacial area increases monotonically for the larger viscosity ratio similarly the contact area at the bottom wall for the low viscosity ratio increases then move steadily before decreasing when the droplet is leaving the constriction while it increases then decreases for a larger viscosity ratio although the maximum contact area with the top wall is observed for the larger viscosity both viscosity ratios show the same behavior interestingly more oil contacts the side wall at a small viscosity ratio than at a larger viscosity ratio the same overall behavior is repeated at a large capillary number except that the events take place in a short time at the same viscosity ratio the droplet contacts more with the side walls and the fluid fluid interface area decreases more at the small capillary number in addition to that the increased capillary number leads to a slight decrease in the contact area with the top wall 3 5 effect of constriction shape current pore network models feature an angular porous structure and throats with non circular cross sections allowing for the existence of pores that are only partially saturated the pressure drop was investigated to elucidate the dynamics of a discontinuous phase flow in fractional wet capillaries with different cross sectional geometries in all the cases only the constriction shape has been modified the wettability of the top and side walls of the channel has been set as 45 and on the bottom wall the wettability has been set as 120 fig 19 shows the pressure drop in capillaries with circular triangular square quadrilateral and pentagonal cross sections for a triangular cross section the pressure remains constant as the droplet advances towards the constriction and a slight increase in pressure occurs as the droplet approaches the entrance of the constriction as soon as the droplet touches the lower wall the pressure drop becomes negative until a larger portion of the droplet enters into the constriction this decrease may be due to an instability of the fluid fluid interface the meniscus instability caused by a rapid change in the size of a confined region reduces its resistance to flow and raises local velocities later the pressure increases to become positive again according to fig 19 the pressure rise in a triangular geometry occurs late and is not steep compared to both pentagonal and circular geometries as a result the instability effect on the interface dynamics is greater in pentagonal and circular constriction geometries than in square constriction the pressure drop becomes steady as the droplet has fully entered the constriction and is moving toward the exit where a higher pressure will be required to force the droplet out of the constriction although similar behavior is observed for all the cross sections few observations can be made the largest pressure drop is observed in the circular cross section while the lowest pressure drop is seen in the triangular cross sectional constriction where wetting layer flow is most favored this implies that residual oil in triangular constrictions can be easily mobilized this can be explained by the fact that the saturation of water square is larger than for the pentagonal and circular cross section as can be shown in fig 20 since it can now easily be retained in the corners of the pore space therefore the viscous force in the water phase against the oil water interface would contribute to the decrease in resistance which results in a lower pressure drop on the other hand in high order polygons the resistance of oil goes up as water saturation goes down the resistance is at its highest when the cross section is a circle the existence of the corners in non circular channel affects the equilibrium configurations and leads to interface complicated behavior to further illustrate the behavior described in fig 19 we investigate the movement of interfaces as the droplet passes through the constriction see fig 21 the change of pressure and its corresponding interface motion can be described in three steps first the decrease in pressure corresponds to the contact of the front meniscus with the constriction walls corner flow can be observed as the droplet crosses the triangular constriction this behavior is reduced in a square cross section and completely suppressed in a circular constriction the larger contact area of the droplet with the constriction walls results in a greater decrease of pressure drop a negative pressure is also observed in triangular and circular cross sections however since the contact area with the walls is greatly reduced in the pentagonal cross section the balanced forces result in a positive and short pressure drop the second step corresponds to the steady state at this stage the droplet is flowing at a nearly constant pressure drop the simultaneous flow of water and oil droplet in the triangular and square constrictions leads to a lower steady pressure drop the small contact area with the triangular constriction wall indicates that more water flows simultaneously with the droplet this confirmed our previous assumptions in the regular polygons with n sides greater than four the corner flow is eliminated due to the cross section and the walls wettability furthermore a saddle shape meniscus is observed in the backward meniscus of a droplet in the pentagonal constriction it becomes even more pronounced in the circular cross section at the same time the advancing meniscus admits a convex curvature the third stage is the critical state which occurs when the front meniscus breaks through to the next pore at this stage the pressure drop is the largest similarly to previous stages there is a coflow in both triangular and square constriction the droplet deformation leads to an increase in pressure drop the front meniscus sticks on the lower wall while the backward meniscus slips until the droplet will completely break through in the square cross section the droplet stretches more as it is breaking through allowing some water to flow along the upper interface the backward meniscus of the droplet in the pentagonal constriction flattens thus the saddle shape is reduced however in the circular constriction the distance between the upper contact line and the lower contact line increases significantly with further water injection the advancing front will stick to the walls and the backward will slip towards the exit of the constriction fig 22 shows that the fluid fluid contact area is greatly reduced in the circular cross section the area slightly increases as the droplet reconfigurates in the constriction during the steady state which is only an apparent one the increase in fluid fluid interface is more pronounced in the square constriction resulting in the stretching of the droplet as discussed before furthermore the viscous dissipation in different capillaries is investigated fig 23 shows the temporal evolution of the viscous dissipation rate for different cross sections when a droplet flows through a large pore the viscous dissipation remains constant an abrupt increase occurs as the droplet enters the constriction similar to the above results the dissipated energy is larger in a circular cross section and smaller in a triangular cross section the curves in fig 23 show a decrease increase profile before reaching a steady state the first profile occurs at the entrance of the constriction while the second occurs near the constriction exit as in accordance with the pressure drop evolution as evident from the pressure drops fig 19 more energy is dissipated as the droplet reaches the exit of the constriction leading to a higher pressure drop fig 24 shows the change of critical pressure drop with capillary number the pressure drop increases linearly with the capillary number for all the constriction geometries it can be observed that for the pentagonal and circular cross section the pressure decreases at a very low capillary number furthermore although the droplet experienced a lower pressure drop in triangular cross sectional constriction it took longer to break through especially at a very low capillary number 3 6 comparison with previous work zhang et al 2014 performed a similar study on the passage of a blood cell through a circular constricted channel they discovered that when a cell moves at a steady speed through a filtering channel the pressure in the channel rises and then falls when the cell enters the constriction the maximum pressure occurs when the cell exits the channel the minimum pressure occurs as a result this maximum pressure is the critical pressure for a cell s effective passage event however we observed that the entrance pressure is not always the maximum pressure different conditions may lead to different regimes entrance pressure drop dominated or exit pressure drop dominated this may also be due to the difference in behavior between a cell and an oil droplet when analyzing the effects of constriction shape they showed that the circular shape produced the highest pressure drop followed by the square cross section and the triangular cross section this result agrees well with our findings moreover this conclusion was also confirmed in the unconstricted capillary channel long et al 2019 the results reported in this work clearly show that in pore network modeling where the capillary channel is similar to the pore body and pore throat it is necessary to model the throat as a separate entity including both the wettability and the shape 4 summary and conclusions in this paper three dimensional direct numerical simulation was employed to investigate the droplet dynamics in a fractionally wet capillary channel with different contact angles on different walls our results give fundamental insights concerning pressure drop and interface evolution which are essential for an accurate description of flow in porous media where the contact angle is rarely locally constant a series of numerical simulations with homogeneous and heterogeneous wettability have been carried out to understand two phase flow droplet dynamics including pressure drop analyses of the area of the fluid fluid interface fluid solid interface and pressure drop are greatly influenced by the wettability of the channel we observed that the pressure drop in a homogeneous capillary channel is larger than in a fractionally wet capillary due to the significant decrease in surface energy as the droplet passes through a constriction in addition to that the pressure drop decreases with an increase in channel heterogeneity the pressure drop decreases as the bottom wall becomes more oil wet this implies that the capillary pressure would be lower with the increase of fractions of oil wet pores in porous media thus the channel heterogeneity improves the sweep efficiency in macroscopic flow we have also shown that the droplet in a fractionally wet channel does not necessarily behave in the same manner as in the homogeneous channel with the corresponding average contact angle the threshold pressure drop is also lower than a system of uniform wettability with the less favorable wettability state however the weakly wetting and weakly non wetting pairs behave similar to the neutrally wet condition the channel heterogeneity promotes a decrease in flow resistance thus the effect of jamin resistance is considerably reduced one key observation that can only be seen in three dimensional simulations is that the fluid fluid menisci often form saddle shaped interfaces with positive curvature in one direction and a negative curvature in an orthogonal direction this is something that is normally ignored in pore scale simulations and demonstrates the need to perform three dimensional simulations furthermore we found that the critical pressure is the maximum value between the entrance pressure drop and the exit pressure the pressure drop increases with the droplet size and the exit pressure is greater than the entrance pressure at fixed ca 3 375 10 3 the entrance pressure drop is the maximum pressure at viscosity ratio less than log rη 0 1 and greater than log rη 2 5 at a fixed viscosity ratio of log rη 1 the exit pressure drop is always greater than the entrance pressure at different capillary number the displacement of trapped oil is easier in triangular cross section than in circular geometries because of wetting layer flow which is governed by the half angle of the throat corners the wetting layer flow affects the flow conductance which can be used to determine the relative permeability the minimum pressure increases with the increase of shape factor and more energy is dissipated in circular channels this also implies that the time necessary to fill a pore or to form an oil bank is reduced with the shape factor this is important for pore network modeling where pores and throats are given a cross section with a shape factor and an inscribed radius this work contributes to existing knowledge of multiphase flow through porous media by providing insights into the wettability effect on fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces the results have shown that it is necessary to consider a pore by pore analysis in heterogeneous porous media and can be also applied in various domains including microfluidic device design groundwater remediation and geological sequestration of co2 this work gives also more insights into the mechanisms by which fluid fluid interfaces travel through pores future work could explore more realistic geometries derived from for instance pore scale imaging combined with the use of machine learning to predict threshold

appendix c supplementary materials image application 1 appendix a derivation of capillary pressure based on young laplace equation the dynamic pressure jump at the front meniscus can be estimated from the formula a1 p c σ κ h κ v in a quadrilateral cross sectional geometry the computation of the capillary pressure at the advancing meniscus can be simplified by neglecting the principal curvature in one direction therefore the problem is reduced to a two dimensional calculation to derive the pressure drop induced at the front interface the capillary channel is divided into two parts as shown in fig 25 let us consider the three phase contact point at the water wet surface and at the oil wet surface dullien 1979 showed that at a point contact an element dlof the three phase contact line is subjected to a force σdlwhich has projection along the normal mn given by a2 σ d l sin β which can be simplified as a3 σ d l β σ d l r t r performing the integration along half of the meniscus while assuming that the interfacial tension doesn t change on each half of the meniscus the total force induced by interfacial tension is a4 π r 2 σ 1 r 1 σ 2 r 2 this force must be balanced by static pressure for the mechanical equilibrium of the surface hence we obtain a5 π r t 2 δ p π r t 2 σ 1 r 1 σ 2 r 2 a6 δ p σ 1 r 1 σ 2 r 2 including the equilibrium at line contact the above expression

88,this study presents droplet dynamics due to capillarity wettability interaction through a constricted capillary channel previous research has investigated the droplet motion in a constricted capillary channel with a two dimensional geometry and uniform wettability to determine the critical pressure necessary for the droplet to pass through the constriction but did not consider the change of pressure as the droplet crosses through a constricted geometry to explore the dynamic behavior of droplet motion across a constriction a direct numerical simulation of a droplet in a three dimensional fractionally wet constricted channel is performed where we have two different contact angles on opposing faces of the constriction the results show that the fractional wettability condition significantly affects the evolution of fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces pressure drop and displacement patterns we show that droplet dynamics in a fractionally wet channel do not necessarily follow the same behavior as in a uniform capillary channel and cannot be predicted using uniform wettability surfaces depicted by an average contact angle in particular the pressure difference needed to push the droplet through the restriction with fractional wettability is lower than that for a uniform channel with a constant contact angle representing the less favorable wettability state the fluid fluid meniscus often forms saddle shaped interfaces with curvature of opposite sign in orthogonal directions moreover the effects of droplet size capillary number viscosity ratio and constriction shape are elucidated the pressure difference increases with droplet size and capillary number triangular cross sections can be accessed at a lower pressure because of wetting layer flow keywords 3 d wettability capillarity droplet data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction the physics of multiphase flow in porous media is crucial to many real world applications geological carbon sequestration andrew et al 2014 enhanced oil recovery dang et al 2018 and groundwater soil remediation abdel moghny et al 2012 are only a few examples making well informed decisions on the overall system control and effective operation necessitates a thorough grasp of pore scale phenomena as a result many experimental and numerical research has concentrated on multiphase flow in a simplified porous medium with a single constricted capillary channel the dynamics of a droplet in a capillary channel with constrictions has gained more attention due to its wide application for instance in the design of modern lab on a chip devices many microfluidic networks contain constricted channels larger bubbles can be trapped at the constriction entrance obstructing the flow to unclog the blocked channel an external pressure has to be supplied to force the bubble out of the channel in oil and gas applications the change of droplet location and shape leads to a variation of the pressure drop required to maintain a constant flow rate a large pressure drop is required to deform the drop sufficiently to squeeze through the constriction and in many cases the droplet will be trapped in the pore space some pertinent studies in this field have been performed gardescu 1930 studied analytically the minimum pressure necessary to drive a gas bubble through a constriction and established a mathematical description of resistance based on the interface pressure by solving numerically a generalized washburn equation legait et al 1983 investigated the minimum pressure difference necessary to push a bubble throughout a constricted channel their results have demonstrated that the pressure drop depends on the ratio of the reynolds number to the capillary number based on the boundary integral method martinez and udell 1990 studied drop motion through a constricted capillary channel later tsai and miksis 1994 used a constricted channel to analyze snap off of the droplet lundstrom 1996 theoretically and experimentally examined the movement of bubbles as they passed through a capillary channel that had some restrictions and discussed how pressure drop affected the movement of the bubbles based on energy balance jensen et al 2004 performed a theoretical and numerical analysis of droplet motion in a hydrophilic constriction cobos et al 2008 and later roca and carvalho 2013 investigated the dynamics of emulsion drops through a constricted capillary channel including the trapping of droplets at small capillary numbers they discovered that compared to a single phase fluid an extra driving pressure is necessary to drive the drops out of the constricted channel to examine the mobilization of a trapped discontinuous phase simon et al 2012 built a lab on a chip with a restriction based on the morphological configuration of bubbles at different stages in the contraction liang et al 2015 studied the threshold pressure to drive the droplet through an inclined constricted channel recently liu et al 2021 established the critical pressure for droplets to move through the pore space cerdeira et al 2020 and singla and ray 2021 provided a review of drop dynamics in various microchannel geometrical structures in our recent work we quantitatively determined the minimum pressure required to force an oil droplet through a constriction imani et al 2022 nevertheless all the aforementioned studies were conducted with a two dimensional model these two dimensional simulations may differ significantly from real world applications especially for irregular microchannels in addition to that in two dimensional models it is challenging to precisely represent the interface topography and flow behavior due to complicated droplet shape and dynamics in irregular microchannels two dimensional models could not accurately and effectively characterize the droplet deformation harvie et al 2008 ngo et al 2015 few studies have used three dimensional models to investigate droplet dynamics the investigation of most relevance to the present study is that conducted by zhang et al 2014 who investigated the pressure behavior in different three dimensional contractions other pertinent investigations include the three dimensional simulations of hoang et al 2017 who studied the droplet dynamics in a constricted microchannel using a three dimensional model of a constricted channel zhang et al 2021 elucidated the snap off process based on energy conservation ansari and nobes 2021 carried out an experimental investigation of droplet motion in a constricted channel in order to calculate the pressure field by analyzing the flow field however these studies have focused on a homogeneous wettability with a constant contact angle in the channel while due to their uneven surface chemistry the wettability of the majority of rocks is naturally heterogeneous surface wettability controls multiphase flow blunt 2017 for example in contrast to homogeneous porous media in which the entire rock has the same affinity for the phases in contact heterogeneous porous media have varying fluid affinities in different regions alyafei and blunt 2016 piri and blunt 2005 it is possible for reservoirs to be partially oil wet and partially water wet due to changes in the wettability of the surface that has contacted crude oil salathiel 1973 this is generally known as heterogeneous wettability laroche et al 1999 two types of heterogeneous wettability have been reported in the literature mixed wettability blunt et al 2013 dixit et al 1999 raeesi and piri 2009 and fractional wettability bradford and leij 1995 in the mixed wet condition the surfaces may contain both water wet and oil wet patches which connect across the pore space while the fractionally wet condition is more general and there are surfaces that may either be water wet or oil wet by combining various fractions of oil wet and water wet grains fractionally wet porous media can be reproduced in the laboratory which represent for instance soils containing organic material as first demonstrated by brown and fatt 1956 mcdougall and sorbie 1993 investigated the effectiveness of water injection in fractionally wet porous media to create fractionally wet porous media specific fractions of water and oil wet pores were considered motealleh et al 2008 studied the stability of the fluid fluid meniscus in fractionally wet porous media using cylindrical tubes zheng et al 2021 developed a pore network model to compute the capillary pressure for fractional wet porous media in general previous research lacks a discussion of the impact of heterogeneous wettability as the droplet crosses through the constriction on a 3d three dimensional model assessing the impact of wettability heterogeneity at the pore scale is essential for the development of macroscopic flow models in addition the mechanisms governing the pore scale dynamics of fluid interfaces and their evolution are still unclear most oil reservoirs are heterogeneous meaning they are neither fully water wet nor fully oil wet so our work is necessary to understand displacement processes including pore invasion the wettability heterogeneity of reservoir rocks might result from their internal surface which is made up of a variety of minerals having various surface chemistry and absorption characteristics anderson 1986 studies have shown that the contact angle varies when crude oil and brine are allowed to mature on a solid surface also in electrochemical devices naturally water wet carbon fibres are coated in ptfe to make them partially hydrophobic creating a mixed wet state several works in the past have investigated multiphase flow in heterogeneous wet porous media and discovered clear differences in the fluid behavior in uniform wet systems and in heterogeneous wet systems this study investigates in particular how the deviation from uniform wetting conditions affects the jamin effect the jamin effect is the resistance to the flow due to the change of droplet morphology liu et al 2021 it plays a critical role in the improvement of waterflooding recovery in this work direct numerical simulations dns were used to study the droplet dynamics through a fractionally wet constricted capillary channel we have built a 3d capillary channel with a constriction and simulated both uniform and non uniform types of wettability we investigated the impact of wettability on the evolution of the fluid fluid interface the fluid solid interface and the minimum pressure necessary to drive the droplet through the constricted capillary channel this work makes a contribution by methodically illustrating how important it is to include contact angle distribution in pore network simulations to accurately describe the behavior of multiphase flow dynamics particularly in non uniform porous media moreover the effect of capillary number viscosity ratio and change on the pressure drop across different shapes of constriction was investigated we will demonstrate that the fractional distribution of contact angle affects the droplet dynamics in multiphase flow 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 phase field method the computational fluid dynamics cfd software comsol multiphysics was used to solve the navier stokes n s equation coupled with the phase field method for incompressible fluids the governing equations are 1 u 0 2 ρ u t u u p i μ u u t f s t f e x t here ρ denotes the density kg m3 μ equals the dynamic viscosity ns m2 u represents the velocity m s p denotes the pressure pa f st is the surface tension force acting at the oil water interface and f ext is the external force yue et al 2004 established the phase field variable with range 1 1 to identify the concentration of fluid that changes continuously over the thin interface but keeps constant in the bulk phases to avoid confusion with the viscous dissipation we denote the phase field variable as α in this study α 1 represents the oil phase α 1 represents the water phase and 1 α 1the oil water interface on the solid surfaces the wetted wall condition is set and a contact angle is specified because the no slip boundary condition is not sufficient to characterize the three phase contact line at the surface qian et al 2006 the navier slip has been set bai et al 2017 and it is equal to the mesh element size at the inlet a normal inflow velocity boundary condition b c is assigned and at the outlet a fixed pressure of 0 pa is established considering that both the capillary channel and the flow characteristics are symmetric only one half of the entire system has been simulated in order to reduce computation costs the model adopted a tetrahedral mesh near the inlet and the hexahedral mesh for the remaining parts after a mesh resolution study described in the supplementary material we have adopted a fine mesh with 2317 866 domain elements the selection of a time step of 10 6 s meets the requirements of the courant number and it has been set to adjust automatically depending on backward differentiation to ensure convergence we chose a relative tolerance of 0 001 the model adopted the multifrontal massively parallel sparse direct solver to compute the simulation variables 2 2 model verification a comparison of the results of the present simulation with the analytical model of lucas washburn liu et al 2014 is carried out to verify the model the mathematical formulation is evaluated using a capillary tube to determine if it can replicate multiphase flow in a porous medium the wetting fluid invasion in a capillary channel is dictated by the capillary and viscous forces neglecting the influence of inertia and gravitation the displacement of the meniscus can be determined by 3 σ cos θ 6 r μ w x μ n l x d x d t where θindicates the contact angle σindicates the interfacial tension n m rrepresents the width of the capillary channel µm ldenotes the length of the capillary channel µm μ w andμ n represent the wetting blue and non wetting red phase viscosities pa s after integration eq 3 can be rewritten as 4 μ w μ n 2 x 2 x 0 2 μ n l x x o r σ cos θ 6 t consider a domain with a length of 500 µm and a width of 10 µm and different section lengths l1 150 µm l2 200 µm l3 150 µm l4 75 µm see fig 1 the wetted wall boundary conditions have been set with a specified contact angle of 60 periodic top and bottom boundary conditions are applied to the leftmost l1 and rightmost l3 parts of the system as well as at both ends of the domain to ensure the conservation of mass in the system the fluid viscosities are μ w 10mpa s blue phase and μ n 1mpa s red phase respectively the fluids have been assigned the same density of 1000 kg m3 the interfacial tension is 0 04 n m for the specified fluid flow conditions we demonstrate how the meniscus location changes with time according to fig 2 the displacement of the meniscus determined by the numerical model agrees well with the theoretical solution validating the correctness of the numerical method the droplet motion in a capillary channel is referred to as a piston like displacement we further validate our model by considering two parallel capillaries where a blue phase wetting is injected to displace a red phase non wetting as shown in fig 3 the top and bottom capillary radii are r1 and r2 with r1 r2 respectively the width of the channel is 100 µm the height is 72 µm the top capillary radius is 15 µm and the bottom capillary radius is 12 µm the interfacial tension wetting wall condition and capillary radius are the three variables that must be considered to calculate the capillary pressures using the young laplace equation 5 p c 1 2 σ cos θ r 1 p c 2 2 σ cos θ r 2 the pressure differential between an inlet and an outlet δp pin pout and the capillary pressure determine the displacement behavior from eq 16 we obtain pc1 3333 pa and pc2 2667 pa it can be observed in fig that when δp pc2 the invading phase cannot enter both capillaries at the same time when pc2 δp pc1 see fig 4 b the invading phase flows only into the large capillary even though the invading water phase flows into both capillaries when the differential pressure is such that δp pc1 fig 4 c the displacement is much faster in the larger capillaries fig 5 shows the recovery factor for different pressure drops the recovery factor is zero when δp pc2 as the applied pressure is insufficient to displace oil it increases with the increase of the applied pressure difference it can be shown that these results are in line with the conceptual model which is what for instance pore network simulators are based on 3 discussion and results 3 1 model description the three dimensional geometrical structure of a constricted channel is shown in fig 6 the channel has a square cross section to represent corners and roughness in the pore space legait 1983 the width of this microchannel system is denoted by l which is also regarded as the system s characteristic length one inlet is located upstream and one outlet is located downstream having both a square cross sectional geometry a constriction with a width of 0 34 l is used to connect both parts of the channel the droplet oil phase is positioned in a water filled capillary channel the water phase is injected from the inlet in order to produce sufficient pressure to displace the droplet which is first positioned at the center of l from the entrance having a diameter of d 0 3 l the oil phase viscosity is denoted by μ o while the water phase is μ w similarly the oil and water densities are ρ o and ρ w respectively the properties of fluids are reported in table 1 in this work the flow is characterized by the capillary number ca μv σ where v is the inlet velocity which is the ratio of viscous and capillary forces since the fluids have the same density gravitational effects can be ignored the flow is sufficiently slow that inertial effects encapsulated in the reynolds numbers are also insignificant the characteristic flow time is defined as τ l v note that in the manuscript pressure drop is scaled by σ l time is scaled by τ and surface free energy δf pressure work w and viscous dissipation ϕ are scaled by σl 3 2 dynamics of a droplet in a fractionally wet constricted channel our main focus is the change of droplet morphology as well as the associated change of pressure difference under various wettability conditions a preliminary series of numerical simulations were conducted to comprehend the physics underlying the droplet motion on the surface with uniform and non uniform wettability fig 7 shows the droplet behavior in a homogeneous wettability capillary channel and in a fractionally wetted channel which is obtained by setting the upper wall as strongly water wet contact angle of 45 iglauer et al 2014 and the lower wall as strongly non wetting to water 135 the side walls were also kept in the same condition as the upper walls the aim of this work is to show that the droplet would behave differently in a homogeneous and heterogeneous wetting condition for a fractional wettability case fig 7 b as soon as the droplet reaches the entrance of constriction it is attracted to the lower wall due to its strong affinity for oil at the same time more water flows into the upper wall corners the formation of a thin film at the upper wall entrance indicates that the advancing meniscus does not touch the upper wall as the droplet moves forward the contact line at the lower wall advances faster while the interface at the upper wall is delayed as more water enters the constriction t 0 64 the backward meniscus stretches the meniscus stretch increases as the droplet moves toward the constriction exit therefore on the backward meniscus water and oil flow simultaneously while near the front meniscus water still flows at the channel corners for a uniform wettability the droplet behaves differently for a water wet condition fig 7 a the advancing and receding meniscus are concave at t 0 48 oil bulges into water as the droplet advances inside the constriction the receding meniscus flattens and water can flow into the corners of the channel this is the behavior that would be expected with a hemispherical advancing meniscus as the droplet crosses the restriction the pressure drop increases indicating that external work is being done to force the droplet through the constricted channel fig 8 illustrates the change of pressure drop with time for different surface wettabilities the pressure drop is the difference between the pressures at the inlet and outlet this pressure corresponds to the pressure necessary to squeeze the droplet through a constricted channel it should be noted that for all the cases in this section the fluid has been injected at the same constant velocity for a fractional wettability case the pressure drop keeps constant as the droplet approaches the constriction then oscillates as it enters the constriction due to entrance effects and finally increases sharply to reach the critical value at t 0 56 at this time the droplet has fully entered the constriction interestingly it can be shown that a lower critical pressure drop is required to displace the droplet on a fractionally wetted surface than on a homogeneous surface a similar conclusion has been reported in the work of jahanbakhsh et al 2021 additionally the pressure drop decreases with an increase of channel heterogeneity as shown in fig 8 b another important observation is that the pressure difference between the inlet and outlet is positive this indicates that the positive external work supplied by the injection of water is greater than the surface energy implying that some energy has been dissipated the energy balance can be used to gain more insights into this behavior for isothermal flow the energy balance equation can be obtained directly from the momentum equation thus by integration of eq 2 over the whole computational domain ω the energy conservation law for the multiphase flow process is given as 6 d e k d t d f d t ρ f u t u ϕ d ω where ek is the bulk kinetic energy ek ω 1 2 ρ u 2 dω f is the surface free energy df σ daow cos θ1 da os top cos θ2 da os bottom cos θ2 da os side with aow aos top aos bottom and aos side indicating the fluid fluid interfacial area the oil phase upper wall interfacial area the oil phase lower wall interfacial area and the oil phase side wall interfacial area respectively on the right hand side the first term represents the energy from the external body force such as buoyancy forces which are negligible in this work the second term is the contribution of the work done by the pressure which can be estimated as w δpqdt where w denotes the work done through the flow domain the last term expresses the viscous dissipation energy which can be given by 7 ϕ 2 μ u x 2 v x 2 w x 2 μ u y v x 2 v z w y 2 u z w x 2 where u v and w are the velocities component in x y and z coordinates respectively by the integration of the viscous dissipation energy over the whole volume the viscous dissipation rate can be obtained as φ ωϕdωdt therefore the total energy balance eq 6 can be rewritten as ferrari and lunati 2014 8 d e k d t d f d t d w d t φ if we select two typical times for the mobilization event the energy conservation equation for this time frame can be written as follows 9 δ f w δ e k φ where δf and δek indicates the change of surface and kinetic energies respectively it has been shown that the amount of energy converted to kinetic energy in a slow process is negligible zhu et al 2021 therefore eq 8 is simplified to w δf φ morrow 1970 this implies that the work done on the system is equal to the change of surface free energy and some dissipated energy the driving pressure drop that pushes the discontinuous phase through the constriction can be expressed as 10 δ p w q δ f φ q where q the flow rate can be computed as q vac ac is the cross sectional area of the inlet the injection flow rate being constant the contribution of the energy surface and the viscous dissipation can help to understand the difference in behavior between the homogeneous and the fractional wettability cases first we measure the surface areas between the fluid fluid interface and the solid fluid interface the fluid fluid interface is divided into three sections see fig 9 at the first stage as the droplet enters the constriction the droplet meniscus reconfigures to fit in the constriction and the fluid fluid interface area decreases steeply the fractional wettability case shows the largest drop in area at the second stage during its passage through the constriction the fluid fluid interface area in the fractionally wet constriction keeps increasing while the area is approximately constant in the homogeneous case finally at the last stage the fluid fluid interface increases as the droplet begins to leave the constriction on the other hand the contact area of the droplet with the side wall increases more for fractional wettability the evolution of the fluid top wall is shown in fig 9 b it can be shown that the contact area of the fluid top wall in the homogeneous case increases more than in the fractionally wet example the fluid top wall contact area aos top of the fractionally wet case will further decrease this is justified by the strong adhesion on the lower walls for the same reason the area contacting the lower walls aos bottom is larger in the fractional wetted surface than in homogeneous as be shown by the inserts in fig 9 b the temporal evolution of surface energy for a homogeneous and fractional wetted case is depicted in fig 10 a initially the energy surface keeps constant as the droplet gets closer to the constriction as it passes through the constriction a decrease in surface energy is observed in the fractionally wet case while a slight increase is observed for the homogeneous case the total viscous dissipation energy increases during the motion of droplets inside the constriction moreover more energy is dissipated in the homogeneous case furthermore as the channel becomes more heterogeneous see fig 10 b the viscous dissipation does not change significantly but the increase in surface energy which is negative results in a lower pressure drop as the droplet moves through the constriction furthermore fig 9 b shows that as the positive work is done the droplet advances until it reaches the local pressure maximum at t 0 56 continuous injection will lead to different equilibrium states a much larger pressure is required to be applied to push the droplet out of constriction at t 0 8 we therefore conclude that the critical pressure drop is the maximum of the local pressure maxima at t 0 56 and t 0 8 which correspond to the entrance and exit times the maximum entry pressure decreases with the increase of heterogeneity while the maximum exit pressure keeps constant in their study due to the complexity of water air surfaces in soils bauters et al 2000 suggested the use of an effective contact angle having the same surface energy as the real meniscus an interesting case would be to look at different wettability pairs with their average contact angle therefore according to the characterization of wettability by iglauer et al 2014 we can construct four pairs mix of complete wetting and complete non wetting 0 180 strongly wetting condition and strongly non wetting condition 30 150 mix of weakly wetting condition and weakly non wetting condition 60 120 and their homogeneous average wetting condition 90 in two dimensional models a simplified capillary pressure expression in a fractionally wetted capillary channel can be written as see appendix a 11 p c σ w cos θ t o p cos θ b o t t o m thus all the wetting conditions above would have zero capillary pressure this is not correct however as an assessment of the capillary pressure necessary for droplet to pass through the system moreover this conclusion is applicable to 3d cases under specific conditions fig 11 shows the droplet evolution in constriction with different wetting conditions the top walls are water wet while the lower walls are oil wet because of its strong affinity for oil the droplet is attracted to the lower wall as soon as it approaches the constriction entrance in the complete wetting pair fig 11 a at the same time more water flows into the upper wall corners a nonsymmetric advancing meniscus shape is observed during the capillary flow due to the alternate contact angle as the droplet moves forward the contact line at the lower wall advances faster while the interface at the upper wall delays as more water enters the constriction t 0 64 the backward meniscus of the droplet stretches the meniscus flattens and enlarges as the droplet moves toward the exit of the constriction covering the whole lower surface therefore water and oil flow simultaneously in the constriction a similar behavior is observed in strongly wetting and strongly non wetting pairs fig 11 b it can be observed that at the entrance the spread of the droplet on the lower wall is reduced compared to the case in a furthermore during droplet reconfiguration the receding meniscus stretches more than the advancing meniscus while a greater stretching has been observed in the advancing meniscus for both complete wetting and non wetting pairs later the moving contact line on the backward meniscus will remain pinned on the bottom wall while the advancing meniscus is advancing leading to a similar configuration to the previous case as the droplet is about to break through however the droplet behaves differently in a case of uniform average contact angle 90 at t 0 48 the advancing meniscus shape accommodates the wettability of the surface however it doesn t completely flatten the receding meniscus is convex the droplet inside of the constriction touches the upper and lower walls when the droplet reaches the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus keeps its curvature while the receding meniscus becomes concave at the exit of the constriction the advancing meniscus becomes convex while the receding meniscus becomes less concave at t 0 48 the advancing meniscus shape accommodates the wettability of the surface however it does not completely flatten the receding meniscus is convex the droplet inside the constriction touches the upper and lower walls when the droplet reaches the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus keeps its curvature while the receding meniscus becomes concave at the constriction exit the advancing meniscus becomes convex while the receding meniscus becomes less concave moreover in the fractional wet case different pairs of wettability would behave differently from fig 11 c it can be shown that in the case of 60 120 the droplet contacted all the walls leading to a suppression of corner flow additionally the spread of the droplet on the lower wall is reduced compared to the case of 30 150 as the droplet advances to the middle of constriction the advancing meniscus is a flat surface instead of a curve and the receding meniscus shows a kind of saddle shape with curvatures in principal directions of different sign at the exit of the constriction as the advancing meniscus breaks through water flows through the corners till the droplet completely leaves the constriction the corresponding two dimensional pictures are given in the appendix b to further investigate the difference between the fractionally wet surfaces and their average contact angle the change of pressure during droplet motion is shown in fig 12 as shown previously the wettability greatly influences the pressure distribution in the capillary channel both wettability and pressure drop are critical parameters in multiphase flow for the complete wetting and complete non wetting pairs as the droplet reaches the constriction entrance the pressure drop increases sharply which is followed by a decrease as the droplet spreads on the bottom wall due to the strong adhesion of the droplet a similar behavior is observed for strongly wetting and strongly non wetting pairs however the pressure drop increases in a step wise manner in this case as the droplet enters completely into the constriction the pressure drop decreases significantly in the complete wetting and completely non wetting pair then increases and reaches the maximum value as the advancing meniscus breaks through on the other hand the pressure decreases to a negative value as the droplet enters the constriction then increases to reach a steady state as the droplet has fully entered the constriction the first maximum pressure is reached as the advancing front breaks through the constriction while the second maximum pressure drop occurs because the droplet has fully occupied the exit of the constriction and has blocked the water therefore to balance the constant injected water velocity the pressure drop increases interestingly as shown in fig 12 b the weakly wetting and weakly non wetting pairs behave similarly to the average contact angle case 3 3 effect of droplet size we have shown previously that two parameters are critical while investigating the critical pressure drop the maximum entry pressure and the maximum exit pressure fig 13 shows the maximum entry pressure and exit pressure for different droplet radii the droplet radius is non dimensionalized by the characteristic length l r d r d l as expected the pressure increased with the droplet radius in both cases 30 120 and 45 120 the maximum entry pressure is lower than the maximum exit pressure however when the droplet size becomes large the maximum entrance pressure is suppressed the fluid fluid contact area fig 13 a shows the total filling of the constriction for the larger droplet with the long decrease in fluid fluid interface area with time indicating that the advancing meniscus of the larger droplet breaks through before the receding meniscus can enter through the constriction which means that the entrance pressure remains at zero therefore we can conclude that at ca 2 10 4 a critical pressure drop in a fractionally wetted rectangular channel is dictated by the maximum exit pressure it should also be noted that the droplet experiences a larger critical pressure drop in the case of 45 120 in addition to that the difference between the maximum entrance pressure and exit pressure drop is greater at 45 120 to elucidate the mechanism behind this phenomenon we first quantify the amount of viscous dissipation in each droplet fig 14 shows the ratio of viscous dissipation in the droplet ϕd to the total viscous dissipation ϕ for different droplet radii it should be noted that the capillary number is kept constant for a smaller droplet the viscous dissipation is zero at the beginning of the process a slight increase occurs as the droplet reaches the constriction entrance and decreases as soon as the droplet touches the lower wall of the constriction a similar behavior is observed for a larger droplet this indicates that the droplet deformation does not contribute to the viscous dissipation however as shown in the insert in fig 14 the viscous forces depend on the droplet size for a smaller droplet the water flowing in the corners of the capillary channel leads to a decrease in the flow resistance thus the viscous forces are lower compared to the larger droplet the water phase works as a low viscosity fluid to lubricate the droplet flow on the meniscus in the water channel allowing the droplet to detach from the inner walls because of this the pushing force on the geometrical structure and the viscous force of the water phase channel against the oil water interface both help the droplets move the increase in pressure drop is therefore dependent on the fluid wall contacts the increase in maximum exit pressure may be due to the adhesive forces which become more important at the exit of the constriction thus looking at the contact area between the droplet and the top side and bottom walls it is noticeable that for the larger droplet the maximum contact area of the droplet with the walls is reached when the droplet is about to leave the constriction thus a higher exit pressure drop is required to push the droplet out of the constriction see fig 15 at the same time the fluid fluid interface area decreases as the droplet passes through the constriction and becomes steady when the leading interface breaks through although the smaller droplet shows similar behavior the steady contact area is longer than for the larger droplet resulting in the existence of both maximum entry pressure and maximum exit pressure more importantly the reduced contact area with the walls results in a lower critical pressure drop for a smaller droplet compared to a larger droplet 3 4 effect of capillary number and viscosity ratio we have shown previously that at a fixed low ca the maximum exit pressure dominates the flow behavior however this is not always true for every injection velocity in this section we investigate the effects of viscosity ratio rη on the dynamics of a droplet as it passes through the constriction the viscosity ratio is changed by holding water viscosity constant and changing oil viscosity the viscosity affects the behavior of the pressure drops fig 16 shows the pressure drop change at different viscosity ratios at low viscosity the maximum entry pressure is larger than the maximum exit pressure at a viscosity ratio of log rη 0 1 both pressure drops are almost equal when the viscosity ratio becomes larger than log rη 0 1 the maximum exit pressure drop becomes larger than the maximum entrance pressure drop another crossing point is reached at a viscosity ratio of log rη 2 5 therefore there is a lower critical point and a higher critical point with a further increase in viscosity ratio the maximum entry pressure dominates the maximum exit pressure the behavior of a droplet for different capillary numbers is investigated different capillary numbers are obtained by changing the inlet velocity at a fixed viscosity ratio of 1 both the maximum entry pressure drop and the maximum exit pressure drop increase linearly with the capillary number as shown in fig 17 in fact when two phases flow simultaneously in porous media at lower ca the mobilizing pressure drop and viscous force are smaller resulting in lower flow resistance on the other hand for the fluids flowing at higher ca the mobilizing pressure drop and the viscous force would be higher leading to higher flow resistance moreover the viscous force that is translated to the drag force on the interface increases as ca increases allowing the other phase to remove more oil from the wall contact while displacing the droplet the maximum exit pressure is always greater than the maximum entry pressure at large capillary numbers the difference between the maximum entrance pressure and the maximum exit pressure decreases we can finally write that the critical pressure drop δp can be expressed as follows 11 δ p max e n t r p r e s s e x p r e s s the primary objective of this study was to systematically assess the two phase behavior from numerical simulations of droplet motion for parameters including wettability viscosity ratio and capillary number on the temporal evolution of wetted area fig 18 shows the change in the contact area between fluid fluid and fluid solid for different capillary numbers and viscosity ratios at a fixed ca 3 375 10 3 the fluid fluid interface area decreases more for a small viscosity ratio than for a larger viscosity ratio as the droplet enters the constriction while the contact area slightly remains constant for the small viscosity the fluid fluid interfacial area increases monotonically for the larger viscosity ratio similarly the contact area at the bottom wall for the low viscosity ratio increases then move steadily before decreasing when the droplet is leaving the constriction while it increases then decreases for a larger viscosity ratio although the maximum contact area with the top wall is observed for the larger viscosity both viscosity ratios show the same behavior interestingly more oil contacts the side wall at a small viscosity ratio than at a larger viscosity ratio the same overall behavior is repeated at a large capillary number except that the events take place in a short time at the same viscosity ratio the droplet contacts more with the side walls and the fluid fluid interface area decreases more at the small capillary number in addition to that the increased capillary number leads to a slight decrease in the contact area with the top wall 3 5 effect of constriction shape current pore network models feature an angular porous structure and throats with non circular cross sections allowing for the existence of pores that are only partially saturated the pressure drop was investigated to elucidate the dynamics of a discontinuous phase flow in fractional wet capillaries with different cross sectional geometries in all the cases only the constriction shape has been modified the wettability of the top and side walls of the channel has been set as 45 and on the bottom wall the wettability has been set as 120 fig 19 shows the pressure drop in capillaries with circular triangular square quadrilateral and pentagonal cross sections for a triangular cross section the pressure remains constant as the droplet advances towards the constriction and a slight increase in pressure occurs as the droplet approaches the entrance of the constriction as soon as the droplet touches the lower wall the pressure drop becomes negative until a larger portion of the droplet enters into the constriction this decrease may be due to an instability of the fluid fluid interface the meniscus instability caused by a rapid change in the size of a confined region reduces its resistance to flow and raises local velocities later the pressure increases to become positive again according to fig 19 the pressure rise in a triangular geometry occurs late and is not steep compared to both pentagonal and circular geometries as a result the instability effect on the interface dynamics is greater in pentagonal and circular constriction geometries than in square constriction the pressure drop becomes steady as the droplet has fully entered the constriction and is moving toward the exit where a higher pressure will be required to force the droplet out of the constriction although similar behavior is observed for all the cross sections few observations can be made the largest pressure drop is observed in the circular cross section while the lowest pressure drop is seen in the triangular cross sectional constriction where wetting layer flow is most favored this implies that residual oil in triangular constrictions can be easily mobilized this can be explained by the fact that the saturation of water square is larger than for the pentagonal and circular cross section as can be shown in fig 20 since it can now easily be retained in the corners of the pore space therefore the viscous force in the water phase against the oil water interface would contribute to the decrease in resistance which results in a lower pressure drop on the other hand in high order polygons the resistance of oil goes up as water saturation goes down the resistance is at its highest when the cross section is a circle the existence of the corners in non circular channel affects the equilibrium configurations and leads to interface complicated behavior to further illustrate the behavior described in fig 19 we investigate the movement of interfaces as the droplet passes through the constriction see fig 21 the change of pressure and its corresponding interface motion can be described in three steps first the decrease in pressure corresponds to the contact of the front meniscus with the constriction walls corner flow can be observed as the droplet crosses the triangular constriction this behavior is reduced in a square cross section and completely suppressed in a circular constriction the larger contact area of the droplet with the constriction walls results in a greater decrease of pressure drop a negative pressure is also observed in triangular and circular cross sections however since the contact area with the walls is greatly reduced in the pentagonal cross section the balanced forces result in a positive and short pressure drop the second step corresponds to the steady state at this stage the droplet is flowing at a nearly constant pressure drop the simultaneous flow of water and oil droplet in the triangular and square constrictions leads to a lower steady pressure drop the small contact area with the triangular constriction wall indicates that more water flows simultaneously with the droplet this confirmed our previous assumptions in the regular polygons with n sides greater than four the corner flow is eliminated due to the cross section and the walls wettability furthermore a saddle shape meniscus is observed in the backward meniscus of a droplet in the pentagonal constriction it becomes even more pronounced in the circular cross section at the same time the advancing meniscus admits a convex curvature the third stage is the critical state which occurs when the front meniscus breaks through to the next pore at this stage the pressure drop is the largest similarly to previous stages there is a coflow in both triangular and square constriction the droplet deformation leads to an increase in pressure drop the front meniscus sticks on the lower wall while the backward meniscus slips until the droplet will completely break through in the square cross section the droplet stretches more as it is breaking through allowing some water to flow along the upper interface the backward meniscus of the droplet in the pentagonal constriction flattens thus the saddle shape is reduced however in the circular constriction the distance between the upper contact line and the lower contact line increases significantly with further water injection the advancing front will stick to the walls and the backward will slip towards the exit of the constriction fig 22 shows that the fluid fluid contact area is greatly reduced in the circular cross section the area slightly increases as the droplet reconfigurates in the constriction during the steady state which is only an apparent one the increase in fluid fluid interface is more pronounced in the square constriction resulting in the stretching of the droplet as discussed before furthermore the viscous dissipation in different capillaries is investigated fig 23 shows the temporal evolution of the viscous dissipation rate for different cross sections when a droplet flows through a large pore the viscous dissipation remains constant an abrupt increase occurs as the droplet enters the constriction similar to the above results the dissipated energy is larger in a circular cross section and smaller in a triangular cross section the curves in fig 23 show a decrease increase profile before reaching a steady state the first profile occurs at the entrance of the constriction while the second occurs near the constriction exit as in accordance with the pressure drop evolution as evident from the pressure drops fig 19 more energy is dissipated as the droplet reaches the exit of the constriction leading to a higher pressure drop fig 24 shows the change of critical pressure drop with capillary number the pressure drop increases linearly with the capillary number for all the constriction geometries it can be observed that for the pentagonal and circular cross section the pressure decreases at a very low capillary number furthermore although the droplet experienced a lower pressure drop in triangular cross sectional constriction it took longer to break through especially at a very low capillary number 3 6 comparison with previous work zhang et al 2014 performed a similar study on the passage of a blood cell through a circular constricted channel they discovered that when a cell moves at a steady speed through a filtering channel the pressure in the channel rises and then falls when the cell enters the constriction the maximum pressure occurs when the cell exits the channel the minimum pressure occurs as a result this maximum pressure is the critical pressure for a cell s effective passage event however we observed that the entrance pressure is not always the maximum pressure different conditions may lead to different regimes entrance pressure drop dominated or exit pressure drop dominated this may also be due to the difference in behavior between a cell and an oil droplet when analyzing the effects of constriction shape they showed that the circular shape produced the highest pressure drop followed by the square cross section and the triangular cross section this result agrees well with our findings moreover this conclusion was also confirmed in the unconstricted capillary channel long et al 2019 the results reported in this work clearly show that in pore network modeling where the capillary channel is similar to the pore body and pore throat it is necessary to model the throat as a separate entity including both the wettability and the shape 4 summary and conclusions in this paper three dimensional direct numerical simulation was employed to investigate the droplet dynamics in a fractionally wet capillary channel with different contact angles on different walls our results give fundamental insights concerning pressure drop and interface evolution which are essential for an accurate description of flow in porous media where the contact angle is rarely locally constant a series of numerical simulations with homogeneous and heterogeneous wettability have been carried out to understand two phase flow droplet dynamics including pressure drop analyses of the area of the fluid fluid interface fluid solid interface and pressure drop are greatly influenced by the wettability of the channel we observed that the pressure drop in a homogeneous capillary channel is larger than in a fractionally wet capillary due to the significant decrease in surface energy as the droplet passes through a constriction in addition to that the pressure drop decreases with an increase in channel heterogeneity the pressure drop decreases as the bottom wall becomes more oil wet this implies that the capillary pressure would be lower with the increase of fractions of oil wet pores in porous media thus the channel heterogeneity improves the sweep efficiency in macroscopic flow we have also shown that the droplet in a fractionally wet channel does not necessarily behave in the same manner as in the homogeneous channel with the corresponding average contact angle the threshold pressure drop is also lower than a system of uniform wettability with the less favorable wettability state however the weakly wetting and weakly non wetting pairs behave similar to the neutrally wet condition the channel heterogeneity promotes a decrease in flow resistance thus the effect of jamin resistance is considerably reduced one key observation that can only be seen in three dimensional simulations is that the fluid fluid menisci often form saddle shaped interfaces with positive curvature in one direction and a negative curvature in an orthogonal direction this is something that is normally ignored in pore scale simulations and demonstrates the need to perform three dimensional simulations furthermore we found that the critical pressure is the maximum value between the entrance pressure drop and the exit pressure the pressure drop increases with the droplet size and the exit pressure is greater than the entrance pressure at fixed ca 3 375 10 3 the entrance pressure drop is the maximum pressure at viscosity ratio less than log rη 0 1 and greater than log rη 2 5 at a fixed viscosity ratio of log rη 1 the exit pressure drop is always greater than the entrance pressure at different capillary number the displacement of trapped oil is easier in triangular cross section than in circular geometries because of wetting layer flow which is governed by the half angle of the throat corners the wetting layer flow affects the flow conductance which can be used to determine the relative permeability the minimum pressure increases with the increase of shape factor and more energy is dissipated in circular channels this also implies that the time necessary to fill a pore or to form an oil bank is reduced with the shape factor this is important for pore network modeling where pores and throats are given a cross section with a shape factor and an inscribed radius this work contributes to existing knowledge of multiphase flow through porous media by providing insights into the wettability effect on fluid fluid and fluid solid interfaces the results have shown that it is necessary to consider a pore by pore analysis in heterogeneous porous media and can be also applied in various domains including microfluidic device design groundwater remediation and geological sequestration of co2 this work gives also more insights into the mechanisms by which fluid fluid interfaces travel through pores future work could explore more realistic geometries derived from for instance pore scale imaging combined with the use of machine learning to predict threshold

appendix c supplementary materials image application 1 appendix a derivation of capillary pressure based on young laplace equation the dynamic pressure jump at the front meniscus can be estimated from the formula a1 p c σ κ h κ v in a quadrilateral cross sectional geometry the computation of the capillary pressure at the advancing meniscus can be simplified by neglecting the principal curvature in one direction therefore the problem is reduced to a two dimensional calculation to derive the pressure drop induced at the front interface the capillary channel is divided into two parts as shown in fig 25 let us consider the three phase contact point at the water wet surface and at the oil wet surface dullien 1979 showed that at a point contact an element dlof the three phase contact line is subjected to a force σdlwhich has projection along the normal mn given by a2 σ d l sin β which can be simplified as a3 σ d l β σ d l r t r performing the integration along half of the meniscus while assuming that the interfacial tension doesn t change on each half of the meniscus the total force induced by interfacial tension is a4 π r 2 σ 1 r 1 σ 2 r 2 this force must be balanced by static

89,gas liquid displacement in porous media widely exists in many terrestrial extraterrestrial subsurface resource extraction and utilization applications the typical fingering displacement during gas invading has been well identified through extensive research efforts yet the evolution of fingering structures after invading breakthrough is rarely reported herein through a joint approach of experimental flow imaging and digital image processing we investigated the gas liquid fingering displacement in a porous patterned microfluidic chip from the breakthrough moment until reaching the steady state with a wide range of capillary number ca and viscosity ratio m we visualized the evolution of finger morphologies in different flow regimes including capillary fingering cf viscous fingering vf and crossover zone cz interestingly we found that finger structures of cf regime remain the same after the breakthrough whereas fingers of vf regime keep expanding until almost all the pore space is invaded and eventually reaches to steady state followed with experimental observations a comparative quantification of fingering patterns was also conducted in terms of invasion velocity phase saturation and fractal dimension a dramatic increase of gas saturation from 0 15 to 0 60 at the case of log10ca 5 17 and log10m 2 78 is obtained in the vf regime when the steady state is reached so is the fractal dimension from 0 14 to 0 16 even higher than one of cf the underlying mechanism of such fingering expansion in vf is further revealed from the time evolution of fingering after breakthrough a previously unobserved fingering cycle consisting of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing keeps repeating until the saturation reaches the maximum we believe that these findings are of significance in evaluating extraction effectiveness economic benefits and storage safety for subsurface applications keywords gas liquid displacement fingering invasion interface instability porous media invasion hydrodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction gas liquid displacement in microscale porous structures is an essential process in many natural phenomena and industrial applications often due to the viscosity contrast between invading and defending phase instability generates at the interface and fingering displacement pattern arises this beautiful physical phenomenon however imposes great complexity for many applications ranging from small to large scales like fuel cells and flow battery shojaei et al 2022 membrane based water filtration samuel et al 2022 geological carbon sequestration gcs singh et al 2020 bakhshian and sahimi 2017 soltanian et al 2017 hydrogen storage tarkowski 2019 underground water contamination lee et al 2010 and remediation of nonaqueous liquids porter et al 2010 therefore extensive research efforts have been dedicated to investigate the fingering pattern and its evolution in porous media during the gas liquid displacement process white et al 2005 wang et al 2018 2016 when a less viscous fluid displaces a higher viscous fluid in porous media the saffman taylor instability saffman and taylor 1958 occurs the variability of the porous media structure could further induce significant velocity fluctuations at the pore scale and mixing of the fluids at the macroscale the research of instability dynamics at core scale aryana and kovscek 2012 and macroscale furtado and pereira 2003 have also been intensively studied wang et al 2020 conducted the scaling analysis and derived a generalized scaling correlation for two phase flow in fractal permeability fields the expression of flow instability is scale independent and fingering dynamics is often observed and investigated at a small scale like pore scale or core scale it was found that capillary force related dynamic capillary pressure relaxation time silin and patzek 2004 and transient flow states sun et al 2021 have an impact on the dynamics of interface instability usually the displacement process is characterized by two dimensionless numbers the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio of the invading phase to the defending phase m which are respectively expressed by 1 ca μ i u i σ d 2 m μ i μ d here μ i and μ d denote dynamic viscosity of the invading and defending phases respectively ui is the darcy velocity of the invading phase and σ d is the interfacial tension these two dimensionless numbers are used to evaluate the competition of the surface tension force and viscous force that dominate the displacement process as a function of log10m and log10ca a phase diagram of different flow regimes is classified from fingering morphologies consisting of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf crossover zone cz and stable displacement sd lan et al 2020 cao et al 2016 lenormand et al 1988 and zhang et al 2011 proposed phase boundaries to distinguish different displacement patterns which is widely accepted by researchers as a dependable reference extensive studies have been contributed to the effects of ca and m on fingering patterns chen et al 2017 2018 often the patterns are investigated quantitatively with parameters like cap velocity ruith and meiburg 2000 finger width hu et al 2020 number of fingers yang et al 2021 interface curvature scanziani et al 2020 levaché and bartolo 2014 rabbani et al 2018 breakthrough time ruith and meiburg 2000 yang et al 2021 invading area guo et al 2019 and saturation yang et al 2021 takeuchi et al 2022 fractal dimension hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 and pressure difference takeuchi et al 2022 primkulov et al 2019 in the above studies different approaches either experimental or numerical modeling are applied primkulov et al 2019 proposed a novel moving capacitor dynamic network model to reproduce experimental observations of immiscible fluid fluid displacement in porous media for the first time the injection pressure can be measured from the model the injection pressure signal can be used to directly infer the character of the multiphase flow displacement which is useful for detailed experiments mejia et al 2021 combined experiments and lattice boltzmann lbm simulations to study the influence of irreducible water mobilization on centimeter scale flow patterns during favourable pore scale displacements it was found that an unstable displacement of viscous oil resulted from less viscous and irreducible water the result of simulations showed that the irreducible water was mobilized ahead of the injected water forming fingers it is noticed that most of the studies are for a small range of ca and m and limited to the fingering characterization only before or at breakthrough evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough is still of great importance in evaluating the extraction effectiveness economic benefits and storage safety in the subsurface applications eventually the displacement pattern does not change further and the saturation reaches a plateau this state is defined as steady state in this study mathematical models based on non equilibrium effects were developed hassanizadeh and gray 1993 barenblatt et al 2002 and gradually modified aryana and kovscek 2013 wang et al 2018 2019 to describe the two phase displacement process and possibly to predict the steady state yet the evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough until reaching a steady state remains unclear in particular for different flow regimes such as vf cf and cz the dynamical transition of fingering patterns from breakthrough to steady state and the underlying mechanisms are rarely investigated so far hu et al 2020 in this study targeting fingering dynamics after breakthrough and the steady state we conducted flow imaging on the gas liquid displacement process in a microfluidic chip with regular porous structures by using air to displace water glycerol mixture we are able to have a wide range of ca and m and thus three different flow regimes vf cf and cz the fingering displacement morphologies of each flow regime were visualized at the breakthrough moment and at the steady state a quantitative analysis of the invasion velocity area and complexity was conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism of fingering dynamics after breakthrough finally the complete dynamical evolution process of the finger before and after breakthrough was studied to enhance the understanding of the overall invasion process in porous media 2 experimental method and flow image processing 2 1 experimental setup and flow imaging procedures fingering displacement was performed on a microfluidic platform as illustrated in fig 1 before the displacement experiment the microfluidic chip has to be saturated with the liquid to do this a vacuum pump was used to remove the air from porous media until the vacuum degree was close to 10 2 bar the liquid was then injected into the porous media by a syringe pump new era ne 4000 until all the void area was filled with the liquid because of the high vacuum the liquid flow rate was carefully kept 20 ml h during the saturation to start the air liquid displacement experiment air was introduced into the chip by using the syringe pump to suck the liquid at the desired flow rate in the reverse direction the pressure drop between the air inlet and liquid outlet forced the air to displace the liquid from the porous spaces due to the viscosity difference between invading and defending fluid fingering displacement appeared in the porous media this process was recorded by a high speed camera phantom v611 with a lens micro nikkor 105mm at a 20μs exposure time the illumination was provided by a light source motic mlc 150c a 1280 256 recording window at 24 2000 fps with a 47 62 μm pixel spatial resolution was performed on the whole porous domain of the microchip to record the whole fingering displacement the geometry and schematic of the porous patterned microfluidic chip are shown in fig 2 the chip from dolomite was purchased and used without modification its material is quartz glass with 5 nm surface roughness ra which is intrinsically hydrophilic with a measured contact angle of 38 3 for water the surface roughness on the channel surface due to the etching process would further increase the surface hydrophilicity also through our contact angle measurements see the last row of table 1 it was found that glycerol has a negligible effect on the static contact angle the microfluidic chip consists of a gas inlet a liquid outlet and a 60 10 mm rectangular porous domain with a porosity ω of 0 633 to have a uniform inflow and outflow of the porous media the channels with a tree shaped layout were assembled to the gas inlet and liquid outlet the pore throat networks of this porous media domain are designed for statistically representative modeling of a complex porous sandstone rock structure the micrograph of the porous pattern in fig 2 b shows that different shaped lattices are ordered in the porous domain forming a straight channel and 2 types of constricted throats as shown in fig 2 c the cross section of the straight channel is close to a circle the width wc wt1 and wt2 of the straight channel throat 1 and throat 2 are 110 μm 85 μm and 63 μm respectively with the same depth d of 100 μm 2 2 fluid properties and experimental conditions to have a wide range of viscosity ratios the mixtures of deionized water and glycerol with different concentrations 0 40 60 80 were used as the defending phase physical properties of the invading phase and the defending phase were shown in table 1 the corresponding viscosity ratio m varied from log10m 1 75 to log10m 3 53 as shown in table 2 in order to generate different types of fingering patterns we used different flow rates for having a wide range of capillary numbers ca the flow rates of air were set as 0 1 1 10 100 1000 ml h and the corresponding ca varied from log10ca 8 17 to log10ca 4 17 as shown in table 2 2 3 image processing method the patterns of fingering displacement were extracted from the images recorded by the high speed camera the procedure of image processing is shown in fig 3 when the porous domain was fully filled with liquid the background images with about 1000 frames were captured to calculate the average gray level of the background pixel by pixel as shown in fig 3 a then the average background image was divided by the raw image fig 3b pixel by pixel the gray level of the finger pattern is much lower than that of the background as shown in fig 3 b after division the gray level of the background is close to 1 1 2 while the gray level of the finger pattern is much higher than 1 2 therefore the threshold of binarization was set to 1 2 to remove the background and binarize the images as shown in fig 3 c d this procedure was implemented by an in house code in matlab common algorithms i e box counting were applied to estimate the invading velocity invading area and fractal dimension which will be discussed further in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow regime and fingering pattern morphology by tuning the injection velocities for air invading into gly water mixtures we were able to study the different regimes of gas fluid fingering displacement in fig 4 we plotted all the experimental cases in the phase diagram that consists of capillary fingering viscous fingering crossover zone and stable displacement the colored areas are the regions of different displacement patterns defined by lenormand et al 1988 based on simulations and experiments in a pore network with the current ca and m the cases in this study cover the regimes of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf and crossover zone cz which are indicated by green circles blue triangles and red rectangles respectively fig 4 shows that almost all the cases in the study are located in the cz region defined by lenormand et al 1988 which indicates a disagreement with this flow regime phase diagram the black solid lines represent the boundaries with a narrower crossover zone proposed by zhang et al 2011 which can predict the present data because the homogeneity of porous media would reduce the size of the crossover zone the porous media used by zhang et al 2011 is homogenous and the porous pattern of the chip in this study is formed by regularly arranged lattices see fig 2 therefore it is unlikely for the viscous fingering and capillary fingering patterns to coexist but when the log10ca is higher than 6 17 the flow patterns both become viscous fingering so there are two vf cases locating in the cz region and the boundary line is close to the cf region recently guo and aryana 2019 also reported the boundaries red dashed lines in fig 4 based on the drainage process in the pore network that represents the pore distribution of berea sandstone the crossover zone between the cf and the vf is narrower compared with that of zhang et al 2011 fig 4 shows a decent agreement in the cf region our cf cases perfectly locate the cf region of guo and aryana 2019 two boundaries between vf and sd are in the lower log10m zone compared with that of zhang et al 2011 so there exists little deviation in the vf region interface destabilization and fingering pattern at the interface were firstly reported by saffman and taylor 1958 when a less viscous fluid invades into another more viscous fluid in porous media here we show the fingering morphologies at the breakthrough moment fig 5 a and when the displacement reaches steady state fig 5 b in different flow regimes for convenience the symbols with letters and numbers a1 a2 d4 d5 were used to represent the different experimental cases in fig 5 a the viscous fingering appears at higher log10ca in this region the viscous force mainly controls the process of displacement because of the higher velocity of the invading phase therefore gas prefers to invade forward rather than lateral forming a relatively narrow and straight flow path the branches and thin fingering patterns are highlighted in the green patterns of fig 5 a with the increase of viscosity ratio log10m the number of fingers increases the reason is that the lower viscosity of the defending fluid the weaker resistance which makes it easier for gas to form new invading paths the region of capillary fingering is located in the region with lower log10ca and higher log10m because of the lower velocity of the invading phase and the lower viscosity of the defending phase the viscous force can be neglected and the capillary force dominates the flow in our porous patterned chip narrow throats with smaller channel diameter can generate larger capillary driving forces than the straight channels therefore the gas will both invade forward and spread lateral throats channels which results in a larger finger width in comparison to the viscous fingering as indicated in the blue region of fig 5 a moreover the displacement fingering pattern becomes even wider at higher log10m specifically at case d1 it covers almost the entire porous domain all the above observations on fingering patterns at breakthrough moment align well with the widely reported results as a step further we have also investigated the evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough by continuously injecting the gas until the displacement reaches to steady state fig 5 b describes fingering morphologies among different regimes at the steady state after comparing the morphologies at breakthrough moment it is found that the capillary fingering stops expanding at the breakthrough moment in the cf regime whereas the viscous fingering continues to expand until almost all the void area is filled in the vf regime as a result a significant increase of invaded area is observed from breakthrough moment to steady state in the vf regime with only small uninvaded areas near the inlet among all the three regimes the gas finger in the cz regime invades the smallest area from breakthrough to steady state in many applications like subsurface hydrocarbon extraction and geological carbon hydrogen storage it is required to maximize the storage capacity without having a leakage risk the displacing dynamics after breakthrough then becomes important in the economic evaluation and risk analysis hence a detailed quantitative analysis of the fingering patterns and invading phase distribution is then provided in the next section 3 2 comparative quantification of fingering patterns at breakthrough moment and steady state before breakthrough the invasion velocity is characterized by the velocity of finger cap ucap by using the binarized image of the displacement process a self developed matlab code was applied to identify the finger cap and to track its position for every frame in this way we are able to obtain the velocity of finger cap u cap from the slope of the curve of position versus time the ucap is displayed against log10ca and log10m in fig 6 a the invasion velocity in the vf region is faster compared with that in the cf and cz regions the lowest invasion velocity occurs in the cf region it should be noted that the velocity of finger cap ucap decreases with the increase of log10m at log10ca 8 17 although the resistance becomes lower as the liquid viscosity decreases the capillary force mainly controls the invasion process in the cf region which allows the gas to mainly percolate in bypass channels as shown in fig 5 however the opposite trend was found in the vf region in order to display the variation of ucap with log10m more intuitively ucap in the vf region was mapped in fig 6 b the velocity of finger cap ucap increases with the increase of log10m in the vf region which is opposite to the one in the cf region this can be explained by the invading path previously observed in fig 5 where the forward invasion dominates the vf region the resistance becomes weaker at higher log10m the less viscous liquid therefore the velocity of finger cap ucap increases fig 6 b also shows that ucap slightly increases with the increase of log10ca this demonstrates that the effect of gas flow rate on the invasion velocity decreases in the vf region therefore in order to enlarge the invasion velocity reducing the liquid viscosity and increasing the gas flow rate have to be considered to transform the pattern from cf to vf the breakthrough time tb is also an important parameter to characterize the velocity of invasion it is the elapsed time for the finger cap to invade from the inlet to the outlet and is displayed against log10ca and log10m in fig 6 c the breakthrough time tb is shorter in the vf region than that in the cf and cz regions because a faster ucap can significantly reduce tb the minimum time to breakthrough is only 0 48 s at the highest log10m and log10ca however the breakthrough time tb in the cf region is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the shortest time such a large difference demonstrates that the displacement patterns have an important impact on the invasion time as shown in fig 6 d the breakthrough time tb in the vf region is inversely proportional to log10m and log10ca because the velocity of finger cap ucap in the vf region is proportional to log10m and log10ca saturation s can be used to characterize the displacement efficiency which is expressed by eqs 3 and 4 3 s b a b l w φ 4 s s a s l w φ here a b and a s indicate the displacement area of the invading phase at the breakthrough moment and the steady state respectively l and w denote the length and width of the porous domain respectively φ is the porosity of the porous domain fig 7 a presents the distribution of saturation sb at the breakthrough moment on the diagram of log10m and log10ca at the breakthrough moment the saturation sb in the cf region is the highest compared with that in the vf and cz regions because the fingers in the cz and vf regions mainly invade forward which forms the elongated finger as shown in fig 5 the finger in the cf region invades in the lateral bypass channels and even covers the entire porous domain the maximum sb at the case log10ca 8 17 log10m 1 75 is 0 73 the saturation sb increases with the increase of log10m in the cf region log10ca 8 17 because fluid with a lower viscosity provides a weaker resistance force as mentioned above displacement in the vf and cz regions will continue after breakthrough therefore the ss at the steady state is estimated and mapped in fig 7 b after breakthrough the saturation in the vf region grows significantly whereas the saturation in the cz region increases slightly which are both obviously reflected by the fingering morphologies in fig 5 fig 7 a confirms that sb in the vf region is close to 0 15 when reaching the steady state the saturation ss increases to 0 60 which is 4 times that of sb at the case of log10ca 5 17 and log10m 2 78 most of the saturation is obtained after breakthrough a similar result was also reported by hu et al 2020 besides ss in the vf region increases with the increase of log10ca however liquid viscosity seems to have a negligible effect on ss and sb in the vf region the normalized increment of saturation from the breakthrough moment to steady state is defined by the saturation gain ratio ss sb sb as shown in fig 7 c the saturation gain ratio in the cf region is close to zero while its value in the vf region ranges from 1 0 to 3 0 this agrees with previous experimental observations where the invading gas in the cf region with a low flow rate can only flow along the previously formed invading paths we also find that the saturation gain ratio increases with the increase of log10ca in the vf region as the invading phase with a high flow rate can continuously invade new areas therefore the invasion behaviour of gas after breakthrough is of great significance to study it can provide the potential guidance of achieving relatedly high displacement efficiency in a short time and determining whether it is cost effective to continue gas injection after breakthrough in industrial applications finger complexity can be quantified by fractal dimension fd the box counting method liebovitch and toth 1989 was used to estimate fractal dimension at the breakthrough moment fdb and at the steady state fds the image is partitioned into the boxes and the number of boxes n occupied by the pattern is counted as the resolution scale δ size of box decreases after fitting the curve in fig a the fractal dimension fd can be obtained by eq 5 5 f d lim δ 0 log n log δ as shown in fig 8 b the fractal dimension fdb at the breakthrough moment in the cf region is the highest compared with that in the vf and cz regions which means a more complex finger forms in the cf region in the cf region log10ca 8 17 the fractal dimension fdb increases with the increase of log10m when the invading phase invades into a less viscous liquid it will encounter a weaker resistance which facilitates an increase in finger complexity the maximum fractal dimension fdb is 1 636 in the case of log10m 1 75 and log10ca 8 17 a similar result is also found in the vf and cz regions the fractal dimension fdb has a proportional relationship with log10m similar to saturation the fractal dimension grows significantly in the vf region after breakthrough fig 8 b confirms that fdb in the vf region is close to 1 4 after reaching the steady state fds approaches 1 6 as shown in fig 8 c which means the complexity of fingering increases after breakthrough besides the complexity of fingering in the vf region increases with the increase of log10ca it should be noted that the fractal dimension maps of the fdb and fds on the diagram of log10m and log10ca are similar to the saturation maps of sb and ss in another word more invaded area represents the generation of more fingering branches and correspondingly fd increases all in all from the breathrough moment to the steady state the increase of the invasion area is manifested in the increase of saturation and fingering complexity to reveal the underlying reasons it is also worthy to look into the dynamical fingering displacement and evolution of patterns 3 3 dynamical fingering displacement from breakthrough to steady state studying the dynamical fingering displacement process can help deepen the understanding of the formation of finger patterns and their evolution at different stages of invasion in porous media when the gas enters from the inlet the invasion begins finger gradually forms at the gas liquid interface the elapsed time in the invading process until the cap reaches the outlet is tb images recorded by the high speed camera were painted in different colors according to different periods from 0 to tb as shown in fig 9 a so that the location of the invasion can be distinguished in each period during the earlier period of invasion painted in blue the gas invades uniformly as the invasion progresses the interface gradually becomes unstable the compact invasion blue area is broken by one or two preferential flow paths green area and the finger is generated as shown in fig 9 a because of the lower gas flow rate this phenomenon is more pronounced in the cf region bottom image in fig 9 a compared with that in the cz and vf regions the top and middle images in the final period of invasion highlighted in white color in fig 9 a there is a sudden rise in fingering branches the rises are more prominent in the cz and cf regions which also can be demonstrated by the sudden increase at the end of the saturation curve in fig 9 b a similar result was found by chen et al 2017 it is because the viscous force becomes insignificant and the capillary force controls the invasion process gradually the capillary dispersion effect allows the cap to invade the branches it is also interesting to see that the newly invaded yet very small area highlighted in red and white color appears near the inlet in the vf region before breakthrough however this newly invaded area is hardly observed in the cz and cf regions this observation provides a strong hint that different invading process would occur for different flow regimes after breackthrough which motivate us to continue the investigation from breakthrough to steady state in fig 9 b we also show the corresponding saturation curve as a function of the normalized location of finger cap x cap l the saturation increases as the cap goes forward for all cases and a step wise increase can be seen in the curve of saturation in the cf and cz regions meanwhile the slope of the saturation curve in the cf region is larger than those in the vf and cz regions the reason is that capillary dispersion and finger widening enhances the increasing speed of saturation when continuously injecting gas after breakthrough dramatic changes of fingering patterns are observed in the vf regime fig 10 a shows the evolution of invasion process in the vf region from breakthrough moment tb to steady state ts most of the invaded area is located near the outlet except for case d3 leaving most of the uninvaded area near the inlet for case d3 the green and blue patterns occupied the most area which means that saturation is close to ss in earlier times as the increasing of liquid viscosity the speed of invasion slowed down there is still the newly invaded area when approaching ts as shown in the white and red pattern of case a3 part of the newly invaded region is also located near inlet fig 10 b verified that the saturation curve is approximately linear in the early stage the slope of curve decreases with the increasing of liquid viscosity it is also noticed that the curve has a turning point near ts as indicated by the dotted circles in fig 10 b after the turning point the curves start to flatten level off toward the end when digging into the underlying causes a previously unobserved finger vanishing and re forming cycle is found from the flow images taking the case a3 as an example fig 11 shows the development of fingering during the period between the breakthrough moment and steady state to better distinguish different paths were painted in different colors firstly the uniform invasion near the inlet is broken by two preferential flow paths 1 and 3 because the invading speed of path 3 is slower than that of path 1 path 1 reaches outlet and breakthrough preferentially as shown in fig 11 a this moment is the tb mentioned earlier which is 15 1 s in a short time of about 0 5 s the front part of path 1 near the outlet vanishes leaving the disconnected ganglia as shown in fig 11 b such figure instability is originally caused by the abrupt decrease of the pressure at breakthrough during the drainage process despite of flow resistance the air pressure has to overcome the entry pressure as high as 2000 pa which is calculated as p c 2 σ cos θ r r with water receding contact angle θ r of 30 and throat size r of 63 µm however the breakthrough allows the air to release this part of high pressure and thus there only exists a corresponding pressure to overcome the flow resistance therefore finger vanishing is observed a similar phenomenon at a smaller scale has also been revealed in the previous literature such as the dynamic connectivity between two gas ganglia during steady state reynolds et al 2017 and the retreat of flow front in a single pore at the breakthrough moment li and zhang 2019 due to the finger vanishing and disconnected ganglia the pressure is quickly restored facilitating the formation of new figures therefore path 2 is observed and it arises faster the structure of path 2 consists of a straight main line and lots of branches perpendicular to the main line as shown in fig 11 b it takes about 3 s for path 2 to reach the outlet which is longer compared with the time it takes for path 1 to vanish when the cap of path 2 arrives outlet path 2 becomes disconnected as shown in fig 11 c similarly the part of path 2 near outlet vanishes after about 0 5 s leaving the scattered dots as shown in fig 11 d during this period path 3 continues to go ahead until the cap breakthrough and then path 3 vanishes the process of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing will repeat until the saturation reaches the maximum and eventually a steady state is reached 4 conclusions gas liquid displacement processes before and after breakthrough in a porous media with a wide range of capillary numbers ca and viscosity ratios m were studied by a joint approach of experimental flow imaging and digital image processing with the current ca and m the cases in this study cover the regimes of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf and crossover zone cz in phase diagram which has a good agreement with the boundaries proposed by zhang et al 2011 based on a homogenous porous media domain visualization of the fingering morphologies shows that the capillary fingering stops expanding at the breakthrough moment whereas the viscous fingering can continue to expand until almost all the void area is filled quantitative study was conducted in terms of invasion velocity phase saturation and fractal dimension based on digital image processing a considerable increment of saturation up to 4 times between breakthrough moment and steady state indicates that most areas are invaded after breakthrough therefore the invasion behaviour of gas after breakthrough is of significance to study to reveal the underlying mechanism evolution of fingering patterns before and after breakthrough was analyzed the gas invades uniformly at the beginning and then the compact invasion is broken by one or two preferential flow paths and the finger is generated when the cap is already breakthrough there are still new invasion areas occurring near the inlet in the vf region which are hardly observed in the cz and cf regions after breakthrough most of the invaded area is located near the outlet leaving most of the uninvaded area near the inlet the saturation curves are approximately linear in the early stage and the slope of curves decreases with the increasing of liquid viscosity time evolution of fingering after breakthrough exposes a previously unobserved process of fingering evolution consisting of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing this process will repeat until steady state reaches this work is of significance for many industrial processes such as fuel cells and membrane filtration the findings can also potentially

89,gas liquid displacement in porous media widely exists in many terrestrial extraterrestrial subsurface resource extraction and utilization applications the typical fingering displacement during gas invading has been well identified through extensive research efforts yet the evolution of fingering structures after invading breakthrough is rarely reported herein through a joint approach of experimental flow imaging and digital image processing we investigated the gas liquid fingering displacement in a porous patterned microfluidic chip from the breakthrough moment until reaching the steady state with a wide range of capillary number ca and viscosity ratio m we visualized the evolution of finger morphologies in different flow regimes including capillary fingering cf viscous fingering vf and crossover zone cz interestingly we found that finger structures of cf regime remain the same after the breakthrough whereas fingers of vf regime keep expanding until almost all the pore space is invaded and eventually reaches to steady state followed with experimental observations a comparative quantification of fingering patterns was also conducted in terms of invasion velocity phase saturation and fractal dimension a dramatic increase of gas saturation from 0 15 to 0 60 at the case of log10ca 5 17 and log10m 2 78 is obtained in the vf regime when the steady state is reached so is the fractal dimension from 0 14 to 0 16 even higher than one of cf the underlying mechanism of such fingering expansion in vf is further revealed from the time evolution of fingering after breakthrough a previously unobserved fingering cycle consisting of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing keeps repeating until the saturation reaches the maximum we believe that these findings are of significance in evaluating extraction effectiveness economic benefits and storage safety for subsurface applications keywords gas liquid displacement fingering invasion interface instability porous media invasion hydrodynamics data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction gas liquid displacement in microscale porous structures is an essential process in many natural phenomena and industrial applications often due to the viscosity contrast between invading and defending phase instability generates at the interface and fingering displacement pattern arises this beautiful physical phenomenon however imposes great complexity for many applications ranging from small to large scales like fuel cells and flow battery shojaei et al 2022 membrane based water filtration samuel et al 2022 geological carbon sequestration gcs singh et al 2020 bakhshian and sahimi 2017 soltanian et al 2017 hydrogen storage tarkowski 2019 underground water contamination lee et al 2010 and remediation of nonaqueous liquids porter et al 2010 therefore extensive research efforts have been dedicated to investigate the fingering pattern and its evolution in porous media during the gas liquid displacement process white et al 2005 wang et al 2018 2016 when a less viscous fluid displaces a higher viscous fluid in porous media the saffman taylor instability saffman and taylor 1958 occurs the variability of the porous media structure could further induce significant velocity fluctuations at the pore scale and mixing of the fluids at the macroscale the research of instability dynamics at core scale aryana and kovscek 2012 and macroscale furtado and pereira 2003 have also been intensively studied wang et al 2020 conducted the scaling analysis and derived a generalized scaling correlation for two phase flow in fractal permeability fields the expression of flow instability is scale independent and fingering dynamics is often observed and investigated at a small scale like pore scale or core scale it was found that capillary force related dynamic capillary pressure relaxation time silin and patzek 2004 and transient flow states sun et al 2021 have an impact on the dynamics of interface instability usually the displacement process is characterized by two dimensionless numbers the capillary number ca and the viscosity ratio of the invading phase to the defending phase m which are respectively expressed by 1 ca μ i u i σ d 2 m μ i μ d here μ i and μ d denote dynamic viscosity of the invading and defending phases respectively ui is the darcy velocity of the invading phase and σ d is the interfacial tension these two dimensionless numbers are used to evaluate the competition of the surface tension force and viscous force that dominate the displacement process as a function of log10m and log10ca a phase diagram of different flow regimes is classified from fingering morphologies consisting of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf crossover zone cz and stable displacement sd lan et al 2020 cao et al 2016 lenormand et al 1988 and zhang et al 2011 proposed phase boundaries to distinguish different displacement patterns which is widely accepted by researchers as a dependable reference extensive studies have been contributed to the effects of ca and m on fingering patterns chen et al 2017 2018 often the patterns are investigated quantitatively with parameters like cap velocity ruith and meiburg 2000 finger width hu et al 2020 number of fingers yang et al 2021 interface curvature scanziani et al 2020 levaché and bartolo 2014 rabbani et al 2018 breakthrough time ruith and meiburg 2000 yang et al 2021 invading area guo et al 2019 and saturation yang et al 2021 takeuchi et al 2022 fractal dimension hu et al 2020 wang et al 2022 and pressure difference takeuchi et al 2022 primkulov et al 2019 in the above studies different approaches either experimental or numerical modeling are applied primkulov et al 2019 proposed a novel moving capacitor dynamic network model to reproduce experimental observations of immiscible fluid fluid displacement in porous media for the first time the injection pressure can be measured from the model the injection pressure signal can be used to directly infer the character of the multiphase flow displacement which is useful for detailed experiments mejia et al 2021 combined experiments and lattice boltzmann lbm simulations to study the influence of irreducible water mobilization on centimeter scale flow patterns during favourable pore scale displacements it was found that an unstable displacement of viscous oil resulted from less viscous and irreducible water the result of simulations showed that the irreducible water was mobilized ahead of the injected water forming fingers it is noticed that most of the studies are for a small range of ca and m and limited to the fingering characterization only before or at breakthrough evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough is still of great importance in evaluating the extraction effectiveness economic benefits and storage safety in the subsurface applications eventually the displacement pattern does not change further and the saturation reaches a plateau this state is defined as steady state in this study mathematical models based on non equilibrium effects were developed hassanizadeh and gray 1993 barenblatt et al 2002 and gradually modified aryana and kovscek 2013 wang et al 2018 2019 to describe the two phase displacement process and possibly to predict the steady state yet the evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough until reaching a steady state remains unclear in particular for different flow regimes such as vf cf and cz the dynamical transition of fingering patterns from breakthrough to steady state and the underlying mechanisms are rarely investigated so far hu et al 2020 in this study targeting fingering dynamics after breakthrough and the steady state we conducted flow imaging on the gas liquid displacement process in a microfluidic chip with regular porous structures by using air to displace water glycerol mixture we are able to have a wide range of ca and m and thus three different flow regimes vf cf and cz the fingering displacement morphologies of each flow regime were visualized at the breakthrough moment and at the steady state a quantitative analysis of the invasion velocity area and complexity was conducted to reveal the underlying mechanism of fingering dynamics after breakthrough finally the complete dynamical evolution process of the finger before and after breakthrough was studied to enhance the understanding of the overall invasion process in porous media 2 experimental method and flow image processing 2 1 experimental setup and flow imaging procedures fingering displacement was performed on a microfluidic platform as illustrated in fig 1 before the displacement experiment the microfluidic chip has to be saturated with the liquid to do this a vacuum pump was used to remove the air from porous media until the vacuum degree was close to 10 2 bar the liquid was then injected into the porous media by a syringe pump new era ne 4000 until all the void area was filled with the liquid because of the high vacuum the liquid flow rate was carefully kept 20 ml h during the saturation to start the air liquid displacement experiment air was introduced into the chip by using the syringe pump to suck the liquid at the desired flow rate in the reverse direction the pressure drop between the air inlet and liquid outlet forced the air to displace the liquid from the porous spaces due to the viscosity difference between invading and defending fluid fingering displacement appeared in the porous media this process was recorded by a high speed camera phantom v611 with a lens micro nikkor 105mm at a 20μs exposure time the illumination was provided by a light source motic mlc 150c a 1280 256 recording window at 24 2000 fps with a 47 62 μm pixel spatial resolution was performed on the whole porous domain of the microchip to record the whole fingering displacement the geometry and schematic of the porous patterned microfluidic chip are shown in fig 2 the chip from dolomite was purchased and used without modification its material is quartz glass with 5 nm surface roughness ra which is intrinsically hydrophilic with a measured contact angle of 38 3 for water the surface roughness on the channel surface due to the etching process would further increase the surface hydrophilicity also through our contact angle measurements see the last row of table 1 it was found that glycerol has a negligible effect on the static contact angle the microfluidic chip consists of a gas inlet a liquid outlet and a 60 10 mm rectangular porous domain with a porosity ω of 0 633 to have a uniform inflow and outflow of the porous media the channels with a tree shaped layout were assembled to the gas inlet and liquid outlet the pore throat networks of this porous media domain are designed for statistically representative modeling of a complex porous sandstone rock structure the micrograph of the porous pattern in fig 2 b shows that different shaped lattices are ordered in the porous domain forming a straight channel and 2 types of constricted throats as shown in fig 2 c the cross section of the straight channel is close to a circle the width wc wt1 and wt2 of the straight channel throat 1 and throat 2 are 110 μm 85 μm and 63 μm respectively with the same depth d of 100 μm 2 2 fluid properties and experimental conditions to have a wide range of viscosity ratios the mixtures of deionized water and glycerol with different concentrations 0 40 60 80 were used as the defending phase physical properties of the invading phase and the defending phase were shown in table 1 the corresponding viscosity ratio m varied from log10m 1 75 to log10m 3 53 as shown in table 2 in order to generate different types of fingering patterns we used different flow rates for having a wide range of capillary numbers ca the flow rates of air were set as 0 1 1 10 100 1000 ml h and the corresponding ca varied from log10ca 8 17 to log10ca 4 17 as shown in table 2 2 3 image processing method the patterns of fingering displacement were extracted from the images recorded by the high speed camera the procedure of image processing is shown in fig 3 when the porous domain was fully filled with liquid the background images with about 1000 frames were captured to calculate the average gray level of the background pixel by pixel as shown in fig 3 a then the average background image was divided by the raw image fig 3b pixel by pixel the gray level of the finger pattern is much lower than that of the background as shown in fig 3 b after division the gray level of the background is close to 1 1 2 while the gray level of the finger pattern is much higher than 1 2 therefore the threshold of binarization was set to 1 2 to remove the background and binarize the images as shown in fig 3 c d this procedure was implemented by an in house code in matlab common algorithms i e box counting were applied to estimate the invading velocity invading area and fractal dimension which will be discussed further in the following section 3 results and discussion 3 1 flow regime and fingering pattern morphology by tuning the injection velocities for air invading into gly water mixtures we were able to study the different regimes of gas fluid fingering displacement in fig 4 we plotted all the experimental cases in the phase diagram that consists of capillary fingering viscous fingering crossover zone and stable displacement the colored areas are the regions of different displacement patterns defined by lenormand et al 1988 based on simulations and experiments in a pore network with the current ca and m the cases in this study cover the regimes of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf and crossover zone cz which are indicated by green circles blue triangles and red rectangles respectively fig 4 shows that almost all the cases in the study are located in the cz region defined by lenormand et al 1988 which indicates a disagreement with this flow regime phase diagram the black solid lines represent the boundaries with a narrower crossover zone proposed by zhang et al 2011 which can predict the present data because the homogeneity of porous media would reduce the size of the crossover zone the porous media used by zhang et al 2011 is homogenous and the porous pattern of the chip in this study is formed by regularly arranged lattices see fig 2 therefore it is unlikely for the viscous fingering and capillary fingering patterns to coexist but when the log10ca is higher than 6 17 the flow patterns both become viscous fingering so there are two vf cases locating in the cz region and the boundary line is close to the cf region recently guo and aryana 2019 also reported the boundaries red dashed lines in fig 4 based on the drainage process in the pore network that represents the pore distribution of berea sandstone the crossover zone between the cf and the vf is narrower compared with that of zhang et al 2011 fig 4 shows a decent agreement in the cf region our cf cases perfectly locate the cf region of guo and aryana 2019 two boundaries between vf and sd are in the lower log10m zone compared with that of zhang et al 2011 so there exists little deviation in the vf region interface destabilization and fingering pattern at the interface were firstly reported by saffman and taylor 1958 when a less viscous fluid invades into another more viscous fluid in porous media here we show the fingering morphologies at the breakthrough moment fig 5 a and when the displacement reaches steady state fig 5 b in different flow regimes for convenience the symbols with letters and numbers a1 a2 d4 d5 were used to represent the different experimental cases in fig 5 a the viscous fingering appears at higher log10ca in this region the viscous force mainly controls the process of displacement because of the higher velocity of the invading phase therefore gas prefers to invade forward rather than lateral forming a relatively narrow and straight flow path the branches and thin fingering patterns are highlighted in the green patterns of fig 5 a with the increase of viscosity ratio log10m the number of fingers increases the reason is that the lower viscosity of the defending fluid the weaker resistance which makes it easier for gas to form new invading paths the region of capillary fingering is located in the region with lower log10ca and higher log10m because of the lower velocity of the invading phase and the lower viscosity of the defending phase the viscous force can be neglected and the capillary force dominates the flow in our porous patterned chip narrow throats with smaller channel diameter can generate larger capillary driving forces than the straight channels therefore the gas will both invade forward and spread lateral throats channels which results in a larger finger width in comparison to the viscous fingering as indicated in the blue region of fig 5 a moreover the displacement fingering pattern becomes even wider at higher log10m specifically at case d1 it covers almost the entire porous domain all the above observations on fingering patterns at breakthrough moment align well with the widely reported results as a step further we have also investigated the evolution of fingering patterns after breakthrough by continuously injecting the gas until the displacement reaches to steady state fig 5 b describes fingering morphologies among different regimes at the steady state after comparing the morphologies at breakthrough moment it is found that the capillary fingering stops expanding at the breakthrough moment in the cf regime whereas the viscous fingering continues to expand until almost all the void area is filled in the vf regime as a result a significant increase of invaded area is observed from breakthrough moment to steady state in the vf regime with only small uninvaded areas near the inlet among all the three regimes the gas finger in the cz regime invades the smallest area from breakthrough to steady state in many applications like subsurface hydrocarbon extraction and geological carbon hydrogen storage it is required to maximize the storage capacity without having a leakage risk the displacing dynamics after breakthrough then becomes important in the economic evaluation and risk analysis hence a detailed quantitative analysis of the fingering patterns and invading phase distribution is then provided in the next section 3 2 comparative quantification of fingering patterns at breakthrough moment and steady state before breakthrough the invasion velocity is characterized by the velocity of finger cap ucap by using the binarized image of the displacement process a self developed matlab code was applied to identify the finger cap and to track its position for every frame in this way we are able to obtain the velocity of finger cap u cap from the slope of the curve of position versus time the ucap is displayed against log10ca and log10m in fig 6 a the invasion velocity in the vf region is faster compared with that in the cf and cz regions the lowest invasion velocity occurs in the cf region it should be noted that the velocity of finger cap ucap decreases with the increase of log10m at log10ca 8 17 although the resistance becomes lower as the liquid viscosity decreases the capillary force mainly controls the invasion process in the cf region which allows the gas to mainly percolate in bypass channels as shown in fig 5 however the opposite trend was found in the vf region in order to display the variation of ucap with log10m more intuitively ucap in the vf region was mapped in fig 6 b the velocity of finger cap ucap increases with the increase of log10m in the vf region which is opposite to the one in the cf region this can be explained by the invading path previously observed in fig 5 where the forward invasion dominates the vf region the resistance becomes weaker at higher log10m the less viscous liquid therefore the velocity of finger cap ucap increases fig 6 b also shows that ucap slightly increases with the increase of log10ca this demonstrates that the effect of gas flow rate on the invasion velocity decreases in the vf region therefore in order to enlarge the invasion velocity reducing the liquid viscosity and increasing the gas flow rate have to be considered to transform the pattern from cf to vf the breakthrough time tb is also an important parameter to characterize the velocity of invasion it is the elapsed time for the finger cap to invade from the inlet to the outlet and is displayed against log10ca and log10m in fig 6 c the breakthrough time tb is shorter in the vf region than that in the cf and cz regions because a faster ucap can significantly reduce tb the minimum time to breakthrough is only 0 48 s at the highest log10m and log10ca however the breakthrough time tb in the cf region is about 4 orders of magnitude higher than the shortest time such a large difference demonstrates that the displacement patterns have an important impact on the invasion time as shown in fig 6 d the breakthrough time tb in the vf region is inversely proportional to log10m and log10ca because the velocity of finger cap ucap in the vf region is proportional to log10m and log10ca saturation s can be used to characterize the displacement efficiency which is expressed by eqs 3 and 4 3 s b a b l w φ 4 s s a s l w φ here a b and a s indicate the displacement area of the invading phase at the breakthrough moment and the steady state respectively l and w denote the length and width of the porous domain respectively φ is the porosity of the porous domain fig 7 a presents the distribution of saturation sb at the breakthrough moment on the diagram of log10m and log10ca at the breakthrough moment the saturation sb in the cf region is the highest compared with that in the vf and cz regions because the fingers in the cz and vf regions mainly invade forward which forms the elongated finger as shown in fig 5 the finger in the cf region invades in the lateral bypass channels and even covers the entire porous domain the maximum sb at the case log10ca 8 17 log10m 1 75 is 0 73 the saturation sb increases with the increase of log10m in the cf region log10ca 8 17 because fluid with a lower viscosity provides a weaker resistance force as mentioned above displacement in the vf and cz regions will continue after breakthrough therefore the ss at the steady state is estimated and mapped in fig 7 b after breakthrough the saturation in the vf region grows significantly whereas the saturation in the cz region increases slightly which are both obviously reflected by the fingering morphologies in fig 5 fig 7 a confirms that sb in the vf region is close to 0 15 when reaching the steady state the saturation ss increases to 0 60 which is 4 times that of sb at the case of log10ca 5 17 and log10m 2 78 most of the saturation is obtained after breakthrough a similar result was also reported by hu et al 2020 besides ss in the vf region increases with the increase of log10ca however liquid viscosity seems to have a negligible effect on ss and sb in the vf region the normalized increment of saturation from the breakthrough moment to steady state is defined by the saturation gain ratio ss sb sb as shown in fig 7 c the saturation gain ratio in the cf region is close to zero while its value in the vf region ranges from 1 0 to 3 0 this agrees with previous experimental observations where the invading gas in the cf region with a low flow rate can only flow along the previously formed invading paths we also find that the saturation gain ratio increases with the increase of log10ca in the vf region as the invading phase with a high flow rate can continuously invade new areas therefore the invasion behaviour of gas after breakthrough is of great significance to study it can provide the potential guidance of achieving relatedly high displacement efficiency in a short time and determining whether it is cost effective to continue gas injection after breakthrough in industrial applications finger complexity can be quantified by fractal dimension fd the box counting method liebovitch and toth 1989 was used to estimate fractal dimension at the breakthrough moment fdb and at the steady state fds the image is partitioned into the boxes and the number of boxes n occupied by the pattern is counted as the resolution scale δ size of box decreases after fitting the curve in fig a the fractal dimension fd can be obtained by eq 5 5 f d lim δ 0 log n log δ as shown in fig 8 b the fractal dimension fdb at the breakthrough moment in the cf region is the highest compared with that in the vf and cz regions which means a more complex finger forms in the cf region in the cf region log10ca 8 17 the fractal dimension fdb increases with the increase of log10m when the invading phase invades into a less viscous liquid it will encounter a weaker resistance which facilitates an increase in finger complexity the maximum fractal dimension fdb is 1 636 in the case of log10m 1 75 and log10ca 8 17 a similar result is also found in the vf and cz regions the fractal dimension fdb has a proportional relationship with log10m similar to saturation the fractal dimension grows significantly in the vf region after breakthrough fig 8 b confirms that fdb in the vf region is close to 1 4 after reaching the steady state fds approaches 1 6 as shown in fig 8 c which means the complexity of fingering increases after breakthrough besides the complexity of fingering in the vf region increases with the increase of log10ca it should be noted that the fractal dimension maps of the fdb and fds on the diagram of log10m and log10ca are similar to the saturation maps of sb and ss in another word more invaded area represents the generation of more fingering branches and correspondingly fd increases all in all from the breathrough moment to the steady state the increase of the invasion area is manifested in the increase of saturation and fingering complexity to reveal the underlying reasons it is also worthy to look into the dynamical fingering displacement and evolution of patterns 3 3 dynamical fingering displacement from breakthrough to steady state studying the dynamical fingering displacement process can help deepen the understanding of the formation of finger patterns and their evolution at different stages of invasion in porous media when the gas enters from the inlet the invasion begins finger gradually forms at the gas liquid interface the elapsed time in the invading process until the cap reaches the outlet is tb images recorded by the high speed camera were painted in different colors according to different periods from 0 to tb as shown in fig 9 a so that the location of the invasion can be distinguished in each period during the earlier period of invasion painted in blue the gas invades uniformly as the invasion progresses the interface gradually becomes unstable the compact invasion blue area is broken by one or two preferential flow paths green area and the finger is generated as shown in fig 9 a because of the lower gas flow rate this phenomenon is more pronounced in the cf region bottom image in fig 9 a compared with that in the cz and vf regions the top and middle images in the final period of invasion highlighted in white color in fig 9 a there is a sudden rise in fingering branches the rises are more prominent in the cz and cf regions which also can be demonstrated by the sudden increase at the end of the saturation curve in fig 9 b a similar result was found by chen et al 2017 it is because the viscous force becomes insignificant and the capillary force controls the invasion process gradually the capillary dispersion effect allows the cap to invade the branches it is also interesting to see that the newly invaded yet very small area highlighted in red and white color appears near the inlet in the vf region before breakthrough however this newly invaded area is hardly observed in the cz and cf regions this observation provides a strong hint that different invading process would occur for different flow regimes after breackthrough which motivate us to continue the investigation from breakthrough to steady state in fig 9 b we also show the corresponding saturation curve as a function of the normalized location of finger cap x cap l the saturation increases as the cap goes forward for all cases and a step wise increase can be seen in the curve of saturation in the cf and cz regions meanwhile the slope of the saturation curve in the cf region is larger than those in the vf and cz regions the reason is that capillary dispersion and finger widening enhances the increasing speed of saturation when continuously injecting gas after breakthrough dramatic changes of fingering patterns are observed in the vf regime fig 10 a shows the evolution of invasion process in the vf region from breakthrough moment tb to steady state ts most of the invaded area is located near the outlet except for case d3 leaving most of the uninvaded area near the inlet for case d3 the green and blue patterns occupied the most area which means that saturation is close to ss in earlier times as the increasing of liquid viscosity the speed of invasion slowed down there is still the newly invaded area when approaching ts as shown in the white and red pattern of case a3 part of the newly invaded region is also located near inlet fig 10 b verified that the saturation curve is approximately linear in the early stage the slope of curve decreases with the increasing of liquid viscosity it is also noticed that the curve has a turning point near ts as indicated by the dotted circles in fig 10 b after the turning point the curves start to flatten level off toward the end when digging into the underlying causes a previously unobserved finger vanishing and re forming cycle is found from the flow images taking the case a3 as an example fig 11 shows the development of fingering during the period between the breakthrough moment and steady state to better distinguish different paths were painted in different colors firstly the uniform invasion near the inlet is broken by two preferential flow paths 1 and 3 because the invading speed of path 3 is slower than that of path 1 path 1 reaches outlet and breakthrough preferentially as shown in fig 11 a this moment is the tb mentioned earlier which is 15 1 s in a short time of about 0 5 s the front part of path 1 near the outlet vanishes leaving the disconnected ganglia as shown in fig 11 b such figure instability is originally caused by the abrupt decrease of the pressure at breakthrough during the drainage process despite of flow resistance the air pressure has to overcome the entry pressure as high as 2000 pa which is calculated as p c 2 σ cos θ r r with water receding contact angle θ r of 30 and throat size r of 63 µm however the breakthrough allows the air to release this part of high pressure and thus there only exists a corresponding pressure to overcome the flow resistance therefore finger vanishing is observed a similar phenomenon at a smaller scale has also been revealed in the previous literature such as the dynamic connectivity between two gas ganglia during steady state reynolds et al 2017 and the retreat of flow front in a single pore at the breakthrough moment li and zhang 2019 due to the finger vanishing and disconnected ganglia the pressure is quickly restored facilitating the formation of new figures therefore path 2 is observed and it arises faster the structure of path 2 consists of a straight main line and lots of branches perpendicular to the main line as shown in fig 11 b it takes about 3 s for path 2 to reach the outlet which is longer compared with the time it takes for path 1 to vanish when the cap of path 2 arrives outlet path 2 becomes disconnected as shown in fig 11 c similarly the part of path 2 near outlet vanishes after about 0 5 s leaving the scattered dots as shown in fig 11 d during this period path 3 continues to go ahead until the cap breakthrough and then path 3 vanishes the process of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing will repeat until the saturation reaches the maximum and eventually a steady state is reached 4 conclusions gas liquid displacement processes before and after breakthrough in a porous media with a wide range of capillary numbers ca and viscosity ratios m were studied by a joint approach of experimental flow imaging and digital image processing with the current ca and m the cases in this study cover the regimes of viscous fingering vf capillary fingering cf and crossover zone cz in phase diagram which has a good agreement with the boundaries proposed by zhang et al 2011 based on a homogenous porous media domain visualization of the fingering morphologies shows that the capillary fingering stops expanding at the breakthrough moment whereas the viscous fingering can continue to expand until almost all the void area is filled quantitative study was conducted in terms of invasion velocity phase saturation and fractal dimension based on digital image processing a considerable increment of saturation up to 4 times between breakthrough moment and steady state indicates that most areas are invaded after breakthrough therefore the invasion behaviour of gas after breakthrough is of significance to study to reveal the underlying mechanism evolution of fingering patterns before and after breakthrough was analyzed the gas invades uniformly at the beginning and then the compact invasion is broken by one or two preferential flow paths and the finger is generated when the cap is already breakthrough there are still new invasion areas occurring near the inlet in the vf region which are hardly observed in the cz and cf regions after breakthrough most of the invaded area is located near the outlet leaving most of the uninvaded area near the inlet the saturation curves are approximately linear in the early stage and the slope of curves decreases with the increasing of liquid viscosity time evolution of fingering after breakthrough exposes a previously unobserved process of fingering evolution consisting of new finger forming cap invading breakthrough and finger vanishing this process will repeat until steady state reaches this work is of significance for many industrial processes such as fuel cells and membrane filtration the findings can also potentially provide guidance for large scale subsurface applications in terms of evaluating extraction effectiveness economic benefits and storage safety credit authorship contribution statement shuo yang
