15380,perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa a forever chemical is continuously discharged and mitigated in the environment despite its production and use being severely restricted globally due to the transformation attachment and adsorption of pfoa in aquatic environments pfoa accumulates in the porous media of sediments soils and vadose regions however the impact of trace pfoa in the porous media on interstitial water and water safety is not clear in this work we simulated a porous media layer using a sand column and explored the effects of µg level pfoa migration on microbial community alternation microbial function regulation and the generation and spread of microbial risks after 60 days of pfoa stimulation proteobacteria became the dominant phylum with an abundance of 91 8 since it carried 71 of the antibiotic resistance genes args meanwhile the halogen related dechloromonas abundance increased from 0 4 to 10 6 in addition pfoa significantly stimulated protein more than 1288 and polysaccharides more than 4417 production by up regulating amino acid metabolism p 0 001 and membrane transport p 0 001 to accelerate the microbial aggregation more importantly the rapidly forming biofilm immobilized and blocked pfoa the more active antioxidant system repaired the damaged cell membrane by significantly up regulating glycerophospholipid metabolism and peptidoglycan biosynthesis it is worth noting that pfoa increased the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes args and human bacterial pathogens hbps in porous media by 30 and 106 pfoa increased the proportion of vertical transmission args vargs and co occurrence network analysis r 0 8 p 0 01 verified that vargs were mainly mediated by hbps a comprehensive understanding of pfoa interactions with its microecological environment is provided graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa porous media microbial community antibiotic resistant genes args human bacterial pathogens hbps biological risks 1 introduction perfluorooctanoic acid pfoa c7f15cooh is a member of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass consisting of an ionizable hydrophilic carboxylic acid co2 and a hydrophobic perfluorocarbon chain c7f15 gagliano et al 2020 hu et al 2020 the strong carbon fluorine bonds bond energy 485 kj mol 1 give pfoa useful chemical properties for making various products and make pfoa extremely resistant to breakdown earning it the moniker the forever chemical lindstrom et al 2011 wang et al 2017 pfoa induced bioaccumulation and health hazards are of considerable concern making pfoa one of the most researched pollutants in the last decade chen et al 2021b xiang et al 2020 zareitalabad et al 2013 pfoa has adverse impacts on the human body such as congenital disabilities growth retardation kidney and liver toxicity and weakened immunity li et al 2018 vieira et al 2013 however it is frequently detected in aquatic environments ng μg l 1 tap water ng l 1 and even human and wild animals blood li et al 2020b 2019b xiao et al 2015 many countries and organizations have adopted strict measures to restrict the production use and discharging of pfoa in 2019 pfoa was added to the stockholm convention s list of persistent organic pollutants pops the united states environmental protection agency established a health advisory level of 70 ng l 1 for pfoa and pfos individually or combined in drinking water however pfoa resists most conventional chemical and microbial treatment technologies espan et al 2015 trojanowicz et al 2018 inevitable trace amounts of pfoa are continuously discharged into the environment the pfoa migration process in the environment is very complex accompanied by the mutual transformation of water atmosphere and soil li et al 2019a due to pfoa s transformation attachment and adsorption in the aquatic environment pfoa accumulates in the porous media of sediments soils and vadose region presenting much higher concentrations for instance in diep and plankenburg rivers south africa the maximum concentration of pfoa in sediments was 191 9 ng g 1 dw and the pfoa content reached 2 4 µg g 1 average value in the soil of an air force base training area in the united states bofa et al 2021 hou et al 2022 proteobacteria and acidobacteria became the dominant phyla in the soil under pfoa stimulation cai et al 2020 and other pathways such as carbohydrate metabolism and membrane transport were significantly affected pfoa could also induce significant suppression of microbial diversity in soils senevirathna et al 2022 the relative abundance of several key microorganisms associated with acidification and methanation was significantly reduced resulting in a 19 2 reduction in methane production wang et al 2021a however pfoa effects on porous interstitial water media and water safety are unclear porous media is a significant pfoa sink hou et al 2022 lyu et al 2020 simultaneously it is a biofilm in the habitat therefore the pfoa effects on the porous media microorganisms also require examination the unique hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of pfoa make it easy to combine with membrane phospholipids and thereby prevent the membrane process resulting in cell membrane disruption liao et al 2010 liu et al 2016 and pfoa could break the balance of the antioxidant system and induce oxidative damage even apoptosis liu et al 2016 moreover pfoa could damage dna duo to its toxicity liu et al 2014 correspondingly under environmental stress microorganisms regulate their metabolic activities such as producing a large amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps to resist the damage of toxic substances which promote biofilm formation in addition microorganisms could activate the synthesis of antioxidant system functional enzymes to improve their resistance and gradually achieve self repair of damaged functions glorieux et al 2015 page et al 2009 more importantly environmental stress and defense responses could cause the production and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args a severe threat to ecology and public health mainly in human bacterial pathogens hbps jiang et al 2017 args spread is divided into horizontal gene transfer hgt feng et al 2021 von wintersdorff et al 2016 and vertical gene transfer vgt li et al 2022 studies showed that the args generation and transmission characteristics are closely related to environmental selection pressure guo et al 2020 lu et al 2020 shekhawat et al 2021 therefore pfoa may play an important role in generating and spreading biological risks during migration in porous media however the pfoa effects on microbial risks production and transferring are unclear little is known about the pfoa effects on the porous media microecology however we hypothesized that pfoa could cause considerable microbial risks due to its bioaccumulative and biotoxic nature this work employed a series of columns 200 ml filled with quartz sands to simulate porous media layers in aquatic environments pfoa containing migration the microbial communities evolution microbial metabolic function changes cell defense and repair capability regulation and microbial risks production during pfoa migration were investigated using chemical analysis metagenomics and metatranscriptomics we explored the relationship between args and hbps and their transmission mechanism based on co occurrence network analysis this study provides a comprehensive understanding on the effects of pfoa migration on microecology and the potential microbial risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 to simulate porous media layers six plexiglass columns height 100 mm inner

equivalent protein was determined by the modified lowry method cui et al 2018 2 2 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum analysis before testing the biomass was freeze dried at 80 c pilot 1 2 boyikang china the x ray photoelectron spectra xps were recorded with a monochromatic aluminum potassium radiation 1486 71 ev energy source operating at 15 kv and 15 ma escalab 250 thermo usa all binding energies were referenced to the neutral c1s peak of 284 6 ev to compensate for the surface charge effect 2 2 4 metagenomic and metatranscriptome analysis the samples were taken from 30 mm deep quartz sand and effluents in a stable reactor all the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen stored at 80 c and finally the samples were sent to novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd beijing china for metagenomic and metatranscriptome sequencing for metagenomic sequencing the details of dna quality control concentration determination library construction and data acquisition were referred to zhang et al 2021a the unigenes containing args and movable gene elements mges were aligned by card integrall the ncbi plasmid database and isfinder here if the mge sequence was identified on the scaftigs with the arg sequence the arg was classified as horizontal transmission arg harg the remaining args were classified as vertical transmission args vargs furthermore the identified hbps were referred to the database including 538 pathogenic species li et al 2015 for metatranscriptome sequencing rna extraction and quality control library construction and purification data acquisition referred to zhang et al 2022b the clean data calculated by q20 q30 and gc content were used for the downstream analyses de novo assembly of the clean reads obtained by preprocessing each sample was

encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg functional database blastp e value 1e 5 with diamond software to obtain comprehensive gene function information 2 2 5 statistical analysis data processing was performed using microsoft office 2016 and origin 2021 student edition tbtools was used to compare the abundance of mges between different samples network analysis was performed to understand the inter associations among hbps and args strong and significant correlation spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 p value 0 01 using the comet in cytoscape v3 8 2 the results were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 alternation of microbial community during the 60 day run almost no pfoa was biodegraded indicating that biodegradation performance was negligible for this hazard fig s1 interestingly trace amounts of pfoa still exerted considerable selective pressure on the microbial community of the porous media as shown in fig 2 proteobacteria became the most dominant phylum relative abundance 91 in the pfoa stimulated porous media 56 9 greater than in the control the enrichment of proteobacteria was consistent with previous reports cai et al 2020 senevirathna et al 2022 indicating that proteobacteria was more advanced than others under pfoa pressure the phosphate groups of proteobacteria outer membrane phospholipids interact with pfoa causing it to respond dramatically under the pfoa stress wojcik et al 2018 the relative abundance at genus level of pelomonas acinetobacter dechloromonas methylophilus acidovorax delftia methylobacterium and methyloversatilis were all significantly increased by as much as 60 1200 with a strong colonization ability acinetobacter was the most dominant genus in the porous media and could play an important role in microorganisms accumulation martinez campos et al 2021 in addition dechloromonas abundance which dechlorinate enzymes dcra and cfra could resist high concentration halogen compounds yang et al 2020b zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2018 increased by 1060 under pfoa stimuli these results indicated that the microbial community in the porous media was altered to be more resistant through a biofilm forming and halogen resistant community succession fig 2 3 2 state of arts of pfoa in the biomass the sem images fig s2a show that pfoa significantly promoted the aggregation of microorganisms on the medium porous surface and consistently the biomass retained in the column increased by 119 fig 3 a at the same time pfoa stimulated the epss production in which the contents of polysaccharides fig 3b and proteins fig 3c increased by nearly 4417 and 1288 respectively epss formed a natural barrier for microorganisms to resist the toxic effects of pfoa cao et al 2022 chen et al 2021a resulting in biofilms formation however tem results fig s2b show that trace pfoa still caused cell membrane damage and intracellular leakage a clear c f bond peak appeared in the xps f1s energy spectrum at bond energy of 688 8 ev fig 3e yang et al 2020a providing definite evidence of pfoa immobilization in particular the biofilm s nh2 basic group could provide adsorption sites for pfoa and thus promote pfoa immobilization yan et al 2021 in sum pfoa could interact with the biofilm destroy the cellular structures membranes and thus reduce their integrity fig 3 3 3 microbial defense and repair 3 3 1 stress related functions and genes expression as shown in fig 4 considerable pathways of the functional traits of kegg level 2 14 20 increased significantly pfoa significantly improved some microbial metabolic activities the folding sorting and degradation pathway was the most significantly up regulated p 0 001 indicating an advanced activity of genetic information processing besides amino acid p 0 001 and lipid p 0 05 metabolisms belonging to metabolism function membrane transport p 0 001 in charge of environmental information processing and cell motility classified to cell processes p 0 001 were all enhanced such regulations contributed to the enhanced microbial resistance in response to pfoa in porous media padmanabhan et al 2020 in addition a small part of functional pathways was slightly inhibited such as carbohydrate metabolism p 0 001 energy metabolism p 0 001 and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism p 0 001 it is worth noting that the abundance of functional traits related to human diseases such as the traits encoding infectious diseases p 0 001 and endocrine and metabolic diseases p 0 001 was significantly higher than the controls moreover on pathway level 3 the overexpression of tuberculosis p 0 001 legionellosis p 0 001 and type 1 diabetes mellitus p 0 001 was also overexpressed see fig s3 these functional traits implied that pfoa could promote the production and enrichment of human bacterial pathogens posing a severe biological risk xie et al 2019 fig 4 as shown in table s2 the expression of key genes related to cell repair dna repair and transport regulation changed significantly under pfoa stress the log2foldchange log2fc values of the functional gene rpos increased from 4 23 to 8 55 indicating the improvements of cells on self recovering capability under pfoa stress fernandez gomez et al 2020 liu et al 2018 moreover most of the critical genes regulating cell repair cusc mdtb and mota dna repair rada recj reco reca rpoh ruvb and lexa and transfer regulation ftsy gspe were also significantly up regulated p 0 001 ftsy and gspe were also played important roles in args transfer and chromosome mutation implying the potentiality of antibiotic resistance genes args production and transformation li et al 2020a 3 3 2 antioxidants regulation the toxic effects of pfoa are ascribed to be mainly cell membrane damage fitzgerald et al 2018 oxidative stress liu et al 2016 and dna damage liu et al 2014 pfoa could induce oxidative stress due to the accumulation of reactive oxide species ross li et al 2021 which then disrupt the balance of the antioxidant system and induce oxidative damage even apoptosis liu et al 2016 in this study intracellular ross concentrations increased by 69 8 at the early stage of the experiment day 5 see fig s4 indicating that the microorganisms were subjected to oxidative damages with biofilm formation and acclimation microorganisms antioxidant capacity was significantly increased the metatranscriptome results supported that the microbial antioxidant systems responded positively to prevent oxidative damage from pfoa as shown in fig 5 the excessed ross under pfoa exposure were successively removed by superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione gsh first sod in which the log2fc values of the encoding functional genes were 6 71 8 23 overexpressed see table s2 catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide anion o2 into hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fabrello et al 2021 then cat in which the log2fc values of the encoding functional genes were 4 86 6 10 overexpressed see table s2 catalyzed the conversion of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to water and molecular oxygen fabrello et al 2021 atp was synthesized on the mitochondria to provide the metabolite required energy moreover the glutathione antioxidant system is another primary enzymatic antioxidant system of organisms which is crucial in numerous biological processes such as dna synthesis removal of oxidation jiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 our results showed that gsh played multiple roles in resisting oxidative damages from pfoa on the one hand the log2fc of genes encoding proteins gclc and gss the rate limiting enzymes for gsh synthesis reached 8 53 and 9 49 deka et al 2021 the generated gsh could reduce h2o2 at the expense of oxidizing gsh to gssg by glutathione peroxidase gpx jiao et al 2020 on the other hand glutathione s transferase gst is a detoxifying enzyme of phase ii of biotransformation and the maximum value of log2fc reached 6 14 the increased gst expression catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione with pfoa fabrello et al 2021 fig 5 3 3 3 cell membrane repairing as shown in fig 6 the metatranscriptome results show significantly up regulated expression of genes encoding essential proteins in the microbial glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway under pfoa induction including gpat1 2 log2fc 5 22 cds1 log2fc 5 81 pisd log2fc 4 91 pla2g16 log2fc 5 75 aas log2fc 7 41 gde1 log2fc 4 20 gonzalez baro and coleman 2017 jennings and epand 2020 simon and cravatt 2008 wang et al 2021b details are given in table s4 this indicated that the phospholipid bilayer synthesis was accelerated to repair the damaged membranes teng et al 2021 acetyl coa is a kind of important cofactor involved in many metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate lipid and amino acid catabolism zhang et al 2021b acetyl coa reacts with oxaloacetate and enters the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle catalyzed by glta to form citric acid further oxidized to generate energy at the same time acetyl coa was transformed into 1 acyl sn glycerol 3p by gpat1 2 contributing to the glycerophospholipids synthesis in addition to the up regulation of glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways the kegg pathway of peptidoglycan biosynthesis was also significantly enriched under the pressure of pfoa compared with the control group the log2fc of mura murb murc and murd were 7 73 3 79 7 96 and 3 93 respectively these enzymes gradually catalyzed the formation of udp murnac l ala γ d glu from udp n acetyl glucosamine udp glcnac hrast et al 2014 class a multimodular penicillin binding proteins classa pbp are membrane bound enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan polymerization and activity terrak et al 2008 the log2fc of class a pbp enriched to 7 21 indicating the synthesis of peptidoglycan was accelerated and the integrity of the cell wall could be improved fig 6 3 4 microbial risks resistance genes and pathogens 3 4 1 arg patterns and hosts studies have shown that pollutants which exert selective biological pressure on microorganisms could cause the production and spread of args such as heavy metals pesticides and disinfection by products dbps guo et al 2020 lu et al 2020 shekhawat et al 2021 pfoa stress also changed the args profiles as shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria with the greatest abundance were the most attributable microorganisms of args under pfoa influence proteobacteria abundance increased by 32 and the args carried by it increased by 13 reaching 71 of the total args this indicated that proteobacteria is the main host of args under pfoa stress in addition the hosts of args analysis shows that there were 12 genera that carried args in the top 20 abundance of bacteria genus level see fig s5 and 9 of them increased significantly under the stimulation of pfoa which plausibly explains the reason for the survival and significant increase of these bacteria is due to the fact that they carry args with resistant to pfoa and most of the hostable args belong to efflux reaching 81 5 the result of circos mech analysis further revealed the relationship between microbial community and the args types see fig 7b the dominant proteobacteria carried more than 65 of efflux args the top 20 abundance args changes showed that pfoa stress could significantly increase efflux args for example emrb axyy oqxb were newly detected efflux args meanwhile abem adek adei adej and abes all belong to efflux args were increased 10 fold compared with the control group fig s6 on the contrary args belong to inactivation target alteration and target replacement such as sul1 dfra7 and chrb increased insignificantly or decreased efflux is a unique system used to expel any unnecessary or toxic substances out of the cells providing binding sites for toxic substances and activating targeted exclusion dey et al 2022 fig 7 3 4 2 pathogens pfoa significantly increased the hbps abundance in the porous media by 106 as shown in fig 8 a hbps including acinetobacter baumannii from 1 1 to 30 6 delftia acidovorans from 1 6 to 23 3 ralstonia pickettii comamonas testosteroni and pseudomonas aeruginosa in porous media were all significantly greater than the control acinetobacter baumannii is associated with resistance to almost all available antibiotics and it has been extensively reported in hospital and device associated infections eze et al 2021 delftia acidovorans could cause catheter related infection infective endocarditis urinary tract infections and nosocomial bacteremia patel et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b the interaction network analysis reveals that biofilm s top 10 abundance hbps significantly impacted hbps in the effluent 16 nodes 63 edges positive edges were more dominated in the networks spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 p value 0 01 confirming that most hbps have mutually beneficial survival relationships for example the most enriched hpb acinetobacter had a significant relationship with six pathogens five of which were positively correlated and only one was negatively correlated pfoa stress also significantly changed the effluent s microbial community structure see fig s7 and dominant bacterial species see fig s8 the above results indicated pfoa migration aggravated the pathogenic risk of the water environment fig 8 3 4 3 args transmission args transmission contained either horizontal gene transfer hgt or vertical gene transfer vgt pathways the former is considered more complicated as it has to break the boundaries of genetic relationship amarasiri et al 2020 hgt comprises three pathways mediated by mobile genetic elements mges including plasmid integron and insertion here we analyzed the harg encoding plasmids crucial in spreading args we measured 64 harg encoding plasmids as shown in the heatmap on fig 9 a the top 30 plasmids abundance decreased significantly in biofilm under pfoa stress e g nc 022589 1 nc 010510 1 and nc 011368 1 similarly pfoa reduced the relative abundance of harg encoding plasmids in the effluents e g nc 020548 1 nc 017575 1 and nc 011758 1 the results indicated that resistance genes are more likely to transfer vertically than horizontally under pfoa stress the hbps and vargs co occurrence network shows that the spread of vargs closely relates to hbps fig 9b shows that 351 pairs of significant p value 0 01 and strong spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 correlations were identified among 60 bacterial species abundance of top 50 non pathogenic bacteria npb and top 10 hbps and abundance of top 40 varg subtypes 100 nodes there were three regions with significant positive correlation where hbps were concentrated the positively correlated vargs co occurring with acinetobacter baumannii enriched most in porous media include adc 3 mus 2 pedo 1 vantg and axyy commonmonas testosteroni significantly increased in effluent under pfoa pressure furthermore it was positively correlated with oxa 60 oxa 112 oxa 205 imp 35 and amed compared to acinetobacter baumannii commonmonas testosterone played a more important role in args transmission due to its strong migration ability the results illustrate that hbps in porous media mediate the spread of vargs under pfoa stress but the transmission of vargs carried by hbps in the effluent is more worthy of attention fig 9 4 conclusions this study was the first time to explore the microbial response behaviors and the biological risk characteristics and propagation laws caused by 2 4 µm pfoa during the migration of porous media the results show that trace pfoa still impacted the microbial community structure and resistance mechanism in the solid medium and effluent proteobacteria and acinetobacter dechloromonas had absolute biological advantages under pfoa stress the rapid formation of biofilm and the enhancement of antioxidant systems initiated the repair function of cell membranes which in turn led to the central resistance regulation of efflux args the bacteria carried args were concentrated in the proteobacteria and vargs mediated by hbps increased significantly taking serious biological risks to the groundwater environment therefore pfoa biological risks in the natural environment are worth concern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

relative abundance of several key microorganisms associated with acidification and methanation was significantly reduced resulting in a 19 2 reduction in methane production wang et al 2021a however pfoa effects on porous interstitial water media and water safety are unclear porous media is a significant pfoa sink hou et al 2022 lyu et al 2020 simultaneously it is a biofilm in the habitat therefore the pfoa effects on the porous media microorganisms also require examination the unique hydrophilic and lipophilic properties of pfoa make it easy to combine with membrane phospholipids and thereby prevent the membrane process resulting in cell membrane disruption liao et al 2010 liu et al 2016 and pfoa could break the balance of the antioxidant system and induce oxidative damage even apoptosis liu et al 2016 moreover pfoa could damage dna duo to its toxicity liu et al 2014 correspondingly under environmental stress microorganisms regulate their metabolic activities such as producing a large amount of extracellular polymeric substances eps to resist the damage of toxic substances which promote biofilm formation in addition microorganisms could activate the synthesis of antioxidant system functional enzymes to improve their resistance and gradually achieve self repair of damaged functions glorieux et al 2015 page et al 2009 more importantly environmental stress and defense responses could cause the production and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args a severe threat to ecology and public health mainly in human bacterial pathogens hbps jiang et al 2017 args spread is divided into horizontal gene transfer hgt feng et al 2021 von wintersdorff et al 2016 and vertical gene transfer vgt li et al 2022 studies showed that the args generation and transmission characteristics are closely related to environmental selection pressure guo et al 2020 lu et al 2020 shekhawat et al 2021 therefore pfoa may play an important role in generating and spreading biological risks during migration in porous media however the pfoa effects on microbial risks production and transferring are unclear little is known about the pfoa effects on the porous media microecology however we hypothesized that pfoa could cause considerable microbial risks due to its bioaccumulative and biotoxic nature this work employed a series of columns 200 ml filled with quartz sands to simulate porous media layers in aquatic environments pfoa containing migration the microbial communities evolution microbial metabolic function changes cell defense and repair capability regulation and microbial risks production during pfoa migration were investigated using chemical analysis metagenomics and metatranscriptomics we explored the relationship between args and hbps and their transmission mechanism based on co occurrence network analysis this study provides a comprehensive understanding on the effects of pfoa migration on microecology and the potential microbial risks 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the schematic diagram of the experimental setup is shown in fig 1 to simulate porous media layers six plexiglass columns height 100 mm inner

equivalent protein was determined by the modified lowry method cui et al 2018 2 2 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy spectrum analysis before testing the biomass was freeze dried at 80 c pilot 1 2 boyikang china the x ray photoelectron spectra xps were recorded with a monochromatic aluminum potassium radiation 1486 71 ev energy source operating at 15 kv and 15 ma escalab 250 thermo usa all binding energies were referenced to the neutral c1s peak of 284 6 ev to compensate for the surface charge effect 2 2 4 metagenomic and metatranscriptome analysis the samples were taken from 30 mm deep quartz sand and effluents in a stable reactor all the samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen stored at 80 c and finally the samples were sent to novogene bioinformatics technology co ltd beijing china for metagenomic and metatranscriptome sequencing for metagenomic sequencing the details of dna quality control concentration determination library construction and data acquisition were referred to zhang et al 2021a the unigenes containing args and movable gene elements mges were aligned by card integrall the ncbi plasmid database and isfinder here if the mge sequence was identified on the scaftigs with the arg sequence the arg was classified as horizontal transmission arg harg the remaining args were classified as vertical transmission args vargs furthermore the identified hbps were referred to the database including 538 pathogenic species li et al 2015 for metatranscriptome sequencing rna extraction and quality control library construction and purification data acquisition referred to zhang et al 2022b the clean data calculated by q20 q30 and gc content were used for the downstream analyses de novo assembly of the clean reads obtained by preprocessing each sample was performed with trinity the sequences were integrated and repeated sequences sequence identity threshold 0 95 were deleted using cd hit est to obtain a unigene dataset unigenes were mapped to the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg functional database blastp e value 1e 5 with diamond software to obtain comprehensive gene function information 2 2 5 statistical analysis data processing was performed using microsoft office 2016 and origin 2021 student edition tbtools was used to compare the abundance of mges between different samples network analysis was performed to understand the inter associations among hbps and args strong and significant correlation spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 p value 0 01 using the comet in cytoscape v3 8 2 the results were visualized in gephi v0 9 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 alternation of microbial community during the 60 day run almost no pfoa was biodegraded indicating that biodegradation performance was negligible for this hazard fig s1 interestingly trace amounts of pfoa still exerted considerable selective pressure on the microbial community of the porous media as shown in fig 2 proteobacteria became the most dominant phylum relative abundance 91 in the pfoa stimulated porous media 56 9 greater than in the control the enrichment of proteobacteria was consistent with previous reports cai et al 2020 senevirathna et al 2022 indicating that proteobacteria was more advanced than others under pfoa pressure the phosphate groups of proteobacteria outer membrane phospholipids interact with pfoa causing it to respond dramatically under the pfoa stress wojcik et al 2018 the relative abundance at genus level of pelomonas acinetobacter dechloromonas methylophilus acidovorax delftia methylobacterium and methyloversatilis were all significantly increased by as much as 60 1200 with a strong colonization ability acinetobacter was the most dominant genus in the porous media and could play an important role in microorganisms accumulation martinez campos et al 2021 in addition dechloromonas abundance which dechlorinate enzymes dcra and cfra could resist high concentration halogen compounds yang et al 2020b zhang et al 2022a zhao et al 2018 increased by 1060 under pfoa stimuli these results indicated that the microbial community in the porous media was altered to be more resistant through a biofilm forming and halogen resistant community succession fig 2 3 2 state of arts of pfoa in the biomass the sem images fig s2a show that pfoa significantly promoted the aggregation of microorganisms on the medium porous surface and consistently the biomass retained in the column increased by 119 fig 3 a at the same time pfoa stimulated the epss production in which the contents of polysaccharides fig 3b and proteins fig 3c increased by nearly 4417 and 1288 respectively epss formed a natural barrier for microorganisms to resist the toxic effects of pfoa cao et al 2022 chen et al 2021a resulting in biofilms formation however tem results fig s2b show that trace pfoa still caused cell membrane damage and intracellular leakage a clear c f bond peak appeared in the xps f1s energy spectrum at bond energy of 688 8 ev fig 3e yang et al 2020a providing definite evidence of pfoa immobilization in particular the biofilm s nh2 basic group could provide adsorption sites for pfoa and thus promote pfoa immobilization yan et al 2021 in sum pfoa could interact with the biofilm destroy the cellular structures membranes and thus reduce their integrity fig 3 3 3 microbial defense and repair 3 3 1 stress related functions and genes expression as shown in fig 4 considerable pathways of the functional traits of kegg level 2 14 20 increased significantly pfoa significantly improved some microbial metabolic activities the folding sorting and degradation pathway was the most significantly up regulated p 0 001 indicating an advanced activity of genetic information processing besides amino acid p 0 001 and lipid p 0 05 metabolisms belonging to metabolism function membrane transport p 0 001 in charge of environmental information processing and cell motility classified to cell processes p 0 001 were all enhanced such regulations contributed to the enhanced microbial resistance in response to pfoa in porous media padmanabhan et al 2020 in addition a small part of functional pathways was slightly inhibited such as carbohydrate metabolism p 0 001 energy metabolism p 0 001 and xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism p 0 001 it is worth noting that the abundance of functional traits related to human diseases such as the traits encoding infectious diseases p 0 001 and endocrine and metabolic diseases p 0 001 was significantly higher than the controls moreover on pathway level 3 the overexpression of tuberculosis p 0 001 legionellosis p 0 001 and type 1 diabetes mellitus p 0 001 was also overexpressed see fig s3 these functional traits implied that pfoa could promote the production and enrichment of human bacterial pathogens posing a severe biological risk xie et al 2019 fig 4 as shown in table s2 the expression of key genes related to cell repair dna repair and transport regulation changed significantly under pfoa stress the log2foldchange log2fc values of the functional gene rpos increased from 4 23 to 8 55 indicating the improvements of cells on self recovering capability under pfoa stress fernandez gomez et al 2020 liu et al 2018 moreover most of the critical genes regulating cell repair cusc mdtb and mota dna repair rada recj reco reca rpoh ruvb and lexa and transfer regulation ftsy gspe were also significantly up regulated p 0 001 ftsy and gspe were also played important roles in args transfer and chromosome mutation implying the potentiality of antibiotic resistance genes args production and transformation li et al 2020a 3 3 2 antioxidants regulation the toxic effects of pfoa are ascribed to be mainly cell membrane damage fitzgerald et al 2018 oxidative stress liu et al 2016 and dna damage liu et al 2014 pfoa could induce oxidative stress due to the accumulation of reactive oxide species ross li et al 2021 which then disrupt the balance of the antioxidant system and induce oxidative damage even apoptosis liu et al 2016 in this study intracellular ross concentrations increased by 69 8 at the early stage of the experiment day 5 see fig s4 indicating that the microorganisms were subjected to oxidative damages with biofilm formation and acclimation microorganisms antioxidant capacity was significantly increased the metatranscriptome results supported that the microbial antioxidant systems responded positively to prevent oxidative damage from pfoa as shown in fig 5 the excessed ross under pfoa exposure were successively removed by superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat and glutathione gsh first sod in which the log2fc values of the encoding functional genes were 6 71 8 23 overexpressed see table s2 catalyzed the dismutation of superoxide anion o2 into hydrogen peroxide h2o2 fabrello et al 2021 then cat in which the log2fc values of the encoding functional genes were 4 86 6 10 overexpressed see table s2 catalyzed the conversion of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to water and molecular oxygen fabrello et al 2021 atp was synthesized on the mitochondria to provide the metabolite required energy moreover the glutathione antioxidant system is another primary enzymatic antioxidant system of organisms which is crucial in numerous biological processes such as dna synthesis removal of oxidation jiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 our results showed that gsh played multiple roles in resisting oxidative damages from pfoa on the one hand the log2fc of genes encoding proteins gclc and gss the rate limiting enzymes for gsh synthesis reached 8 53 and 9 49 deka et al 2021 the generated gsh could reduce h2o2 at the expense of oxidizing gsh to gssg by glutathione peroxidase gpx jiao et al 2020 on the other hand glutathione s transferase gst is a detoxifying enzyme of phase ii of biotransformation and the maximum value of log2fc reached 6 14 the increased gst expression catalyzes the conjugation of glutathione with pfoa fabrello et al 2021 fig 5 3 3 3 cell membrane repairing as shown in fig 6 the metatranscriptome results show significantly up regulated expression of genes encoding essential proteins in the microbial glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway under pfoa induction including gpat1 2 log2fc 5 22 cds1 log2fc 5 81 pisd log2fc 4 91 pla2g16 log2fc 5 75 aas log2fc 7 41 gde1 log2fc 4 20 gonzalez baro and coleman 2017 jennings and epand 2020 simon and cravatt 2008 wang et al 2021b details are given in table s4 this indicated that the phospholipid bilayer synthesis was accelerated to repair the damaged membranes teng et al 2021 acetyl coa is a kind of important cofactor involved in many metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate lipid and amino acid catabolism zhang et al 2021b acetyl coa reacts with oxaloacetate and enters the tricarboxylic acid tca cycle catalyzed by glta to form citric acid further oxidized to generate energy at the same time acetyl coa was transformed into 1 acyl sn glycerol 3p by gpat1 2 contributing to the glycerophospholipids synthesis in addition to the up regulation of glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways the kegg pathway of peptidoglycan biosynthesis was also significantly enriched under the pressure of pfoa compared with the control group the log2fc of mura murb murc and murd were 7 73 3 79 7 96 and 3 93 respectively these enzymes gradually catalyzed the formation of udp murnac l ala γ d glu from udp n acetyl glucosamine udp glcnac hrast et al 2014 class a multimodular penicillin binding proteins classa pbp are membrane bound enzymes responsible for peptidoglycan polymerization and activity terrak et al 2008 the log2fc of class a pbp enriched to 7 21 indicating the synthesis of peptidoglycan was accelerated and the integrity of the cell wall could be improved fig 6 3 4 microbial risks resistance genes and pathogens 3 4 1 arg patterns and hosts studies have shown that pollutants which exert selective biological pressure on microorganisms could cause the production and spread of args such as heavy metals pesticides and disinfection by products dbps guo et al 2020 lu et al 2020 shekhawat et al 2021 pfoa stress also changed the args profiles as shown in fig 7 a proteobacteria with the greatest abundance were the most attributable microorganisms of args under pfoa influence proteobacteria abundance increased by 32 and the args carried by it increased by 13 reaching 71 of the total args this indicated that proteobacteria is the main host of args under pfoa stress in addition the hosts of args analysis shows that there were 12 genera that carried args in the top 20 abundance of bacteria genus level see fig s5 and 9 of them increased significantly under the stimulation of pfoa which plausibly explains the reason for the survival and significant increase of these bacteria is due to the fact that they carry args with resistant to pfoa and most of the hostable args belong to efflux reaching 81 5 the result of circos mech analysis further revealed the relationship between microbial community and the args types see fig 7b the dominant proteobacteria carried more than 65 of efflux args the top 20 abundance args changes showed that pfoa stress could significantly increase efflux args for example emrb axyy oqxb were newly detected efflux args meanwhile abem adek adei adej and abes all belong to efflux args were increased 10 fold compared with the control group fig s6 on the contrary args belong to inactivation target alteration and target replacement such as sul1 dfra7 and chrb increased insignificantly or decreased efflux is a unique system used to expel any unnecessary or toxic substances out of the cells providing binding sites for toxic substances and activating targeted exclusion dey et al 2022 fig 7 3 4 2 pathogens pfoa significantly increased the hbps abundance in the porous media by 106 as shown in fig 8 a hbps including acinetobacter baumannii from 1 1 to 30 6 delftia acidovorans from 1 6 to 23 3 ralstonia pickettii comamonas testosteroni and pseudomonas aeruginosa in porous media were all significantly greater than the control acinetobacter baumannii is associated with resistance to almost all available antibiotics and it has been extensively reported in hospital and device associated infections eze et al 2021 delftia acidovorans could cause catheter related infection infective endocarditis urinary tract infections and nosocomial bacteremia patel et al 2019 as shown in fig 8b the interaction network analysis reveals that biofilm s top 10 abundance hbps significantly impacted hbps in the effluent 16 nodes 63 edges positive edges were more dominated in the networks spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 p value 0 01 confirming that most hbps have mutually beneficial survival relationships for example the most enriched hpb acinetobacter had a significant relationship with six pathogens five of which were positively correlated and only one was negatively correlated pfoa stress also significantly changed the effluent s microbial community structure see fig s7 and dominant bacterial species see fig s8 the above results indicated pfoa migration aggravated the pathogenic risk of the water environment fig 8 3 4 3 args transmission args transmission contained either horizontal gene transfer hgt or vertical gene transfer vgt pathways the former is considered more complicated as it has to break the boundaries of genetic relationship amarasiri et al 2020 hgt comprises three pathways mediated by mobile genetic elements mges including plasmid integron and insertion here we analyzed the harg encoding plasmids crucial in spreading args we measured 64 harg encoding plasmids as shown in the heatmap on fig 9 a the top 30 plasmids abundance decreased significantly in biofilm under pfoa stress e g nc 022589 1 nc 010510 1 and nc 011368 1 similarly pfoa reduced the relative abundance of harg encoding plasmids in the effluents e g nc 020548 1 nc 017575 1 and nc 011758 1 the results indicated that resistance genes are more likely to transfer vertically than horizontally under pfoa stress the hbps and vargs co occurrence network shows that the spread of vargs closely relates to hbps fig 9b shows that 351 pairs of significant p value 0 01 and strong spearman s r 0 8 and pearson s r 0 8 correlations were identified among 60 bacterial species abundance of top 50 non pathogenic bacteria npb and top 10 hbps and abundance of top 40 varg subtypes 100 nodes there were three regions with significant positive correlation where hbps were concentrated the positively correlated vargs co occurring with acinetobacter baumannii enriched most in porous media include adc 3 mus 2 pedo 1 vantg and axyy commonmonas testosteroni significantly increased in effluent under pfoa pressure furthermore it was positively correlated with oxa 60 oxa 112 oxa 205 imp 35 and amed compared to acinetobacter baumannii commonmonas testosterone played a more important role in args transmission due to its strong migration ability the results illustrate that hbps in porous media mediate the spread of vargs under pfoa stress but the transmission of vargs carried by hbps in the effluent is more worthy of attention fig 9 4 conclusions this study was the first time to explore the microbial response behaviors and the biological risk characteristics and propagation laws caused by 2 4 µm pfoa during the migration of porous media the results show that trace pfoa still impacted the microbial community structure and resistance mechanism in the solid medium and effluent proteobacteria and acinetobacter dechloromonas had absolute biological advantages under pfoa stress the rapid formation of biofilm and the enhancement of antioxidant systems initiated the repair function of cell membranes which in turn led to the central resistance regulation of efflux args the bacteria carried args were concentrated in the proteobacteria and vargs mediated by hbps increased significantly taking serious biological risks to the groundwater environment therefore pfoa biological risks in the natural environment are worth concern declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

15381,guizhou province is located in the heart of a karst zone in southwest china which is one of the largest karst areas in the world given the fragile surface ecosystem and highly developed underground karst structure the migration and transformation of soil hg may impact groundwater quality in karst environments with high hg background concentrations this study examines the vertical migration and transformation of soil mercury hg in two karst catchments huilong and chenqi with the former containing high hg contents associated with mineralization and the latter representing regional background hg the results show that the soil hg pool in the huilong catchment was as high as 44 4 4 2 g m 2 whereas in the chenqi catchment was only 0 17 0 02 g m 2 compared with farmland soil forest soil showed a significant loss of hg the results of l3 x ray absorption near edge structure of hg indicated that α hgs the primary mineral of hg ore gradually changed to other mineral types during soil formation in huilong catchment the proportion of organic bound hg sr 2 out of total hg decreased from 44 0 to 20 3 when soil depth increased from 10 cm to 160 cm in farmland soil profile and from 39 3 to 34 5 in forest soil profile while the proportion of ionic hg increased with soil depth from 4 2 to 10 7 in the farmland soil profile and from 6 7 to 11 6 in the forestland soil profile results from the triple mixing isotope model show that soil hg accounts for more than 80 hg in groundwater in the two catchments results from this study indicate potential risks of soil hg entering into groundwater in this karst area graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater contamination hg speciation hg stable isotopes karst catchment land use type data availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction mercury is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants and can be transported globally by atmospheric processes barkay and wagner dobler 2005 driscoll et al 2013 karst ecosystems with high hg background concentrations play a unique role in the global hg biogeochemical cycle especially through fast flow into aquifers and associated risks of groundwater contamination chorover et al 2007 hartmann et al 2021 xia et al 2021a the global hg mineralization zone and karst concentrated area are highly overlapping in southwest china see figs s1 s2 goldscheider et al 2020 gustin et al 1999 china possesses the largest area of karst terrain in the world and nearly half of the karst landforms in china are distributed in the southwestern part of the country huang et al 2008 the karst region of southwest china covers an area of 6 2 104 km2 and is located on the global hg mineralization belt a region containing the majority of the hg ore deposits in china for example guizhou province in this region the most important hg production base in china possesses an estimated hg reserve of 880 000 tons accounting for about 78 of the national total qiu et al 2009 the area is characterized by low temperature metallogenic ores associated with numerous exposed low temperature hydrothermal deposits the mining and smelting of hg and other mineral resources release large quantities of hg to the surface environment mercury contents in surface 0 25 cm depth and deeper soils in the karst region of southwest china are 3 5 times higher than those in the other regions of china largely due to the region s high geochemical background hg levels nie et al 2019 the high background hg contents associated with the region s contiguous karst landforms combined with extensive agricultural activities may negatively impact the region s function as an important ecological barrier that protects the middle and upper reaches of the yangtze and pearl rivers specifically excessive agricultural and mining activities may exacerbate the release of hg into the atmosphere water and soil environments seriously affect the environmental quality and agricultural product safety of karst areas in fact human activities and other factors that enhanced soil erosion have resulted in an 84 increase in the loss of hg from 1990 to 2010 in the karst areas of southwest china liu et al 2019b a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of hg in the karst ecosystem is urgently needed in order to sustain future agricultural development while maintaining a health ecological environment vegetation plays a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of hg in terrestrial ecosystems on the global scale forest ecosystems are a net sink of atmospheric hg which absorb about 1180 tons of hg from the atmosphere annually wang et al 2016 agricultural cultivation strongly perturbs the biogeochemical cycling of hg in terrestrial ecosystems fertilization with chemical fertilizers and livestock manure and application of straw to the ground surface represent additional sources of soil hg in farmlands while crop harvesting removes hg from soils but brings non negligible hg exposure health risks to residents in areas with high hg background concentrations xia et al 2021a the contradiction between humans demand for agricultural cultivation and shortage of cultivated land has been long last in the karst areas of southwest china large scale conversion of bare lands to sloping cultivated lands with low yield has enhanced soil erosion some of these converted agricultural lands were later abandoned due to the movement of the rural people into urban living guided by the government policy of building a green environment the vegetation coverage in the karst areas has increased in recent years for example the forest coverage in guizhou province has increased from 30 of the land area in 1998 to 60 in 2020 such big land use change likely has impacts on hg biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems as well as to underground water quality the underground drainage network in the karst area is highly developed while the thickness of the soil is relatively thin limiting the region s capacity to resist environmental damage xiao et al 2021 given the combined traits of an ecologically fragile karst ecosystem and high hg background levels the main factors controlling the migration of soil hg and its transformation under different land use conditions in karst areas need to be better understood these factors may play an important role in determining and preventing the risk of groundwater hg pollution in karst areas bavec and gosar 2016 bollen et al 2008 while we have a reasonably good understanding of the mass balance of hg on the catchment scales fig s5 s6 we know little about the fate of soil hg to fill this knowledge gap there is a need to distinguish the behavior of soil hg in the hydrological process of rainfall infiltration into groundwater considering the unique surface underground dual water flow structure in karst areas soil hg distribution speciation stable isotope composition can provide important information to explore the sources of groundwater hg through quantifying soil hg pool and vertical migration this study used water extraction and synchrotron radiation technology to assess the migration and transformation of soil hg in karst catchments mediated by land use types and to determine the main controlling factors for the transformation of soil hg speciation under various conditions particularly hg stable isotope composition in precipitation soil runoff and associated environmental media were analyzed to understand the soil hg fate in karst ecosystem mercury in soil profiles under different geological background conditions and land use types was analyzed in detail in terms of hg distribution speciation and stable isotope composition to better understand the vertical migration and transformation of soil hg and its potential impacts to groundwater in karst areas knowledge gained in this study is useful for developing future land use management and hg emission control policies in order to sustain future agricultural development while maintaining a healthy ecological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites descriptions the two karst catchments in southwestern china huilong and chenqi were selected in a previous study to assess the source and sink of hg using a mass balance approach xia et al 2021a the same two catchments were also selected in the present study to investigate the migration and transformation of soil hg under different land use briefly the huilong catchment is located in the southwestern part of guizhou province whereas the chenqi catchment is located in the central part of the province fig s3 and they are underlain by detrital sandstone and limestone respectively sun et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 mercury mining in the huilong catchment continued for about 350 years and ceased in the 1950s but there are no known hg deposits in chenqi wang et al 2005 these two catchments are representative of the region with the former having higher and the latter having lower hg or background levels more information about these two catchments can be found in xia et al 2021a 2 2 sampling and measurement the locations for soil profile sampling were selected based on the distributions of forests and farmlands within the catchment two locations were selected within each catchment one for forest soil and another for agricultural soil soil and bedrock sampling were performed with a circular knife geological hammer from top to bottom to avoid contamination the soil and bedrock samples were put into sample bags numbered and shipped to the laboratory for drying at 40 c the soil samples were weighed and recorded and then the visible plants and larger stones higher than 2 mm were removed from the samples fernández martínez et al 2015 shaheen and rinklebe 2018 after grinding the soil and bedrock samples were screened through a 200 mesh sieve the materials were then separated and recorded for further chemical analysis an hg analyzer dma80 milestone ltd italy was used to determine the total hg content in the collected soil and bedrock samples the method s detection limit is 0 01 ng g 1 the average relative standard deviation for the duplicate analyses of hg was 4 7 matrix spiked recoveries ranged from 92 to 105 mean 97 n 6 the equipment blank for hg in liquid samples was 0 05 0 01 ng l 1 n 6 the soil reference material gbw07405 was used for soil analytical quality control the measured average hg content of the reference materials was 0 27 0 09 mg kg 1 n 6 which was comparable to the certified value of 0 29 0 04 mg kg 1 the relative percentage differences between the sample replicates were 7 the sampling and measurement for throughfall rainfall surface runoff and groundwater were similar to those described in detailed addressed in xia et al 2021a two sites in chenqi and three sites in huilong catchments were established to collect monthly throughfall the portion of rainfall which falls to the forest floor from the canopy from august 2018 to july 2019 excluding for the dry months one site at each catchment was established to collect rainfall open field precipitation during the same period as for throughfall a 1 2 m2 rain board covered with poly tetra fluoro ethylene ptfe was placed 0 6 m above the ground to collect rain samples to avoid possible interference of litterfall and insect debris a plastic bag was used to cover the rain board during the non sampling period and this bag was opened at the start and closed at the end of precipitation sampling of surface runoff in each catchment was conducted above the surface converges of runoff and underground runoff was conducted in water heads of underground runoff at low terrain monthly surface runoff and underground runoff samples were collected in each catchment during the same period as for throughfall a 5 l brown borosilicate glass bottle was used to collect the water sample the collected water samples were filtered through a cellulose membrane 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter durapore millipore into clean and marked brown borosilicate glass bottles spiked with hcl final concentration 0 5 v

muffle furnace for isotopic analysis mercury released by thermal decomposition was treated with 5 ml of 40 aqua regia absorption liquid capture demers et al 2013 jiskra et al 2017 the capture solution was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to hg isotope analysis mercury concentration of the absorbing liquid was determined according to the method of useap 1631 with a hg analyzer tekran 2500

dissolution but mdf was present drott et al 2013 wiederhold et al 2015 therefore for the hydrological process that only includes leaching dissolution and scrubbing δ199hg and δ200hg can be used to calculate the end member ratio with two degrees of freedom the contribution ratio of the three end members can be calculated at the same time a triple mixing isotope model was thus used to quantify

migration coefficient mc can be used to describe the migration and enrichment characteristics of hg in the soil profile relative to the bedrock nesbitt 1979 sun et al 2019 and was calculated as 9 m c c s h g c s z r c r z r c r h g 1 where cs hg and cs zr are the hg and zirconium content in the soil and cr hg and cr zr are those in the bedrock respectively zirconium was chosen as a reference element because of zircon s excellent stability to weathering results from its exceptionally low solubility in aqueous solutions santos et al 2019 soil and bedrock zirconium contents were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as detailed in xia et al 2021b a mc 0 indicates that the sampling point is enriched in hg during the soil forming process while a mc 0 indicates the hg in the sampling point is depleted 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of hg in soil profiles the soil hg contents in the farmland and forested sections of the huilong catchment were 97 9 51 3 mg kg 1 and 20 0 4 9 mg kg 1 respectively and those in the chenqi catchment were 0 16 0 05 mg kg 1 and 0 21 0 19 mg kg 1 respectively soil hg content in the farmland section of the huilong catchment slightly decreased with soil depth beneath the h a o fig 1 a the soil closer to the surface is affected more by agricultural practices such as fertilization as well as atmospheric deposition of hg ma et al 2022 soil hg content gradually increased from the bottom of the h a o to the h a b likely due to the downward leaching and migration of hg from the upper soil layer soil hg content increased significantly with soil depth in the h a c presumably because of its proximity to the parent material that possessed relatively high hg concentrations soil hg content in the forestland section of the huilong catchment decreased with soil depth from the h f o to h f a fig 1b mercury leaching was likely related to the layers with low soil ph between 4 and 5 at greater soil depths hg began to accumulate and soil hg content increased soil hg content in the farmland section of the chenqi catchment was relatively high in the c a o fig 1c possibly because of hg input from agricultural ploughing and atmospheric hg deposition from the lower part of the c a o to the c a a a portion of easily dissolved hg migrated downward through soil seepage and was subsequently fixed in the c a b soil hg content changed little with soil depth in the bottom soil which may be related to the low geological background hg in this area of the chenqi catchment and absence of exogenous hg input or human activities soil hg content in the forestland section of the chenqi catchment exhibited high concentrations in the c f o fig 1d which was mainly due to litterfall hg input soil hg content decreased with soil depth in the c f a due to hg leaching soil hg content increased with soil depth in the c f b due to the migration of hg from the upper soil layer 3 2 mercury migration and accumulation in the karst soil profiles in this study the migration and accumulation of hg in the farmland and forestland soil profiles of the huilong and chenqi catchments were characterized using a migration coefficient mc fig 2 a the farmland soil profile within the huilong catchment possessed two distinct ranges of mc values mc 0 and mc 0 mc is in the range of 0 9 0 0 at soil depths of 0 80 cm and 130 180 cm indicating that soil hg at these depths is relatively depleted this suggests that the shallow and deep seepage of water through the soil has leached the soil hg within these two soil layers abu dieyeh et al 2019 in addition hg may have been lost from the soil surface by interfacial hg exchange with the atmosphere since the background soil hg concentrations are as high as several hundreds of mg kg 1 in this area the magnitude of the interfacial hg exchange between soil and atmosphere interface is likely large and result in hg loss from soil qiu et al 2006 mc is in the range of 0 0 0 9 at soil depths of 80 130 cm indicating that soil hg at these depths is relatively enriched mercury enrichment may be due to the downward transport of hg from the upper layer and its subsequent redeposition for the forest soil profile of the huilong catchment soil hg was relatively depleted in general with mc being in the range of 0 75 0 0 fig 2b in the organic layer 0 20 cm soil depth the degree of hg loss was limited mc 0 54 0 45 likely due to the release of hg from leaf litterfall degradation that supplements the soil hg the degree of hg loss is relatively large between 40 and 60 cm depth mc 0 75 0 71 due to strong leaching and no effective supplementation of hg the depletion of hg decreases at depths closer to the bedrock likley due to higher hg concentrations derived from the bedrock and retained in the regolith and semi regolith near the bedrock in the farmland soil profile of the chenqi catchment soil hg was enriched at all depth with mc being in the range of 0 1 64 fig 2c the farmland is located in lower topographic areas of the catchment and therefore continuously receives and accumulats hg from eroded soil transported by surface runoff from areas of higher terrain and steeper slopes the enrichment of hg in the topsoil may also be related to atmospheric deposition and or agricultural inputs in the accumulation layer of the soil profile between 30 and 60 cm in depth mc increased significantly reaching values as high as 1 6 the very high mc values at these depths indicate highly enriched hg presumably due to leaching from overlying soil santos frances et al 2011 teršič et al 2014 soil hg in the forest soil profile of the chenqi catchment was relatively depleted in general fig 2d with mc being in the range of 0 7 0 0 in the organic layer 0 and 20 cm depth the degree of hg loss was relatively weak possibly because of supplemental hg released from leaf litterfall degradation silva filho et al 2006 soils between 20 and 40 cm depth exhibited a large degree of hg loss fig 2d suggesting strong leaching while with limited hg supplementation the depletion of hg decreases at depths closer to the bedrock which may be because the soil at the bottom of the profile was not fully developed limiting hg migration at this depth in general farmland soils in catchment depressions were close to 2 m in thickness mercury in the deep soils shows varying degrees of depletion or enrichment depending on the superposition of factors such as the contributions of hg from bedrock weathering soil seepage and leaching among others considering that lower ph should enhance hg leaching effendi et al 2020 soil ph might have also played an important role in shaping the soil hg profile knowing that soil ph of huilong catchment is between 4 24 and 6 98 and that of chenqi catchment is between 6 93 and 7 61 table s2 the thickness of the forest soil layer on the hillside is less than 1 meter the thin soil layer could be caused by prominent soil erosion and large hill slopes in the karst area both factors were conducive to hg leaching through surface runoff and internal soil seepage the reduced hg loss in the organic soil layer should be related to the replenishment of soil hg from litterfall input xia et al 2021a 3 3 water extracted hg the water extracted soil hg contents were 51 9 1742 μg kg 1 and 0 88 10 8 μg kg 1 accounting for 0 24 6 3 and 0 73 6 4 of the total hg in huilong and chenqi catchment respectively fig 3 the contents and proportions of water extracted hg increased from the h a o to the h a a and decreased to the h a b in the farmland soil profile of the huilong catchment and increased from the h a o to the h a a in the forestland soil profile of the same catchment fig 3a in the chenqi farmland soil profile fig 3b the contents and proportions of water extracted hg increased from the c a o to the c a a and decreased to the c a b in the forestland soil profile the contents of water extracted hg decreased from c f o to c f b while the proportions of water extracted hg increased first and then decreased there was an obvious similarity among these four profiles in that the water extracted hg had a significant upward trend in the leaching layer a similar phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies this is because most soluble hg in soil occurs in the speciation of non reactive complex binding and it is highly likely that hg binds to soluble humic matter teršič et al 2014 it has also been suggested that nano hg containing particles or colloids may be released during leaching gray et al 2004 3 4 mercury speciation in the soil profiles determined by xanes data obtained from the synchrotron radiation near side absorption spectrum for the farmland soil profile in the huilong catchment fig 4 showed that organically bound hg decreased from the surface h a o to the h a a and to the h a b the proportion of hg sr 2 in these three layers was 44 0 23 2 and 20 3 respectively similar to those of organically bound hg extracted by the bcr the high proportion of organically bound hg in the cultivated layer of the soil may be related to long term agricultural farming activities including the addition of straw and fertilization to the farm field the application of livestock manure may be particularly important in the huilong catchment the annual average yields of corn stalks and barley stalks were as high as 20 250 and 6750 kg ha 1 yr 1 while their hg contents were 0 32 0 05 mg kg 1 and 0 15 0 03 mg kg 1 respectively xia et al 2021a a portion of the harvested straw is naturally degraded and incorporated into the soil as it is returned to the fields the remaining portion of straw is usually recycled by farmers to feed livestock and the resulting farmyard manure is applied to the farmland thus while the soil fertility of the cultivated layer is improved the content of organically bound hg in the soil is always maintained at a high level hg sr 2 is potentially bioavailable especially when the soil is acidic soil hg in the form of hg sr 2 could increase hg contents in crop products and subsequently increase the risk of hg exposure by local residents consuming products meanwhile hg sr 2 in soil could also increase the possibility of hg conversion to ionic hg which will increase the potential downward migration of hg from the upper soil layers by leaching the proportion of ionic hg increased gradually with soil depth from 4 2 to 6 9 and then to 10 7 fig 4 the acidic nature of the soil at huilong likely allows for significant leaching resulting in continuous accumulation and increasing proportions of ionic hg from the top to bottom of the soil profile this trend is consistent with observed downward increase in organic matter content fig 4 the ionic hg that can be combined and fixed by the organic matter decreases suggesting that with continued leaching of ionic hg the sorption capacity of the organic matter becomes saturated allowing hg to be transported to greater depths leterme et al 2014 mclagan et al 2022 a considerable amount ranging from a few percent to a dozen percent of ionic hg has been observed in the soils of several world famous hg mining districts such as almadén asturias spain idria slovenia and wanshan china esbri et al 2010 yin et al 2016 soils characterized by high hg background content and intensive soil leaching of ionic hg increases the risk of the downward migration of soil hg to groundwater note that it is not suitable to directly compare the ionic hg determined by xanes with water extracted hg due to their significant differences caused by matrix and particle size and or by crystallinity effect which affect the apparent solubility of hg phase kim et al 2003 the proportion of α hgs increases toward the deep soil from 8 5 to 9 3 and to 21 0 α hgs was the main component of natural hg ore the content of this form of hg tends to decrease with soil formation it may be transformed to other forms of hg by biologically mediated weathering gómez armesto et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the closer the soil is to the surface the stronger the weathering is and the more primary minerals are degraded thereby reducing the portion of soil hg as α hgs bourdineaud et al 2020 the proportions of β hgs in the h a o and h a a were 13 6 and 9 3 respectively whereas those of nano β hgs were 26 8 and 50 0 respectively a possible factor producing the opposite trends between β hgs and nano β hgs is the transformation of nano β hgs which is an amorphous hg sulfide soil weathering especially in the cultivated layer that is strongly disturbed by farming may promote the transformation of nano β hgs into more stable β hgs in the forestland of the huilong catchment the proportion of organically bound hg hg sr 2 declined slightly from 39 3 in the h f o to 34 5 in the h f a this observed downward trend may be due to the accumulation of hg in the surficial soil organic layer of the forestland from degradation of litterfall where the soil organic matter is constantly being renewed the hg flux from litterfall input in the huilong catchment was estimated to be 129 85 3 μg m 2 yr 1 xia et al 2021a most of the hg derived from the degradation of litterfall will be incorporated into the soil allowing organically bound hg in the surface soil to be maintained at a relatively high level the proportion of ionic hg increased significantly from 6 7 in the h f o to 11 6 in the h f a the observed trend may be controlled by soil ph and som as described for the farmland soil it may also be related to the greater moisture content of the forestland soils which have a natural advantage in water retention in comparison to adjacent non forestlands monteiro venturini et al 2022 the tall forest canopy reduces solar radiation reaching to the surface thereby reduces temperature and evaporation rate of soil water which leads to higher soil moisture content that is conducive to leaching in contrast to the farmland soil profile the proportion of α hgs in the forestland profile initially decreases by a large amount and then increases at greater depths fig 4 the sharp decrease may be due to the lack of a plow layer in the surface soil that has been disturbed by anthropogenic activities over the years in addition the top layer of the forest was characterized by litterfall and there was more bedrock in the bottom layer α hgs in the a horizon is affected by its higher water content and by its well developed plant root system that strengthens the effects of soil weathering and leaching thus the primary minerals in this layer were α hgs which would be transformed into other forms of secondary minerals under strong weathering and leaching conditions the limited weathering within the h f c results in a large proportion of the primary mineral α hgs which accounts for 85 4 of the total leaving the remaining 16 9 as β hgs in general som was closely related to the oxidizable hg in the process of soil formation the main primary mineral α hgs of the hg ore gradually changed to other mineral types as the soil depth increases the proportion of hg sr 2 decreases while the ionic hg tends to increase it is worth to note that the increasing tendency of ionic hg with increasing soil depth implies that the risk of soil hg entering groundwater is high in the karst areas with high hg background therefore both soil hg profile and possible migration of hg to groundwater need to be closely monitored in order to develop effective control measures to prevent soil hg pollution to groundwater 3 5 mercury isotopic signatures in karst hydrological processes the hg isotopic signatures of rainfall in huilong were δ202hg 1 00 0 61 δ199hg 0 48 0 19 and δ200hg 0 13 0 05 n 8 and those of throughfall were δ202hg 1 77 0 47 δ199hg 0 06 0 11 and δ200hg 0 02 0 03 n 8 fig 5 a the hg isotopic signatures of rainfall in chenqi were δ202hg 0 42 0 14 δ199hg 0 29 0 17 and δ200hg 0 12 0 03 n 5 and those of throughfall were δ202hg 1 44 0 60 δ199hg 0 07 0 16 and δ200hg 0 07 0 04 n 11 fig 5b note that the hg isotopic signatures of natural precipitation in the global background area were δ202hg 0 57 0 48 δ199hg 0 44 0 23 and δ200hg 0 25 0 19 chen et al 2012 demers et al 2013 donovan et al 2013 the mdf of hg isotopes in the chenqi catchment was slightly negative and the mif of hg isotope was significantly negative by about 0 2 which was likely due to the significantly higher hg concentration in the precipitation in chenqi 7 9 26 0 ng l 1 compared to those of the forest precipitation in the global background area 5 9 19 0 ng l 1 fu et al 2010 schwesig and matzner 2000 xia et al 2021a the hg isotopic signatures observed in chenqi reflect the influence of anthropogenic hg sources that have negative δ202hg and close to 0 δ199hg and δ200hg blum et al 2014 kwon et al 2020 tsui et al 2020 besides a portion of the hg isotopic signatures of the throughfall was inherited from those of the vegetation canopy due to the washout of particulate hg adsorbed on the surface of leaves and trunks by throughfall the hg isotopic signatures of the vegetation canopy were characterized with negative δ202hg and δ199hg and close to 0 δ200hg demers et al 2013 yu et al 2016 in conclusion the hg isotopic signatures of the forest soil do not have positive δ200hg and the δ199hg signal was further diluted such a finding was of great significance for tracing the hg cycle in the hydrological process of the karst area the hg isotopic signatures of bulk soil were δ202hg 0 29 0 24 δ199hg 0 01 0 06 and δ200hg 0 02 0 03 n 11 in huilong catchment fig 5a and were δ202hg 1 34 0 34 δ199hg 0 02 0 06 and δ200hg 0 02 0 02 n 7 in chenqi catchment fig 5b the hg isotope composition of bedrock were δ202hg 0 79 0 23 δ199hg 0 05 0 05 and δ200hg 0 01 0 03 n 3 in huilong catchment and were δ202hg 0 83 0 05 δ199hg 0 17 0 07 and δ200hg 0 04 0 01 n 2 in chenqi catchment compared with hg isotope composition of bedrocks in the other regions of the world δ202hg was usually negative and both δ199hg and δ200hg were close to 0 obrist et al 2017 smith et al 2008 the slightly positive δ199hg for carbonate rocks observed in the present study may be related to the material deposition diagenesis process but more evidences are needed to confirm this the hg isotope composition of surface runoff in huilong were δ202hg 0 66 0 27 δ199hg 0 16 0 13 and δ200hg 0 03 0 04 n 5 and those of groundwater were δ202hg 0 42 0 15 δ199hg 0 05 0 07 and δ200hg 0 03 0 01 n 4 fig 5a the hg isotope composition of surface runoff in chenqi were δ202hg 1 10 0 23 δ199hg 0 06 0 15 and δ200hg 0 02 0 08 n 5 and those of groundwater were δ202hg 1 38 0 21 δ199hg 0 02 0 10 and δ200hg 0 00 0 02 n 6 fig 5b the hg isotopes of surface runoff retained the signatures of rainfall to a certain extent especially the positive δ199hg likely because the surface runoff in this area was formed within a short time after rainfall and then infiltrated rapidly the hg isotopes of groundwater were generally consistent with those of soil in the two catchments suggesting sufficient exchange with soil hg including a series of adsorption desorption processes after precipitation entering the soil system mclagan et al 2022 using the triple mixing isotope model it was estimated that soil hg rainfall hg and throughfall hg contributed 84 9 11 9 and 5 12 respectively to groundwater hg in huilong and 88 12 5 20 and 7 25 respectively in chenqi thus soil hg was the main source for groundwater hg surface fissures developed in karst areas and land use types may directly impact rainfall and throughfall hg input to groundwater 3 6 the implications of soil hg transformation to karst groundwater safety due to the unique dual hydrologic structure of the area s karst system characterized by both an above ground and underground flow field the downward migration of soil hg becomes a potential risk for regional groundwater security in karst areas with high hg background concentrations such as in huilong catchment with a soil hg pool as high as 44 4 4 2 g m 2 previous research documented that hg dom and ionic hg have relatively higher vertical mobility in soil gai et al 2016 hg sr 2 investigated in the present study has similar chemical properties to those of hg dom reported in literature liu et al 2019a fig 6 shows an illustration of hg migration and transformation in farmland and forest soil profiles in the huilong catchment based on results from the present study and data reported in xia et al 2021a the present study shows ionic hg increases with increasing soil depth and such an increase is stronger in forest soil from 6 7 to 11 6 than in farmland soil from 4 2 to 10 7 while hg sr 2 decreases with soil depth and the trend is stronger in farmlands from 44 0 to 20 3 than forests from 39 3 to 34 5 soil moisture contents are likely higher in forest soils than farmland soils due to the higher canopy height of forests the leaching effect of ionic hg in forest soils is thus stronger as seen in the stronger trend of its vertical migration the input of forest litterfall provides continuous replenishment of organic matter in the understory soil resulting in downward migration of hg sr 2 at the catchment scale hg input flux from precipitation and output flux through runoff were 20 9 13 3 μg m 2 yr 1 and 21 6 0 93 μg m 2 yr 1 respectively xia et al 2021a soil hg speciation and associated high levels of hg fluxes in various hydrological processes suggest the potential risks of soil hg migration to groundwater in this karst area this was consistent with the results of hg isotope source analysis for groundwater hg 4 conclusions the groundwater hg was derived mainly from soil in huilong and chenqi catchments the extremely high soil hg pool suggests a big risk of hg diffusion to the surrounding environment in huilong from the perspective of the vertical migration of hg in the soil profiles a more obvious hg depletion was observed in the forest soil than the farmland soil during soil formation α hgs which is the primary hg ore mineral is gradually transformed into other mineral types and this slow transformation process of α hgs in the soil provides opportunity for groundwater contamination the proportion of organic bound hg sr 2 decreased while the proportion of ionic hg increased with increasing soil depth it is particularly noteworthy that the tendency of ionic hg to increase with soil depth suggests an increased risk of soil hg entering into groundwater in karst areas with high hg background therefore the management and remediation of soil hg pollution in such areas should focus on not only hg at the soil surface but also hg migration to groundwater future research should take into account the migration and transformation of hg in hydrological processes under different land use in karst areas credit authorship contribution statement jicheng xia

15381,guizhou province is located in the heart of a karst zone in southwest china which is one of the largest karst areas in the world given the fragile surface ecosystem and highly developed underground karst structure the migration and transformation of soil hg may impact groundwater quality in karst environments with high hg background concentrations this study examines the vertical migration and transformation of soil mercury hg in two karst catchments huilong and chenqi with the former containing high hg contents associated with mineralization and the latter representing regional background hg the results show that the soil hg pool in the huilong catchment was as high as 44 4 4 2 g m 2 whereas in the chenqi catchment was only 0 17 0 02 g m 2 compared with farmland soil forest soil showed a significant loss of hg the results of l3 x ray absorption near edge structure of hg indicated that α hgs the primary mineral of hg ore gradually changed to other mineral types during soil formation in huilong catchment the proportion of organic bound hg sr 2 out of total hg decreased from 44 0 to 20 3 when soil depth increased from 10 cm to 160 cm in farmland soil profile and from 39 3 to 34 5 in forest soil profile while the proportion of ionic hg increased with soil depth from 4 2 to 10 7 in the farmland soil profile and from 6 7 to 11 6 in the forestland soil profile results from the triple mixing isotope model show that soil hg accounts for more than 80 hg in groundwater in the two catchments results from this study indicate potential risks of soil

availability i have shared the link to my data at the attach file step 1 introduction mercury is one of the most toxic heavy metal pollutants and can be transported globally by atmospheric processes barkay and wagner dobler 2005 driscoll et al 2013 karst ecosystems with high hg background concentrations play a unique role in the global hg biogeochemical cycle especially through fast flow into aquifers and associated risks of groundwater contamination chorover et al 2007 hartmann et al 2021 xia et al 2021a the global hg mineralization zone and karst concentrated area are highly overlapping in southwest china see figs s1 s2 goldscheider et al 2020 gustin et al 1999 china possesses the largest area of karst terrain in the world and nearly half of the karst landforms in china are distributed in the southwestern part of the country huang et al 2008 the karst region of southwest china covers an area of 6 2 104 km2 and is located on the global hg mineralization belt a region containing the majority of the hg ore deposits in china for example guizhou province in this region the most important hg production base in china possesses an estimated hg reserve of 880 000 tons accounting for about 78 of the national total qiu et al 2009 the area is characterized by low temperature metallogenic ores associated with numerous exposed low temperature hydrothermal deposits the mining and smelting of hg and other mineral resources release large quantities of hg to the surface environment mercury contents in surface 0 25 cm depth and deeper soils in the karst region of southwest china are 3 5 times higher than those in the other regions of china largely due to the region s high geochemical background hg levels nie et al 2019 the high background hg contents associated with the region s contiguous karst landforms combined with extensive agricultural activities may negatively impact the region s function as an important ecological barrier that protects the middle and upper reaches of the yangtze and pearl rivers specifically excessive agricultural and mining activities may exacerbate the release of hg into the atmosphere water and soil environments seriously affect the environmental quality and agricultural product safety of karst areas in fact human activities and other factors that enhanced soil erosion have resulted in an 84 increase in the loss of hg from 1990 to 2010 in the karst areas of southwest china liu et al 2019b a better understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of hg in the karst ecosystem is urgently needed in order to sustain future agricultural development while maintaining a health ecological environment vegetation plays a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of hg in terrestrial ecosystems on the global scale forest ecosystems are a net sink of atmospheric hg which absorb about 1180 tons of hg from the atmosphere annually wang et al 2016 agricultural cultivation strongly perturbs the biogeochemical cycling of hg in terrestrial ecosystems fertilization with chemical fertilizers and livestock manure and application of straw to the ground surface represent additional sources of soil hg in farmlands while crop harvesting removes hg from soils but brings non negligible hg exposure health risks to residents in areas with high hg background concentrations xia et al 2021a the contradiction between humans demand for agricultural cultivation and shortage of cultivated land has been long last in the karst areas of southwest china large scale conversion of bare lands to sloping cultivated lands with low yield has enhanced soil erosion some of these converted agricultural lands were later abandoned due to the movement of the rural people into urban living guided by the government policy of building a green environment the vegetation coverage in the karst areas has increased in recent years for example the forest coverage in guizhou province has increased from 30 of the land area in 1998 to 60 in 2020 such big land use change likely has impacts on hg biogeochemical cycling in terrestrial ecosystems as well as to underground water quality the underground drainage network in the karst area is highly developed while the thickness of the soil is relatively thin limiting the region s capacity to resist environmental damage xiao et al 2021 given the combined traits of an ecologically fragile karst ecosystem and high hg background levels the main factors controlling the migration of soil hg and its transformation under different land use conditions in karst areas need to be better understood these factors may play an important role in determining and preventing the risk of groundwater hg pollution in karst areas bavec and gosar 2016 bollen et al 2008 while we have a reasonably good understanding of the mass balance of hg on the catchment scales fig s5 s6 we know little about the fate of soil hg to fill this knowledge gap there is a need to distinguish the behavior of soil hg in the hydrological process of rainfall infiltration into groundwater considering the unique surface underground dual water flow structure in karst areas soil hg distribution speciation stable isotope composition can provide important information to explore the sources of groundwater hg through quantifying soil hg pool and vertical migration this study used water extraction and synchrotron radiation technology to assess the migration and transformation of soil hg in karst catchments mediated by land use types and to determine the main controlling factors for the transformation of soil hg speciation under various conditions particularly hg stable isotope composition in precipitation soil runoff and associated environmental media were analyzed to understand the soil hg fate in karst ecosystem mercury in soil profiles under different geological background conditions and land use types was analyzed in detail in terms of hg distribution speciation and stable isotope composition to better understand the vertical migration and transformation of soil hg and its potential impacts to groundwater in karst areas knowledge gained in this study is useful for developing future land use management and hg emission control policies in order to sustain future agricultural development while maintaining a healthy ecological environment 2 materials and methods 2 1 sites descriptions the two karst catchments in southwestern china huilong and chenqi were selected in a previous study to assess the source and sink of hg using a mass balance approach xia et al 2021a the same two catchments were also selected in the present study to investigate the migration and transformation of soil hg under different land use briefly the huilong catchment is located in the southwestern part of guizhou province whereas the chenqi catchment is located in the central part of the province fig s3 and they are underlain by detrital sandstone and limestone respectively sun et al 2012 zhao et al 2010 mercury mining in the huilong catchment continued for about 350 years and ceased in the 1950s but there are no known hg deposits in chenqi wang et al 2005 these two catchments are representative of the region with the former having higher and the latter having lower hg or background levels more information about these two catchments can be found in xia et al 2021a 2 2 sampling and measurement the locations for soil profile sampling were selected based on the distributions of forests and farmlands within the catchment two locations were selected within each catchment one for forest soil and another for agricultural soil soil and bedrock sampling were performed with a circular knife geological hammer from top to bottom to avoid contamination the soil and bedrock samples were put into sample bags numbered and shipped to the laboratory for drying at 40 c the soil samples were weighed and recorded and then the visible plants and larger stones higher than 2 mm were removed from the samples fernández martínez et al 2015 shaheen and rinklebe 2018 after grinding the soil and bedrock samples were screened through a 200 mesh sieve the materials were then separated and recorded for further chemical analysis an hg analyzer dma80 milestone ltd italy was used to determine the total hg content in the collected soil and bedrock samples the method s detection limit is 0 01 ng g 1 the average relative standard deviation for the duplicate analyses of hg was 4 7 matrix spiked recoveries ranged from 92 to 105 mean 97 n 6 the equipment blank for hg in liquid samples was 0 05 0 01 ng l 1 n 6 the soil reference material gbw07405 was used for soil analytical quality control the measured average hg content of the reference materials was 0 27 0 09 mg kg 1 n 6 which was comparable to the certified value of 0 29 0 04 mg kg 1 the relative percentage differences between the sample replicates were 7 the sampling and measurement for throughfall rainfall surface runoff and groundwater were similar to those described in detailed addressed in xia et al 2021a two sites in chenqi and three sites in huilong catchments were established to collect monthly throughfall the portion of rainfall which falls to the forest floor from the canopy from august 2018 to july 2019 excluding for the dry months one site at each catchment was established to collect rainfall open field precipitation during the same period as for throughfall a 1 2 m2 rain board covered with poly tetra fluoro ethylene ptfe was placed 0 6 m above the ground to collect rain samples to avoid possible interference of litterfall and insect debris a plastic bag was used to cover the rain board during the non sampling period and this bag was opened at the start and closed at the end of precipitation sampling of surface runoff in each catchment was conducted above the surface converges of runoff and underground runoff was conducted in water heads of underground runoff at low terrain monthly surface runoff and underground runoff samples were collected in each catchment during the same period as for throughfall a 5 l brown borosilicate glass bottle was used to collect the water sample the collected water samples were filtered through a cellulose membrane 0 45 μm pore size 47 mm diameter durapore millipore into clean and marked brown borosilicate glass bottles spiked with hcl final concentration 0 5 v v oxidized by 50 ml brcl 0 2 m for 24 h pre reduced by 20 ml nh2oh hcl 3 6 m then reduced with 40 ml sncl2 1 05 m to reduce aqueous hg2 to hg0 the reduced hg0 was blown out for 1 h at a flow rate of 2 5 l min 1 and collected by a chlorine impregnated activated carbon clc trap li et al 2019 bedrock soils and clc pre enriched samples were thermal released by two stage temperature controlled tubular muffle furnace for isotopic analysis mercury released by thermal decomposition was treated with 5 ml of 40 aqua regia absorption liquid capture demers et al 2013 jiskra et al 2017 the capture solution was stored in a refrigerator at 4 c prior to hg isotope analysis mercury concentration of the absorbing liquid was determined according to the method of useap 1631 with a hg analyzer tekran 2500 tekran ltd ca and the detection limit of this method was 0 2 ng l 1 the method recoveries of pretreatment were tested using standard reference materials bcr 482 480 20 μg kg 1 and gss 4 590 50 μg kg 1 which were 92 1 3 5 n 6 and 94 5 4 7 n 6 respectively 2 3 water extracted soil hg approximately 0 4 g of soil sample was placed in a centrifuge tube and then 35 ml of milli q water 18 2 mώ was added three replicates per sample these tubes were then shaken at room temperature for 20 h and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min to separate the supernatant the residue was washed and centrifuged with 5 ml water and the supernatant was separated and combined with the supernatant obtained in the previous step the supernatant was subsequently filtered prior to analysis to determine the quantity of hg that was in water extracted soil hg bloom et al 2003 reis et al 2014 mercury concentrations in the extracted solutions were analysed by cold vapor atomic fluorescence spectrometry tekran 2500 refer to the usa epa method 1631 2 4 x ray absorption near edge structure spectrum of hg l3 about 0 1 g of the sieved soil or bedrock sample was placed into a special tablet press fw 4 tianguang instruments china to create a sample pellet φ 1 cm the reference compounds selected in this study were based on the existing literature pertaining to soil and hg components terzano et al 2010 yin et al 2016 and included cinnabar α hgs metacinnabar β hgs synthetic organic bound hg hg sr 2 nano β hgs and ionic hg hgcl2 the method used to determine the synthetic organic bound hg hg sr 2 and nano β hgs was detailed in liu et al 2019a the experiment was conducted at the 1w1b line station of the beijing synchrotron radiation facility bsrf the basic experimental parameters were set at 2 5 gev of electron energy 250 ma of electron current and an energy resolution δe e of 1 3 10 4 for hg l3 edge xanes spectroscopy analyses an energy range of 12 18 12 58 kev was used to acquire the spectra data for hg

calculate the end member ratio with two degrees of freedom the contribution ratio of the three end members can be calculated at the same time a triple mixing isotope model was thus used to quantify

migration coefficient mc can be used to describe the migration and enrichment characteristics of hg in the soil profile relative to the bedrock nesbitt 1979 sun et al 2019 and was calculated as 9 m c c s h g c s z r c r z r c r h g 1 where cs hg and cs zr are the hg and zirconium content in the soil and cr hg and cr zr are those in the bedrock respectively zirconium was chosen as a reference element because of zircon s excellent stability to weathering results from its exceptionally low solubility in aqueous solutions santos et al 2019 soil and bedrock zirconium contents were analysed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry as detailed in xia et al 2021b a mc 0 indicates that the sampling point is enriched in hg during the soil forming process while a mc 0 indicates the hg in the sampling point is depleted 3 results and discussion 3 1 distribution of hg in soil profiles the soil hg contents in the farmland and forested sections of the huilong catchment were 97 9 51 3 mg kg 1 and 20 0 4 9 mg kg 1 respectively and those in the chenqi catchment were 0 16 0 05 mg kg 1 and 0 21 0 19 mg kg 1 respectively soil hg content in the farmland section of the huilong catchment slightly decreased with soil depth beneath the h a o fig 1 a the soil closer to the surface is affected more by agricultural practices such as fertilization as well as atmospheric deposition of hg ma et al 2022 soil hg content gradually increased from the bottom of the h a o to the h a b likely due to the downward leaching and migration of hg from the upper soil layer soil hg content increased significantly with soil depth in the h a c presumably because of its proximity to the parent material that possessed relatively high hg concentrations soil hg content in the forestland section of the huilong catchment decreased with soil depth from the h f o to h f a fig 1b mercury leaching was likely related to the layers with low soil ph between 4 and 5 at greater soil depths hg began to accumulate and soil hg content increased soil hg content in the farmland section of the chenqi catchment was relatively high in the c a o fig 1c possibly because of hg input from agricultural ploughing and atmospheric hg deposition from the lower part of the c a o to the c a a a portion of easily dissolved hg migrated downward through soil seepage and was subsequently fixed in the c a b soil hg content changed little with soil depth in the bottom soil which may be related to the low geological background hg in this area of the chenqi catchment and absence of exogenous hg input or human activities soil hg content in the forestland section of the chenqi catchment exhibited high concentrations in the c f o fig 1d which was mainly due to litterfall hg input soil hg content decreased with soil depth in the c f a due to hg leaching soil hg content increased with soil depth in the c f b due to the migration of hg from the upper soil layer 3 2 mercury migration and accumulation in the karst soil profiles in this study the migration and accumulation of hg in the farmland and forestland soil profiles of the huilong and chenqi catchments were characterized using a migration coefficient mc fig 2 a the farmland soil profile within the huilong catchment possessed two distinct ranges of mc values mc 0 and mc 0 mc is in the range of 0 9 0 0 at soil depths of 0 80 cm and 130 180 cm indicating that soil hg at these depths is relatively depleted this suggests that the shallow and deep seepage of water through the soil has leached the soil hg within these two soil layers abu dieyeh et al 2019 in addition hg may have been lost from the soil surface by interfacial hg exchange with the atmosphere since the background soil hg concentrations are as high as several hundreds of mg kg 1 in this area the magnitude of the interfacial hg exchange between soil and atmosphere interface is likely large and result in hg loss from soil qiu et al 2006 mc is in the range of 0 0 0 9 at soil depths of 80 130 cm indicating that soil hg at these depths is relatively enriched mercury enrichment may be due to the downward transport of hg from the upper layer and its subsequent redeposition for the forest soil profile of the huilong catchment soil hg was relatively depleted in general with mc being in the range of 0 75 0 0 fig 2b in the organic layer 0 20 cm soil depth the degree of hg loss was limited mc 0 54 0 45 likely due to the release of hg from leaf litterfall degradation that supplements the soil hg the degree of hg loss is relatively large between 40 and 60 cm depth mc 0 75 0 71 due to strong leaching and no effective supplementation of hg the depletion of hg decreases at depths closer to the bedrock likley due to higher hg concentrations derived from the bedrock and retained in the regolith and semi regolith near the bedrock in the farmland soil profile of the chenqi catchment soil hg was enriched at all depth with mc being in the range of 0 1 64 fig 2c the farmland is located in lower topographic areas of the catchment and therefore continuously receives and accumulats hg from eroded soil transported by surface runoff from areas of higher terrain and steeper slopes the enrichment of hg in the topsoil may also be related to atmospheric deposition and or agricultural inputs in the accumulation layer of the soil profile between 30 and 60 cm in depth mc increased significantly reaching values as high as 1 6 the very high mc values at these depths indicate highly enriched hg presumably due to leaching from overlying soil santos frances et al 2011 teršič et al 2014 soil hg in the forest soil profile of the chenqi catchment was relatively depleted in general fig 2d with mc being in the range of 0 7 0 0 in the organic layer 0 and 20 cm depth the degree of hg loss was relatively weak possibly because of supplemental hg released from leaf litterfall degradation silva filho et al 2006 soils between 20 and 40 cm depth exhibited a large degree of hg loss fig 2d suggesting strong leaching while with limited hg supplementation the depletion of hg decreases at depths closer to the bedrock which may be because the soil at the bottom of the profile was not fully developed limiting hg migration at this depth in general farmland soils in catchment depressions were close to 2 m in thickness mercury in the deep soils shows varying degrees of depletion or enrichment depending on the superposition of factors such as the contributions of hg from bedrock weathering soil seepage and leaching among others considering that lower ph should enhance hg leaching effendi et al 2020 soil ph might have also played an important role in shaping the soil hg profile knowing that soil ph of huilong catchment is between 4 24 and 6 98 and that of chenqi catchment is between 6 93 and 7 61 table s2 the thickness of the forest soil layer on the hillside is less than 1 meter the thin soil layer could be caused by prominent soil erosion and large hill slopes in the karst area both factors were conducive to hg leaching through surface runoff and internal soil seepage the reduced hg loss in the organic soil layer should be related to the replenishment of soil hg from litterfall input xia et al 2021a 3 3 water extracted hg the water extracted soil hg contents were 51 9 1742 μg kg 1 and 0 88 10 8 μg kg 1 accounting for 0 24 6 3 and 0 73 6 4 of the total hg in huilong and chenqi catchment respectively fig 3 the contents and proportions of water extracted hg increased from the h a o to the h a a and decreased to the h a b in the farmland soil profile of the huilong catchment and increased from the h a o to the h a a in the forestland soil profile of the same catchment fig 3a in the chenqi farmland soil profile fig 3b the contents and proportions of water extracted hg increased from the c a o to the c a a and decreased to the c a b in the forestland soil profile the contents of water extracted hg decreased from c f o to c f b while the proportions of water extracted hg increased first and then decreased there was an obvious similarity among these four profiles in that the water extracted hg had a significant upward trend in the leaching layer a similar phenomenon has also been reported in previous studies this is because most soluble hg in soil occurs in the speciation of non reactive complex binding and it is highly likely that hg binds to soluble humic matter teršič et al 2014 it has also been suggested that nano hg containing particles or colloids may be released during leaching gray et al 2004 3 4 mercury speciation in the soil profiles determined by xanes data obtained from the synchrotron radiation near side absorption spectrum for the farmland soil profile in the huilong catchment fig 4 showed that organically bound hg decreased from the surface h a o to the h a a and to the h a b the proportion of hg sr 2 in these three layers was 44 0 23 2 and 20 3 respectively similar to those of organically bound hg extracted by the bcr the high proportion of organically bound hg in the cultivated layer of the soil may be related to long term agricultural farming activities including the addition of straw and fertilization to the farm field the application of livestock manure may be particularly important in the huilong catchment the annual average yields of corn stalks and barley stalks were as high as 20 250 and 6750 kg ha 1 yr 1 while their hg contents were 0 32 0 05 mg kg 1 and 0 15 0 03 mg kg 1 respectively xia et al 2021a a portion of the harvested straw is naturally degraded and incorporated into the soil as it is returned to the fields the remaining portion of straw is usually recycled by farmers to feed livestock and the resulting farmyard manure is applied to the farmland thus while the soil fertility of the cultivated layer is improved the content of organically bound hg in the soil is always maintained at a high level hg sr 2 is potentially bioavailable especially when the soil is acidic soil hg in the form of hg sr 2 could increase hg contents in crop products and subsequently increase the risk of hg exposure by local residents consuming products meanwhile hg sr 2 in soil could also increase the possibility of hg conversion to ionic hg which will increase the potential downward migration of hg from the upper soil layers by leaching the proportion of ionic hg increased gradually with soil depth from 4 2 to 6 9 and then to 10 7 fig 4 the acidic nature of the soil at huilong likely allows for significant leaching resulting in continuous accumulation and increasing proportions of ionic hg from the top to bottom of the soil profile this trend is consistent with observed downward increase in organic matter content fig 4 the ionic hg that can be combined and fixed by the organic matter decreases suggesting that with continued leaching of ionic hg the sorption capacity of the organic matter becomes saturated allowing hg to be transported to greater depths leterme et al 2014 mclagan et al 2022 a considerable amount ranging from a few percent to a dozen percent of ionic hg has been observed in the soils of several world famous hg mining districts such as almadén asturias spain idria slovenia and wanshan china esbri et al 2010 yin et al 2016 soils characterized by high hg background content and intensive soil leaching of ionic hg increases the risk of the downward migration of soil hg to groundwater note that it is not suitable to directly compare the ionic hg determined by xanes with water extracted hg due to their significant differences caused by matrix and particle size and or by crystallinity effect which affect the apparent solubility of hg phase kim et al 2003 the proportion of α hgs increases toward the deep soil from 8 5 to 9 3 and to 21 0 α hgs was the main component of natural hg ore the content of this form of hg tends to decrease with soil formation it may be transformed to other forms of hg by biologically mediated weathering gómez armesto et al 2020 wu et al 2017 the closer the soil is to the surface the stronger the weathering is and the more primary minerals are degraded thereby reducing the portion of soil hg as α hgs bourdineaud et al 2020 the proportions of β hgs in the h a o and h a a were 13 6 and 9 3 respectively whereas those of nano β hgs were 26 8 and 50 0 respectively a possible factor producing the opposite trends between β hgs and nano β hgs is the transformation of nano β hgs which is an amorphous hg sulfide soil weathering especially in the cultivated layer that is strongly disturbed by farming may promote the transformation of nano β hgs into more stable β hgs in the forestland of the huilong catchment the proportion of organically bound hg hg sr 2 declined slightly from 39 3 in the h f o to 34 5 in the h f a this observed downward trend may be due to the accumulation of hg in the surficial soil organic layer of the forestland from degradation of litterfall where the soil organic matter is constantly being renewed the hg flux from litterfall input in the huilong catchment was estimated to be 129 85 3 μg m 2 yr 1 xia et al 2021a most of the hg derived from the degradation of litterfall will be incorporated into the soil allowing organically bound hg in the surface soil to be maintained at a relatively high level the proportion of ionic hg increased significantly from 6 7 in the h f o to 11 6 in the h f a the observed trend may be controlled by soil ph and som as described for the farmland soil it may also be related to the greater moisture content of the forestland soils which have a natural advantage in water retention in comparison to adjacent non forestlands monteiro venturini et al 2022 the tall forest canopy reduces solar radiation reaching to the surface thereby reduces temperature and evaporation rate of soil water which leads to higher soil moisture content that is conducive to leaching in contrast to the farmland soil profile the proportion of α hgs in the forestland profile initially decreases by a large amount and then increases at greater depths fig 4 the sharp decrease may be due to the lack of a plow layer in the surface soil that has been disturbed by anthropogenic activities over the years in addition the top layer of the forest was characterized by litterfall and there was more bedrock in the bottom layer α hgs in the a horizon is affected by its higher water content and by its well developed plant root system that strengthens the effects of soil weathering and leaching thus the primary minerals in this layer were α hgs which would be transformed into other forms of secondary minerals under strong weathering and leaching conditions the limited weathering within the h f c results in a large proportion of the primary mineral α hgs which accounts for 85 4 of the total leaving the remaining 16 9 as β hgs in general som was closely related to the oxidizable hg in the process of soil formation the main primary mineral α hgs of the hg ore gradually changed to other mineral types as the soil depth increases the proportion of hg sr 2 decreases while the ionic hg tends to increase it is worth to note that the increasing tendency of ionic hg with increasing soil depth implies that the risk of soil hg entering groundwater is high in the karst areas with high hg background therefore both soil hg profile and possible migration of hg to groundwater need to be closely monitored in order to develop effective control measures to prevent soil hg pollution to groundwater 3 5 mercury isotopic signatures in karst hydrological processes the hg isotopic signatures of rainfall in huilong were δ202hg 1 00 0 61 δ199hg 0 48 0 19 and δ200hg 0 13 0 05 n

isotope was significantly negative by about 0 2 which was likely due to the significantly higher hg concentration in the precipitation in chenqi 7 9 26 0 ng l 1 compared to those of the forest precipitation in the global background area 5 9 19 0 ng l 1 fu et al 2010 schwesig and matzner 2000 xia et al 2021a the hg isotopic signatures observed in chenqi reflect the influence of anthropogenic hg sources that have negative δ202hg and close to 0 δ199hg and δ200hg blum et al 2014 kwon et al 2020 tsui et al 2020 besides a portion of the hg isotopic signatures of the throughfall was inherited from those of the vegetation canopy due to the washout of particulate hg adsorbed on the surface of leaves and trunks by throughfall the hg isotopic signatures of the vegetation canopy were characterized with negative δ202hg and δ199hg and close to 0 δ200hg demers et al 2013 yu et al 2016 in conclusion the hg isotopic signatures of the forest soil do not have positive δ200hg and the δ199hg signal was further diluted such a finding was of great significance for tracing the hg cycle in the hydrological process of the karst area the hg isotopic signatures of bulk soil were δ202hg 0 29 0 24 δ199hg 0 01 0 06 and δ200hg 0 02 0 03 n 11 in huilong catchment fig 5a and were δ202hg 1 34 0 34 δ199hg 0 02 0 06 and δ200hg 0 02 0 02 n 7 in chenqi catchment fig 5b the hg isotope composition of bedrock were δ202hg 0 79 0 23 δ199hg 0 05 0 05 and δ200hg 0 01 0 03 n 3 in huilong catchment and were δ202hg 0 83 0 05 δ199hg 0 17 0 07 and δ200hg 0 04 0 01 n 2 in chenqi catchment compared with hg isotope composition of bedrocks in the other regions of the world δ202hg was usually negative and both δ199hg and δ200hg were close to 0 obrist et al 2017 smith et al 2008 the slightly positive δ199hg for carbonate rocks observed in the present study may be related to the material deposition diagenesis process but more evidences are needed to confirm this the hg isotope composition of surface runoff in huilong were δ202hg 0 66 0 27 δ199hg 0 16 0 13 and δ200hg 0 03 0 04 n 5 and those of groundwater were δ202hg 0 42 0 15 δ199hg 0 05 0 07 and δ200hg 0 03 0 01 n 4 fig 5a the hg isotope composition of surface runoff in chenqi were δ202hg 1 10 0 23 δ199hg 0 06 0 15 and δ200hg 0 02 0 08 n 5 and those of groundwater were δ202hg 1 38 0 21 δ199hg 0 02 0 10 and δ200hg 0 00 0 02 n 6 fig 5b the hg isotopes of surface runoff retained the signatures of rainfall to a certain extent especially the positive δ199hg likely because the surface runoff in this area was formed within a short time after rainfall and then infiltrated rapidly the hg isotopes of groundwater were generally consistent with those of soil in the two catchments suggesting sufficient exchange with soil hg including a series of adsorption desorption processes after precipitation entering the soil system mclagan et al 2022 using the triple mixing isotope model it was estimated that soil hg rainfall hg and throughfall hg contributed 84 9 11 9 and 5 12 respectively to groundwater hg in huilong and 88 12 5 20 and 7 25 respectively in chenqi thus soil hg was the main source for groundwater hg surface fissures developed in karst areas and land use types may directly impact rainfall and throughfall hg input to groundwater 3 6 the implications of soil hg transformation to karst groundwater safety due to the unique dual hydrologic structure of the area s karst system characterized by both an above ground and underground flow field the downward migration of soil hg becomes a potential risk for regional groundwater security in karst areas with high hg background concentrations such as in huilong catchment with a soil hg pool as high as 44 4 4 2 g m 2 previous research documented that hg dom and ionic hg have relatively higher vertical mobility in soil gai et al 2016 hg sr 2 investigated in the present study has similar chemical properties to those of hg dom reported in literature liu et al 2019a fig 6 shows an illustration of hg migration and transformation in farmland and forest soil profiles in the huilong catchment based on results from the present study and data reported in xia et al 2021a the present study shows ionic hg increases with increasing soil depth and such an increase is stronger in forest soil from 6 7 to 11 6 than in farmland soil from 4 2 to 10 7 while hg sr 2 decreases with soil depth and the trend is stronger in farmlands from 44 0 to 20 3 than forests from 39 3 to 34 5 soil moisture contents are likely higher in forest soils than farmland soils due to the higher canopy height of forests the leaching effect of ionic hg in forest soils is thus stronger as seen in the stronger trend of its vertical migration the input of forest litterfall provides continuous replenishment of organic matter in the understory soil resulting in downward migration of hg sr 2 at the catchment scale hg input flux from precipitation and output flux through runoff were 20 9 13 3 μg m 2 yr 1 and 21 6 0 93 μg m 2 yr 1 respectively xia et al 2021a soil hg speciation and associated high levels of hg fluxes in various hydrological processes suggest the potential risks of soil hg migration to groundwater in this karst area this was consistent with the results of hg isotope source analysis for groundwater hg 4 conclusions the groundwater hg was derived mainly from soil in huilong and chenqi catchments the extremely high soil hg pool suggests a big risk of hg diffusion to the surrounding environment in huilong from the perspective of the vertical migration of hg in the soil profiles a more obvious hg depletion was observed in the forest soil than the farmland soil during soil formation α hgs which is the primary hg ore mineral is gradually transformed into other mineral types and this slow transformation process of α hgs in the soil provides opportunity for groundwater contamination the proportion of organic bound hg sr 2 decreased while the proportion of ionic hg increased with increasing soil depth it is particularly noteworthy that the tendency of ionic hg to increase with soil depth suggests an increased risk of soil hg entering into groundwater in karst areas with high hg background therefore the management and remediation of soil hg pollution in such areas should focus on not only hg at the soil surface but also hg migration to groundwater future research should take into account the migration and transformation of hg in hydrological processes under different land use in karst areas credit authorship contribution statement jicheng xia

15382,mnbs micro nano bubbles are widely used in cleaning processes for environmental treatments but few studies have examined the interaction of mnbs with coagulation in this study a novel process i e mnbs coagulation was developed for enhanced drinking water treatment the humic acid ha removal efficiency was used to evaluate the effectiveness of mnbs coagulation for drinking water treatment the hydrolysis component ratio of polymeric aluminum chloride pacl with and without mnbs the complexation strength of ha and pacl and flocculent functional group characterization were used to analyze the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process to enhance drinking water treatment the results of a jar test showed that the mnbs coagulation process could improve the removal efficiency of ha up to a 27 9 increase in doc removal in continuous flow experiments to remove ha mnbs coagulation can increase the removal efficiency of uv254 by about 26 5 and with no significant change in turbidity these results are attributed to the inherent hydroxyl radical generating properties of mnbs the forced hydrolysis of pacl by mnbs to increase the alc percentage and the ability of mnbs to increase the complexation strength of ha with pacl at the same time the mnbs coagulation process has a strong anti interference ability almost no interference from anions and cations such as cl so4 2 and ca2 and has a good performance in natural surface water in summary mnbs coagulation has strong potential for practical applications to enhance the efficiency of drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mnbs pacl forced hydrolysis enhanced coagulation drinking water treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a complex matrix of organic substances commonly found in surface water sillanpää et al 2018 humic acid ha which is the main component of nom accounts for about 50 90 of organic matter content yue et al 2021 ha is an electrically negative macromolecular organic substance with a high number of functional groups rodríguez and núñez 2011 ha trends to form strong complexes with heavy metals leading to the formation of organometallic complexes with strong transit capacity bioavailability and toxicity tamamura et al 2013 terashima et al 2007 equally important is the contribution of ha to the formation of disinfection by products dbps golea et al 2017 which may result in the presence of potentially carcinogenic compounds in conventional chlorination disinfection processes including aliphatic halogenated trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans etc serrano et al 2015 surface water is commonly used as a source of drinking water in areas with growing urban populations borrull et al 2021 hence the presence of ha even in trace amounts is a cause of great concern for water quality and its potential impact on human health from chronic exposure various laboratory scale studies have demonstrated that coagulation is the best available economic and efficient method for the removal of ha xu et al 2016 coagulation is based on various functions such as charge neutralization adsorption bridging net catching and sweeping to achieve the removal of pollutants liu et al 2021 polymer coagulation results in large positive charges such as poly aluminum chloride pacl and colloidal forms with rich specific surface areas which are often used as effective components of the coagulation process zhao et al 2012 prior research has indicated that most of the ha can be removed by coagulation but the efficiency with which some low molecular weight or hydrophilic compounds are removed is limited siéliéchi et al 2008 therefore enhanced coagulation is often used as the preferred technique for the more complete removal of ha the addition of absorbents activated carbon wang et al 2016 or oxidants o3 yu et al 2016 to the coagulation process is a common practice for enhanced coagulation although these methods can improve the efficiency of ha removal they increase the size of water treatment facilities generate more solid waste increase carbon consumption and do not meet the requirements of cleaner production processes mnbs have diameters on the scale of nano to micro meters with large specific surface areas zimmerman et al 2011 furthermore due to their superior characteristics such as improved mass transfer efficiency at the gas liquid interface increased hydraulic residence time up to several weeks in solution and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh with high oxidation potentials mnbs have been recognized in recent decades as having great potential to solve various challenges of water treatment atkinson et al 2019 takahashi et al 2007a 2007b the most common applications for mnbs are the enrichment of water with oxygen and in biological water treatment drinking water disinfection groundwater remediation and membrane fouling mitigation by free radical oxidation agarwal et al 2011 dayarathne et al 2019 hu and xia 2018 yasui et al 2018 these studies have aimed to achieve higher pollutant removal efficiency while reducing the size of the facility decreasing run time and maintenance costs of the water treatment plant and minimizing carbon consumption rosa and rubio 2018 soyluoglu et al 2021 although mnbs are widely used as a cleaning process in environmental treatments few studies have applied mnbs to the coagulation process some studies have shown that nom can interact with the surface of mnbs black et al 1965 soyluoglu et al 2021 sugano et al 2017 mnbs can act as collectors and carriers in the aqueous environment absorbing nom in water and carrying nom to track cations fan et al 2019 based on the above background the potential exists for mnbs to absorb and carry with nom during the coagulation process the coagulation efficiency is expected to improve due to the high mass transfer efficiency and oh production properties of mnbs especially in low turbidity water in this study a novel and environmentally friendly mnbs coagulation process is proposed to improve the efficiency of drinking water treatment the ha removal efficiency was used to evaluate the effectiveness of mnbs coagulation for drinking water treatment in jar test and continuous flow test the hydrolysis component ratio of pacl with and without mnbs the complexation strength of ha and pacl and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to analyze the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process to enhance drinking water treatment eventually the influences of water background matrices including cl so4 2 no3 co3 2 ca2 mg2 and natural surface waters on the improvement of drinking water treatment by mnbs coagulation process were systematically evaluated as well as the economic benefits of the process this study is expected to fill the research gap of mnbs in the coagulation process and provide theoretical support for the application of the mnbs coagulation process in practical engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical reagents used were analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china including alcl3 6h2o hcl naoh nacl na2so4 nano3 na2co3 cacl2 mgcl2 and kaolin 2 1 1 characteristics of ha solution and pacl as in previous studies li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the ha used for the current study was obtained from sigma aldrich 53680 usa the preparation of the ha stock solution and experimental raw water was modeled on the study of kong et al 2021 the detailed preparation process and characteristics of ha solution at a certain concentration are shown in text s1 and table s1 respectively unless explicitly stated the experimental ha solution characteristics remained unchanged throughout the study a pacl solution 10 0 g l as al3 was prepared by adding a certain amount of na2co3 solution to an alcl3 6h2o solution with rapid stirring and basicity oh al3 ratio of 2 0 shen et al 2020 the characteristics of pacl are listed in table s3 2 1 2 characteristics of natural surface waters two kinds of natural surface waters were collected from weiming lake at xi an university of architecture and technology and xingqing lake in xingqing park xi an china which are referred to as nwⅰ and nwⅱ respectively to remove the complex particulate matter from the surface waters and reduce the effects of microorganisms the natural surface waters were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes prior to analyses yu et al 2022 the characteristics of the two water samples are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 jar test fig 1 shows device models of the coagulation process and the mnbs coagulation process for jar tests the coagulant dosing method used was the most notable difference between the two processes other corresponding variables being the same in contrast to the direct application of a coagulant in the coagulation process the mnbs coagulation process implemented an additional bubble tank to allow the mnbs to react fully with the coagulant the coagulant was first added to a bubble tank containing 400 ml of local tap water that had been standing for 24 h to eliminate the influence of residual chlorine in the water on the experiment after which the mnbs reacted with the coagulant for 30 s through the self circulating system of the mnb generator finally the diluted coagulant was transferred to the coagulation unit through the outlet pipe the duration of the entire process was approximately 45 s the remainder of the experimental setup for the jar test is presented in text s2 2 2 2 continuous flow test fig s1 shows the device model of the mnbs coagulation process in the continuous flow test the main component of the experimental device is a cylinder with a height of 500 mm and a diameter of 100 mm during the experiment the peristaltic pump and the jet pump were used to control the flow rate of the influent water 50 ml min and the dosage of the coagulant 20 ml min so that the ha concentration and coagulant concentration in the device were 20 mg l and 4 mg l respectively furthermore the coagulant and contaminants were thoroughly mixed using tubular static mixers and stirring paddles in contrast to the coagulation process the micro nano bubble generator introduced mnbs into the coagulant tank alcl3 tank every 30 min for 15 min with a gas flow rate of 60 ml min for the mnbs coagulation process in the coagulation process there was no involvement of mnbs and the coagulant was introduced directly to raw water unlike the jar test pacl b 2 0 was not used for the continuous flow test instead a certain amount of alcl3 6h2o was dissolved directly in tap water to a pre determined concentration 10 mg l as al3 luo et al 2020 yan et al 2021 this design was to simulate actual drinking water treatment 2 2 3 micro nano bubble generator the micro nano bubble generator used in the mnbs coagulation process was purchased from shanghai xingheng technology co lf 1500 china the device generates micro nano bubbles by the pressurized dissolved gas method unless explicitly stated the air was used as a gas source to produce mnbs during the experiments the internal pressure of the micro nano bubble generator was maintained at 0 4 mpa and only the gas flow rate was varied qg 20 40 60 ml min the size distribution and concentration of mnbs for various qg were measured using a nanoparticle tracking analyzer zetaview pmx120 germany the size and concentration of mnbs were sampled after one minute of aeration in deionized water using a micro nano bubble generator and this procedure was repeated more than three times the deionized water without mnbs qg 0 ml min was used as a blank control after one minute of aeration in deionized water by the micro nano bubble generator the size and concentration of mnbs were sampled and this procedure was repeated more than three times the test results are shown in table 2 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis uv254 was characterized by a hitachi u 3900 spectrophotometer doc was measured by using a multi n c 2100s toc analyzer all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter 2 3 2 analysis of the transformation of al species during the coagulation process before the coagulation process the al species distribution of pacl was analyzed by the al ferron method after coagulation the aluminum hydrolysis distribution and transformation were investigated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms and recorded with a thermo scientific q exactive hrms all esi ms measurements were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and analyzed in the positive ion mode 2 3 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis an x ray photoelectron spectrometer kratos axis ultra dld was used for the xps analysis of flocs all flocs tested were produced by a reaction in a ph 7 solution separated by centrifugation after 15 min of precipitation and then freeze dried 2 3 4 excitation emission matrix eem analysis three dimensional eems spectra were acquired by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan which was set up as below excitation wavelengths ex ranged from 200 to 400 nm at 3 nm increments and emission wavelengths em were 250 to 550 in 3 nm increments li et al 2020a to minimize possible metal nom complexation the ph of the samples was adjusted to 2 8 0 1 using 0 1 m hcl baghoth et al 2011 2 3 5 other analytical methods the zeta potential was characterized by a malvern zs90 methanol trapping was used for the determination of oh content fan et al 2020 flyunt et al 2003 the method used an excess of tert butanol to completely capture the generated oh and expressed the amount of oh as a stable reaction product hcho neural network fitting and parafac eems were used in matalab r2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of the mnbs coagulation process fig 2 presents the uv254 and doc removal efficiency of the mnbs coagulation process for ha at different ph ph 6 7 8 and 2 mg l pacl as al3 for mnbs coagulation the presence of mnbs could enhance uv254 removal efficiency compared with coagulation in acidic and neutral solutions this phenomenon might be attributed to the influence of mnbs on the zeta potential of aqueous solution before coagulation as shown in fig s2 when the ph was 6 or 7 the participation of mnbs before coagulation could improve the zeta potential of the solution which was helpful to enhance the electrical neutralization in the coagulation process thus improving the removal efficiency of uv254 bu et al 2016 2019 when the ph was 8 the involvement of mnbs had a certain negative effect on the zeta potential of the solution the reduction of electrical neutralization inhibited the removal of uv254 xu et al 2020 for doc removal efficiency the presence of mnbs promoted the doc removal for all ph with a maximum increase in doc removal of 27 9 one reason for this result is that mnbs remove partial ha by the generation of oh wang et al 2018 as shown in fig s3 although there was no oh detected at ph 8 al3 could promote mnbs to generate oh when a certain amount of pacl was added to the solution in addition the results in fig s4 showed that when tertiary butanol was added to the solution as a hydroxyl radical quencher mnbs alone had almost no effect on ha removal before 300 s compared with the control group without tertiary butanol participation when tertiary butanol was gradually consumed after 300 s the oh gradually played the oxidation role this conclusion indicates that oh produced by mnbs has a certain effect on enhancing coagulation efficiency however the doc removal results differed somewhat from the uv254 removal results especially in alkaline environments for mnbs coagulation the reasons for this difference in results will be analyzed in detail below to verify the feasibility of the mnbs coagulation process for practical engineering applications mnbs were applied to a continuous coagulation unit the experimental results and the fitting results are shown in figs 3 and s5 compared to the coagulation process the mnbs coagulation process improved the removal efficiency of ha uv254 by 26 5 in addition it can be seen from the fitting results that the participation of mnbs in the coagulation process improves the stability of the process and helps to effectively cope with the effects of water quality fluctuations in summary the mnbs coagulation process has a certain prospect for engineering applications 3 2 characteristics of aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behaviors 3 2 1 al ferron complexation timed spectrophotometry given the significant effect of qg on the ha removal efficiency by coagulation for various values of ph the al species distributions of the pacl under different ph and qg i e ph at 6 7 8 and qg of 0 20 40 60 ml min before coagulation are shown in fig 4 and table s4 the hydrolyzed al species can be divided into monomeric species ala intermediate polymer species alb and higher polymers with colloidal or solid species alc lee et al 2012 shirasaki et al 2016 ala is composed of a monomer al3 al oh 2 a dimer al2 oh 2 4 a trimer al3 oh 4 5 and some small polymers which normally have small molecular weights mws of 1 kda and play the role of charge neutralizers yan et al 2007 alb represents polymers with mws in the range of 1 3 kda and alc represents polymers with mws larger than 3 kda alb and alc participate in adsorption bridging and net sweeping respectively shu xuan et al 2014 before coagulation fig 4 and table s4 show that the al species distribution and transformation of the pacl were strongly impacted by qg for different values of ph at different ph the presence of mnbs enables further hydrolysis of pacl increasing the proportion of alc although alb remains the main component when qg 40 ml min the alc proportion was increased to the maximum value and the alc proportion increased to 40 03 45 53 and 24 13 for ph 6 7 and 8 respectively previous studies have shown that the increase in the proportion of alc decreases uv254 removal but increases the removal efficiency of doc du et al 2021 wang et al 2019 this result could be well explained by the fact that mnbs coagulation could improve doc removal efficiency by increasing the percentage of alc especially in an alkaline environment the increase in the proportion of alc in pacl at different values of qg could be attributed to the forced hydrolysis reaction brought about by the hydroxyl ions oh adsorbed on the surface of mnbs in previous studies mnbs have large negative surface charges which are caused by the adsorption and aggregation of oh on the surface of mnbs haris et al 2020 zangi and engberts 2005 the adsorption of the oh is attributed to its total specificity and is independent of the properties of present gasses for air h2 o2 or n2 creux et al 2009 beattie et al 2008 the specific adsorption of oh resulted in the mnbs becoming negatively charged even under neutral conditions because of their negative charge mnbs could transport oh towards positive charges especially al3 or other al polymers in solution a large number of oh on the surface of mnbs surround the al3 or al polymers to create a strong alkaline microenvironment forcing the al salt to hydrolyze and form keggin al13 al12alo4 oh 24 7 the most effective active flocculation component of pacl or nal13 tang et al 2015 some studies have shown that the oh generated by ozone can also play a role in promoting the hydrolysis of al salts during the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process jin et al 2017 2021 to investigate the effect of oh generated during mnbs coagulation on the hydrolysis of pacl the gas used to generate mnbs was changed from air to n2 and o2 to simulate the absence and generation of oh wang et al 2018 respectively the experimental results are shown in fig s6 and table s5 the analysis showed that in the mnbs coagulation process the participation of mnbs could hydrolyze pacl regardless of the presence of oh and the presence of oh was not necessarily related to the proportion of alc this result supported the above conclusion that the increase in alc percentage by pacl hydrolysis during the mnbs coagulation process could be attributed to the oh adsorbed on the surface of mnbs 3 2 2 esi ms spectroscopy to further elucidate the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process the effect of qg on the distribution of hydrolyzed al species was analyzed with esi ms the esi ms spectra obtained at different qg for mnbs coagulation are shown in figs s7 s10 the al species can be distinguished based on the mass to charge ration m z feng et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 the signals of al species detected in the esi ms spectra are shown in table s6 four al species were categorized as follows al1 al2 species monomeric and dimeric al complexes al3 al5 species small polymeric al species al6 al10 species median polymeric al species and al11 al20 species large polymeric al species zhao et al 2009 the abundance of polymeric al species was estimated semi quantitatively by signal intensities relative to al species the results are shown in fig 5 the median and large polymeric al species were significantly lower after coagulation than before which suggests that adsorption bridging and net sweeping played a major mechanistic role in mnbs coagulation furthermore the gradual increase in the percentage of al11 al20 from 17 to 23 after coagulation with increasing qg indirectly indicates that the involvement of mnbs causes hydrolysis of pacl and increases the percentage of al11 al20 in the coagulant notably the increased proportion of al13 from 6 to 22 after coagulation also further demonstrated the ability of mnbs to increase the proportion of al13 in coagulants by forcing pacl hydrolysis al13 is considered a highly efficient polymeric aluminum species for coagulation not only because of its strong charge neutralization capacity but also its nucleation ability to form flocs with dom to produce colloids and to precipitate efficiently in low turbidity water lin et al 2008 yan et al 2008 as a result the efficiency of doc removal improved 3 3 complexation between pacl and ha in the mnbs coagulation process complexation plays an important role in the removal of dom and impurity ions from water by coagulation it has been pointed out that positively charged coagulant monomers or hydrolysis products can interact with negatively charged organic functional groups boguta et al 2016 the presence of many unsaturated sites in the quinone and phenol functional groups on the surface of organic matter makes it easy for metal ions to approach the surface and complex with the organic matter at the active sites to explore the effect of different values of qg on the strength of complexation between ha and al salts the complexation of ha with pacl after mnbs coagulation was calculated and analyzed using differential lna dlna eq 1 and dslope325 375 eq 2 minghao and fangang et al 2016 1 d l n a i λ l n a i λ l n a r e f λ 2 d s l o p e 325 375 s l o p e 325 375 i s l o p e 325 375 r e f where lnai λ and lnaref λ are the log transformed absorbance values at certain wavelengths measured with and without aluminum respectively slpoe325 375 i is the slope of a straight line from 325 to 375 nm in the log transformed absorbance and slope325 375 ref represents the parameter in the absence of aluminum minghao and fangang 2016 figs s11 and 6 show the changes of absorbance and the differential log transformed absorbance for different values of qg and ph respectively the calculated values of dslope325 375 under different working conditions are shown in fig 7 the calculations show that the involvement of mnbs increased the complexation strength between ha and al salts this result was attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the surface oh of mnbs which were able to transport dom towards cations e g al ions in water fan et al 2019 haris et al 2020 soyluoglu et al 2021 thus increasing the strength of complexation between ha and al salts 3 4 xps analysis of flocs during mnbs coagulation to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the mnbs coagulation process the flocs produced by coagulation with and without the involvement of mnbs were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the total spectrum c 1s o 1s and al 2p as shown in figs 8 and s12 during the coagulation process whether mnbs was involved or not the c 1s spectra of flocs did not change significantly and three c 1s peaks appear at 288 8 286 6 and 284 9 ev these peaks can be assigned to carboxylic carbon coo ether or alcohol carbon c o and aliphatic carbon c c c h monteil rivera et al 2000 and are consistent with the c 1s spectrum of ha the flocculent o 1s spectrum without the involvement of mnbs showed two fitted peaks at 532 86 ev adsorbed oxygen oγ and 531 51 ev surface hydroxyl group oβ ding et al 2016 in the mnbs coagulation process it is observed that the participation of mnbs reduced the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups oβ this phenomenon could be attributed to the depletion of oβ during the production of oh by the mnbs additionally in flocculent samples without the involvement of mnbs two overlapping bands associated with two different al 2p transitions with binding energies of 73 28 ev and 74 12 ev which represent alⅳ al ⅲ tet and alⅵ al ⅲ oct respectively were observed duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 some studies have shown that the al in al oh 3 is mainly octahedral duong et al 2005 while the tetrahedral al is mainly derived from al13 or al13 aggregates lin et al 2009 however when mnbs was involved in the coagulation process the xps results showed that the proportion of tetrahedral al increased by 33 7 from 19 0 to 52 7 the results further indicated that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process could force pacl to further hydrolyze and increase the proportion of al13 which was consistent with the esi ms spectroscopy 3 5 effect of water matrix on mnbs coagulation system 3 5 1 effect of coexisting ions to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions on the removal of ha by the mnbs coagulation process solutions containing 20 mg l ha and four different concentrations 0 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 mm of coexisting ions were treated with the mnbs coagulation process as shown in fig 9 the effects of various coexisting ions cl so4 2 no3 co3 2 ca2 and mg2 used on the removal of ha by the mnbs coagulation process were negligible the results show that the mnbs coagulation process has good anti interference ability and has certain feasibility of engineering application 3 5 2 application in natural surface water treatment to further verify the feasibility of the mnbs coagulation process in practical engineering applications mnbs was applied to natural surface water treatment with uv254 and eem as evaluation indexes in order not to change the concentration of pollutants in raw water tap water in the bubble tank was replaced with an equal volume of raw water as shown in fig s13 and the remaining operating parameters were unchanged in previous studies the eems combined with parallel factor analysis parafac eems has been reported for rapid investigation to identify the removal of unknown fluorescent organic matter ishii and boyer 2012 in this study different fluorescent fractions of nom in natural surface waters were identified by parafac eem and the differences in the treatment of fluorescent compounds with or without mnbs in the coagulation process were further characterized as presented in figs s14 and s15 two fluorescent components i e c1 and c2 were obtained in the natural surface water specifically the component of c1 was described as marine or terrestrial humic substances with the ex em of 248 416 nm baghoth et al 2011 c2 showed an em maximum at 335 nm with double ex peaks at 230 nm and 280 nm which was characterized as protein like components in previous studies dainard et al 2015 li et al 2020a the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component and uv254 are shown in fig 10 for hydrophobic component c1 when mnbs were involved in the coagulation process of nwⅰ and nwⅱ water samples the maximum fluorescence intensity of c1 corresponding to different water samples was reduced by 14 8 and 29 6 respectively compared with the conventional coagulation process this result was corresponding to uv254 for hydrophilic component c2 which is difficult to be removed by coagulation the mnbs coagulation process has a better removal effect the maximum fluorescence intensity corresponding to c2 in two kinds of water samples could be reduced by 55 9 and 28 2 respectively this result verified that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process could improve the removal of hydrophilic organic matter by generating oh forcing pacl hydrolysis and improving the complexation strength of pacl and nom 3 5 3 engineering implications considering the results of continuous treatment of ha fig 3 sequential batch treatment of natural surface water fig 10 and anti interference ability coexisting ions fig 9 by mnbs coagulation process mnbs coagulation process has good engineering feasibility in enhancing the efficiency of drinking water treatment to fully evaluate the engineering application prospects the economic sustainability of the mnbs coagulation process was evaluated in terms of operational costs and chemicals based on previous research information li et al 2023 micari et al 2020 and compared with existing enhanced coagulation processes as shown in table s7 compared with the other three common enhanced coagulation processes the mnbs coagulation process has extremely high economic benefits and good engineering application prospects 3 6 proposed mechanism of mnbs coagulation based on a comparison between the mnbs coagulation and the coagulation process the involvement of mnbs improves the efficiency of pollutant removal and enhances the effectiveness of drinking water treatment the above phenomenon is attributed to the synergy of three main points shown in fig 11 i the presence of h and al3 in the solution accelerates the collapse of mnbs promotes the formation of oh and therefore enables the oxidation of more pollutants ii the oh i e alkaline micro interfaces on the surfaces of mnbs could force pacl hydrolysis which increases the proportion of alc which in turn improves the efficiency of doc removal iii mnbs can collect and transport ha towards al ions thereby increasing the strength of complexation between pacl and ha and improving coagulation efficiency 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel cleaning process i e the mnbs coagulation process to enhance the effectiveness of drinking water treatment the specific enhanced treatment efficiency and enhanced mechanism of action are as follows 1 the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process mnbs coagulation can enhance the removal of nom from water and reduce doc levels in water by up to 27 9 in continuous flow experiments the mnbs coagulation process increased the ha uv254 removal efficiency by about 26 5 compared with the coagulation process without mnbs this process has stable operation strong anti interference ability and good performance in the treatment of natural surface water which has good economic sustainability and good engineering application prospects 2 the al ferron complexation timed spectrophotometry results and esi ms results show that both alc and al13 percentages increase in mnbs coagulation this is attributed to the formation of alkaline micro interfaces by adsorbed hydroxyl groups on the surface of mnbs that cause pacl hydrolysis the increased percentage of alc and al13 contributes to the enhanced removal of doc 3 the results of the complexation experiments show that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process can improve the complexation strength of ha with pacl this is attributed to the fact that mnbs can adsorb ha on their surfaces and transport ha towards al ions in water the increase in complexation strength can also improve doc removal 4 the xps results show that the presence of mnbs can increase the proportion of tetrahedral al in flocs from another perspective this finding validates the conclusion that the participation of mnbs in the coagulation process can force the hydrolysis of

15382,mnbs micro nano bubbles are widely used in cleaning processes for environmental treatments but few studies have examined the interaction of mnbs with coagulation in this study a novel process i e mnbs coagulation was developed for enhanced drinking water treatment the humic acid ha removal efficiency was used to evaluate the effectiveness of mnbs coagulation for drinking water treatment the hydrolysis component ratio of polymeric aluminum chloride pacl with and without mnbs the complexation strength of ha and pacl and flocculent functional group characterization were used to analyze the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process to enhance drinking water treatment the results of a jar test showed that the mnbs coagulation process could improve the removal efficiency of ha up to a 27 9 increase in doc removal in continuous flow experiments to remove ha mnbs coagulation can increase the removal efficiency of uv254 by about 26 5 and with no significant change in turbidity these results are attributed to the inherent hydroxyl radical generating properties of mnbs the forced hydrolysis of pacl by mnbs to increase the alc percentage and the ability of mnbs to increase the complexation strength of ha with pacl at the same time the mnbs coagulation process has a strong anti interference ability almost no interference from anions and cations such as cl so4 2 and ca2 and has a good performance in natural surface water in summary mnbs coagulation has strong potential for practical applications to enhance the efficiency of drinking water treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords mnbs pacl forced hydrolysis enhanced coagulation drinking water treatment data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction natural organic matter nom is a complex matrix of organic substances commonly found in surface water sillanpää et al 2018 humic acid ha which is the main component of nom accounts for about 50 90 of organic matter content yue et al 2021 ha is an electrically negative macromolecular organic substance with a high number of functional groups rodríguez and núñez 2011 ha trends to form strong complexes with heavy metals leading to the formation of organometallic complexes with strong transit capacity bioavailability and toxicity tamamura et al 2013 terashima et al 2007 equally important is the contribution of ha to the formation of disinfection by products dbps golea et al 2017 which may result in the presence of potentially carcinogenic compounds in conventional chlorination disinfection processes including aliphatic halogenated trihalomethanes thms haloacetic acids haas haloacetonitriles hans etc serrano et al 2015 surface water is commonly used as a source of drinking water in areas with growing urban populations borrull et al 2021 hence the presence of ha even in trace amounts is a cause of great concern for water quality and its potential impact on human health from chronic exposure various laboratory scale studies have demonstrated that coagulation is the best available economic and efficient method for the removal of ha xu et al 2016 coagulation is based on various functions such as charge neutralization adsorption bridging net catching and sweeping to achieve the removal of pollutants liu et al 2021 polymer coagulation results in large positive charges such as poly aluminum chloride pacl and colloidal forms with rich specific surface areas which are often used as effective components of the coagulation process zhao et al 2012 prior research has indicated that most of the ha can be removed by coagulation but the efficiency with which some low molecular weight or hydrophilic compounds are removed is limited siéliéchi et al 2008 therefore enhanced coagulation is often used as the preferred technique for the more complete removal of ha the addition of absorbents activated carbon wang et al 2016 or oxidants o3 yu et al 2016 to the coagulation process is a common practice for enhanced coagulation although these methods can improve the efficiency of ha removal they increase the size of water treatment facilities generate more solid waste increase carbon consumption and do not meet the requirements of cleaner production processes mnbs have diameters on the scale of nano to micro meters with large specific surface areas zimmerman et al 2011 furthermore due to their superior characteristics such as improved mass transfer efficiency at the gas liquid interface increased hydraulic residence time up to several weeks in solution and the formation of hydroxyl radicals oh with high oxidation potentials mnbs have been recognized in recent decades as having great potential to solve various challenges of water treatment atkinson et al 2019 takahashi et al 2007a 2007b the most common applications for mnbs are the enrichment of water with oxygen and in biological water treatment drinking water disinfection groundwater remediation and membrane fouling mitigation by free radical oxidation agarwal et al 2011 dayarathne et al 2019 hu and xia 2018 yasui et al 2018 these studies have aimed to achieve higher pollutant removal efficiency while reducing the size of the facility decreasing run time and maintenance costs of the water treatment plant and minimizing carbon consumption rosa and rubio 2018 soyluoglu et al 2021 although mnbs are widely used as a cleaning process in environmental treatments few studies have applied mnbs to the coagulation process some studies have shown that nom can interact with the surface of mnbs black et al 1965 soyluoglu et al 2021 sugano et al 2017 mnbs can act as collectors and carriers in the aqueous environment absorbing nom in water and carrying nom to track cations fan et al 2019 based on the above background the potential exists for mnbs to absorb and carry with nom during the coagulation process the coagulation efficiency is expected to improve due to the high mass transfer efficiency and oh production properties of mnbs especially in low turbidity water in this study a novel and environmentally friendly mnbs coagulation process is proposed to improve the efficiency of drinking water treatment the ha removal efficiency was used to evaluate the effectiveness of mnbs coagulation for drinking water treatment in jar test and continuous flow test the hydrolysis component ratio of pacl with and without mnbs the complexation strength of ha and pacl and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps were used to analyze the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process to enhance drinking water treatment eventually the influences of water background matrices including cl so4 2 no3 co3 2 ca2 mg2 and natural surface waters on the improvement of drinking water treatment by mnbs coagulation process were systematically evaluated as well as the economic benefits of the process this study is expected to fill the research gap of mnbs in the coagulation process and provide theoretical support for the application of the mnbs coagulation process in practical engineering 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical reagents used were analytical grade and obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china including alcl3 6h2o hcl naoh nacl na2so4 nano3 na2co3 cacl2 mgcl2 and kaolin 2 1 1 characteristics of ha solution and pacl as in previous studies li et al 2020b yang et al 2020 yu et al 2010 the ha used for the current study was obtained from sigma aldrich 53680 usa the preparation of the ha stock solution and experimental raw water was modeled on the study of kong et al 2021 the detailed preparation process and characteristics of ha solution at a certain concentration are shown in text s1 and table s1 respectively unless explicitly stated the experimental ha solution characteristics remained unchanged throughout the study a pacl solution 10 0 g l as al3 was prepared by adding a certain amount of na2co3 solution to an alcl3 6h2o solution with rapid stirring and basicity oh al3 ratio of 2 0 shen et al 2020 the characteristics of pacl are listed in table s3 2 1 2 characteristics of natural surface waters two kinds of natural surface waters were collected from weiming lake at xi an university of architecture and technology and xingqing lake in xingqing park xi an china which are referred to as nwⅰ and nwⅱ respectively to remove the complex particulate matter from the surface waters and reduce the effects of microorganisms the natural surface waters were filtered through 0 45 μm membranes prior to analyses yu et al 2022 the characteristics of the two water samples are shown in table 1 2 2 experimental setup 2 2 1 jar test fig 1 shows device models of the coagulation process and the mnbs coagulation process for jar tests the coagulant dosing method used was the most notable difference between the two processes other corresponding variables being the same in contrast to the direct application of a coagulant in the coagulation process the mnbs coagulation process implemented an additional bubble tank to allow the mnbs to react fully with the coagulant the coagulant was first added to a bubble tank containing 400 ml of local tap water that had been standing for 24 h to eliminate the influence of residual chlorine in the water on the experiment after which the mnbs reacted with the coagulant for 30 s through the self circulating system of the mnb generator finally the diluted coagulant was transferred to the coagulation unit through the outlet pipe the duration of the entire process was approximately 45 s the remainder of the experimental setup for the jar test is presented in text s2 2 2 2 continuous flow test fig s1 shows the device model of the mnbs coagulation process in the continuous flow test the main component of the experimental device is a cylinder with a height of 500 mm and a diameter of 100 mm during the experiment the peristaltic pump and the jet pump were used to control the flow rate of the influent water 50 ml min and the dosage of the coagulant 20 ml min so that the ha concentration and coagulant concentration in the device were 20 mg l and 4 mg l respectively furthermore the coagulant and contaminants were thoroughly mixed using tubular static mixers and stirring paddles in contrast to the coagulation process the micro nano bubble generator introduced mnbs into the coagulant tank alcl3 tank every 30 min for 15 min with a gas flow rate of 60 ml min for the mnbs coagulation process in the coagulation process there was no involvement of mnbs and the coagulant was introduced directly to raw water unlike the jar test pacl b 2 0 was not used for the continuous flow test instead a certain amount of alcl3 6h2o was dissolved directly in tap water to a pre determined concentration 10 mg l as al3 luo et al 2020 yan et al 2021 this design was to simulate actual drinking water treatment 2 2 3 micro nano bubble generator the micro nano bubble generator used in the mnbs coagulation process was purchased from shanghai xingheng technology co lf 1500 china the device generates micro nano bubbles by the pressurized dissolved gas method unless explicitly stated the air was used as a gas source to produce mnbs during the experiments the internal pressure of the micro nano bubble generator was maintained at 0 4 mpa and only the gas flow rate was varied qg 20 40 60 ml min the size distribution and concentration of mnbs for various qg were measured using a nanoparticle tracking analyzer zetaview pmx120 germany the size and concentration of mnbs were sampled after one minute of aeration in deionized water using a micro nano bubble generator and this procedure was repeated more than three times the deionized water without mnbs qg 0 ml min was used as a blank control after one minute of aeration in deionized water by the micro nano bubble generator the size and concentration of mnbs were sampled and this procedure was repeated more than three times the test results are shown in table 2 2 3 analytical methods 2 3 1 uv254 and dissolved organic carbon doc analysis uv254 was characterized by a hitachi u 3900 spectrophotometer doc was measured by using a multi n c 2100s toc analyzer all samples were filtered through a 0 45 μm filter 2 3 2 analysis of the transformation of al species during the coagulation process before the coagulation process the al species distribution of pacl was analyzed by the al ferron method after coagulation the aluminum hydrolysis distribution and transformation were investigated using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry esi ms and recorded with a thermo scientific q exactive hrms all esi ms measurements were filtered using a 0 45 μm filter and analyzed in the positive ion mode 2 3 3 x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis an x ray photoelectron spectrometer kratos axis ultra dld was used for the xps analysis of flocs all flocs tested were produced by a reaction in a ph 7 solution separated by centrifugation after 15 min of precipitation and then freeze dried 2 3 4 excitation emission matrix eem analysis three dimensional eems spectra were acquired by a fluorescence spectrophotometer f 7000 hitachi japan which was set up as below excitation wavelengths ex ranged from 200 to 400 nm at 3 nm increments and emission wavelengths em were 250 to 550 in 3 nm increments li et al 2020a to minimize possible metal nom complexation the ph of the samples was adjusted to 2 8 0 1 using 0 1 m hcl baghoth et al 2011 2 3 5 other analytical methods the zeta potential was characterized by a malvern zs90 methanol trapping was used for the determination of oh content fan et al 2020 flyunt et al 2003 the method used an excess of tert butanol to completely capture the generated oh and expressed the amount of oh as a stable reaction product hcho neural network fitting and parafac eems were used in matalab r2018a 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal performance of the mnbs coagulation process fig 2 presents the uv254 and doc removal efficiency of the mnbs coagulation process for ha at different ph ph 6 7 8 and 2 mg l pacl as al3 for mnbs coagulation the presence of mnbs could enhance uv254 removal efficiency compared with coagulation in acidic and neutral solutions this phenomenon might be attributed to the influence of mnbs on the zeta potential of aqueous solution before coagulation as shown in fig s2 when the ph was 6 or 7 the participation of mnbs before coagulation could improve the zeta potential of the solution which was helpful to enhance the electrical neutralization in the coagulation process thus improving the removal efficiency of uv254 bu et al 2016 2019 when the ph was 8 the involvement of mnbs had a certain negative effect on the zeta potential of the solution the reduction of electrical neutralization inhibited the removal of uv254 xu et al 2020 for doc removal efficiency the presence of mnbs promoted the doc removal for all ph with a maximum increase in doc removal of 27 9 one reason for this result is that mnbs remove partial ha by the generation of oh wang et al 2018 as shown in fig s3 although there was no oh detected at ph 8 al3 could promote mnbs to generate oh when a certain amount of pacl was added to the solution in addition the results in fig s4 showed that when tertiary butanol was added to the solution as a hydroxyl radical quencher mnbs alone had almost no effect on ha removal before 300 s compared with the control group without tertiary butanol participation when tertiary butanol was gradually consumed after 300 s the oh gradually played the oxidation role this conclusion indicates that oh produced by mnbs has a certain effect on enhancing coagulation efficiency however the doc removal results differed somewhat from the uv254 removal results especially in alkaline environments for mnbs coagulation the reasons for this difference in results will be analyzed in detail below to verify the feasibility of the mnbs coagulation process for practical engineering applications mnbs were applied to a continuous coagulation unit the experimental results and the fitting results are shown in figs 3 and s5 compared to the coagulation process the mnbs coagulation process improved the removal efficiency of ha uv254 by 26 5 in addition it can be seen from the fitting results that the participation of mnbs in the coagulation process improves the stability of the process and helps to effectively cope with the effects of water quality fluctuations in summary the mnbs coagulation process has a certain prospect for engineering applications 3 2 characteristics of aluminum hydrolysis and coagulation behaviors 3 2 1 al ferron complexation timed spectrophotometry given the significant effect of qg on the ha removal efficiency by coagulation for various values of ph the al species distributions of the pacl under different ph and qg i e ph at 6 7 8 and qg of 0 20 40 60 ml min before coagulation are shown in fig 4 and table s4 the hydrolyzed al species can be divided into monomeric species ala intermediate polymer species alb and higher polymers with colloidal or solid species alc lee et al 2012 shirasaki et al 2016 ala is composed of a monomer al3 al oh 2 a dimer al2 oh 2 4 a trimer al3 oh 4 5 and some small polymers which normally have small molecular weights mws of 1 kda and play the role of charge neutralizers yan et al 2007 alb represents polymers with mws in the range of 1 3 kda and alc represents polymers with mws larger than 3 kda alb and alc participate in adsorption bridging and net sweeping respectively shu xuan et al 2014 before coagulation fig 4 and table s4 show that the al species distribution and transformation of the pacl were strongly impacted by qg for different values of ph at different ph the presence of mnbs enables further hydrolysis of pacl increasing the proportion of alc although alb remains the main component when qg 40 ml min the alc proportion was increased to the maximum value and the alc proportion increased to 40 03 45 53 and 24 13 for ph 6 7 and 8 respectively previous studies have shown that the increase in the proportion of alc decreases uv254 removal but increases the removal efficiency of doc du et al 2021 wang et al 2019 this result could be well explained by the fact that mnbs coagulation could improve doc removal efficiency by increasing the percentage of alc especially in an alkaline environment the increase in the proportion of alc in pacl at different values of qg could be attributed to the forced hydrolysis reaction brought about by the hydroxyl ions oh adsorbed on the surface of mnbs in previous studies mnbs have large negative surface charges which are caused by the adsorption and aggregation of oh on the surface of mnbs haris et al 2020 zangi and engberts 2005 the adsorption of the oh is attributed to its total specificity and is independent of the properties of present gasses for air h2 o2 or n2 creux et al 2009 beattie et al 2008 the specific adsorption of oh resulted in the mnbs becoming negatively charged even under neutral conditions because of their negative charge mnbs could transport oh towards positive charges especially al3 or other al polymers in solution a large number of oh on the surface of mnbs surround the al3 or al polymers to create a strong alkaline microenvironment forcing the al salt to hydrolyze and form keggin al13 al12alo4 oh 24 7 the most effective active flocculation component of pacl or nal13 tang et al 2015 some studies have shown that the oh generated by ozone can also play a role in promoting the hydrolysis of al salts during the hybrid ozonation coagulation hoc process jin et al 2017 2021 to investigate the effect of oh generated during mnbs coagulation on the hydrolysis of pacl the gas used to generate mnbs was changed from air to n2 and o2 to simulate the absence and generation of oh wang et al 2018 respectively the experimental results are shown in fig s6 and table s5 the analysis showed that in the mnbs coagulation process the participation of mnbs could hydrolyze pacl regardless of the presence of oh and the presence of oh was not necessarily related to the proportion of alc this result supported the above conclusion that the increase in alc percentage by pacl hydrolysis during the mnbs coagulation process could be attributed to the oh adsorbed on the surface of mnbs 3 2 2 esi ms spectroscopy to further elucidate the mechanism of the mnbs coagulation process the effect of qg on the distribution of hydrolyzed al species was analyzed with esi ms the esi ms spectra obtained at different qg for mnbs coagulation are shown in figs s7 s10 the al species can be distinguished based on the mass to charge ration m z feng et al 2011 zhao et al 2011 the signals of al species detected in the esi ms spectra are shown in table s6 four al species were categorized as follows al1 al2 species monomeric and dimeric al complexes al3 al5 species small polymeric al species al6 al10 species median polymeric al species and al11 al20 species large polymeric al species zhao et al 2009 the abundance of polymeric al species was estimated semi quantitatively by signal intensities relative to al species the results are shown in fig 5 the median and large polymeric al species were significantly lower after coagulation than before which suggests that adsorption bridging and net sweeping played a major mechanistic role in mnbs coagulation furthermore the gradual increase in the percentage of al11 al20 from 17 to 23 after coagulation with increasing qg indirectly indicates that the involvement of mnbs causes hydrolysis of pacl and increases the percentage of al11 al20 in the coagulant notably the increased proportion of al13 from 6 to 22 after coagulation also further demonstrated the ability of mnbs to increase the proportion of al13 in coagulants by forcing pacl hydrolysis al13 is considered a highly efficient polymeric aluminum species for coagulation not only because of its strong charge neutralization capacity but also its nucleation ability to form flocs with dom to produce colloids and to precipitate efficiently in low turbidity water lin et al 2008 yan et al 2008 as a result the efficiency of doc removal improved 3 3 complexation between pacl and ha in the mnbs coagulation process complexation plays an important role in the removal of dom and impurity ions from water by coagulation it has been pointed out that positively charged coagulant monomers or hydrolysis products can interact with negatively charged organic functional groups boguta et al 2016 the presence of many unsaturated sites in the quinone and phenol functional groups on the surface of organic matter makes it easy for metal ions to approach the surface and complex with the organic matter at the active sites to explore the effect of different values of qg on the strength of complexation between ha and al salts the complexation of ha with pacl after mnbs coagulation was calculated and analyzed using differential lna dlna eq 1 and dslope325 375 eq 2 minghao and fangang et al 2016 1 d l n a i λ l n a i λ l n a r e f λ 2 d s l o p e 325 375 s l o p e 325 375 i s l o p e 325 375 r e f where lnai λ and lnaref λ are the log transformed absorbance values at certain wavelengths measured with and without aluminum respectively slpoe325 375 i is the slope of a straight line from 325 to 375 nm in the log transformed absorbance and slope325 375 ref represents the parameter in the absence of aluminum minghao and fangang 2016 figs s11 and 6 show the changes of absorbance and the differential log transformed absorbance for different values of qg and ph respectively the calculated values of dslope325 375 under different working conditions are shown in fig 7 the calculations show that the involvement of mnbs increased the complexation strength between ha and al salts this result was attributed to the high hydrophilicity of the surface oh of mnbs which were able to transport dom towards cations e g al ions in water fan et al 2019 haris et al 2020 soyluoglu et al 2021 thus increasing the strength of complexation between ha and al salts 3 4 xps analysis of flocs during mnbs coagulation to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in the mnbs coagulation process the flocs produced by coagulation with and without the involvement of mnbs were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy of the total spectrum c 1s o 1s and al 2p as shown in figs 8 and s12 during the coagulation process whether mnbs was involved or not the c 1s spectra of flocs did not change significantly and three c 1s peaks appear at 288 8 286 6 and 284 9 ev these peaks can be assigned to carboxylic carbon coo ether or alcohol carbon c o and aliphatic carbon c c c h monteil rivera et al 2000 and are consistent with the c 1s spectrum of ha the flocculent o 1s spectrum without the involvement of mnbs showed two fitted peaks at 532 86 ev adsorbed oxygen oγ and 531 51 ev surface hydroxyl group oβ ding et al 2016 in the mnbs coagulation process it is observed that the participation of mnbs reduced the ratio of surface hydroxyl groups oβ this phenomenon could be attributed to the depletion of oβ during the production of oh by the mnbs additionally in flocculent samples without the involvement of mnbs two overlapping bands associated with two different al 2p transitions with binding energies of 73 28 ev and 74 12 ev which represent alⅳ al ⅲ tet and alⅵ al ⅲ oct respectively were observed duong et al 2005 lin et al 2014 some studies have shown that the al in al oh 3 is mainly octahedral duong et al 2005 while the tetrahedral al is mainly derived from al13 or al13 aggregates lin et al 2009 however when mnbs was involved in the coagulation process the xps results showed that the proportion of tetrahedral al increased by 33 7 from 19 0 to 52 7 the results further indicated that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process could force pacl to further hydrolyze and increase the proportion of al13 which was consistent with the esi ms spectroscopy 3 5 effect of water matrix on mnbs coagulation system 3 5 1 effect of coexisting ions to evaluate the effect of coexisting ions on the removal of ha by the mnbs coagulation process solutions containing 20 mg l ha and four different concentrations 0 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 mm of coexisting ions were treated with the mnbs coagulation process as shown in fig 9 the effects of various coexisting ions cl so4 2 no3 co3 2 ca2 and mg2 used on the removal of ha by the mnbs coagulation process were negligible the results show that the mnbs coagulation process has good anti interference ability and has certain feasibility of engineering application 3 5 2 application in natural surface water treatment to further verify the feasibility of the mnbs coagulation process in practical engineering applications mnbs was applied to natural surface water treatment with uv254 and eem as evaluation indexes in order not to change the concentration of pollutants in raw water tap water in the bubble tank was replaced with an equal volume of raw water as shown in fig s13 and the remaining operating parameters were unchanged in previous studies the eems combined with parallel factor analysis parafac eems has been reported for rapid investigation to identify the removal of unknown fluorescent organic matter ishii and boyer 2012 in this study different fluorescent fractions of nom in natural surface waters were identified by parafac eem and the differences in the treatment of fluorescent compounds with or without mnbs in the coagulation process were further characterized as presented in figs s14 and s15 two fluorescent components i e c1 and c2 were obtained in the natural surface water specifically the component of c1 was described as marine or terrestrial humic substances with the ex em of 248 416 nm baghoth et al 2011 c2 showed an em maximum at 335 nm with double ex peaks at 230 nm and 280 nm which was characterized as protein like components in previous studies dainard et al 2015 li et al 2020a the maximum fluorescence intensity of each component and uv254 are shown in fig 10 for hydrophobic component c1 when mnbs were involved in the coagulation process of nwⅰ and nwⅱ water samples the maximum fluorescence intensity of c1 corresponding to different water samples was reduced by 14 8 and 29 6 respectively compared with the conventional coagulation process this result was corresponding to uv254 for hydrophilic component c2 which is difficult to be removed by coagulation the mnbs coagulation process has a better removal effect the maximum fluorescence intensity corresponding to c2 in two kinds of water samples could be reduced by 55 9 and 28 2 respectively this result verified that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process could improve the removal of hydrophilic organic matter by generating oh forcing pacl hydrolysis and improving the complexation strength of pacl and nom 3 5 3 engineering implications considering the results of continuous treatment of ha fig 3 sequential batch treatment of natural surface water fig 10 and anti interference ability coexisting ions fig 9 by mnbs coagulation process mnbs coagulation process has good engineering feasibility in enhancing the efficiency of drinking water treatment to fully evaluate the engineering application prospects the economic sustainability of the mnbs coagulation process was evaluated in terms of operational costs and chemicals based on previous research information li et al 2023 micari et al 2020 and compared with existing enhanced coagulation processes as shown in table s7 compared with the other three common enhanced coagulation processes the mnbs coagulation process has extremely high economic benefits and good engineering application prospects 3 6 proposed mechanism of mnbs coagulation based on a comparison between the mnbs coagulation and the coagulation process the involvement of mnbs improves the efficiency of pollutant removal and enhances the effectiveness of drinking water treatment the above phenomenon is attributed to the synergy of three main points shown in fig 11 i the presence of h and al3 in the solution accelerates the collapse of mnbs promotes the formation of oh and therefore enables the oxidation of more pollutants ii the oh i e alkaline micro interfaces on the surfaces of mnbs could force pacl hydrolysis which increases the proportion of alc which in turn improves the efficiency of doc removal iii mnbs can collect and transport ha towards al ions thereby increasing the strength of complexation between pacl and ha and improving coagulation efficiency 4 conclusions this study proposed a novel cleaning process i e the mnbs coagulation process to enhance the effectiveness of drinking water treatment the specific enhanced treatment efficiency and enhanced mechanism of action are as follows 1 the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process mnbs coagulation can enhance the removal of nom from water and reduce doc levels in water by up to 27 9 in continuous flow experiments the mnbs coagulation process increased the ha uv254 removal efficiency by about 26 5 compared with the coagulation process without mnbs this process has stable operation strong anti interference ability and good performance in the treatment of natural surface water which has good economic sustainability and good engineering application prospects 2 the al ferron complexation timed spectrophotometry results and esi ms results show that both alc and al13 percentages increase in mnbs coagulation this is attributed to the formation of alkaline micro interfaces by adsorbed hydroxyl groups on the surface of mnbs that cause pacl hydrolysis the increased percentage of alc and al13 contributes to the enhanced removal of doc 3 the results of the complexation experiments show that the involvement of mnbs in the coagulation process can improve the complexation strength of ha with pacl this is attributed to the fact that mnbs can adsorb ha on their surfaces and transport ha towards al ions in water the increase in complexation strength can also improve doc removal 4 the xps results show that the presence of mnbs can increase the proportion of tetrahedral al in flocs from another perspective this finding validates the conclusion that the participation of mnbs in the coagulation process can force the hydrolysis of

15383,hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge into biocrude effect of aqueous phase recycling on energy recovery and pollution mitigation hongmin song tianhua yang bingshuo li yao tong rundong li key laboratory of clean energy of liaoning college of energy and environment shenyang aerospace university shenyang 110136 china key laboratory of clean energy of liaoning college of energy and environment shenyang aerospace university shenyang 110136 china key laboratory of clean energy of liaoning college of energy and environment shenyang aerospace university shenyang 110136 china corresponding author hydrothermal liquefaction htl of sewage sludge is facing the challenges of low biocrude yield a large number of intractable aqueous phase and heavy metals pollution in this study the aqueous phase produced by htl was recycled as solvent with an aim to improve the biocrude yield and mitigate potential pollution results showed that the recycling of aqueous phase increased the biocrude yield from 17 9 to 30 5 and the energy recovery ratio from 40 3 to 61 7 the recycling could increase the contents of zn cu pb and cr in solid residues by 2 7 3 0 times it is worth emphasizing that the recycling reduced the cod of aqueous phase by 24 9 however the enhanced protein hydrolysis process reduced the calorific value of biocrude from 36 4 to 28 5 mj kg and promoted the migration of the nitrogen to the aqueous phase which was not environmentally favourable for the direct usage in diesel engines analysis showed that the ketones and the phenols in aqueous phase participated in htl process as reactants and the acids promoted the hydrolysis of protein in the sludge overall the recycling of aqueous phase effectively improved the energy recovery and alleviated pollution of the sludge htl graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sewage sludge htl biocrude aqueous phase cod heavy metals data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction international energy agency predicted that the global demands for bioenergy will more than triple by 2060 therefore it is critical to extract energy from biomass more efficiently and realize sustainable utilization raheem et al 2018 with the expansion of municipal sewage treatment scale the annual output of sewage sludge ss in china exceeds 70 million tons ss contains a large number of organic pollutants bacteria ash etc which needs to be disposed as hazardous waste for reducing the harm to environment such a huge output poses a challenge to the disposal of ss high moisture content is one of the characteristics of ss which makes htl emerge among multitudinous treatment methods yang and wang 2021 as a technology that can directly treat biomass with high moisture content htl can not only recover the energy in ss but also realize disinfection and sterilization in previous studies the htl reaction conditions of ss have been optimized by scholars it is well known that temperature and residence time are the main variable parameters the improvement of biocrude yield and the control of pollutants could be realized by suitable temperature and residence time at the same time li et al 2020 xu et al 2018 obtained the maximum biocrude yield 22 89 at 340 c and found that with the increase of temperature 260 350 c a large number of heavy metals hms changed from weak acid extracted and reducible components to oxidizable and residue components silva thomsen et al 2020 discussed the energy recovery and micro pollutants drug residues antibiotics etc removal ratio in ss at 300 350 c they found that the energy recovery ratio was the highest at 325 c and the drug removal ratio exceeded 98 chang et al 2021a proposed that the biocrude yield was improved with the increase of temperature 200 360 c and reached the maximum at 300 c they also found that the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was enhanced with the extension of residence time 0 60 min the maximum biocrude output was obtained when lai et al 2018 held for 30 min in the htl process of ss whereas a longer residence time would promote the conversion of organic matters to the solid residue suitable base conditions can be obtained by referring to literature which will be introduced in the later section the high moisture content of ss makes htl a better choice but it means that a large scale waste water will be produced therefore it is not only the yield of biocrude or cost limits the application of ss htl but also the aqueous phase ap that contains a large amount of nitrogen and organic compounds edmundson et al 2017 and garcia alba et al 2013 proposed that adding trace elements to ap and diluting it properly to foster algae such methods could realize the material recycling of ap with reducing the environmental burden however due to the long foster cycle this will pose new challenges to the foster container and the area covered although anaerobic digestion ad has been proven to be a low cost and effective way of energy recovery it is also facing the same problem zhu et al 2019 increasing temperature to convert ap and biomass into h2 and ch4 for recovery is also a way that worthy of promotion the gasification process benefits from the rich organic matters in ap but such approaches will put forward higher requirements for the reaction equipment and consume more energy studies have shown that ap contains a large number of oxygen containing compounds furfuryl alcohol phenol etc and nitrogen containing compounds furan fatty acid amide etc which could be converted into biocrude at a higher temperature godwin et al 2017 therefore the recycling of ap is of great significance in large scale industrial htl applications li et al 2021 found that the high calorific value and the h ceff of biocrude was attributed to the promoted deoxygenation by h enriched in ap which proved the potential of ap in biocrude upgrading some researchers have proposed that the poly hydroxybutyrate in ap could be used as the diluent of raw materials so as to improve the yield of biocrude pedersen et al 2016 used aspen wood as the htl raw material and found that the ap recycling was helpful to obtain 34 3 mj kg high calorific value biocrude by increasing the h c ratio although the reaction pathways were not further clarified they successfully demonstrated the promotion effect of ap recycling on the biocrude quality from biomasses with high carbon content and high ash content chen et al 2014 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019a recycled the ap produced by spirulina htl to the system and found that the yield of biocrude was increased from 30 to 40 after the first cycle the possible reason was that the unsaturated organic components in ap promoted the decomposition of spirulina however the effect of the ap on biocrude was gradually weakened as the organic components reached saturation in the subsequent recycling processes consistent with the above zhu et al 2015 used straw as the raw material in htl the yield of biocrude was raised from 34 9 to 38 4 although the positive effect was weak it still pointed to that some organic components in ap promoted the formation of liquefaction products with the deepening of research alireza et al 2020 further concluded that the acidic compounds in ap promoted the dehydration reaction of organic matters in algae and observed that the nitrogen content in the biocrude was increased by 5 4 which was not conducive to the next utilization in addition biller et al 2016 have reported that the ap recycling could significantly improve the biocrude yield from dried distiller grains and focused on the effect of the catalyst k2co3 on htl but the specific promotion mechanism of the numbers of recycling experiments has not been clarified according to the literature consulted there was no ap recycling researches related to ss htl process in this paper ss was used as the raw material and the htl reactions under the same working conditions were carried out in distilled water and ap respectively the ap recycling was performed to investigate the htl reaction pathways and whether the yield and the energy recovery ratio of biocrude was successfully improved by the ap recycling whether the recycling could effectively reduce the cod of ap was also discussed what s more the positive effect of the ap recycling on hms migration was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the dehydrated ss was taken from the shenyang zhenxing sewage treatment plant liaoning province china the samples were taken back and frozen in the refrigerator the experimental reagents were analytical grade the proximate ultimate analyses and calorific value of ss are listed in table 1 2 2 htl processes and products separation the whole htl processes of ss were carried out in a batch 500 ml stainless steel autoclave ss 50 g and distilled water 115 g were weighed and poured into the reactor after mixing the moisture content of ss was 70 and the solid liquid ratio was 1 10 the reactor was purged with n2 for 5 min to replace all air the internal temperature of autoclave was set to 330 c the upper pressure was limited to 25 mpa the rotating speed of the agitator was 100 rpm and the holding time was 30 min the above experiment was defined as the benchmark experiment named cycle 0 and the subsequent recycling experiments were carried out on this basis since ss was a high ash biomass and considering the effect of different separation solvents on the biocrude yield acetone was used as the extraction solvent to optimize the biocrude extraction lu et al 2017 watson et al 2019 after the reactor was cooled down to the room temperature the gas in reactor was vented to a fume hood without analysis the products in reactor were poured into beaker 1 followed by washing the reactor wall with acetone twice then the washing fluid was transferred to beaker 2 the mixture in beaker 1 was separated by vacuum filtration the obtained liquid was aqueous phase which would be integrated with gas to calculate the yield then the filter cake was mixed with the washing fluid in beaker 2 which was also separated by vacuum filtration the solid residues recovered on the filter paper were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h after that the filtrate was evaporated at 58 c under reduced pressure to remove acetone resulting in biocrude furthermore five sequential recycling experiments were conducted in the ap instead of the fresh water to explore the feasibility of the ap recycling for a higher biocrude yield in each of the five succeeding runs 80 ml ap formed in the run before was recycled and 35 ml of additional distilled water was supplemented other reaction conditions and separation methods were completely consistent with cycle 0 all htl experiments either in pure water or in recycled ap were performed in triplicate and averaged to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility refer to fig 1 for the specific operation methods 2 3 data analysis the yield of each product was calculated based on ash free ss 1 y o mo m ss 100 m ss a ss 100 2 y s m s 100 m ss a s

was the recovery ratio of ap mw was the quality of recovered ap moisture a was the moisture content of raw ss in order to explore the positive impact of the ap recycling on the energy recovery of htl

hhvo and hhvss represented the calorific value of biocrude and raw ss respectively c h o n were the mass percentages of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen ero was the energy recovery ratio of biocrude in addition the average of three parallel experiments was taken as the final data of the figures and the standard deviation of the data was calculated to draw error bars 2 4 analytical method the main elemental compositions of biocrude and solid residues were determined by element analyzer a3000 chns o italy the proportion of oxygen was calculated by subtraction the organic compositions of biocrude and ap were qualitatively analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent gc ms8890 7000d equipped with a chromatographic column hp 5 ms the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the split ratio was 10 1 the temperature was held at 40 c for 5 min and was then risen to 280 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and held for 10 min the injection volume was 1 µl and the temperature was 250 c the functional group compositions of biocrude were determined by fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir nicolet is50 thermo fisher nicolet usa the acquisition spectrum range was 4000 cm 1 400 cm 1 cod was determined by water quality determination of the chemical oxygen demand dichromate method hj 828 2017 on the instrument ash 6b 80 the ph of aqueous phase was measured by semisolid ph meter smart sensor ph 818m the content of heavy metals was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry on the instrument perkin elmer optima 8300 3 results and discussion 3 1 products distribution fig 2 shows the effect of ap cycles 0 to 5 on the products distribution with the increase of cycle numbers the yield of biocrude was increased from 17 9 to 30 5 and the maximum was reached in cycles 2 and 4 respectively the biocrude yield was decreased in cycle 5 but it was still higher than cycle 0 this proved that the ap recycling brought periodic changes or different promotion mechanisms which will be further discussed in section 3 2 because the ap contained a large number of nitrogen and oxygen elements the recycling process promoted the organic compounds in ap to further polymerized into higher molecular weight substances which was consistent with the conclusion of godwin et al 2017 unexpectedly the yield of solid residues was increased from 21 5 to 25 6 with the progress of the experiments and showed a regular improvement xu et al 2020 found that the ap recycling would significantly promote the enrichment of carbon and nitrogen to the solid phase which further proved that the ap would lead to the cyclization of small molecular organics into those substances with larger molecular weight another possible reason was that the organic components in ap promoted the hydrolysis of biomass chen et al 2019b which will be introduced in the subsequent analyses after cycle 2 the profits brought by the recycling of ap was gradually decreased but it still made a considerable benefit in the yield of biocrude 3 2 characteristics of aqueous phase 3 2 1 gc ms analysis main chemical compositions of ap obtained from each group is shown in fig 3 a the peak area of each compound was calculated as a percentage of the total peak area expressed as the relative content of the compound the ap was mainly composed of heterocyclic organic compounds containing nitrogen and oxygen pyridine pyridine amine pyrrolidone etc ketones 2 cyclopenten 1 one 2 methyl etc phosphonic acids and phenols were the second a little alcohols and hydrocarbon compounds were also observed in ap such as 3 quinuclidinol 1 3 2 dioxaborinane 2 ethyl 5 5 dimethyl etc as the number of cycles was increased the ketones in ap were decreased significantly while the nitrogen containing compounds were increased this may be due to the addition reaction between r nh2 and co which caused them to form cnr after removing h2o therefore more nitrogen heterocyclic substances such as pyridine and pyrrole appeared in the ap incomplete addition reaction would produce polycyclic nitrogen containing compounds containing co such as pyrrole 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 2 methylpropyl ketones could participate in htl as a hydrogen supply solvent which was combined with the intermediate products and converted to liquefied products the removed hydrogen radicals could be combined with the free radical fragments of protein it would reduce the possibility of coupling free radical fragments to produce condensation products therefore the ketones may react with hydrogen to form alkanes aromatic hydrocarbons may be formed by intramolecular chain breaking and aromatization process chang et al 2021a another reason for the increase of nitrogen containing organic matters content may be that the ap promoted the decomposition of proteins in ss and a large number of amines were released maillard reaction was triggered between reducing sugar and amines the nitrogen heterocycles such as 2 pyrrolidinone 2 5 piperazine dione 3 6 bis 2 methylpropyl were formed xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b this phenomenon mainly appeared in cycles 3 and 4 as shown in fig 3 b and c there was an ideal inverse relationship between the content of ketones and the biocrude yield when the content of ketones no longer changed the yield of biocrude was still remained at a high level it was because the content of phosphonic acid in ap was significantly increased in cycles 3 and 4 which promoted the hydrolysis of protein the substitution reaction occurred between the phosphoric acid or phosphate in solid phase and the nitrogen heterocycles or amides in ap which led to the transfer of nitrogen to the solid phase this was also the reason for the temporary decline of the nitrogen content in ap similarly xu et al 2020 found that using hydro char to recover the nitrogen in ap was an effective way and the best recycle numbers was three nevertheless the overall increase of the nitrogen containing substances content in ap was still obvious the content of phenols in ap was gradually decreased with the cycle numbers which may be caused by the free radical substitution reaction the yield of biocrude was further improved by the conversion of phenols to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons dimethyl benzene ethyl benzene etc 3 2 2 cod and ph analyses in order to further explored the impact of ap recycling on htl processes the cod and the recovery ratio of ap were measured according to fig 4 a with the increase of cycle numbers the recovery ratio of ap was decreased from 73 4 to 68 7 the cod was decreased from 7265 to 5458 mg l the minimum value of cod 5457 mg l was obtained after cycle 3 which was slightly increased by cycle 4 however the cod was still significantly lower than cycle 0 this might be because the degree of ap participating in htl during cycles 0 to 3 was higher than the promotion of ss hydrolysis as a result more organic matters migrated from the ap to the biocrude residue and gas yang et al 2018 when the reaction proceeded to cycle 4 the organic matters in ap reached the limit after participating reaction and the content of ketones remained stable after cycle 3 the discovery was consistent with the result of gc ms analysis at the same time the promoting effect of ap on ss hydrolysis was gradually obvious a huge number of protein hydrolysates were released which led to a direct improvement of the cod and the recovery ratio the conclusion was the same as xu et al 2019b that the acids in ap could promote the hydrolysis of algal and the release of organic matters the biocrude yield and the ph of ap are shown in fig 4 b the value was mainly between 8 3 and 9 which was consistent with the previous study by wilk et al 2019 the ph of cycles 1 and 2 were relatively stable however the yield of biocrude was increased significantly and reached 29 3 in cycle 2 which mainly depended on the participation of ketones phenols and other organic substances in the ap the ph of cycles 3 to 5 was increased significantly which may be due to the phosphonic acid in ap promoted the hydrolysis of ss more proteins participated in the decomposition process a large amount of nh3 n was produced by the denitrification of soluble proteins chen et al 2019c the release of more alkaline products led to the rise of ph value which enhanced the dissociation of acidic groups of extracellular polymers eps in ss and the swelling of ss granular organic matters therefore the maximum yield of biocrude was obtained in cycle 4 3 3 characteristics of biocrude 3 3 1 elemental analysis table 2 shows the elemental analysis hhv and the energy recovery of biocrude ero the effect of ap recycling on the h c of biocrude was not obvious which indicated that the main components of biocrude were the same due to the reaction between the ketones and the nitrogen heterocycles in ap the oxygen proportion was increased from 12 4 to 36 4 in biocrude this situation was particularly serious in cycles 4 and 5 which was because the presence of ap promoted the decomposition of ss and released more oxygen containing organic compounds such as amino acids interestingly the nitrogen content in biocrude was not increased as described in literatures hu et al 2017 taghipour et al 2021a which may be because the free radicals formed by some components inhibited the transformation of the nitrogen element to the biocrude although the specific mechanism was vague it was still an exciting discovery after the first cycle both the yield and the calorific value of biocrude were improved however as the oxygen element migrated from the ap to the biocrude the calorific value was gradually decreased from 36 4 mj kg to 29 5 mj kg the minimum value was exactly obtained in cycle 5 which was an expected result energy recovery ratio ero was an important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of converting ss into biocrude by htl tong et al 2021 although the hhv of biocrude was decreased the ero was significantly improved by 21 9 the change of biocrude yield played a decisive role according to the quality and the ero of biocrude recycling for three times should be recommended the hhv and the ero of biocrude in cycles 4 and 5 were decreased obviously therefore if the number of cycles continued to be increased it would lead to lower benefits and lose the value 3 3 2 ftir analysis fig 5 shows the infrared spectra of biocrude the functional group characteristics of biocrude were similar the fluctuation from 3500 to 3100 cm 1 was related to the tensile vibration of oh after cycle 1 the ch stretching vibration of methyl or methylene between 3000 cm 1 and 2820 cm 1 was increased which indicated that the biocrude contained hydrocarbons under the conditions of cycles 4 and 5 the vibration of co around 1720 cm 1 was significantly enhanced which indicated that the ap recycling promoted the transfer of oxygen to the biocrude in the form of aldehydes ketones lipids or carboxylic acids the vibration around 1632 cm 1 was attributed to aromatic cc skeleton structure in biocrude the ch stretching vibration between 1473 cm 1 and 1360 cm 1 was slightly strengthened which meant an increase of the aliphatic hydrocarbon content with the increase of ap cycle numbers the co stretching vibration of carboxylic acids esters or ether substances between 1320 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 was gradually enhanced however the nh bending vibration of amines between 872 cm 1 and 593 cm 1 was nearly unchanged which indicated the nitrogen content in the biocrude was not significantly increased 3 3 3 tga analysis the thermogravimetric curves of biocrude obtained after different numbers of recycling are shown in fig 6 the thermal decomposition was observed to be divided into two distinct stages the moisture removal and the main devolatilization the mass loss above 100 c was came from the evaporative removal of the water in biocrude which was the first stage the temperature between 150 c and 450 c was the second stage of the main devolatilization of biocrude lim and andrésen 2011 it could be seen that the volatilization rate and degree of the biocrude in cycle 0 were significantly lower than others which implied the longer residence time or less energy in the tga garba et al 2018 as the temperature was further increased the coke residues of the unrecycled biocrude samples were much higher than those of the other samples which was not good for engines or other applications in general the recycling of ap significantly increased the content of volatile components in the biocrude thereby enhanced the availability of biocrude and reduced the residue yield in the thermal decomposition process 3 3 4 gc ms analysis the organic components in biocrude were characterized by gc ms it should be noted that the light components may be lost in the separation process only a part of components could be characterized by gc ms in order to clarify the influence of unexpected organic components on the biocrude in raw materials the raw ss was vacuum filtered to remove water then the soluble substances were extracted with acetone according to fig 7 the components of biocrude mainly included aromatic hydrocarbons benzene 1 3 dimethyl and ethylbenzene etc aliphatic hydrocarbons hexane and pentane etc ketones 2 pentanone 4 hydroxy 4 methyl etc esters dibutyl phthalate etc nitrogenous heterocycle oxygenated heterocycle furan 2 methoxy etc phenols acids acetic acid etc the components of biocrude obtained by each group were similar after cycle 1 monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were the main component of biocrude the direct reason was a large number of aromatic derivatives in raw material the ap promoted the breaking of the long chain branch of dibutyl phthalate in the raw ss benzene rings fatty acids or ketones were then formed at the same time due to the hydrolysis of protein was strengthened by the ap recycling more amino acids and polysaccharide were released the condensation and the cyclization of intermediates after polysaccharide degradation was another possible reason for the increase of aromatic hydrocarbons in biocrude kumar et al 2018 this was similar to the conclusion of chang et al 2021b that if the temperature was further higher than 300 c the content of aromatics would be greatly increased due to the ketones in ap acted as the hydrogen supply solvent the alkanes content was slightly increased in the biocrude meanwhile olefins could be deoxidized by the fatty acids and the ketones the contents of nitrogen and oxygen were decreased in the biocrudes obtained from cycles 1 and 2 but the content was increased after cycle 3 this indicated that more components were first transferred to the biocrude by the recycling then the new protein hydrolysis process was strengthened in addition alanine n methyl n propargyloxycarbonyl heptyl ester was found in the biocrude obtained from cycle 3 which further confirmed the existence of enhanced hydrolysis reaction in the system although there was no significantly evidence that ap promoted the migration of nitrogen to the biocrude the nitrogen content of biocrude was still slightly increased after cycle 3 this was because the enhanced hydrolysis of protein caused maillard reaction taghipour et al 2021b due to the monosaccharide produced by carbohydrate hydrolysis first generated furan and then aromatic hydrocarbons lópez barreiro et al 2015 the biocrude obtained by cycle 3 had lower aromatic and higher furan contents which was different from cycle 4 after cycle 5 the oxygen content and the o c of biocrude was significantly increased which meant the oxygen containing substances in ap may enter the biocrude in the form of carboxylic acids esters ketones etc hu et al 2017 klemmer et al 2016 therefore if the number of cycles continued to be increased the ap recycling would lose advantage based on the above analyses the reaction pathways shown in fig 8 could be obtained the promoting effect of ap on the biocrude yield in cycles 1 and 2 were the ketones in ap participated in the htl on the one hand the ketones acted as hydrogen donor solvents and reacted with other free radicals to produce alkanes in this process on the other hand the co combined with the rnh2 to produce the cnr what s more the ketones in ap could be cyclized and enter the biocrude in the form of benzene ring in cycles 3 to 5 due to the exchange of the nitrogen and the phosphorus between solid residue and ap the phosphonic acid content was increased significantly in the ap therefore the phosphonic acid promoted ss hydrolysis then more alkaline substances were released resulting in the increase of ph in ap the cells in ss were more likely to swell under alkaline conditions which contributed to the improvement of the biocrude yield 3 4 distribution of heavy metals as shown in fig 9 the content of hms in three kinds of products aqueous phase biocrude and solid residues were investigated the conclusion was similar to the previous researches huang et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 xu and jiang 2017 which meant that the hms were mainly concentrated in the solid residue as expected the hms content in ap was the lowest the ap recycling promoted the enrichment of most hms to the solid phase the slight increase of hms concentration in ap was due to the enrichment effect of the reduced yield which was consistent with lasheen and ammar 2009 the contents of zn and cu were the highest in all products because they had the affinity to enter organic phase zn and cu existed in the form of organic sulfide in cells huang et al 2018 because of the enhanced hydrolysis process more zn and cu were released to form oxidizable components and the contents in solid residues were improved by 2 7 and 2 8 times respectively after cycle 1 the content of pb was significantly decreased in the biocrude which was increased by 3 times in the solid residue at most that was because pb was preferentially combined in the residual state which was almost undetectable in the active form the same was true for cr more than 95 of cr existed in the solid residues as the oxidizable components and the residual components miaomiao et al 2009 therefore due to the decomposition and transformation of organic matters were promoted by the ap recycling pb and cr were released from the organic matter binding sites to form the residual state among all kinds of hms cd content was the lowest in the system the existing form of cd was dominated by reducing components and the recycling of ap seemed to have no obvious effect on the distribution of cd overall the ap recycling could effectively promote the enrichment of hms to the solid phase which was an ideal situation the migration of hms was vital in the process of ss htl the high hms content will cause more pollution after fuel combustion so the specific morphological distribution and transformation need to be further explored 4 conclusions the current study recycled the aqueous phase as solvent into the htl system and thoroughly investigated the changes in aqueous phase cod properties biocrude yeild chemical structure energy recovery ratio and heavy metals distribution the extraction of the light organic matters in aqueous phase directly reduced the cod by 24 9 and improved the energy recovery by 21 4 the enrichment degree of the most heavy metals in solid residues was even 3 times higher than that before the aqueous phase recycling however applying the aqueous phase transferred a part of undesired oxygen to the biocrude which decreased the calorific value by 7 9 it was found that the best result was achieved by recycled the aqueous phase for three times the application of aqueous phase into the htl was an interesting scheme to improve the biocrude yield with reducing pollution which showed double advantages however there are still some challenges for the application of aqueous phase recycling and performing a full techno economic comparative analysis at a large scale would be

15383,hydrothermal liquefaction of sewage sludge into biocrude effect of aqueous phase recycling on energy recovery and pollution mitigation hongmin song tianhua yang bingshuo li yao tong rundong li

corresponding author hydrothermal liquefaction htl of sewage sludge is facing the challenges of low biocrude yield a large number of intractable aqueous phase and heavy metals pollution in this study the aqueous phase produced by htl was recycled as solvent with an aim to improve the biocrude yield and mitigate potential pollution results showed that the recycling of aqueous phase increased the biocrude yield from 17 9 to 30 5 and the energy recovery ratio from 40 3 to 61 7 the recycling could increase the contents of zn cu pb and cr in solid residues by 2 7 3 0 times it is worth emphasizing that the recycling reduced the cod of aqueous phase by 24 9 however the enhanced protein hydrolysis process reduced the calorific value of biocrude from 36 4 to 28 5 mj kg and promoted the migration of the nitrogen to the aqueous phase which was not environmentally favourable for the direct usage in diesel engines analysis showed that the ketones and the phenols in aqueous phase participated in htl process as reactants and the acids promoted the hydrolysis of protein in the sludge overall the recycling of aqueous phase effectively improved the energy recovery and alleviated pollution of the

moisture content is one of the characteristics of ss which makes htl emerge among multitudinous treatment methods yang and wang 2021 as a technology that can directly treat biomass with high moisture content htl can not only recover the energy in ss but also realize disinfection and sterilization in previous studies the htl reaction conditions of ss have been optimized by scholars it is well known that temperature and residence time are the main variable parameters the improvement of biocrude yield and the control of pollutants could be realized by suitable temperature and residence time at the same time li et al 2020 xu et al 2018 obtained the maximum biocrude yield 22 89 at 340 c and found that with the increase of temperature 260 350 c a large number of heavy metals hms changed from weak acid extracted and reducible components to oxidizable and residue components silva thomsen et al 2020 discussed the energy recovery and micro pollutants drug residues antibiotics etc removal ratio in ss at 300 350 c they found that the energy recovery ratio was the highest at 325 c and the drug removal ratio exceeded 98 chang et al 2021a proposed that the biocrude yield was improved with the increase of temperature 200 360 c and reached the maximum at 300 c they also found that the synthesis of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was enhanced with the extension of residence time 0 60 min the maximum biocrude output was obtained when lai et al 2018 held for 30 min in the htl process of ss whereas a longer residence time would promote the conversion of organic matters to the solid residue suitable base conditions can be obtained by referring to literature which will be introduced in the later section the high moisture content of ss makes htl a better choice but it means that a large scale waste water will be produced therefore it is not only the yield of biocrude or cost limits the application of ss htl but also the aqueous phase ap that contains a large amount of nitrogen and organic compounds edmundson et al 2017 and garcia alba et al 2013 proposed that adding trace elements to ap and diluting it properly to foster algae such methods could realize the material recycling of ap with reducing the environmental burden however due to the long foster cycle this will pose new challenges to the foster container and the area covered although anaerobic digestion ad has been proven to be a low cost and effective way of energy recovery it is also facing the same problem zhu et al 2019 increasing temperature to convert ap and biomass into h2 and ch4 for recovery is also a way that worthy of promotion the gasification process benefits from the rich organic matters in ap but such approaches will put forward higher requirements for the reaction equipment and consume more energy studies have shown that ap contains a large number of oxygen containing compounds furfuryl alcohol phenol etc and nitrogen containing compounds furan fatty acid amide etc which could be converted into biocrude at a higher temperature godwin et al 2017 therefore the recycling of ap is of great significance in large scale industrial htl applications li et al 2021 found that the high calorific value and the h ceff of biocrude was attributed to the promoted deoxygenation by h enriched in ap which proved the potential of ap in biocrude upgrading some researchers have proposed that the poly hydroxybutyrate in ap could be used as the diluent of raw materials so as to improve the yield of biocrude pedersen et al 2016 used aspen wood as the htl raw material and found that the ap recycling was helpful to obtain 34 3 mj kg high calorific value biocrude by increasing the h c ratio although the reaction pathways were not further clarified they successfully demonstrated the promotion effect of ap recycling on the biocrude quality from biomasses with high carbon content and high ash content chen et al 2014 chen et al 2017 zhu et al 2016 chen et al 2019a recycled the ap produced by spirulina htl to the system and found that the yield of biocrude was increased from 30 to 40 after the first cycle the possible reason was that the unsaturated organic components in ap promoted the decomposition of spirulina however the effect of the ap on biocrude was gradually weakened as the organic components reached saturation in the subsequent recycling processes consistent with the above zhu et al 2015 used straw as the raw material in htl the yield of biocrude was raised from 34 9 to 38 4 although the positive effect was weak it still pointed to that some organic components in ap promoted the formation of liquefaction products with the deepening of research alireza et al 2020 further concluded that the acidic compounds in ap promoted the dehydration reaction of organic matters in algae and observed that the nitrogen content in the biocrude was increased by 5 4 which was not conducive to the next utilization in addition biller et al 2016 have reported that the ap recycling could significantly improve the biocrude yield from dried distiller grains and focused on the effect of the catalyst k2co3 on htl but the specific promotion mechanism of the numbers of recycling experiments has not been clarified according to the literature consulted there was no ap recycling researches related to ss htl process in this paper ss was used as the raw material and the htl reactions under the same working conditions were carried out in distilled water and ap respectively the ap recycling was performed to investigate the htl reaction pathways and whether the yield and the energy recovery ratio of biocrude was successfully improved by the ap recycling whether the recycling could effectively reduce the cod of ap was also discussed what s more the positive effect of the ap recycling on hms migration was investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials the dehydrated ss was taken from the shenyang zhenxing sewage treatment plant liaoning province china the samples were taken back and frozen in the refrigerator the experimental reagents were analytical grade the proximate ultimate analyses and calorific value of ss are listed in table 1 2 2 htl processes and products separation the whole htl processes of ss were carried out in a batch 500 ml stainless steel autoclave ss 50 g and distilled water 115 g were weighed and poured into the reactor after mixing the moisture content of ss was 70 and the solid liquid ratio was 1 10 the reactor was purged with n2 for 5 min to replace all air the internal temperature of autoclave was set to 330 c the upper pressure was limited to 25 mpa the rotating speed of the agitator was 100 rpm and the holding time was 30 min the above experiment was defined as the benchmark experiment named cycle 0 and the subsequent recycling experiments were carried out on this basis since ss was a high ash biomass and considering the effect of different separation solvents on the biocrude yield acetone was used as the extraction solvent to optimize the biocrude extraction lu et al 2017 watson et al 2019 after the reactor was cooled down to the room temperature the gas in reactor was vented to a fume hood without analysis the products in reactor were poured into beaker 1 followed by washing the reactor wall with acetone twice then the washing fluid was transferred to beaker 2 the mixture in beaker 1 was separated by vacuum filtration the obtained liquid was aqueous phase which would be integrated with gas to calculate the yield then the filter cake was mixed with the washing fluid in beaker 2 which was also separated by vacuum filtration the solid residues recovered on the filter paper were dried in an oven at 105 c for 24 h after that the filtrate was evaporated at 58 c under reduced pressure to remove acetone resulting in biocrude furthermore five sequential recycling experiments were conducted in the ap instead of the fresh water to explore the feasibility of the ap recycling for a higher biocrude yield in each of the five succeeding runs 80 ml ap formed in the run before was recycled and 35 ml of additional distilled water was supplemented other reaction conditions and separation methods were completely consistent with cycle 0 all htl experiments either in pure water or in recycled ap were performed in triplicate and averaged to demonstrate acceptable reproducibility refer to fig 1 for the specific operation methods 2 3 data analysis the yield of each product was calculated based on ash free ss 1 y o mo m ss 100 m ss a ss 100 2 y s m s 100 m ss a s

was the recovery ratio of ap mw was the quality of recovered ap moisture a was the moisture content of raw ss in order to explore the positive impact of the ap recycling on the energy recovery of htl reactions the calculation formulas of calorific value and energy recovery ratio of biocrude were used parikh et al 2005 5 hhv mj kg 0 3419 c 1 1178 h 0 1005 o 0 1034 n 6 e r o hh v o y o hh v ss 100 hhvo and hhvss represented the calorific value of biocrude and raw ss respectively c h o n were the mass percentages of carbon hydrogen oxygen and nitrogen ero was the energy recovery ratio of biocrude in addition the average of three parallel experiments was taken as the final data of the figures and the standard deviation of the data was calculated to draw error bars 2 4 analytical method the main elemental compositions of biocrude and solid residues were determined by element analyzer a3000 chns o italy the proportion of oxygen was calculated by subtraction the organic compositions of biocrude and ap were qualitatively analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry agilent gc ms8890 7000d equipped with a chromatographic column hp 5 ms the carrier gas was helium with a flow rate of 1 0 ml min and the split ratio was 10 1 the temperature was held at 40 c for 5 min and was then risen to 280 c with a heating rate of 5 c min and held for 10 min the injection volume was 1 µl and the temperature was 250 c the functional group compositions of biocrude were determined by fourier transform infrared spectrometry ft ir nicolet is50 thermo fisher nicolet usa the acquisition spectrum range was 4000 cm 1 400 cm 1 cod was determined by water quality determination of the chemical oxygen demand dichromate method hj 828 2017 on the instrument ash 6b 80 the ph of aqueous phase was measured by semisolid ph meter smart sensor ph 818m the content of heavy metals was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry on the instrument perkin elmer optima 8300 3 results and discussion 3 1 products distribution fig 2 shows the effect of ap cycles 0 to 5 on the products distribution with the increase of cycle numbers the yield of biocrude was increased from 17 9 to 30 5 and the maximum was reached in cycles 2 and 4 respectively the biocrude yield was decreased in cycle 5 but it was still higher than cycle 0 this proved that the ap recycling brought periodic changes or different promotion mechanisms which will be further discussed in section 3 2 because the ap contained a large number of nitrogen and oxygen elements the recycling process promoted the organic compounds in ap to further polymerized into higher molecular weight substances which was consistent with the conclusion of godwin et al 2017 unexpectedly the yield of solid residues was increased from 21 5 to 25 6 with the progress of the experiments and showed a regular improvement xu et al 2020 found that the ap recycling would significantly promote the enrichment of carbon and nitrogen to the solid phase which further proved that the ap would lead to the cyclization of small molecular organics into those substances with larger molecular weight another possible reason was that the organic components in ap promoted the hydrolysis of biomass chen et al 2019b which will be introduced in the subsequent analyses after cycle 2 the profits brought by the recycling of ap was gradually decreased but it still made a considerable benefit in the yield of biocrude 3 2 characteristics of aqueous phase 3 2 1 gc ms analysis main chemical compositions of ap obtained from each group is shown in fig 3 a the peak area of each compound was calculated as a percentage of the total peak area expressed as the relative content of the compound the ap was mainly composed of heterocyclic organic compounds containing nitrogen and oxygen pyridine pyridine amine pyrrolidone etc ketones 2 cyclopenten 1 one 2 methyl etc phosphonic acids and phenols were the second a little alcohols and hydrocarbon compounds were also observed in ap such as 3 quinuclidinol 1 3 2 dioxaborinane 2 ethyl 5 5 dimethyl etc as the number of cycles was increased the ketones in ap were decreased significantly while the nitrogen containing compounds were increased this may be due to the addition reaction between r nh2 and co which caused them to form cnr after removing h2o therefore more nitrogen heterocyclic substances such as pyridine and pyrrole appeared in the ap incomplete addition reaction would produce polycyclic nitrogen containing compounds containing co such as pyrrole 1 2 a pyrazine 1 4 dione hexahydro 3 2 methylpropyl ketones could participate in htl as a hydrogen supply solvent which was combined with the intermediate products and converted to liquefied products the removed hydrogen radicals could be combined with the free radical fragments of protein it would reduce the possibility of coupling free radical fragments to produce condensation products therefore the ketones may react with hydrogen to form alkanes aromatic hydrocarbons may be formed by intramolecular chain breaking and aromatization process chang et al 2021a another reason for the increase of nitrogen containing organic matters content may be that the ap promoted the decomposition of proteins in ss and a large number of amines were released maillard reaction was triggered between reducing sugar and amines the nitrogen heterocycles such as 2 pyrrolidinone 2 5 piperazine dione 3 6 bis 2 methylpropyl were formed xu et al 2019a xu et al 2019b this phenomenon mainly appeared in cycles 3 and 4 as shown in fig 3 b and c there was an ideal inverse relationship between the content of ketones and the biocrude yield when the content of ketones no longer changed the yield of biocrude was still remained at a high level it was because the content of phosphonic acid in ap was significantly increased in cycles 3 and 4 which promoted the hydrolysis of protein the substitution reaction occurred between the phosphoric acid or phosphate in solid phase and the nitrogen heterocycles or amides in ap which led to the transfer of nitrogen to the solid phase this was also the reason for the temporary decline of the nitrogen content in ap similarly xu et al 2020 found that using hydro char to recover the nitrogen in ap was an effective way and the best recycle numbers was three nevertheless the overall increase of the nitrogen containing substances content in ap was still obvious the content of phenols in ap was gradually decreased with the cycle numbers which may be caused by the free radical substitution reaction the yield of biocrude was further improved by the conversion of phenols to monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons dimethyl benzene ethyl benzene etc 3 2 2 cod and ph analyses in order to further explored the impact of ap recycling on htl processes the cod and the recovery ratio of ap were measured according to fig 4 a with the increase of cycle numbers the recovery ratio of ap was decreased from 73 4 to 68 7 the cod was decreased from 7265 to 5458 mg l the minimum value of cod 5457 mg l was obtained after cycle 3 which was slightly increased by cycle 4 however the cod was still significantly lower than cycle 0 this might be because the degree of ap participating in htl during cycles 0 to 3 was higher than the promotion of ss hydrolysis as a result more organic matters migrated from the ap to the biocrude residue and gas yang et al 2018 when the reaction proceeded to cycle 4 the organic matters in ap reached the limit after participating reaction and the content of ketones remained stable after cycle 3 the discovery was consistent with the result of gc ms analysis at the same time the promoting effect of ap on ss hydrolysis was gradually obvious a huge number of protein hydrolysates were released which led to a direct improvement of the cod and the recovery ratio the conclusion was the same as xu et al 2019b that the acids in ap could promote the hydrolysis of algal and the release of organic matters the biocrude yield and the ph of ap are shown in fig 4 b the value was mainly between 8 3 and 9 which was consistent with the previous study by wilk et al 2019 the ph of cycles 1 and 2 were relatively stable however the yield of biocrude was increased significantly and reached 29 3 in cycle 2 which mainly depended on the participation of ketones phenols and other organic substances in the ap the ph of cycles 3 to 5 was increased significantly which may be due to the phosphonic acid in ap promoted the hydrolysis of ss more proteins participated in the decomposition process a large amount of nh3 n was produced by the denitrification of soluble proteins chen et al 2019c the release of more alkaline products led to the rise of ph value which enhanced the dissociation of acidic groups of extracellular polymers eps in ss and the swelling of ss granular organic matters therefore the maximum yield of biocrude was obtained in cycle 4 3 3 characteristics of biocrude 3 3 1 elemental analysis table 2 shows the elemental analysis hhv and the energy recovery of biocrude ero the effect of ap recycling on the h c of biocrude was not obvious which indicated that the main components of biocrude were the same due to the reaction between the ketones and the nitrogen heterocycles in ap the oxygen proportion was increased from 12 4 to 36 4 in biocrude this situation was particularly serious in cycles 4 and 5 which was because the presence of ap promoted the decomposition of ss and released more oxygen containing organic compounds such as amino acids interestingly the nitrogen content in biocrude was not increased as described in literatures hu et al 2017 taghipour et al 2021a which may be because the free radicals formed by some components inhibited the transformation of the nitrogen element to the biocrude although the specific mechanism was vague it was still an exciting discovery after the first cycle both the yield and the calorific value of biocrude were improved however as the oxygen element migrated from the ap to the biocrude the calorific value was gradually decreased from 36 4 mj kg to 29 5 mj kg the minimum value was exactly obtained in cycle 5 which was an expected result energy recovery ratio ero was an important parameter to evaluate the efficiency of converting ss into biocrude by htl tong et al 2021 although the hhv of biocrude was decreased the ero was significantly improved by 21 9 the change of biocrude yield played a decisive role according to the quality and the ero of biocrude recycling for three times should be recommended the hhv and the ero of biocrude in cycles 4 and 5 were decreased obviously therefore if the number of cycles continued to be increased it would lead to lower benefits and lose the value 3 3 2 ftir analysis fig 5 shows the infrared spectra of biocrude the functional group characteristics of biocrude were similar the fluctuation from 3500 to 3100 cm 1 was related to the tensile vibration of oh after cycle 1 the ch stretching vibration of methyl or methylene between 3000 cm 1 and 2820 cm 1 was increased which indicated that the biocrude contained hydrocarbons under the conditions of cycles 4 and 5 the vibration of co around 1720 cm 1 was significantly enhanced which indicated that the ap recycling promoted the transfer of oxygen to the biocrude in the form of aldehydes ketones lipids or carboxylic acids the vibration around 1632 cm 1 was attributed to aromatic cc skeleton structure in biocrude the ch stretching vibration between 1473 cm 1 and 1360 cm 1 was slightly strengthened which meant an increase of the aliphatic hydrocarbon content with the increase of ap cycle numbers the co stretching vibration of carboxylic acids esters or ether substances between 1320 cm 1 and 1200 cm 1 was gradually enhanced however the nh bending vibration of amines between 872 cm 1 and 593 cm 1 was nearly unchanged which indicated the nitrogen content in the biocrude was not significantly increased 3 3 3 tga analysis the thermogravimetric curves of biocrude obtained after different numbers of recycling are shown in fig 6 the thermal decomposition was observed to be divided into two distinct stages the moisture removal and the main devolatilization the mass loss above 100 c was came from the evaporative removal of the water in biocrude which was the first stage the temperature between 150 c and 450 c was the second stage of the main devolatilization of biocrude lim and andrésen 2011 it could be seen that the volatilization rate and degree of the biocrude in cycle 0 were significantly lower than others which implied the longer residence time or less energy in the tga garba et al 2018 as the temperature was further increased the coke residues of the unrecycled biocrude samples were much higher than those of the other samples which was not good for engines or other applications in general the recycling of ap significantly increased the content of volatile components in the biocrude thereby enhanced the availability of biocrude and reduced the residue yield in the thermal decomposition process 3 3 4 gc ms analysis the organic components in biocrude were characterized by gc ms it should be noted that the light components may be lost in the separation process only a part of components could be characterized by gc ms in order to clarify the influence of unexpected organic components on the biocrude in raw materials the raw ss was vacuum filtered to remove water then the soluble substances were extracted with acetone according to fig 7 the components of biocrude mainly included aromatic hydrocarbons benzene 1 3 dimethyl and ethylbenzene etc aliphatic hydrocarbons hexane and pentane etc ketones 2 pentanone 4 hydroxy 4 methyl etc esters dibutyl phthalate etc nitrogenous heterocycle oxygenated heterocycle furan 2 methoxy etc phenols acids acetic acid etc the components of biocrude obtained by each group were similar after cycle 1 monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were the main component of biocrude the direct reason was a large number of aromatic derivatives in raw material the ap promoted the breaking of the long chain branch of dibutyl phthalate in the raw ss benzene rings fatty acids or ketones were then formed at the same time due to the hydrolysis of protein was strengthened by the ap recycling more amino acids and polysaccharide were released the condensation and the cyclization of intermediates after polysaccharide degradation was another possible reason for the increase of aromatic hydrocarbons in biocrude kumar et al 2018 this was similar to the conclusion of chang et al 2021b that if the temperature was further higher than 300 c the content of aromatics would be greatly increased due to the ketones in ap acted as the hydrogen supply solvent the alkanes content was slightly increased in the biocrude meanwhile olefins could be deoxidized by the fatty acids and the ketones the contents of nitrogen and oxygen were decreased in the biocrudes obtained from cycles 1 and 2 but the content was increased after cycle 3 this indicated that more components were first transferred to the biocrude by the recycling then the new protein hydrolysis process was strengthened in addition alanine n methyl n propargyloxycarbonyl heptyl ester was found in the biocrude obtained from cycle 3 which further confirmed the existence of enhanced hydrolysis reaction in the system although there was no significantly evidence that ap promoted the migration of nitrogen to the biocrude the nitrogen content of biocrude was still slightly increased after cycle 3 this was because the enhanced hydrolysis of protein caused maillard reaction taghipour et al 2021b due to the monosaccharide produced by carbohydrate hydrolysis first generated furan and then aromatic hydrocarbons lópez barreiro et al 2015 the biocrude obtained by cycle 3 had lower aromatic and higher furan contents which was different from cycle 4 after cycle 5 the oxygen content and the o c of biocrude was significantly increased which meant the oxygen containing substances in ap may enter the biocrude in the form of carboxylic acids esters ketones etc hu et al 2017 klemmer et al 2016 therefore if the number of cycles continued to be increased the ap recycling would lose advantage based on the above analyses the reaction pathways shown in fig 8 could be obtained the promoting effect of ap on the biocrude yield in cycles 1 and 2 were the ketones in ap participated in the htl on the one hand the ketones acted as hydrogen donor solvents and reacted with other free radicals to produce alkanes in this process on the other hand the co combined with the rnh2 to produce the cnr what s more the ketones in ap could be cyclized and enter the biocrude in the form of benzene ring in cycles 3 to 5 due to the exchange of the nitrogen and the phosphorus between solid residue and ap the phosphonic acid content was increased significantly in the ap therefore the phosphonic acid promoted ss hydrolysis then more alkaline substances were released resulting in the increase of ph in ap the cells in ss were more likely to swell under alkaline conditions which contributed to the improvement of the biocrude yield 3 4 distribution of heavy metals as shown in fig 9 the content of hms in three kinds of products aqueous phase biocrude and solid residues were investigated the conclusion was similar to the previous researches huang et al 2011 xiao et al 2020 xu and jiang 2017 which meant that the hms were mainly concentrated in the solid residue as expected the hms content in ap was the lowest the ap recycling promoted the enrichment of most hms to the solid phase the slight increase of hms concentration in ap was due to the enrichment effect of the reduced yield which was consistent with lasheen and ammar 2009 the contents of zn and cu were the highest in all products because they had the affinity to enter organic phase zn and cu existed in the form of organic sulfide in cells huang et al 2018 because of the enhanced hydrolysis process more zn and cu were released to form oxidizable components and the contents in solid residues were improved by 2 7 and 2 8 times respectively after cycle 1 the content of pb was significantly decreased in the biocrude which was increased by 3 times in the solid residue at most that was because pb was preferentially combined in the residual state which was almost undetectable in the active form the same was true for cr more than 95 of cr existed in the solid residues as the oxidizable components and the residual components miaomiao et al 2009 therefore due to the decomposition and transformation of organic matters were promoted by the ap recycling pb and cr were released from the organic matter binding sites to form the residual state among all kinds of hms cd content was the lowest in the system the existing form of cd was dominated by reducing components and the recycling of ap seemed to have no obvious effect on the distribution of cd overall the ap recycling could effectively promote the enrichment of hms to the solid phase which was an ideal situation the migration of hms was vital in the process of ss htl the high hms content will cause more pollution after fuel combustion so the specific morphological distribution and transformation need to be further explored 4 conclusions the current study recycled the aqueous phase as solvent into the htl system and thoroughly investigated the changes in aqueous phase cod properties biocrude yeild chemical structure energy recovery ratio and heavy metals distribution the extraction of the light organic matters in aqueous phase directly reduced the cod by 24 9 and improved the energy recovery by 21 4 the enrichment degree of the most heavy metals in solid residues was even 3 times higher than that before the aqueous phase recycling however applying the aqueous phase transferred a part of undesired oxygen to the biocrude which decreased the calorific value by 7 9 it was found that the best result was achieved by recycled the aqueous phase for three times the application of aqueous phase into the htl was an interesting scheme to improve the biocrude yield with reducing pollution which showed double advantages however there are still some challenges for the application of aqueous phase recycling and performing a full techno economic comparative analysis at a large scale would be

15384,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom strongly influences the bioavailability of metals in aquatic environments however the association between the binding activities and the

is commonly used to quantify dom wood et al 2011 most of previous studies suggested the presence of dom constitutes representative humic acids and fulvic acids could decrease the free metal ion

reportedly lead to an increase in the concentrations of free metal ions e g cu ii and hg ii lee et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 by far free metal ion concentrations decrease with an increase in doc

accumulation over time tk and its toxicity td in organisms and results showed that there was a difference between the observed and predicted tk td parameters in organisms exposed to cu in the haihe river in tianjin china gao et al 2020 the mitigating and accelerating effects of dom on heavy metal bioavailability and toxicity were observed but its quantification extent due to complexity of dom composition had to be examined because the dom compositions are closely related to its functionality and source the compositions of dom has been extensively investigated in natural waters lin et al 2016 2018 in addition diffusive gradients in the thin films technique dgt are generally used to detect bioavailable metals and identify their bio uptake processes in the root soil and or water soil interfaces long et al 2022 xu et al 2019 the dgt method provided a greater advantage in assessing the bioavailable metals than the traditional chemical extraction methods han et al 2019 and help explore the mitigating and accelerating effects of doc on heavy metal bioavailability quantitatively studying the ability of dom and bls to complex heavy metal ions and their competition with conventional metal ions k na ca2 and mg2 for binding are the keys to constructing the tk model for heavy metal toxicity assessment some common materials and methods such as ion exchange resins ion

binding characteristics of ligands such as the stability constants of bls and the complexation capacity of abls marcinek et al 2021 santos et al 2008 the another key is to simulate the protective effect of dom compositions on metal toxicity and find the possible peak effect and apply the model to metal accumulation and toxicity prediction in natural water bodies the classification of dom by molecular weight is useful to understand its properties lin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 using molecular weight cutoff dom from the coastal surface waters of qingdao china was resolved into three fractions to reveal the interactions among dom fractions ph and salinity in the semi enclosed bay liu et al 2010 another study separated dom from forest soil into four fractions molecular weight 3500 da 3500 12 000 da 12 000 14 000 da and 14 000 da through dialysis and determined that the movement of dom from surficial water into soil pore water is a significant component of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems wang et al 2020 in another means of solid phase extraction spe classification the components of dom from water were separated based on polarity and acidity into the following six categories hydrophobic acid hoa hydrophobic neutral hon hydrophobic base hob hydrophilic acid hia hydrophilic neutral hin and hydrophilic base hib these two classification methods help analyze the relationship between the components in dom and the effective concentration of metals therefore they are widely used to study the interaction of dom with its aquatic environment rho et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in this study we aimed to quantify the bioavailability of cd associated with dom compositions using a bl tk td model as shown in fig 1 in order to construct a bl tk td model we first selected the main compositions of dom i e six low molecular weight 350 da organic acids as representative abls to simulate the complexation of cd2 by dom secondly we examined the effects of conventional metal ions and ph on the accumulation and toxicity of cd2 in zebrafish larvae to estimate the binding parameters k of the bl tk td model thirdly we validated the effect of different dom compositions fulvic acid fa and citric acid ca on cd2 accumulation and toxicity to further refine the model finally we validated the model predictions by evaluating the cd2 toxicity in 32 natural waters in china our results highlight the urgent need for site specific water quality criteria for metals and provide guidelines for better industrial and agricultural production to protect aquatic biota 2 materials and methods the complete details of tested zebrafish danio rerio larvae and toxicity tests are provided in the supporting information 2 1 test organism in brief the fish were maintained in the standard dilution water table s1 under a 12 h light 12 h dark photoperiod at 28 c 0 5 c and fed with high protein feed two times a day their embryos were collected after 1 male 2 female mating as described by akimenko akimenko et al 1995 the embryos were hatched at 72 h post fertilization hpf and the larvae were used in the following 96 h toxicity tests i e 72 168 hpf figure s1 gao et al 2019 2 2 test chemicals the stock solutions of cd2 1 g l 1 k na ca2 and mg2 0 5 g l 1 each were prepared by adding different amounts of cdcl2 2 5h2o kcl nahco3 cacl2 2h2o and mgso4 7h2o 99 all chemicals were

h cations in the section on the main dom compositions cd2 titration experiments cd ii solution as 0 1 g l 1 in 10 ml were added into fa has ca tt ga and ba solutions respectively and the free cd2 concentration in six organic acid solutions was detected by ise the software wham was applied to calculate cd species representative results are listed in table s4 in the section on the effect of conventional cations on cd2 toxicity test a 96 h single cd2 toxicity test was prepared in 8 89 10 7 m 0 1 mg l 1 cd2 the 96 h cd2 toxicity tests were prepared in single k set na set ca2 set mg2 set and ph set respectively when studying the competing effects of one primary cation the concentration of other cations in the exposure medium should be as low as possible to avoid masking the protective effect of the objective cation and one of these parameters was varied and the others were set at fixed concentrations table s5 in the laboratory dom compositions single fa and fa ca mixture solutions validation section the 96 h toxicity tests were conducted with 8 89 10 7 m 0 1 mg l 1 cd2 herein the elemental compositions of fa are shown in table s6 as shown in table s7 the concentrations of fa

compositions in the field site water validation section the 96 h toxicity tests were conducted by spiking 4 45 10 5 m 5 mg l 1 cd2 into 32 sampling rivers from the seven rivers in china figure s2 the free cd2 concentration was calculated using ise and wham the bioavailable cd2 was measured by the diffusive gradients in thin films dgt method which was within the 91 115 accuracy table s8 and has 96 h optimum retention time table s9 more details about the dgt method are shown in the supporting information and the dgt operating procedure is shown in figure s3 in the physical and chemical analyses

typical surface waters wang et al 2020 wu et al 2012 the dom fractions of different molecular weights dom 1000 da dom1000 14 000 da and dom 14 000 da in 32 site rivers in china were screened through the 20 mm and 100 mm dialysis bags dom grouping by acids and bases hoa hob hon hia hib and hin in 32 site rivers were also separated by xad resins and detected by a total organic carbon analyzer the cd2 contents in larvae dgt membranes and exposure solutions were detected by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry elan drc e perkinelmer usa 2 4 model 2 4 1 model concept the tk td model at first considered bls in our previous study gao et al 2020 based on the blm theory that assumes that the mass of metal binding ligands as a function of the metal binding constant kmbl and the cation binding constant kcbl and then links the mass ratio of bound metal fmbl with survival by the classic s curve logistic model smith et al 2017 we combined the bl and the tk td model to describe metal concentration in organisms as a time course function of kmbl and kcbl in the tk model and then connected the internal concentration with survival via the stochastic death model in the td model gao et al 2016 here we named the bl tk td model to explain the effects of competitive cations as well as abls and bls on cd2 bioaccumulation and toxicity de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 the bl tk td model was described as follows the bl tk model gao et al 2020 1 d d t c c d int t j c d max c d 2 k c d b l c d 2 k c d b l c d z k c b l 1 k c d int c c d int t where the k na ca2 mg2 and h can bind the bls at a proportion described as the binding constants kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl with the assumption that the binding ability is independent among cations de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 in the numerator the maximum uptake rate of the tested cd jcd max multiplies cd2 concentrations cd2 and multiplies the corresponding binding constants kcdbl l mol 1 and in the denominator cd2 multiplies kcdbl and the cation concentration cz multiplies the cation binding constants kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl mol l the kcd out is the elimination rate constant of metal m time 1 and t is the exposure time time here the growth rate of zebrafish larvae during the 96 h exposure was negligible and thus α the initial weight of a larva mass and β the growth rate of a larva mass time 1 were not present in the model based on the dynamic energy budget toxicology debtox concept in the td model s t is the survival rate of an organism exposed to cd until time t dimensionless and is up to cd beginning to accumulate in an organism when the mass of metal in an organism exceeds the safe threshold cit mass amount 1 which thus decreases the survival of the exposed larvae ashauer et al 2007 here stochastic death sd was used to describe s t in the td model ashauer and brown 2008 the sd assumes that the tested organisms share a common cit and when cit is exceeded they die at random jager et al 2011 which showed that the dead organisms are the unlucky ones zhao and newman 2007 2 d h t d t k k max c c d int t c i t 0 3 s t e h t s c o n t r o l t 4 s c o n t r o l t e h b t herein kk is the killing rate per unit of excess metal above cit mass amount 1 time 1 scontrol t is the survival fraction of the control group set to 1 dimensionless and hb is the background hazard rate set to 0 time 1 indicated by the control group no larvae died in the control during 96 h toxicity tests 2 4 2 model parameterization in addition to quantifying the effect of competing cations on cd2 bioavailability e g log kcdbl value four additional parameters are required to factor the effects of water chemistry into the accumulation and toxicity prediction model three of these parameters are tk parameters i e jcd max kcdbl and kcd out that describe the bioaccumulation process the other two parameters are td parameters i e cit kk that describe the occurrence of toxicity these five parameters were obtained by fitting the cd2 exposure survival data to the bl tk td model see supplementary material r codes for detailed procedures toxicity is linked by jcd max and kcd out to the metal concentration accumulated in the organism rather than the exposure solution jcd max has been included in the blms used to model metal bioabsorption lavoie et al 2014 the metal excretion process cannot be ignored in the 96 h toxicity test but kcd out is negligible in blm in the short term e g 1 h bioabsorption test in the bl tk td model parameters were estimated by using the nelder mead method with the fitode package in r 4 1 3 http www r project org the tk parameters for cd jcd max kcdbl and kcd out were obtained using the 96 h cd accumulation data the td parameters cit and kk for cd were obtained using the 96 h cd survival data the kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl were estimated using the data from the effects of k na ca2 mg2 and h on cd toxicity the complete r codes are provided in the supporting information 2 4 3 model validation we validated the predictive ability of the bl tk td model in laboratory solutions as well as in the 32 sites in the seven river basins in china figure s2 the predictive ability was assessed by comparing 1 1 lines of predicted and observed survival rates in spiked 8 89 10 7 m 0 1 mg l 1 cd2 under 0 20 mg l 1 fa 0 12 mg l 1 ca mixtures in lab solutions and spiked 1 56 10 5 m 5 mg l 1 cd2 under 32 field site water quality the above kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl were used as inputs during the bl tk td modeling k na ca2 mg2 ph cl no3 and so4 2 levels in sampling sites were used as inputs in wham to calculate cd2 concentration and competitive k na ca2 mg2 and h levels were used as inputs in the bl tk td modeling also detected cd2 from the ise method and bioavailable cd from the dgt method were used as inputs in the bl tk td modeling the complete r codes are provided in the supporting information 2 5 data analysis the concentrations of individual cd species e g cd2 cdoh cd oh 3 cdcl in the test solutions were calculated by the wham module in visual minteq visual minteq version 3 1 https vminteq lwr kth se and the concentrations of dissolved cd doc k na ca2 mg2 cl no3 and so4 2 and the ph were used as input parameters the zebrafish larvae were rinsed in ultrapure water for about 1 h before the test to avoid feces extra doc being introduced into the exposure solutions the best rinse time was determined according to the time at which the toc content in ultrapure water reaches equilibrium figure s4 the bl tk td model predicted cd accumulation and survival rates of zebrafish larvae were compared with 24 48 72 and 96 h observed accumulation and survival rates for 8 89 10 7 m 0 1 mg l 1 cd in 0 20 mg l 1 fa 0 12 mg l ca and 4 45 10 5 m 5 mg l 1 cd in 32 sampling rivers using r 4 1 3 http www r project org r core team 2022 the initial cd concentrations in solutions were individually input as follows 1 the concentrations of free cd2 calculated by the wham module e g cd species in table s10 and s11 for sites 1 and 2 respectively 2 the concentrations of free cd2 detected by ise 3 the concentrations of bioavailable cd detected by dgt method the comparisons between the observed and predicted values were regressed through the 1 1 line and rmse is the root mean square error of the 1 1 line the complete r codes are provided in the supporting information the bl tk td model predicted cd lc50 and compared it with the observed cd lc50 at 24 48 72 and 96 h for the 32 field sites it also compared it with the calculated cd lc50 in the ecotox database https cfpub epa gov ecotox and the entries were selected with the following criteria effect as mortality endpoint as lc50 observed duration as 24 48 72 and 96 h exposure types as renewal exposure media as fresh water we analyzed the correlation among the predicted cd lc50 dom 1000 da dom1000 14 000 da and dom 14 000 da concentrations and also analyzed the correlation among the predicted cd lc50 hoa hon hob hia hib and hin concentrations the predicted and observed cd lc50s were compared through the 1 1 line and rmse is the root mean square error of the 1 1 line the observed lc50s and hia concentrations were non linearly fitted with the parabola function y ax2 bx c to derive the hia concentrations corresponding to the peak lc50 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction of the tk td model considering the main compositions of dom in laboratory solutions 3 1 1 binding between cd ii and organic acids the complex formation curves of cd ii with organic acids are shown in fig 2 the concentrations of cd ii binding abls cd abl were normalized by organic acid mass concentrations as mol g 1 and they increased with increasing cd concentrations cd ii larger molecules such as has or fa likely aggregated at higher concentrations wada et al 2020 yuan et al 2015 and resulted in decreased binding to cd ii however they did not aggregate in the concentration range tested 1 50 mg l 1 indicated by the transparency of the solutions for fa has tt ca ba and ga cd ii addition resulted in significant binding fig 2 low molecular weight organic acids such as ca tt and ga rarely aggregate ged and boyer 2013 and other possible mechanisms should be considered we did not find a proper model to describe these binding curves but we noticed that cd ii binding decreased with the increasing concentrations of the tested low molecular organic acids we tested different concentrations of organic acids in 0 1 m nano3 binding to the two primary cd ii concentrations mm as shown in figure s5 the addition of fa and has resulted in significant amounts of cd ii bound to abiotic acids fa and has were not aggregating in the tested concentration range because the decrease of cd ii was always observed until fa and has concentrations reached 0 012 mm and 0 016 mm respectively however the addition of tt ca ba and ga resulted in a peak valley effect of cd ii concentrations when each abiotic acid and cd ii were in an equimolar ratio the cd ii concentrations decreased to their lowest levels and then increased with increasing concentrations of the acids a similar phenomenon was observed for some low molecular weight organic acids whose concentration dependent complexation with cu ii is obvious because of the homoconjugation negative charge assisted h bonding interactions among organic acid molecules zhao et al 2018 the decreased cd ii organic acid binding was thus correlated to the increased homoconjugation among acid molecules 3 1 2 estimation of parameters jcd max kcdbl kcd out cit and kk in the tk td model as shown in figure s6 after fitting the cd accumulation data jcd max and kcd out were 12 2 0 27 μg g 1 h 1 and 0 061 0 0049 h 1 respectively table 1 cit measures an organism s tolerance to cd but does not reflect a higher risk of death whereas kk measures the rate at which mortality increases when a safe threshold is exceeded ashauer and brown 2008 after fitting the survival data cit and kk were 12 8 1 09 μg g 1 and 1 42 0 24 10 3 g μg 1 h 1 respectively table 1 in traditional blm only one parameter is used to measure the magnitude of toxicity namely the median lethal accumulation la50 corresponding to 50 mortality clifford and mcgeer 2010 or f50 the proportion of metal bound bls corresponding to 50 mortality de schamphelaere et al 2002 la50 and f50 correspond to cit but cit is different 1 la50 or f50 represents the amount of metal bound to bls on the surface of the organism whereas cit represents the amount of metal accumulated in the organism 2 la50 or f50 corresponds to the effective metal concentration ec50 for 50 biological death whereas cit corresponds to the in vivo metal concentration without death nec 3 la50 or f50 is related to exposure time e g larvae exposed to metal for 24 48 72 and 96 h gao et al 2021 whereas cit is independent of time the ligand complexation constant log kcdbl of cd in zebrafish larvae was 5 68 table 2 which was smaller than that reported in several species of fish table s12 including 7 20 in yellow perch perca flavescens niyogi and wood 2004 7 34 in rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss niyogi et al 2008 and 8 6 in pimephales promebs brooks et al 2006 the log kcdbl value reflects the ability of cd to bind to bls and is positively correlated with the toxicity of cd measured as ec50 or lc50 expressed as free ion cd2 concentration or activity ardestani et al 2014 in zebrafish larvae higher log k values were generally observed for more toxic metals such as cu2 7 4 and lower log k values for less toxic metals such as zn2 5 31 gao et al 2017 3 1 3 estimates of parameters log k for h k na ca2 and mg2 in the bl tk td model as shown in figures s7 s11 after fitting the cd accumulation and toxicity data in different k set na set ca set mg set and ph set respectively the log k values for competing cations except h ranged from 3 08 0 06 for na to 4 54 0 02 for ca2 table 2 our estimates were in the range of 3 to 5 as reported in previous blm reports on cd in various fish species ardestani et al 2014 in this study k 2 56e 5 2 05e 4 m did not affect cd accumulation in fish larvae figure s7 whereas na 3 48e 4 8 70e 4 m did figure s8 due to no effect of toxicity mitigation in many cases log k values for na and k are rarely reported for example na 5 4e 4 1 65e 3 m or k 5e 5 1 43e 3 m did not significantly affect cd toxicity in daphnia pulex clifford and mcgeer 2010 and na 6e 5 2 2e 3 m did not affect cd bioaccumulation in rainbow trout gills niyogi et al 2008 however ca2 4 50e 5 2 20e 4 m mg2 4 67e 5 3 38e 4 m and h ph 5 5 7 0 affected cd accumulation in fish larvae figures s9 s11 and log k values for ca2 mg2 and h are often reported brooks et al 2006 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 niyogi and wood 2004 the log knabl kcabl and kmgbl values were in the range 3 19 5 00 in blm for cd in various aquatic species table s12 competing cations i e na ca2 and mg2 had log k values approximately 1 5 log units lower than that of cd2 table 2 this means that na ca2 and mg2 concentrations need to be at least 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of cd2 0 5 μm to satisfy the condition for the competitive accumulation of kcbl ciz kcdbl cd2 and achieve the protective effect of cations see eq 1 we calculated the median lethal concentration of cd at 24 h for different ph k na ca and mg sets table s13 the lc50 of cd increased with increasing cation concentration except k which indicated the protective effect of these cations high concentrations of the major cations themselves did not show toxicity i e no larvae deaths in the corresponding controls although they may alter osmotic pressure in larvae and increase their susceptibility to cd klinck et al 2012 the underlying physiological regulatory mechanism is still unclear and its impact cannot be considered in the current bl tk td model therefore caution should be used when applying the model to water bodies with cation concentrations outside the calibration range of the model as shown in table 2 log khbl 5 22 was close to log kcdbl 5 68 therefore h concentrations need to be close to cd2 concentrations i e ph 7 3 to significantly reduce cd toxicity eqs 2 4 the measured log khbl 5 22 was significantly lower than the corresponding value in fathead minnow larvae 6 7 brooks et al 2006 but was in the log khbl range 4 3 7 6 for other metals in various biological species ardestani et al 2014 the cd species was sensitive to changes in ph but cd2 ions were always the predominant species 50 99 throughout the ph range studied figure s3 furthermore the log khbl value of 5 22 is close to the pka value for the dissociation of thiol sh or amine nh3 groups in weak acids harris 2010 suggesting that bls may have thiol groups 3 1 4 model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis we analyzed the parameter sensitivity of the bl tk td model and showed that the parameters related to accumulation such as jcd max kcdbl and kcd out and toxicity such as cit and kk largely determined the model output figure s12 based on the dynamic energy budget framework billoir et al 2009 kooijman et al 2008 the bio uptake process jcd max and kcdbl was assumed to be the main function for acquiring energy which drives all other functions in an organism moreover cit and kk are the main factors in the td model thus we believe that kk must be accurate and credible throughout the replicates in the toxicity test the bl tk td model is parameterized with data from only one toxicity experiment model parameters are more susceptible to toxicity testing errors therefore higher quality toxicity data need to be calibrated different concentrations of cd in toxicity tests such as 10 and 50 μg l 1 cd theoretically yield similar log kcdbl values when we estimated the parameters of the bl tk td model the initial parameter values may lead to greater uncertainty in their optimized values therefore the jcd max kcdbl and kcd out values from previous studies gao et al 2016 2015 were used as initial parameter values in this study 3 2 validation of the predictive ability of the bl tk td model considering the compositions of dom in laboratory solutions to validate the kinetic bl tk td model in the presence of dom cd toxicity was observed at different concentrations of fa figure s13 increasing the concentration of fa from 0 to 6 48e 5 m resulted in a decrease in the concentration of free cd2 from 1 78e 6 m to 1 30e 6 m so increasing the concentration of fa would reduce cd accumulation in larvae and increase their survival rate the protective effect of dom on cd toxicity was well predicted by the bl tk td model figure s13 as shown in table s14 the median lethal concentration of free cd2 lc50cd 2 at 24 h was positively correlated with fa concentration as the fa concentration increased from 0 to 6 48e 5 m the lc50cd 2 of cd exposed zebrafish larvae at 24 h increased from 3 87 10 6 m to 19 4 10 6 m to validate the kinetic bl tk td model in the presence of dom with different components the concentration of other ions was maintained at a constant value and cd toxicity was measured with an fa ca gradient mixture fa 0 065 0 0016 mm ca 0 0 064 mm as the concentration of free cd2 increases from 5 8e 7 m to 7 5e 7 m increasing the concentration of ca will increase the concentration of cd2 in the exposure solution thereby increasing the accumulation of cd in larvae fig 3 and reducing their survival rate fig 4 the ability of small molecular organic acids such as ca to bind free ions of heavy metals reportedly changes with their concentration zhao et al 2018 one study reported that at low concentrations the negatively charged organic acid easily complexed with cu2 thereby reducing the concentration of free cu2 in the solution11 however at high concentrations the negatively charged organic acid molecules collide and complex together due to charge assisted hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2018 increasing the concentration of free cu2 in the solution which may affect its bioavailability in the water environment this effect results in a difference between the model predicted and actual heavy metal distribution in the water leading to an inaccurate toxicity assessment by the existing blm zhang et al 2017 we speculate that when the concentrations of ca increased the negatively charged ca molecules collided and complexed together increasing the concentration of free cd2 in the solution and eventually increasing the bioavailability of cd in the larvae fig 3 for a certain water body if the doc mainly comes from fa the lc50 of cu in medaka fish predicted using blm was the same as that calculated through experiments wang et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 the fold difference between lc50s was relatively small between 1 3 and 1 5 wang et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 thus the assumption of ha fa 5 5 in the bl tk td model may be safer than ha fa 1 9 which is assumed by the traditional blm niyogi et al 2008 however this study found that the effect of doc composition on the acute toxicity of cd cannot be ignored in the existing bl tk td model 100 doc was assumed to come from fa or 90 10 from fa and ca respectively and the model prediction accuracy was high when both fa and ca are assumed to be 50 the accuracy of model predictions was poorer in natural waters some docs may also originate from non humic organic matter but these may have weaker complexation activities with metals chen et al 2021 su et al 2021 many researchers have been aware of this problem but they simply believe that most docs have metal complexation activities in studying metal complexation in natural waters li et al 2022 to fit the experimental data with a simple and practical complexation model they simply attributed this part of the active doc to fa namely active fa smith et al 2014 in the cu titration experiments of some natural water samples it was found that if active fa constituted 40 80 of the doc the rest of the doc did not have complexation ability and the best agreement was found between the measured and theoretically calculated free cu ion activity values tipping et al 2022 without a better definition of doc composition the assumption that 50 of the doc contributes to metal complexation via active fa can provide the most comprehensive prediction of the types and forms of cu complexed by organic matter craven et al 2012 levit and faustova 2009 according to this assumption the 48 h lc50 value of cu in daphnia magna was accurately predicted in the studied surface water the ratio of predicted to an observed value less than 2 de schamphelaere et al 2002 however domestic and industrial wastewater that is discharged into natural water bodies contains other metal complexing organic pollutants such as edta de luna et al 2020 a more nuanced definition of doc composition in blm is required to accurately predict the toxicity of metals in such wastewater 3 3 validation of the predictive ability of the bl tk td model considering the complexity of dom compositions in field waters 3 3 1 physical and chemical indices of natural water bodies the physical and chemical indices of the 32 water samples from seven river basins across china were very different table s15 in this study the collected water samples were analyzed for the two parameters concerning blm water body cations and doc as shown in figure s14 the hardness of the yellow river basin water was higher than that of other basin waters the doc content in the pearl river basin was the lowest and that in the songhua and huai river basins was the highest among all the sampled basins the concentrations of co3 2 and po4 3 were below the detection limit and not presented table s15 the measured water chemistry indices table s15 and concentrations μg l 1 of metals table s16 in the 32 surface river samples were used for data analysis whenever applicable 3 3 2 molecular weight fractions of dom as shown in figure s15 dom 14 000 da was predominant in the dombulk extracted from samples 1 2 4 14 17 19 and 22 its concentration was 6 30 mg l 1 and accounted for 44 6 of the dombulk the concentrations of dom 1000 da and dom1000 14 000 da in these samples were relatively lower 3 67 mg l 1 and 4 45 mg l 1 respectively accounting for 22 9 and 34 7 of the dombulk respectively in previous studies river water was dominated by large molecular weight dom bekbolet and sen kavurmaci 2015 yang et al 2017 whereas seawater was dominated by small molecular weight dom fox et al 2018 rossel et al 2016 the highest dom1000 14 000 da concentration 6 99 mg l 1 was found in samples 3 and 23 accounting for 50 5 of the dombulk in the water from these rivers dom 1000 da predominated in samples 13 16 21 25 and 28 with concentrations 2 61 mg l 1 accounting for 45 0 of the dombulk dom 14 000 da and dom1000 14 000 da were relatively lesser accounting for 24 0 and 33 0 respectively this confirmed the diversity of dom from different rivers across china 3 3 3 acid base components of dom according to acidity basicity dombulk from the 32 water bodies was divided into six groups and the results are shown in figure s16 the main components of dombulk in samples 6 and 22 were hoa accounting for 20 but it is reported that the hoa content in field rivers did not exceed 12 aslam et al 2013 avsar et al 2014 the highest hob contents were found in samples 14 and 17 accounting for 25 and 27 of the dombulk respectively the highest hon content was in sample 5 accounting for 21 which was similar to the values obtained in the previous studies zhou et al 2010 however this component was hardly detected in dom from other field water bodies peleato et al 2017 yang et al 2013 the hib contents in all samples accounted for 14 30 the hin contents in samples 2 13 16 21 25 28 and 31 accounted for 20 but it was previously reported that this value does not exceed 15 peleato et al 2017 in this study the main components of dombulk in samples 13 16 21 25 and 28 were hia accounting for 28 3 3 4 prediction of cadmium accumulation in natural water bodies the accumulation of cd in zebrafish larvae from natural freshwater rivers was predicted by the bl tk td model in most water samples the accumulation of bioavailable cd calculated by the dgt method was higher than the observed value figure s17 because dgt considers both bioavailable dom complexed cd and bio unavailable dom complexed cd as bioavailable cd the co3 2 and hco3 in all 32 water samples were lower than the limit of detection table s15 therefore there is almost no cd in a carbonate bound state that is not easily bioavailable the accumulation of cd2 predicted by the ise method was generally lower than the observed

predicted accumulation of cd2 obtained by wham was in good agreement with the observed values fig 5 the predicted and observed cd accumulation values matched well for samples 1 2 4 8 12 18 19 20 22 23 24 26 27 30 and 32 whereas the observed values of cd accumulation were higher than the predicted values for samples 5 6 7 9 10 13 14 16 17 21 25 and 28 among them samples 13 16 doc 10 46 mg l 1 21 doc 15 02 mg l 1 25 doc 13 71 mg l 1 and 28 doc 17 94 mg l 1 had higher doc content especially small molecular dom and higher hia components as well charge assisted hydrogen bonding may have occurred zhao et al 2018 increasing cd2 content in the water and its accumulation in the larvae samples 14 doc 11 02 mg l 1 and 17 doc 12 2 mg l 1 had high doc content high small molecular dom content and high proportion of hob components besides intake from the water phase the cd adsorbed by the hob substance can enter the organism through the oral pathway chen et al 2017 and thus increase the absorption flux of cd the situation is complex and beyond the predictable range of the bl tk td model which did not consider food intake in eq 1 based on the bl tk td model the observed cd accumulation in larvae from samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 was lower than the predicted values fig 5 the toxic effect of heavy metals on organisms is mainly manifested in reducing the transport of na in organisms producing poisoning symptoms related to the loss of na from cells wan et al 2008 samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 contained a relatively higher concentration of doc which could enhance the activity of na k atpase promoting the uptake of na and inhibiting the uptake of cd wan et al 2008 in natural freshwater the three humic like components had a similar ability of binding metals large molecular weight dom 14 000 da generally had a higher ability of binding metal ions e g cd2 and cu2 than moderate 1000 14 000 da and small molecular weight dom 1000 da chen et al 2013 however this phenomenon was not true for mercury hg2 where the binding log khgbl was quite variable chen et al 2013 doc is mostly comprised of ha and fa substances which are low molecular weight organic acids containing phenolic hydroxyl carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups li et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 these groups are considered to be the active binding sites for heavy metals zhao et al 2018 which enhances their migration ability the main functional groups that easily combine with heavy metal ions and their oxides are cooh and oh croue et al 2003 the interaction between doc and cd mostly goes through two stages zhang et al 2014 1 the ion exchange reaction dom combines cd2 to form a compound and releases h from the functional group at the same time however the compounds of dom and cu formed at this time are soluble therefore the concentration of dom in the solution remains unchanged 2 all functional groups such as cooh and oh in dom react completely with cd and the dom and cd compounds formed at this time continue to combine with cu dom complexes to form high molecular weight polymers when the molecular weight is large enough precipitation occurs and the precipitate is removed from the water phase to the bottom in addition comparing the ca mg dom complex with the cd dom complex shows that ca and mg at high concentrations are preferentially bound by the cooh sites of dom lu and allen 2002 increasing the concentration of cd2 in solution the observed values of cd accumulation in larvae from sample 14 ca2 4 47 mm and mg2 7 23 mm table s15 were higher than the predicted values 3 3 5 prediction of cadmium toxicity in natural water the survival rate of larvae in natural freshwater rivers was predicted based on the bl tk td model in most water samples the survival rate predicted by the dgt method was generally lower than the observed value figure s19 whereas that obtained by the ise method was generally higher than the observed value figure s20 using wham calculations the predicted survival rates for half of the 32 water samples were in good agreement with the observed values whereas those for the other samples i e 1 3 5 9 11 and 12 were overestimated fig 6 the most pronounced overestimation occurred in samples 1 and 3 both of which had high doc concentrations 6 7 and 6 9 mg l 1 respectively probably due to a simulation error by visual minteq 3 1 in the amount of cd complexed by dom in natural water bodies the complexing capacity of native dom was lower than that of the two commercial fas and cas the dom in water bodies is quite different from the dom used to calibrate the bl tk td model gustafsson and kleja 2005 the complexation effect of dom in natural waters needs to be understood and the application of the bl tk td model to assess the toxicity of natural water will underestimate the true risk the observed and the model predicted survival rates of zebrafish larvae agreed well for samples 1 2 4 8 9 12 14 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 26 27 30 and 32 fig 6 as the content of large molecular weight dom and hob components in samples 14 doc 11 02 mg l 1 and 17 doc 12 2 mg l 1 were high the bioaccumulation of cd in the larvae was greater these components adsorb cd in the solution and enter the digestive tract of zebrafish larvae through drinking water they are not completely absorbed by the larval intestines and cannot pass through the intestinal barrier to enter the bloodstream and produce toxicity cronholm et al 2011 pittinger and pecquet 2018 therefore they do not lead to higher toxicity and are eventually excreted in the feces bruinink et al 2015 based on the bl tk td model the observed values of cd survival rate in larval fish in samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 were higher than the predicted values fig 6 probably due to the high proportion of hin contents in these river sites 20 which affected the proportion between detoxified cd nontoxic dose and metabolically available cd toxic dose in larvae dom decreased the absorption of cd in the rat intestine isolated metabolically available cd and increased the proportion of detoxified cd glynn 1995 in the future the accuracy of modeling can be improved by incorporating the detoxified cd and metabolically available cd as a two compartment model into the current bl tk td model tan and wang 2012 based on the model prediction the observed values of survival rate of larvae exposed to cd in samples 5 6 7 10 13 16 21 25 and 28 were lower than the predicted values fig 6 the observed accumulation of cd in these samples increased fig 5 causing the survival rate to decrease 3 3 6 calculation of lc50 using kinetic blm we were able to predict the time course of cd bioaccumulation and the survival upon exposure to specific cd concentrations and hydro chemical conditions conversely we were able to calculate the cd concentration that resulted in 50 mortality after t h of exposure i e t h lc50 which was not necessarily the same duration 96 h used for model calibration most of the calculated 24 48 72 and 96 h lc50 values were in the range of 1 11 10 4 0 521 mg l 1 table s17 for sites with higher concentrations of competing cations dom and especially lower ph samples 2 9 14 15 16 and 17 the calculated lc50 values will be higher the predicted 24 h lc50 values 0 138 0 446 mg l 1 were lower than the 96 h lc50 values 0 743 1 17 mg l 1 for turquoise killifish larvae but close to the 24 h lc50 values for chameleon cichlid larvae 0 152 mg l 1 in the ecotox database table s18 the predicted 48 h lc50 values 0 039 0 125 mg l 1 were close to the corresponding values for fathead minnow larvae 3 54 10 2 6 35 10 2 mg l 1 but lower than those for acrossocheilus paradoxus larvae 0 370 mg l 1 and turquoise killifish larvae 0 583 mg l 1 the predicted 72 h lc50 values 0 005 0 018 mg l 1 were lower than those for turquoise killifish larvae 0 393 0 412 mg l 1 the predicted 96 h lc50 values were lower than those for zebrafish larvae 0 122 5 44 mg l 1 and nothobranchius furzeri 0 283 0 391 mg l 1 table s18 the 96 h lc50 predicted using kinetic bl tk td was very close to the cd toxicity statistics endpoint mortality of several fish species etheostoma fonticola 96 h lc50 of 1 18 10

and hin had no obvious dose response relationship with the predicted lc50 at different time points figures s21 s28 the predicted and observed lc50 values deviated in some cases rmse 7 60e 5 0 088 during the 96 h exposure to cd in the 32 samples figure s29 the current model does not consider dom components with unknown structures and the ability to complex metals in natural waters with increasing hia concentrations the lc50 values gradually increased to a peak and then decreased fig 7 the peak of lc50 appeared when the hia concentration was 3 55 0 44 mg l 1 which was similar to the finding that 2 5 mg l 1 doc may effectively increase the acute toxicity of cu in a euryhaline clam potamocorbula laevis chen et al 2017 3 4 advantages of the kinetic bl tk td model the first advantage of bl tk td is that it requires fewer toxicity experiments and testing organisms using traditional methods a cd blm was developed using 22 tests and 3520 daphnias clifford and mcgeer 2010 in contrast we developed the cd bl tk td model using only a few toxicity tests one test for each cation and a few zebrafish larvae typically four to seven toxicity tests are required to estimate ligand complexation constants using traditional blm methods clifford and mcgeer 2010 only one toxicity test is required for the bl tk td method model parameters are estimated simultaneously from multivariate nonlinear fits and variations in multiple water chemistry parameters doc h k na ca2 and mg2 can be mathematically handled and are acceptable toxicity predictions using this model are more accurate because the model is dynamic and can predict effective concentrations of metals under different exposure times and fluctuating concentrations which is expected in natural water bodies the traditional blm can only predict toxic effective concentrations at specific times such as t time ecx lax and fx e g 24 h ec50 la50 and f50 i e the metal concentration that would result in a 50 biological response after exposure jeong et al 2022 however bl tk td is more flexible exposure time itself is an independent variable and can predict the metal concentration that leads to any response i e 0 100 after any exposure time 3 5 limitations of the bl tk td model our refined tk td model considering a wide range of doc concentrations could accurately predict cd toxicity in natural field waters but showed certain limits related to certain doc concentrations 3 55 0 44 mg l 1 the advantage of estimating bl tk td parameters using fewer toxicity tests may compromise model stability thus the model parameters become more susceptible to toxicity testing errors and higher quality toxicity data are needed to estimate parameters in predicting lc50 by bl tk td we assumed that model parameters remain constant over time as the organism grows and develops which cannot be completely correct introducing the growth rate equation into the tk model should be considered in the future gergs et al 2019 toxicity delay effects were not accounted for in the model and the organisms recovered immediately when the internal cd concentration fell below the threshold cit this is one of the reasons why the model predictions did not completely match the observations the functional group structure of each component of dom in the 32 water bodies is still unclear effectively determining the constituents of dom and their structural characteristics using traditional chemical analysis is challenging and the original properties of the components can easily be destroyed and changed during the determination process he et al 2016 in future research spectroscopic analysis techniques such as infrared spectroscopy liu et al 2018 nuclear magnetic resonance seidel et al 2022 etc can be used to nondestructively determine the components and structural characteristics of dom in addition the proportion of dom components could be identified and used to optimize model fit through a concise amount of metal binding by dom in waters this identification procedure was not considered in the bl tk td model we got used to assuming the amount of metal bound by dom without identifying dom compositions and thus the bl tk td fitted the toxicity data poorly consequently it is urgent to incorporate this identification procedure into the current bl tk td to improve the accuracy of modeling 4 implications we could use one toxicity test instead of 5 7 to estimate each log k and develop the bl tk td model consequently saving several resources e g toxicity testing organisms time and lab space our bl tk td model could accurately predict the protective effect of fulvic acid while overestimate the complexing capacity of citric acid the model was also validated in the presence of different dom compositions from 32 natural water bodies in china and could successfully simulate the protective effects of native dom in most cases due to its complexity and heterogeneity and existence with inorganic salts in the aqueous environment at low concentrations the complete qualitative and quantitative characterization of dom in terms of compositions and structures is still not possible although spe separation and enrichment of dom improves the understanding of its composition and bioavailability the low retention rate of spe for strongly polar substances is an obstacle to the complete characterization of dom compositions and structures the distribution characteristics of hardness and doc components in different river basins and their effects on metal accumulation and toxicity should be considered when establishing the metal benchmarks for different river basins to control heavy metal pollution the bl tk td model is not limited to test duration e g 96 h or model output toxicity results lc50 and can predict lcx after any exposure time this flexibility will greatly facilitate the application of the bl tk td model to scientifically determine metal benchmarks for different river basins disclosures

15384,the presence of dissolved organic matter dom strongly influences the bioavailability of metals in aquatic environments however the association between the binding activities and the concentrations of dom compositions is not well documented leading to uncertainties in metal toxicity assessment we creatively quantify the mitigation and acceleration effects of dom compositions on cadmium cd bioaccumulation and toxicity in zebrafish larvae using abiotic ligand abls and biotic ligand bls in a toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model the bl tk td model could accurately predict the

acids glycolic acid proteins amino acids lipids polysaccharides ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid edta nitrilotriacetic acid citric acid tartaric acid and surfactants minor et al 2014 dom significantly affects the biogeochemical processes of the aquatic environment including the migration and transformation of heavy metals such as copper cu and cadmium cd regulation of dissolved oxygen and ph and the cycling of inorganic elements such as potassium k sodium na calcium ca2 and magnesium mg2 minor et al 2014 dissolved organic carbon doc accounting for 50 70 of the dom mass composition is commonly used to quantify dom wood et al 2011 most of previous studies suggested the presence of dom constitutes representative humic acids and fulvic acids could decrease the free metal ion concentrations and reduce metal bioavailability and toxicity cui et al 2022 mastrangelo et al 2011 on the contrary higher concentrations of doc especially organic acids with low molecular weight reportedly lead to an increase in the concentrations of free metal ions e g cu ii and hg ii lee et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 by far free metal ion concentrations decrease with an increase in doc concentrations which was applied by the windermere humic aqueous model wham in the present biotic ligand model blm and thus increasing the uncertainty in the assessment of heavy metal toxicity clement

concentration and do not truly reflect the precise amount of heavy metals in the water body10 our previous study refined the toxicokinetic toxicodynamic tk td model using bls to simulate metal accumulation over time tk and its toxicity td in organisms and results showed that there was a difference between the observed and predicted tk td parameters in organisms exposed to cu in the haihe river in tianjin china gao et al 2020 the mitigating and accelerating effects of dom on heavy metal bioavailability and toxicity were observed but its quantification extent due to complexity of dom composition had to be examined because the dom compositions are closely related to its functionality and source the compositions of dom has been extensively investigated in natural waters lin et al 2016 2018 in addition diffusive gradients in the thin films technique dgt are generally used to detect bioavailable metals and identify their bio uptake processes in the root soil and or water soil interfaces long et al 2022 xu et al 2019 the dgt method provided a greater advantage in assessing the bioavailable metals than the traditional chemical extraction methods han et al 2019 and help explore the mitigating and accelerating effects of doc on heavy metal bioavailability quantitatively studying the ability of dom and bls to complex heavy metal ions and their competition with conventional metal ions k na ca2 and mg2 for binding are the keys to constructing the tk model for heavy metal toxicity assessment some common materials and methods such as ion exchange resins ion selective electrodes ultraviolet maximum absorption light waves ultrafiltration equilibrium dialysis and fluorescence spectroscopy rho et al 2019 wang et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 help discern the binding characteristics of ligands such as the stability constants of bls and the complexation capacity of abls marcinek et al 2021 santos et al 2008 the another key is to simulate the protective effect of dom compositions on metal toxicity and find the possible peak effect and apply the model to metal accumulation and toxicity prediction in natural water bodies the classification of dom by molecular weight is useful to understand its properties lin et al 2018 wang et al 2020 using molecular weight cutoff dom from the coastal surface waters of qingdao china was resolved into three fractions to reveal the interactions among dom fractions ph and salinity in the semi enclosed bay liu et al 2010 another study separated dom from forest soil into four fractions molecular weight 3500 da 3500 12 000 da 12 000 14 000 da and 14 000 da through dialysis and determined that the movement of dom from surficial water into soil pore water is a significant component of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems wang et al 2020 in another means of solid phase extraction spe classification the components of dom from water were separated based on polarity and acidity into the following six categories hydrophobic acid hoa hydrophobic neutral hon hydrophobic base hob hydrophilic acid hia hydrophilic neutral hin and hydrophilic base hib these two classification methods help analyze the relationship between the components in dom and the effective concentration of metals therefore they are widely used to study the interaction of dom with its aquatic environment rho et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in this study we aimed to quantify the bioavailability of cd associated with dom compositions using a bl tk td model as shown in fig 1 in order to construct a bl tk td model we first selected the main compositions of dom i e six low molecular weight 350 da organic acids as representative abls to simulate the complexation of cd2 by dom secondly we examined the effects of conventional metal ions and ph on the accumulation and toxicity of cd2 in zebrafish larvae to estimate the binding parameters k of the bl tk td model thirdly we validated the effect of different dom compositions fulvic acid fa and citric acid ca on cd2 accumulation and toxicity to further refine the model finally we validated the model predictions by evaluating the cd2 toxicity in 32 natural waters in china our

first considered bls in our previous study gao et al 2020 based on the blm theory that assumes that the mass of metal binding ligands as a function of the metal binding constant kmbl and the cation binding constant kcbl and then links the mass ratio of bound metal fmbl with survival by the classic s curve logistic model smith et al 2017 we combined the bl and the tk td model to describe metal concentration in organisms as a time course function of kmbl and kcbl in the tk model and then connected the internal concentration with survival via the stochastic death model in the td model gao et al 2016 here we named the bl tk td model to explain the effects of competitive cations as well as abls and bls on cd2 bioaccumulation and toxicity de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 the bl tk td model was described as follows the bl tk model gao et al 2020 1 d d t c c d int t j c d max c d 2 k c d b l c d 2 k c d b l c d z k c b l 1 k c d int c c d int t where the k na ca2 mg2 and h can bind the bls at a proportion described as the binding constants kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl with the assumption that the binding ability is independent among cations de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 in the numerator the maximum uptake rate of the tested cd jcd max multiplies cd2 concentrations cd2 and multiplies the corresponding binding constants kcdbl l mol 1 and in the denominator cd2 multiplies kcdbl and the cation concentration cz multiplies the cation binding constants kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl mol l the kcd out is the elimination rate constant of metal m time 1 and t is the exposure time time here the growth rate of zebrafish larvae during the 96 h exposure was negligible and thus α the initial weight of a larva mass and β the growth rate of a larva mass time 1 were not present in the model based on the dynamic energy budget toxicology debtox concept in the td model s t is the survival rate of an organism exposed to cd until time t dimensionless and is up to cd beginning to accumulate in an organism when the mass of metal in an organism exceeds the safe threshold cit mass amount 1 which thus decreases the survival of the exposed larvae ashauer et al 2007 here stochastic death sd was used to describe s t in the td model ashauer and brown 2008 the sd assumes that the tested organisms share a common cit and when cit is exceeded they die at random jager et al 2011 which showed that the dead organisms are the unlucky ones zhao and newman 2007 2 d h t d t k k max c c d int t c i t 0 3 s t e h t s c o n t r o l t 4 s c o n t r o l t e h b t herein kk is the killing rate

by the control group no larvae died in the control during 96 h toxicity tests 2 4 2 model parameterization in addition to quantifying the effect of competing cations on cd2 bioavailability e g log kcdbl value four additional parameters are required to factor the effects of water chemistry into the accumulation and toxicity prediction model three of these parameters are tk parameters i e jcd max kcdbl and kcd out that describe the bioaccumulation process the other two parameters are td parameters i e cit kk that describe the occurrence of toxicity these five parameters were obtained by fitting the cd2 exposure survival data to the bl tk td model see supplementary material r codes for detailed procedures toxicity is linked by jcd max and kcd out to the metal concentration accumulated in the organism rather than the exposure solution jcd max has been included in the blms used to model metal bioabsorption lavoie et al 2014 the metal excretion process cannot be ignored in the 96 h toxicity test but kcd out is negligible in blm in the short term e g 1 h bioabsorption test in the bl tk td model parameters were estimated by using the nelder mead method with the fitode package in r 4 1 3 http www r project org the tk parameters for cd jcd max kcdbl and kcd out were obtained using the 96 h cd accumulation data the td parameters cit and kk for cd were obtained using the 96 h cd survival data the kkbl knabl kcabl kmgbl and khbl were estimated using the data from the effects of k na ca2 mg2 and h on cd toxicity the complete r codes are provided in the supporting information 2 4 3 model validation we validated the predictive ability of the bl tk td model in laboratory solutions as well as in the 32 sites in the seven river basins in china figure s2 the predictive ability

the tk td model considering the main compositions of dom in laboratory solutions 3 1 1 binding between cd ii and organic acids the complex formation curves of cd ii with organic acids are shown in fig 2 the concentrations of cd ii binding abls cd abl were normalized by organic acid mass concentrations as mol g 1 and they increased with increasing cd concentrations cd ii larger molecules such as has or fa likely aggregated at higher concentrations wada et al 2020 yuan et al 2015 and resulted in decreased binding to cd ii however they did not aggregate in the concentration range tested 1 50 mg l 1 indicated by the transparency of the solutions for fa has tt ca ba and ga cd ii addition resulted in significant binding fig 2 low molecular weight organic acids such as ca tt and ga rarely aggregate ged and boyer 2013 and other possible mechanisms should be considered we did not find a proper model to describe these binding curves but we noticed that cd ii binding decreased with the increasing concentrations of the tested low molecular organic acids we tested different concentrations of organic acids in 0 1 m nano3 binding to the two primary cd ii concentrations mm as shown in figure s5 the addition of fa and has resulted in significant amounts of cd ii bound to abiotic acids fa and has were not aggregating in the tested concentration range because the decrease of cd ii was always observed until fa and has concentrations reached 0 012 mm and 0 016 mm respectively however the addition of tt ca ba and ga resulted in a peak valley effect of cd ii concentrations when each abiotic acid and cd ii were in an equimolar ratio the cd ii concentrations decreased to their lowest levels and then increased with increasing concentrations of the acids a similar phenomenon was observed for some low molecular weight organic acids whose concentration dependent complexation with cu ii is obvious because of the homoconjugation negative charge assisted h bonding interactions among organic acid molecules zhao et al 2018 the decreased cd ii organic acid binding was thus correlated to the increased homoconjugation among acid molecules 3 1 2 estimation of parameters jcd max kcdbl kcd out cit and kk in the tk td model as shown in figure s6 after fitting the cd accumulation data jcd max and kcd out were 12 2 0 27 μg g 1 h 1 and 0 061 0 0049 h 1 respectively table 1 cit measures an organism s tolerance to cd but does not reflect a higher risk of death whereas kk measures the rate at which mortality increases when a safe threshold is exceeded ashauer and brown 2008 after fitting the survival data cit and kk were 12 8 1 09 μg g 1 and 1 42 0 24 10 3 g μg 1 h 1 respectively table 1 in traditional blm only one parameter is used to measure the magnitude of toxicity namely the median lethal accumulation la50 corresponding to 50 mortality clifford and mcgeer 2010 or f50 the proportion of metal bound bls corresponding to 50 mortality de schamphelaere et al 2002 la50 and f50 correspond to cit but cit is different 1 la50 or f50 represents the amount of metal bound to bls on the surface of the organism whereas cit represents the amount of metal accumulated in the organism 2 la50 or f50 corresponds to the effective metal concentration ec50 for 50 biological death whereas cit corresponds to the in vivo metal concentration without death nec 3 la50 or f50 is related to exposure time e g larvae exposed to metal for 24 48 72 and 96 h gao et al 2021 whereas cit is independent of time the ligand complexation constant log kcdbl of cd in zebrafish larvae was 5 68 table 2 which was smaller than that reported in several species of fish table s12 including 7 20 in yellow perch perca flavescens niyogi and wood 2004 7 34 in rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss niyogi et al 2008 and 8 6 in pimephales promebs brooks et al 2006 the log kcdbl value reflects the ability of cd to bind to bls and is positively correlated with the toxicity of cd measured as ec50 or lc50 expressed as free ion cd2 concentration or activity ardestani et al 2014 in zebrafish larvae higher log k values were generally observed for more toxic metals such as cu2 7 4 and lower log k values for less toxic metals such as zn2 5 31 gao et al 2017 3 1 3 estimates of parameters log k for h k na ca2 and mg2 in the bl tk td model as shown in figures s7 s11 after fitting the cd accumulation and toxicity data in different k set na set ca set mg set and ph set respectively the log k values for competing cations except h ranged from 3 08 0 06 for na to 4 54 0 02 for ca2 table 2 our estimates were in the range of 3 to 5 as reported in previous blm reports on cd in various fish species ardestani et al 2014 in this study k 2 56e 5 2 05e 4 m did not affect cd accumulation in fish larvae figure s7 whereas na 3 48e 4 8 70e 4 m did figure s8 due to no effect of toxicity mitigation in many cases log k values for na and k are rarely reported for example na 5 4e 4 1 65e 3 m or k 5e 5 1 43e 3 m did not significantly affect cd toxicity in daphnia pulex clifford and mcgeer 2010 and na 6e 5 2 2e 3 m did not affect cd bioaccumulation in rainbow trout gills niyogi et al 2008 however ca2 4 50e 5 2 20e 4 m mg2 4 67e 5 3 38e 4 m and h ph 5 5 7 0 affected cd accumulation in fish larvae figures s9 s11 and log k values for ca2 mg2 and h are often reported brooks et al 2006 de schamphelaere and janssen 2002 niyogi and wood 2004 the log knabl kcabl and kmgbl values were in the range 3 19 5 00 in blm for cd in various aquatic species table s12 competing cations i e na ca2 and mg2 had log k values approximately 1 5 log units lower than that of cd2 table 2 this means that na ca2 and mg2 concentrations need to be at least 1 5 orders of magnitude higher than that of cd2 0 5 μm to satisfy the condition for the competitive accumulation of kcbl ciz kcdbl cd2 and achieve the protective effect of cations see eq 1 we calculated the median lethal concentration of cd at 24 h for different ph k na ca and mg sets table s13 the lc50 of cd increased with increasing cation concentration except k which indicated the protective effect of these cations high concentrations of the major cations themselves did not show toxicity i e no larvae deaths in the corresponding controls although they may alter osmotic pressure in larvae and increase their susceptibility to cd klinck et al 2012 the underlying physiological regulatory mechanism is still unclear and its impact cannot be considered in the current bl tk td model therefore caution should be used when applying the model to water bodies with cation concentrations outside the calibration range of the model as shown in table 2 log khbl 5 22 was close to log kcdbl 5 68 therefore h concentrations need to be close to cd2 concentrations i e ph 7 3 to significantly reduce cd toxicity eqs 2 4 the measured log khbl 5 22 was significantly lower than the corresponding value in fathead minnow larvae 6 7 brooks et al 2006 but was in the log khbl range 4 3 7 6 for other metals in various biological species ardestani et al 2014 the cd species was sensitive to changes in ph but cd2 ions were always the predominant species 50 99 throughout the ph range studied figure s3 furthermore the log khbl value of 5 22 is close to the pka value for the dissociation of thiol sh or amine nh3 groups in weak acids harris 2010 suggesting that bls may have thiol groups 3 1 4 model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis we analyzed the parameter sensitivity of the bl tk td model and showed that the parameters related to accumulation such as jcd max kcdbl and kcd out and toxicity such as cit and kk largely determined the model output figure s12 based on the dynamic energy budget framework billoir et al 2009 kooijman et al 2008 the bio uptake process jcd max and kcdbl was assumed to be the main function for acquiring energy which drives all other functions in an organism moreover cit and kk are the main factors in the td model thus we believe that kk must be accurate and credible throughout the replicates in the toxicity test the bl tk td model is parameterized with data from only one toxicity experiment model parameters are more susceptible to toxicity testing errors therefore higher quality toxicity data need to be calibrated different concentrations of cd in toxicity tests such as 10 and 50 μg l 1 cd theoretically yield similar log kcdbl values when we estimated the parameters of the bl tk td model the initial parameter values may lead to greater uncertainty in their optimized values therefore the jcd max kcdbl and kcd out values from previous studies gao et al 2016 2015 were used as initial parameter values in this study 3 2 validation of the predictive ability of the bl tk td model considering the compositions of dom in laboratory solutions to validate the kinetic bl tk td model in the presence of dom cd toxicity was observed at different concentrations of fa figure s13 increasing the concentration of fa from 0 to 6 48e 5 m resulted in a decrease in the concentration of free cd2 from 1 78e 6 m to 1 30e 6 m so increasing the concentration of fa would reduce cd accumulation in larvae and increase their survival rate the protective effect of dom on cd toxicity was well predicted by the bl tk td model figure s13 as shown in table s14 the median lethal concentration of free cd2 lc50cd 2 at 24 h was positively correlated with fa concentration as the fa concentration increased from 0 to 6 48e 5 m the lc50cd 2 of cd exposed zebrafish larvae at 24 h increased from 3 87 10 6 m to 19 4 10 6 m to validate the kinetic bl tk td model in the presence of dom with different components the concentration of other ions was maintained at a constant value and cd toxicity was measured with an fa ca gradient mixture fa 0 065 0 0016 mm ca 0 0 064 mm as the concentration of free cd2 increases from 5 8e 7 m to 7 5e 7 m increasing the concentration of ca will increase the concentration of cd2 in the exposure solution thereby increasing the accumulation of cd in larvae fig 3 and reducing their survival rate fig 4 the ability of small molecular organic acids such as ca to bind free ions of heavy metals reportedly changes with their concentration zhao et al 2018 one study reported that at low concentrations the negatively charged organic acid easily complexed with cu2 thereby reducing the concentration of free cu2 in the solution11 however at high concentrations the negatively charged organic acid molecules collide and complex together due to charge assisted hydrogen bonding zhao et al 2018 increasing the concentration of free cu2 in the solution which may affect its bioavailability in the water environment this effect results in a difference between the model predicted and actual heavy metal distribution in the water leading to an inaccurate toxicity assessment by the existing blm zhang et al 2017 we speculate that when the concentrations of ca increased the negatively charged ca molecules collided and complexed together increasing the concentration of free cd2 in the solution and eventually increasing the bioavailability of cd in the larvae fig 3 for a certain water body if the doc mainly comes from fa the lc50 of cu in medaka fish predicted using blm was the same as that calculated through experiments wang et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 the fold difference between lc50s was relatively small between 1 3 and 1 5 wang et al 2011 wang and tan 2019 thus the assumption of ha fa 5 5 in the bl tk td model may be safer than ha fa 1 9 which is assumed by the traditional blm niyogi et al 2008 however this study found that the effect of doc composition on the acute toxicity of cd cannot be ignored in the existing bl tk td model 100 doc was assumed to come from fa or 90 10 from fa and ca respectively and the model prediction accuracy was high when both fa and ca are assumed to be 50 the accuracy of model predictions was poorer in natural waters some docs may also originate from non humic organic matter but these may have weaker complexation activities with metals chen et al 2021 su et al 2021 many researchers have been aware of this problem but they simply believe that most docs have metal complexation activities in studying metal complexation in natural waters li et al 2022 to fit the experimental data with a simple and practical complexation model they simply attributed this part of the active doc to fa namely active fa smith et al 2014 in the cu titration experiments of some natural water samples it was found that if active fa constituted 40 80 of the doc the rest of the doc did not have complexation ability and the best agreement was found between the measured and theoretically calculated free cu ion activity values tipping et al 2022 without a better definition of doc composition the assumption that 50 of the doc contributes to metal complexation via active fa can provide the most comprehensive prediction of the types and forms of cu complexed by organic matter craven et al 2012 levit and faustova 2009 according to this assumption the 48 h lc50 value of cu in daphnia magna was accurately predicted in the studied surface water the ratio of predicted to an observed value less than 2 de schamphelaere et al 2002 however domestic and industrial wastewater that is discharged into natural water bodies contains other metal complexing organic pollutants such as edta de luna et al 2020 a more nuanced definition of doc composition in blm is required to accurately predict the toxicity of metals in such wastewater 3 3 validation of the predictive ability of the bl tk td model considering the complexity of dom compositions in field waters 3 3 1 physical and chemical indices of natural water bodies the physical and chemical indices of the 32 water samples from seven river basins across china were very different table s15 in this study the collected water samples were analyzed for the two parameters concerning blm water body cations and doc as shown in figure s14 the hardness of the yellow river basin water was higher than that of other basin waters the doc content in the pearl river basin was the lowest and that in the songhua and huai river basins was the highest among all the sampled basins the concentrations of co3 2 and po4 3 were below the detection limit and not presented table s15 the measured water chemistry indices table s15 and concentrations μg l 1 of metals table s16 in the 32 surface river samples were used for data analysis whenever applicable 3 3 2 molecular weight fractions of dom as shown in figure s15 dom 14 000 da was predominant in the dombulk extracted from samples 1 2 4 14 17 19 and 22 its concentration was 6 30 mg l 1 and accounted for 44 6 of the dombulk the concentrations of dom 1000 da and dom1000 14 000 da in these samples were relatively lower 3 67 mg l 1 and 4 45 mg l 1 respectively accounting for 22 9 and 34 7 of the dombulk respectively in previous studies river water was dominated by large molecular weight dom bekbolet and sen kavurmaci 2015 yang et al 2017 whereas seawater was dominated by small molecular weight dom fox et al 2018 rossel et al 2016 the highest dom1000 14 000 da concentration 6 99 mg l 1 was found in samples 3 and 23 accounting for 50 5 of the dombulk in the water from these rivers dom 1000 da predominated in samples 13 16 21 25 and 28 with concentrations 2 61 mg l 1 accounting for 45 0 of the dombulk dom 14 000 da and dom1000 14 000 da were relatively lesser accounting for 24 0 and 33 0 respectively this confirmed the diversity of dom from different rivers across china 3 3 3 acid base components of dom according to acidity basicity dombulk from the 32 water bodies was divided into six groups and the results are shown in figure s16 the main components of dombulk in samples 6 and 22 were hoa accounting for 20 but it is reported that the hoa content in field rivers did not exceed 12 aslam et al 2013 avsar et al 2014 the highest hob contents were found in samples 14 and 17 accounting for 25 and 27 of the dombulk respectively the highest hon content was in sample 5 accounting for 21 which was similar to the values obtained in the previous studies zhou et al 2010 however this component was hardly detected in dom from other field water bodies peleato et al 2017 yang et al 2013 the hib contents in all samples accounted for 14 30 the hin contents in samples 2 13 16 21 25 28 and 31 accounted for 20 but it was previously reported that this value does not exceed 15 peleato et al 2017 in this study the main components of dombulk in samples 13 16 21 25 and 28 were hia accounting for 28 3 3 4 prediction of cadmium accumulation in natural water bodies the accumulation of cd in zebrafish larvae from natural freshwater rivers was predicted by the bl tk td model in most water samples the accumulation of bioavailable cd calculated by the dgt method was higher than the observed value figure s17 because dgt considers both bioavailable dom complexed cd and bio unavailable dom complexed cd as bioavailable cd the co3 2 and hco3 in all 32 water samples were lower than the limit of detection table s15 therefore there is almost no cd in a carbonate bound state that is not easily bioavailable the accumulation of cd2 predicted by the ise method was generally lower than the observed value figure s18 because ise underestimates cd2 concentration in alkaline conditions ph 8 0 the accumulation of cd2 predicted by ise was in good agreement with the observed values for samples 11 ph 7 45 12 ph 7 47 28 ph 7 63 29 ph 7 65 and 32 ph 7 57 figure s18 the ise method for detecting cd2 was optimum under acidic and weakly alkaline conditions ph 2 0 8 0 for most water samples the bl tk td predicted accumulation of cd2 obtained by wham was in good agreement with the observed values fig 5 the predicted and observed cd accumulation values matched well for samples 1 2 4 8 12 18 19 20 22 23 24 26 27 30 and 32 whereas the observed values of cd accumulation were higher than the predicted values for samples 5 6 7 9 10 13 14 16 17 21 25 and 28 among them samples 13 16 doc 10 46 mg l 1 21 doc 15 02 mg l 1 25 doc 13 71 mg l 1 and 28 doc 17 94 mg l 1 had higher doc content especially small molecular dom and higher hia components as well charge assisted hydrogen bonding may have occurred zhao et al 2018 increasing cd2 content in the water and its accumulation in the larvae samples 14 doc 11 02 mg l 1 and 17 doc 12 2 mg l 1 had high doc content high small molecular dom content and high proportion of hob components besides intake from the water phase the cd adsorbed by the hob substance can enter the organism through the oral pathway chen et al 2017 and thus increase the absorption flux of cd the situation is complex and beyond the predictable range of the bl tk td model which did not consider food intake in eq 1 based on the bl tk td model the observed cd accumulation in larvae from samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 was lower than the predicted values fig 5 the toxic effect of heavy metals on organisms is mainly manifested in reducing the transport of na in organisms producing poisoning symptoms related to the loss of na from cells wan et al 2008 samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 contained a relatively higher concentration of doc which could enhance the activity of na k atpase promoting the uptake of na and inhibiting the uptake of cd wan et al 2008 in natural freshwater the three humic like components had a similar ability of binding metals large molecular weight dom 14 000 da generally had a higher ability of binding metal ions e g cd2 and cu2 than moderate 1000 14 000 da and small molecular weight dom 1000 da chen et al 2013 however this phenomenon was not true for mercury hg2 where the binding log khgbl was quite variable chen et al 2013 doc is mostly comprised of ha and fa substances which are low molecular weight organic acids containing phenolic hydroxyl carboxyl and alcoholic hydroxyl groups li et al 2015 zhao et al 2018 these groups are considered to be the active binding sites for heavy metals zhao et al 2018 which enhances their migration ability the main functional groups that easily combine with heavy metal ions and their oxides are cooh and oh croue et al 2003 the interaction between doc and cd mostly goes through two stages zhang et al 2014 1 the ion exchange reaction dom combines cd2 to form a compound and releases h from the functional group at the same time however the compounds of dom and cu formed at this time are soluble therefore the concentration of dom in the solution remains unchanged 2 all functional groups such as cooh and oh in dom react completely with cd and the dom and cd compounds formed at this time continue to combine with cu dom complexes to form high molecular weight polymers when the molecular weight is large enough precipitation occurs and the precipitate is removed from the water phase to the bottom in addition comparing the ca mg dom complex with the cd dom complex shows that ca and mg at high concentrations are preferentially bound by the cooh sites of dom lu and allen 2002 increasing the concentration of cd2 in solution the observed values of cd accumulation in larvae from sample 14 ca2 4 47 mm and mg2 7 23 mm table s15 were higher than the predicted values 3 3 5 prediction of cadmium toxicity in natural water the survival rate of larvae in natural freshwater rivers was predicted based on the bl tk td model in most water samples the survival rate predicted by the dgt method was generally lower than the observed value figure s19 whereas that obtained by the ise method was generally higher than the observed value figure s20 using wham calculations the predicted survival rates for half of the 32 water samples were in good agreement with the observed values whereas those for the other samples i e 1 3 5 9 11 and 12 were overestimated fig 6 the most pronounced overestimation occurred in samples 1 and 3 both of which had high doc concentrations 6 7 and 6 9 mg l 1 respectively probably due to a simulation error by visual minteq 3 1 in the amount of cd complexed by dom in natural water bodies the complexing capacity of native dom was lower than that of the two commercial fas and cas the dom in water bodies is quite different from the dom used to calibrate the bl tk td model gustafsson and kleja 2005 the complexation effect of dom in natural waters needs to be understood and the application of the bl tk td model to assess the toxicity of natural water will underestimate the true risk the observed and the model predicted survival rates of zebrafish larvae agreed well for samples 1 2 4 8 9 12 14 17 18 19 20 22 23 24 26 27 30 and 32 fig 6 as the content of large molecular weight dom and hob components in samples 14 doc 11 02 mg l 1 and 17 doc 12 2 mg l 1 were high the bioaccumulation of cd in the larvae was greater these components adsorb cd in the solution and enter the digestive tract of zebrafish larvae through drinking water they are not completely absorbed by the larval intestines and cannot pass through the intestinal barrier to enter the bloodstream and produce toxicity cronholm et al 2011 pittinger and pecquet 2018 therefore they do not lead to higher toxicity and are eventually excreted in the feces bruinink et al 2015 based on the bl tk td model the observed values of cd survival rate in larval fish in samples 3 11 15 29 and 31 were higher than the predicted values fig 6 probably due to the high proportion of hin contents in these river sites 20 which affected the proportion between detoxified cd nontoxic dose and metabolically available cd toxic dose in larvae dom decreased the absorption of cd in the rat intestine isolated metabolically available cd and increased the proportion of detoxified cd glynn 1995 in the future the accuracy of modeling can be improved by incorporating the detoxified cd and metabolically available cd as a two compartment model into the current bl tk td model tan and wang 2012 based on the model prediction the observed values of survival rate of larvae exposed to cd in samples 5 6 7 10 13 16 21 25 and 28 were lower than the predicted values fig 6 the observed accumulation of cd in these samples increased fig 5 causing the survival rate to decrease 3 3 6 calculation of lc50 using kinetic blm we were able to predict the time course of cd bioaccumulation and the survival upon exposure to specific cd concentrations and hydro chemical conditions conversely we were able to calculate the cd concentration that resulted in 50 mortality after t h of exposure i e t h lc50 which was not necessarily the same duration 96 h used for model calibration most of the calculated 24 48 72 and 96 h lc50 values were in the range of 1 11 10 4 0 521 mg l 1 table s17 for sites with higher concentrations of competing cations dom and especially lower ph samples 2 9 14 15 16 and 17 the calculated lc50 values will be higher the predicted 24 h lc50 values 0 138 0 446 mg l 1 were lower than the 96 h lc50 values 0 743 1 17 mg l 1 for turquoise killifish larvae but close to the 24 h lc50 values for chameleon cichlid larvae 0 152 mg l 1 in the ecotox database table s18 the predicted 48 h lc50 values 0 039 0 125 mg l 1 were close to the corresponding values for fathead minnow larvae 3 54 10 2 6 35 10 2 mg l 1 but lower than those for acrossocheilus paradoxus larvae 0 370 mg l 1 and turquoise killifish larvae 0 583 mg l 1 the predicted 72 h lc50 values 0 005 0 018 mg l 1 were lower than those for turquoise killifish larvae 0 393 0 412 mg l 1 the predicted 96 h lc50 values were lower than those for zebrafish larvae 0 122 5 44 mg l 1 and nothobranchius furzeri 0 283 0 391 mg l 1 table s18 the 96 h lc50 predicted using kinetic bl tk td was very close to the cd toxicity statistics endpoint mortality of several fish species etheostoma fonticola 96 h lc50 of 1 18 10 2 1 57 10 2 mg l 1 cyprinus carpio 5 10 10 3 mg l 1 and oreochromis mossambicus 3 48 10 2 mg l 1 the contents of dom 1000 da dom1000 14 000 da and dom 14 000 da and the contents of hoa hon hob hia hib and hin had no obvious dose response relationship with the predicted lc50 at different time points figures s21 s28 the predicted and observed lc50 values deviated in some cases rmse 7 60e 5 0 088 during the 96 h exposure to cd in the 32 samples figure s29 the current model does not consider dom components with unknown structures and the ability to complex metals in natural waters with increasing hia concentrations the lc50 values gradually increased to a peak and then decreased fig 7 the peak of lc50 appeared when the hia concentration was 3 55 0 44 mg l 1 which was similar to the finding that 2 5 mg l 1 doc may effectively increase the acute toxicity of cu in a euryhaline clam potamocorbula laevis chen et al 2017 3 4 advantages of the kinetic bl tk td model the first advantage of bl tk td is that it requires fewer toxicity experiments and testing organisms using traditional methods a cd blm was developed using 22 tests and 3520 daphnias clifford and mcgeer 2010 in contrast we developed the cd bl tk td model using only a few toxicity tests one test for each cation and a few zebrafish larvae typically four to seven toxicity tests are required to estimate ligand complexation constants using traditional blm methods clifford and mcgeer 2010 only one toxicity test is required for the bl tk td method model parameters are estimated simultaneously from multivariate nonlinear fits and variations in multiple water chemistry parameters doc h k na ca2 and mg2 can be mathematically handled and are acceptable toxicity predictions using this model are more accurate because the model is dynamic and can predict effective concentrations of metals under different exposure times and fluctuating concentrations which is expected in natural water bodies the traditional blm can only predict toxic effective concentrations at specific times such as t time ecx lax and fx e g 24 h ec50 la50 and f50 i e the metal concentration that would result in a 50 biological response after exposure jeong et al 2022 however bl tk td is more flexible exposure time itself is an independent variable and can predict the metal concentration that leads to any response i e 0 100 after any exposure time 3 5 limitations of the bl tk td model our refined tk td model considering a wide range of doc concentrations could accurately predict cd toxicity in natural field waters but showed certain limits related to certain doc concentrations 3 55 0 44 mg l 1 the advantage of estimating bl tk td parameters using fewer toxicity tests may compromise model stability thus the model parameters become more susceptible to toxicity testing errors and higher quality toxicity data are needed to estimate parameters in predicting lc50 by bl tk td we assumed that model parameters remain constant over time as the organism grows and develops which cannot be completely correct introducing the growth rate equation into the tk model should be considered in the future gergs et al 2019 toxicity delay effects were not accounted for in the model and the organisms recovered immediately when the internal cd concentration fell below the threshold cit this is one of the reasons why the model predictions did not completely match the observations the functional group structure of each component of dom in the 32 water bodies is still unclear effectively determining the constituents of dom and their structural characteristics using traditional chemical analysis is challenging and the original properties of the components can easily be destroyed and changed during the determination process he et al 2016 in future research spectroscopic analysis techniques such as infrared spectroscopy liu et al 2018 nuclear magnetic resonance seidel et al 2022 etc can be used to nondestructively determine the components and structural characteristics of dom in addition the proportion of dom components could be identified and used to optimize model fit through a concise amount of metal binding by dom in waters this identification procedure was not considered in the bl tk td model we got used to assuming the amount of metal bound by dom without identifying dom compositions and thus the bl tk td fitted the toxicity data poorly consequently it is urgent to incorporate this identification procedure into the current bl tk td to improve the accuracy of modeling 4 implications we could use one toxicity test instead of 5 7 to estimate each log k and develop the bl tk td model consequently saving several resources e g toxicity testing organisms time and lab space our bl tk td model could accurately predict the protective effect of fulvic acid while overestimate the complexing capacity of citric acid the model was also validated in the presence of different dom compositions from 32 natural water bodies in china and could successfully simulate the protective effects of native dom in most cases due to its complexity and heterogeneity and existence with inorganic salts in the aqueous environment at low concentrations the complete qualitative and quantitative characterization of dom in terms of compositions and structures is still not possible although spe separation and enrichment of dom improves the understanding of its composition and bioavailability the low retention rate of spe for strongly polar substances is an obstacle to the complete characterization of dom compositions and structures the distribution characteristics of hardness and doc components in different river basins and their effects on metal accumulation and toxicity should be considered when establishing the metal benchmarks for different river basins to control heavy metal pollution the bl tk td model is not limited to test duration e g 96 h or model output toxicity results lc50 and can predict lcx after any exposure time this flexibility will greatly facilitate the application of the bl tk td model to scientifically determine metal benchmarks for different river basins disclosures
