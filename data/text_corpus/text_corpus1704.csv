8520,study region australia study focus design rainfalls in the form of intensity duration frequency curves are the standard input for most flood studies methods to combine rainfall data across space are required to provide optimal estimates of design rainfalls and constrain their uncertainty this paper robustly investigates the use of a variety of regionalization methods to provide australia wide design rainfall estimates using 8619 high quality rainfall stations the influence of an individual large rainfall event in march 2012 on the regionalised design rainfalls is also investigated to guide decisions on when design rainfall data should be updated following record breaking rainfall events new hydrological insights for the region the optimum approach was found to be circular regions of influence with a size of 500 station years the regions of influence are least biased when defined using spatial proximity and including elevation in the calculating spatial proximity can help to reduce the bias in design rainfall estimates in areas of strong topographic relief the march 2012 rainfall event increased site rainfall quantiles by 14 on average when regionalisation is used the increases were substantially moderated and were within the uncertainty bounds of the design rainfalls it is still not routine to provide uncertainty estimates with design rainfall data but such information is particularly important given likely future changes in extreme rainfalls due to anthropogenic climate change keywords design rainfall regionalisation region of influence 1 introduction design rainfalls commonly known as intensity duration frequency relationships are used by engineers to calculate flood risk and correctly size flood protection and stormwater infrastructure common design standards for such infrastructure include the 1 and 0 5 annual exceedance probability aep events which are used in many parts of the world as flood planning levels plate 2002 it is important that the rainfall totals or intensities associated with these large events are estimated accurately and precisely to enable designs to proceed with known confidence however in many locations rainfall gauges have operated for periods of time shorter than the return periods of interest and there may be many missing records in these cases the uncertainty in the estimates of the events of interest can be very large and the fitted probability distributions poorly constrained madsen et al 2002 to overcome these issues regionalisation is often adopted whereby a number of nearby stations are pooled together to better define the extreme value distribution hosking and wallis 1997 regionalisation has been commonly used in the analysis of regional flood frequency relationships e g burn 1990 haddad and rahman 2012 merz et al 2001 rosbjerg and madsen 1995 and also in design rainfalls madsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 1998 norbiato et al 2007 wallis et al 2007 in both cases the general assumption is that a common probability distribution can be used to describe the data at all the sites in a region possibly with a site specific scaling factor the aim of the regionalisation is to define the parameters of this common probability distribution and then use it for design the regionalisation methods are based around grouping stations together that have similar distributions for the extreme rainfall statistics the grouping increases the amount of data that are available to fit the probability distribution this extra information can lead to increases in both the accuracy and precision of the quantile estimates compared to only using the data from a single site one way to regionalise data is to delineate a number of different regions and assign every station to a region the regions can be defined using geographic coordinates or alternatively defined using other features in either case the clustering seeks to find the stations that are closest to each other in the space of the features used this approach is often referred to as a fixed region approach as the total number of regions is known ways of delineating the regions have also included arbitrary geographic boundaries such as states or counties an alternative approach to the clustering is that each station is located at the centre of its own region of influence roi burn 1990 the roi includes all the neighbours for the station of interest an adjacent station will have its own roi which may be similar but not contain exactly the same subset of stations one of the important questions in either approach is how large the regions should be if the region is too small then there is limited benefit from undertaking the regionalisation on the other hand if the region is too large then the stations included in the region may be too different from each other or the target station and will lead to biases in the fitted probability distribution how big is the optimal region this work seeks to answer this question in the context of daily rainfall data in the regionalisation of streamflow data region sizes of 5y where y is the return period of the quantile of interest have been found to be useful centre for ecology and hydrology 2008 however it is not clear how this translates to rainfall data given the higher spatial density of stations and generally longer record lengths that are available at rainfall gauges compared to streamflow gauges the higher spatial density of stations is likely to lead to more spatial correlations between adjacent gauges reducing the effective independent data available for regionalisation much of the previous work on regionalisation has been related to streamflow measurements where gauged catchments are located relatively far apart compared to the density of daily rainfall gauge networks previous work has also generally focused on regionalisation applied over limited areas estimating design rainfalls at a national scale is a large undertaking and as a result the estimates are not regularly updated for example in australia design rainfalls were estimated in the mid 1980s and were updated in 2013 whilst in the united states atlas 14 design rainfall reports have been issued between 2004 and 2015 replacing atlas 2 estimates from the mid 1970s noaa hydrometeorological design studies center 2016 given these long time frames what happens if a significant rainfall event occurs just after the publication of new design rainfall estimates when data is regionalised how strong is the influence of an individual rainfall event on the design rainfalls in this paper different regionalisation strategies for australia are considered using an extensive network of daily read rainfall gauges and recommendations for deriving design rainfalls are made the impact of isolated historical records on design rainfalls is also considered using techniques that have not previously been tested in a regionalised context information on the data sources are presented in the next section then the different regionalisation strategies that have been considered are described in section 3 finally recommendations are made for regionalisation studies in section 4 2 data a database of daily read rainfall gauges was compiled by the australian bureau of meteorology for the purposes of revising design rainfalls for australia gauges with at least 30 years of data were adopted for this study the annual maximum series ams was extracted for each station based on years where at least 10 months had less than 25 missing data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 suggest that when forming the ams an additional criteria should be implemented that considers the rank of the maximum value in a year that is classified as missing testing this criterion on the dataset for this study only led to small changes 1 in the estimated site quantiles the total number of stations used in determining the optimal regionalisation strategy as discussed here was 8074 the number of stations used in the final design rainfall product was 8619 which included some stations with 20 years of data and some continuous sub daily stations in areas which were sparsely gauged the data from each station was quality controlled using both automated processes and extensive manual checks green et al 2012a the ams data extracted from daily read gauges is expected to underestimate the true 24 h rainfall totals by 10 15 dwyer and reed 1995 the ams values were therefore scaled by 1 15 to create equivalent 24 h rainfall maximums jakob et al 2005 the locations of the 8074 daily rainfall stations used for testing are shown in fig 1 a and b the study period covered the full period of record at each station until the end of 2011 the stations with more than 100 years of data are shown in both panels for reference whilst fig 1b shows the locations of all 8074 gauges the average record length was 65 years and the maximum record length was 156 years it is clear that despite the relatively sparse population densities in many parts of the country the coverage of daily rainfall gauges is relatively good although there are very few gauges located in the arid centre of the country the stations with the longest records tend to be located on the east coast and around adelaide south australia there are few long records in the north west of the country which suggests that regionalisation of the rainfall data in this area will be particularly important shown in the background of fig 1a is the topography of australia the highest elevations are found in the great dividing range and australian alps which run parallel to the eastern and southern coast line relatively large relief is also found in tasmania which has significant impacts on rainfall distribution with large annual rainfall totals occurring in the western part of the island due to the moist air flows from the southern ocean significant orographic effects are known to exist in the coastal hinterland of queensland and new south wales particularly south of cairns fig 1a point 1 and around wollongong fig 1a point 2 regionalisation approaches generally require information on characteristics of the station location other than the rainfalls themselves most previous work is based on streamflow regionalisation studies and have included attributes such as catchment area main stream length and main stream slope burn and goel 2000 flood seasonality burn 1997 cunderlik and burn 2006 and the average annual rainfall and the base flow index for the site jakob et al 1999a jakob et al 1999b in the context of regionalising extreme rainfalls di baldassarre et al 2006 use mean annual rainfall mar to define regions for design rainfall analysis in northern central italy it was found that the roi model based on mar led to unbiased estimates of the design rainfalls although other models were not compared so it is not known if the resulting regions were optimal considering the seasonality of extreme events as a regionalisation parameter is attractive because the event date data used for describing seasonality are generally error free and are thus more robust than magnitude data cunderlik and burn 2006 burn 1997 provides information on defining the statistics for the date of occurrence which can be summarised by the mean date of the ams as well as the variability of all ams dates around this mean in a circular coordinate system the angle θ defines the mean date and a length vector between zero and one reflects the variability around the mean taking a value of zero if all ams events occurred on the same day each year and a value of one if the set of all ams events are evenly distributed across the year for the work here a number of different characteristics were compiled for each station as listed below latitude and longitude elevation distance to the coast slope and aspect of the location mean annual rainfall rainfall seasonality 3 extreme value analysis and regionalisation methods 3 1 adopted regionalisation methodology based on a review of the literature and hydrometeorological knowledge of the drivers of extreme rainfall in australia a number of different approaches were compared in terms of creating the rois these included grouping stations according to geography as well as using the other site characteristics listed above circular rois defined using the distance between stations calculated from the latitude and longitude of each station circular rois defined using the distance between stations calculated in three dimensions from the latitude longitude and elevation by a factor of 1000 the scaled elevation is motivated by the relative importance of the vertical scales compared to the horizontal scale when considering atmospheric dynamics daley 1991 hutchinson 1995 hutchinson and bischof 1983 scaling using a factor of 500 and 2000 was also investigated rois defined using the euclidean distance of a subset of the potential site characteristics a number of different site characteristics for each gauge location have been identified that are known to have possible impacts on rainfall in general and extreme rainfalls in particular it is not known at this stage which of these factors is likely to be the most influential in terms of creating homogenous regions and this is to be investigated in this work using linear regression a best subset selection approach has been used to understand which characteristics are most strongly related to the site l cv the l cv is used for this subset selection as it is more stable than the l skewness and is often used for tests of regional homogeneity hosking and wallis 1997 to ensure that all characteristics have equal weighting then we need to rescale the predictors hastie et al 2009 once the strongest relationships are understood then rois are defined using the euclidean distance between the rescaled site characteristics 3 2 fitting an extreme value distribution in this study the ams has been used to fit the at site and regionalised extreme value distributions the generalised extreme value gev distribution has been shown to be appropriate to describe the behaviour of the ams at the majority of station locations in australia green et al 2012b the method of l moments has been used to fit the at site and regionalised gev distributions hosking and wallis 1997 due to its simplicity and robustness to outliers in the data for each site the mean of the ams l cv and l skewness are estimated for the at site estimates these three statistics are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution using eq 1 where ζ is the location parameter α is the scale parameter κ is the shape parameter and f is the cumulative probability for the rainfall depths x note that in this definition a positive shape parameter κ leads to a gev distribution with an upper bound and a negative shape parameter gives an unbounded gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 the rainfall quantiles are estimated for annual exceedance probabilities aep ranging from 1 in 2 1 in 100 1 x f ξ α 1 log f κ κ κ 0 for the regionalisation once the members of the roi have been identified the ams values at each station are standardised by dividing by the mean of the ams this allows the growth curves to be combined from all members of the roi the growth curve is a representation of the extreme value distribution scaled to have a mean of one from the scaled data the l cv and l skewness are calculated and the weighted average l cv and l skewness are calculated using all stations in the roi the weighting factor is the inverse of the station data length i e number of values in the ams hosking and wallis 1997 the average l cv and l skewness are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution for the regionalised growth curve this growth curve can then be rescaled by the mean of the ams at the station of interest or by the average of all the stations in the roi in a full leave one out cross validation approach 3 3 evaluation in this work a leave one out cross validation approach is adopted such that the station at the centre of a roi is not included in the regionalisation and then the regionalised quantiles are compared to the at site quantiles for that site the pooled uncertainty measure pum was adopted to summarise the differences between the site and regionalised quantile estimates kjeldsen and jones 2009 as shown in eq 2 2 p u m t i 1 m h i ln z t i ln z t i r 2 i 1 m h i 1 2 where zt i is the at site quantile for the t year return period i e 1 in t aep based on the growth factor for the ith gauge or catchment in the case of the implementation by kdjeldsen and jones 2009 the superscript r indicates the regionalised growth factor and hi is the weight assigned to the ith catchment the weight assigned to each station is defined as 3 h i n i 1 n i 16 where ni is the record length in years for each station such that long record length sites have more influence when calculating the pum the optimal weights vary with return period so the divisor 16 is a compromise suitable for all return periods this error statistic represents the average quantile difference in log space which reduces the influence of the sites with high rainfall totals and is weighted by the record length at a station so errors at sites with long records contribute more to the pum estimate than shorter record sites the pum can be calculated for each quantile separately to understand how the shape of the probability distributions influences the estimates for rare events compared to more frequent extremes the bias of the rainfall quantiles for each aep was also calculated 3 4 influence of individual rainfall events on regionalised estimates in march 2012 a significant rainfall event occurred across south eastern australia with multi day accumulations breaking records at a number of stations as shown in fig 2 the rainfall was due to a slow moving low pressure trough and led to flooding in new south wales and victoria the event was particularly interesting because record high rainfalls were experienced over a wide geographic area it is therefore useful to assess how including it in the regionalisation of design rainfalls affects the quantile estimates the maximum rainfall at each station in 2012 was added into the ams used in the previous analyses to automate this analysis the 2012 rainfall estimates were extracted at each gauge location from the gridded australian water availability project awap rainfall product the site and regionalised quantiles were then re estimated and the differences resulting from the march 2012 event were calculated 4 results 4 1 optimum region size using the simplest regionalisation approach of rois based on latitude and longitude the influence of region size on the predictive uncertainty has been explored using all 8619 stations the cross validation of the results has been undertaken in two ways in fig 3 a the results are based on validating the quantiles estimated from the regionalisation in fig 3b the growth curves are validated i e prior to scaling by the mean of the ams in both cases as expected small region sizes lead to high predictive uncertainty because there is too much variance between individual stations when applied in the leave one out cross validation framework the immediate neighbour may not be closely related to the station of interest due to different periods of record or sampling errors it is only when more stations are included in the regionalisation that the fitted distribution becomes more representative of the site of interest however there is a limit to this behaviour once the regions become too large and the pooled stations are too dissimilar to the station of interest evaluating over the quantiles fig 2a tends to preference smaller regions than when just the regionalised growth curves are considered this suggests that there is more similarity within the regions in terms of the shape of the curve than there is in the mean ams values for the application of revising design rainfalls where the regionalised gev parameters are only required at station locations then it is considered more appropriate to select the region size based on the regionalised growth curve results fig 3b rather than the regionalised quantiles fig 3a thus a region size of 500 years is adopted the roi size considered in fig 3 is the cumulative number of years of data from all stations in the roi another alternative to defining the region size is simply the number of stations included in the roi the pattern is broadly the same as when the calculations are done with the number of years and it was found that 8 stations minimise the pum given that the average station length is 66 years then a total of 528 years corresponds to an average of 8 stations per region which matches relatively well with results shown in fig 3 the advantage of using the station years approach is that it can account for regions with generally shorter records and maintain similar predictive uncertainty compared to using a fixed number of stations to define the region in fig 4 the distance required to satisfy the 500 station year criterion at each location is shown the roi approach inherently accounts for station density when station densities are low the required region size will be larger in australia most areas with low station densities for daily rainfall data tend to occur in areas with relatively smooth climate patterns so it is considered that the larger distances involved in the regionalisation are not a significant issue the only exception is in the cape york area where there are few gauges and the tropical climate leads to large convective events and tropical cyclones which tend to introduce a lot of spatial variability without additional gauging it is not possible to address this problem this highlights the importance of presenting uncertainty bounds with all design rainfall information to ensure that practitioners are aware of these issues in fig 5 a the impact of regionalisation on the shape parameter of the gev distribution is shown it is clear that after regionalisation very small and very large shape parameters have been moderated the gev distribution definition of hosking and wallis 1997 has been used in this study such that the positive shape parameter κ gives a gev distribution with an upper bound and a negative shape parameter gives an unbounded gev distribution positive shape parameters tend to occur at stations with short periods of record as shown in fig 5b and there is much more variability in shape parameters for short record length both negative and positive than for longer record lengths stations consistent with the findings of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 although there is obviously a physical maximum amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold c f probable maximum precipitation giving a theoretical reason for a bounded distribution this in general is a far larger amount than the 1 in 100 aep rainfall quantile thus it seems reasonable for the moderate extremes considered for design rainfalls that the unbounded gev distribution is more appropriate and this is much more likely to occur after regionalising the rainfall data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 find that only 10 of stations with more than 100 years of data are fitted with bounded distributions defined using a negative shape parameter in their study and extrapolate this relationship to suggest that if stations had more than 226 years of data bounded distributions would not occur they propose that the bounded gev distribution reverse weibull should not be fitted to rainfall data and instead if a bounded distribution is suggested by the data it should be replaced with a gumbel distribution shape parameter of zero or the asymptotic estimate of the shape parameter of 0 114 note sign change compared to eq 1 a bayesian framework to fit the distributions could be useful approach to implement this approach in a flexible framework with a prior based on the asymptotic estimates of the shape parameter based on the optimum region size the impacts of regionalisation on individual rainfall quantile estimates are shown in fig 6 the average bias between the site and regionalised estimates is 1 and 90 of stations have a bias of less than 30 although it is clear that at some stations the biases are much larger than this fig 6a and b regionalisation tends to moderates the very largest rainfall quantile estimates consistent with reduced range of shape parameters fig 5a in fig 6c the fitted gev distribution for an individual station 032064 are shown this station has the largest change in its 1 in 100 aep estimate after regionalisation of all stations it is clear that at this station there is a lot of scatter around the fitted gev distribution particularly for the more extreme values this station has a reasonably short record length less than 40 years and the gev fit is biased by the number of low values and leads to a shape parameter of 0 18 after regionalisation the shape parameter is 0 04 in fig 6d the fitted gev distribution for station 070036 is shown which has the smallest difference between the site and regionalised quantile estimates for all stations in this case there is quite a long record and the site gev provides a good fit which is very similar in shape to the regionalised growth curve leading to small differences in the quantile estimates using the 500 station year regions testing was also carried out on whether the gev distribution provided the best fit for the regionalised data it was found that the gev distribution was appropriate at almost 90 regions which was a larger percentage of regions than any of the other four distributions tested namely the generalised logistic generalised normal generalised pareto and pearson type iii using the definitions of hosking and wallis 1997 regions where the gev is not appropriate are scattered across australia although they do tend to cluster together in small areas however as a continent wide regionalisation strategy is required the gev has been used for all regions 4 2 impact of different roi definitions in this section results from a number of different roi formation methods are compared the most simple is the case presented in the previous section based on the location of each station defined in two dimensions latitude and longitude three more cases considered the location in three dimensions with different scaling factors on the elevation the relationship between region size and errors is consistent whether elevation is included in the region definition or not in general including the third dimension in the regionalisation definition does not improve the prediction errors either pum or rmse and has no impact on the bias of the regionalised estimates as shown in table 1 for the optimum 500 year region size increasing the influence of the elevation term by increasing the scaling factor is also not recommended the results presented in table 1 are continent wide averages in the context of mapping extreme rainfall surfaces johnson et al 2016 found that continent wide optimisation does not always lead to the best outcomes in areas of high topographic relief thus to check the importance of elevation in regionalisation the results have been isolated for two areas where orographic effects are known to be important the areas south of cairns point 1 in fig 1a and around wollongong point 2 in fig 1a have been chosen to assess the sensitivity of the regionalisation choices where the topography is highly varied as shown in table 2 for all of australia over 50 of stations are located at an elevation less than 200 m for the two areas of sensitivity analysis there are far more stations located at higher elevations around wollongong the escarpment is so steep that there are only a limited number of stations at elevations between 200 m and 500 m in table 3 the results of the regionalisation including elevation are presented including elevation in the regionalisation improves all statistics for the wollongong study area close to the coast i e close to sea level including elevation slightly degrades the regionalisation results with increases in both pum and bias around cairns however at mid elevations including the elevation data leads to reductions in bias for all exceedance probabilities and generally improves the pum estimates as well different weights for the elevation data were also tested but did not lead to further improvements these results suggest that for the relatively flat coastal strip around cairns picking the closest stations leads to the best regionalisation results on slopes where orographic effects may become more important there is value in ensuring that the effects of elevation are incorporated into the regionalisation these locations tend to be located in the upper parts of relatively heavily populated coastal catchments it is therefore important that the rainfall gradients are correctly assessed to ensure that infrastructure is properly sized this becomes even more important when considering that these catchments have very short response times in the order of just a couple of hours so that flood warnings are difficult to issue with sufficient lead times hapuarachchi et al 2011 4 3 non geographic groupings for rois as listed in section 2 there are a number of other site characteristics that may be useful in determining neighbours for the rois linear regressions were constructed between each of the characteristics and site l cv backward best subset selection using the akaike information criterion aic was then used to reduce the number of predictors and understand which characteristics are most strongly related to the site l cv the results from the best subset selections are shown in table 4 which identifies the characteristics that provide the optimal regression model of each size mean annual rainfall is the most useful predictor in determining l cv followed by the latitude of the station the r2 values are comparable to those found for linear regressions to predict l cv for flood frequency analyses in the united kingdom jakob et al 1999b kjeldsen and jones 2009 the strong rainfall gradients moving away from the coast are reflected in the importance of the distance to the coast characteristic the seasonality of the ams is only a moderately important predictor and this is likely because the latitude characteristic already provides discrimination between sites as australia s seasonal rainfall climatology is strongly related to latitude ten fold cross validation of each regression model with 1 9 predictors suggests that prediction errors are quite similar for models with at least 3 predictors to the full regression model 9 predictors thus rois have been tested using 3 site characteristics mar latitude and distance to the coast as well as the set of all 9 site characteristics these rois can then be compared to the geographic rois defined in the previous section using pum and bias the results are shown in fig 7 when considering the error in the estimated quantiles using pum fig 7a the rois defined using geographic proximity provide much better regionalisation results than either of the options using other site characteristics the difference in the quantile errors discussed in the previous section when using elevation in the circular roi is very small compared to the difference between the geographic and non geographic roi definitions the median relative bias leads to slightly different conclusions with the circular rois including elevation providing better estimates than using all the non geographic measures particularly for the more frequent events the three predictor model also performs well in terms of relative bias for the 1 in 100 aep event there is not much difference in the median bias estimates between the four methods however a review of the distribution of all bias estimates for this event shows that the spread of bias is larger for the non geographic measures standard deviation all 0 30 and mld 0 29 compared to the circular roi standard deviation 0 26 4 4 influence of individual rainfall events on regionalised estimates the march 2012 daily rainfall event is shown in fig 8 highlighting stations where the daily rainfall was the highest on record and also those stations where the march 2012 rainfall was within 80 of the highest rainfall on record at that location the strong band of record and near record rainfalls is clear through northern victoria and southern new south wales in this region 123 stations had their largest daily rainfall on record during this event the ratio of the march 2012 rainfall to the previous record rainfall at each station is shown in fig 8b compared to the number of years of data in the ams at each station at some locations the march 2012 rainfall event was almost double the highest rainfall previously experienced there is no clear relationship between record length and the relative size of the march 2012 event compared to the previous ams maximum fig 8b highlighting its significance in the instrumental period in fig 9 the effect of including the march 2012 event in the fitted gev distributions at all sites is assessed four estimates are made for each aep event at each station the at site estimate using the ams with march 2012 added in at site estimates using the ams without march 2012 a regionalised estimate based on 500 years of data including march 2012 rainfall and finally a regionalised estimate based on 500 years of data not including the march 2012 rainfall event for each aep the ratio of the two at site estimates is shown fig 9 against the ratio of the two regionalised estimates for sites where the march 2012 event was the highest on record ratios greater than 1 indicate that including the march 2012 event has increased the estimated rainfall quantile for the smallest events 1 in 2 aep and 1 in 5 aep the additional data make very little difference to the estimated rainfall quantiles for both at site and regionalised estimates even though fig 9 only shows stations where march 2012 rainfall was the highest on record at some locations these additional data have led to small decreases in the 1 in 2 aep event this is due to changes in the shape parameter of the gev distribution which have pulled down the lower quantile estimates whilst increasing the higher quantiles for the less frequent events the additional data always lead to increases in the estimated rainfall quantiles all ratios greater than 1 however once the design rainfalls are regionalised these increases are substantially moderated for most sites for the 1 in 100 aep event the average increase in the at site estimates was 14 after including the march 2012 event whilst for the regionalised estimates it was 10 how do these results compare to sites where the 2012 rainfall totals were not the highest on record including the maximum daily rainfall from 2012 i e including another year of data in the ams at all 8074 stations leads to an average change of 0 2 for both the at site estimates and regionalised estimates fig 10 shows the relationship between the ratio of 2012 rainfall total to the maximum of the ams against the percentage change in the 1 in 100 aep rainfall quantile the vast majority of stations experience changes of 2 in the regionalised quantile estimate which is well within the natural variability seen in ams rainfall time series a simple local linear regression has been fitted to the data in fig 10 which shows that adding an additional year of data never leads to large decreases in the quantile estimate all less than 5 even when the additional maximum rainfall is particularly small as evident from fig 9 when the additional year of data is the largest on record x value greater than one the regionalised estimate is always larger than that made without 2012 data but the regionalisation moderates the increase such that increases of 50 in the maximum ams only lead to increases of 15 in the 1 in 100 aep quantile station 075114 shown in red in fig 10 represents this general result and the fitted gev distributions at this station are shown in fig 11 station 075114 was open from 1889 to 1939 and had 42 years of data in its ams which is shorter than the average record length of 65 years for all stations when the site data was used to fit the gev distribution the shape parameter was slightly positive κ 0 066 leading to an upper bound on the quantile estimates which is quite typical for relatively short record lengths adding an estimate of the 2012 rainfall event at this location leads to quite large changes in the quantile estimates because the shape parameter becomes negative κ 0 073 leading to an unbounded distribution using bootstrap resampling to estimate the confidence limits on both these estimates efron and tibshirani 1993 it is clear that the new expected values for the quantiles are actually consistent with the pre 2012 ams distribution lying inside the shaded red area in fig 11a the introduction of the large 2012 rainfall event substantially increases the uncertainty associated with the fitted distribution particularly on the upper confidence limit the 95th percentile for the 1 in 100 aep increases from 131 9 mm to 183 3 mm regionalisation stabilises these effects with both regionalised distributions pre 2012 and including 2012 having negative shape parameters and substantially narrower confidence limits the regionalised increases due to the 2012 event are still quite large however they lie within the confidence limits of the pre 2012 data this illustrates the importance of providing uncertainty information along with design rainfall data to allow practitioners to effectively estimate risks from rainfall uncertainty alongside as the other data and modelling choices included in flood assessments increasingly uncertainty estimation is becoming important in flood design and flood forecasting although there considerable work is still required in many jurisdictions to translate uncertainty methods from research into operational practice 5 conclusions the results presented here demonstrate the value of regionalisation in estimating design rainfalls the design of the study has allowed a number of distinct questions to be addressed which will be useful in future studies using regionalisation despite extensive validation of more complex methodologies it was shown that circular regions of influence with approximately 500 years of station data lead to the best balance between reducing uncertainty and bias in the design rainfall estimates which confirms earlier findings from streamflow regionalisation studies although non geographic factors are conceptually attractive in defining region membership it is shown that the resulting estimates are more biased than when simple geographic proximity is used to define the regions some small benefits are obtained by considering geographic proximity including elevation finally the impact of a single regionally significant rainfall event on continent wide design rainfalls was shown to be quite large at particular stations regionalisation moderates these increases and although the general pattern was for increased design rainfalls the increases generally were within the uncertainty of the design rainfalls estimated without the 2012 event this shows that for engineering design based on design rainfalls to be robust it is uncertainty bounds on the rainfall estimates should be provided to practitioners along with additional guidance on decision making under uncertainty acknowledgements the quality controlled daily rainfall data

are required to provide optimal estimates of design rainfalls and constrain their uncertainty this paper robustly investigates the use of a variety of regionalization methods to provide australia wide design rainfall estimates using 8619 high quality rainfall stations the influence of an individual large rainfall event in march 2012 on the regionalised design rainfalls is also investigated to guide decisions on when design rainfall data should be updated following record breaking rainfall events new hydrological insights for the region the optimum approach was found to be circular regions of influence with a size of 500 station years the regions of influence are least biased when defined using spatial proximity and including elevation in the calculating spatial proximity can help to reduce the bias in design rainfall estimates in areas of strong topographic relief the march 2012 rainfall event increased site rainfall quantiles by 14 on average when regionalisation is used the increases were substantially moderated and were within the uncertainty bounds of the design rainfalls it is still not routine to provide uncertainty estimates with design rainfall data but such information is particularly important given likely future changes in extreme rainfalls due to anthropogenic climate change keywords design rainfall regionalisation region of influence 1 introduction design rainfalls commonly known as intensity duration frequency relationships are used by engineers to calculate flood risk and correctly size flood protection and stormwater infrastructure common design standards for such infrastructure include the 1 and 0 5 annual exceedance probability aep events which are used in many parts of the world as flood planning levels plate 2002 it is important that the rainfall totals or intensities associated with these large events are estimated accurately and precisely to enable designs to proceed with known confidence however in many locations rainfall gauges have operated for periods of time shorter than the return periods of interest and there may be many missing records in these cases the uncertainty in the estimates of the events of interest can be very large and the fitted probability distributions poorly constrained madsen et al 2002 to overcome these issues regionalisation is often adopted whereby a number of nearby stations are pooled together to better define the extreme value distribution hosking and wallis 1997 regionalisation has been commonly used in the analysis of regional flood frequency relationships e g burn 1990 haddad and rahman 2012 merz et al 2001 rosbjerg and madsen 1995 and also in design rainfalls madsen et al 2002 nguyen et al 1998 norbiato et al 2007 wallis et al 2007 in both cases the general assumption is that a common probability distribution can be used to describe the data at all the sites in a region possibly with a site specific scaling factor the aim of the regionalisation is to define the parameters of this common probability distribution and then use it for design the regionalisation methods are based around grouping stations together that have similar distributions for the extreme rainfall statistics the grouping increases the amount of data that are available to fit the probability distribution this extra information can lead to increases in both the accuracy and precision of the quantile estimates compared to only using the data from a single site one way to regionalise data is to delineate a number of different regions and assign every station to a region the regions can be defined using geographic coordinates or alternatively defined using other features in either case the clustering seeks to find the stations that are closest to each other in the space of the features used this approach is often referred to as a fixed region approach as the total number of regions is known ways of delineating the regions have also included arbitrary geographic boundaries such as states or counties an alternative approach to the clustering is that each station is located at the centre of its own region of influence roi burn 1990 the roi includes all the neighbours for the station of interest an adjacent station will have its own roi which may be similar but not contain exactly the same subset of stations one of the important questions in either approach is how large the regions should be if the region is too small then there is limited benefit from undertaking the regionalisation on the other hand if the region is too large then the stations included in the region may be too different from each other or the target station and will lead to biases in the fitted probability distribution how big is the optimal region this work seeks to answer this question in the context of daily rainfall data in the regionalisation of streamflow data region sizes of 5y where y is the return period of the quantile of interest have been found to be useful centre for ecology and hydrology 2008 however it is not clear how this translates to rainfall data given the higher spatial density of stations and generally longer record lengths that are available at rainfall gauges compared to streamflow gauges the higher spatial density of stations is likely to lead to more spatial correlations between adjacent gauges reducing the effective independent data available for regionalisation much of the previous work on regionalisation has been related to streamflow measurements where gauged catchments are located relatively far apart compared to the density of daily rainfall gauge networks previous work has also generally focused on regionalisation applied over limited areas estimating design rainfalls at a national scale is a large undertaking and as a result the estimates are not regularly updated for example in australia design rainfalls were estimated in the mid 1980s and were updated in 2013 whilst in the united states atlas 14 design rainfall reports have been issued between 2004 and 2015 replacing atlas 2 estimates from the mid 1970s noaa hydrometeorological design studies center 2016 given these long time frames what happens if a significant rainfall event occurs just after the publication of new design rainfall estimates when data is regionalised how strong is the influence of an individual rainfall event on the design rainfalls in this paper different regionalisation strategies for australia are considered using an extensive network of daily read rainfall gauges and recommendations for deriving design rainfalls are made the impact of isolated historical records on design rainfalls is also considered using techniques that have not previously been tested in a regionalised context information on the data sources are presented in the next section then the different regionalisation strategies that have been considered are described in section 3 finally recommendations are made for regionalisation studies in section 4 2 data a database of daily read rainfall gauges was compiled by the australian bureau of meteorology for the purposes of revising design rainfalls for australia gauges with at least 30 years of data were adopted for this study the annual maximum series ams was extracted for each station based on years where at least 10 months had less than 25 missing data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 suggest that when forming the ams an additional criteria should be implemented that considers the rank of the maximum value in a year that is classified as missing testing this criterion on the dataset for this study only led to small changes 1 in the estimated site quantiles the total number of stations used in determining the optimal regionalisation strategy as discussed here was 8074 the number of stations used in the final design rainfall product was 8619 which included some stations with 20 years of data and some continuous sub daily stations in areas which were sparsely gauged the data from each station was quality controlled using both automated processes and extensive manual checks green et al 2012a the ams data extracted from daily read gauges is expected to underestimate the true 24 h rainfall totals by 10 15 dwyer and reed 1995 the ams values were therefore scaled by 1 15 to create equivalent 24 h rainfall maximums jakob et al 2005 the locations of the 8074 daily rainfall stations used for testing are shown in fig 1 a and b the study period covered the full period of record at each station until the end of 2011 the stations with more than 100 years of data are shown in both panels for reference whilst fig 1b shows the locations of all 8074 gauges the average record length was 65 years and the maximum record length was 156 years it is clear that despite the relatively sparse population densities in many parts of the country the coverage of daily rainfall gauges is relatively good although there are very few gauges located in the arid centre of the country the stations with the longest records tend to be located on the east coast and around adelaide south australia there are few long records in the north west of the country which suggests that regionalisation of the rainfall data in this area will be particularly important shown in the background of fig 1a is the topography of australia the highest elevations are found in the great dividing range and australian alps which run parallel to the eastern and southern coast line relatively large relief is also found in tasmania which has significant impacts on rainfall distribution with large annual rainfall totals occurring in the western part of the island due to the moist air flows from the southern ocean significant orographic effects are known to exist in the coastal hinterland of queensland and new south wales particularly south of cairns fig 1a point 1 and around wollongong fig 1a point 2 regionalisation approaches generally require information on characteristics of the station location other than the rainfalls themselves most previous work is based on streamflow regionalisation studies and have included attributes such as catchment area main stream length and main stream slope burn and goel 2000 flood seasonality burn 1997 cunderlik and burn 2006 and the average annual rainfall and the base flow index for the site jakob et al 1999a jakob et al 1999b in the context of regionalising extreme rainfalls di baldassarre et al 2006 use mean annual rainfall mar to define regions for design rainfall analysis in northern central italy it was found that the roi model based on mar led to unbiased estimates of the design rainfalls although other models were not compared so it is not known if the resulting regions were optimal considering the seasonality of extreme events as a regionalisation parameter is attractive because the event date data used for describing seasonality are generally error free and are thus more robust than magnitude data cunderlik and burn 2006 burn 1997 provides information on defining the statistics for the date of occurrence which can be summarised by the mean date of the ams as well as the variability of all ams dates around this mean in a circular coordinate system the angle θ defines the mean date and a length vector between zero and one reflects the variability around the mean taking a value of zero if all ams events occurred on the same day each year and a value of one if the set of all ams events are evenly distributed across the year for the work here a number of different characteristics were compiled for each station as listed below latitude and longitude elevation distance to the coast slope and aspect of the location mean annual rainfall rainfall seasonality 3 extreme value analysis and regionalisation methods 3 1 adopted regionalisation methodology based on a review of the literature and hydrometeorological knowledge of the drivers of extreme rainfall in australia a number of different approaches were compared in terms of creating the rois these included grouping stations according to geography as well as using the other site characteristics listed above circular rois defined using the distance between stations calculated from the latitude and longitude of each station circular rois defined using the distance between stations calculated in three dimensions from the latitude longitude and elevation by a factor of 1000 the scaled elevation is motivated by the relative importance of the vertical scales compared to the horizontal scale when considering atmospheric dynamics daley 1991 hutchinson 1995 hutchinson and bischof 1983 scaling using a factor of 500 and 2000 was also investigated rois defined using the euclidean distance of a subset of the potential site characteristics a number of different site characteristics for each gauge location have been identified that are known to have possible impacts on rainfall in general and extreme rainfalls in particular it is not known at this stage which of these factors is likely to be the most influential in terms of creating homogenous regions and this is to be investigated in this work using linear regression a best subset selection approach has been used to understand which characteristics are most strongly related to the site l cv the l cv is used for this subset selection as it is more stable than the l skewness and is often used for tests of regional homogeneity hosking and wallis 1997 to ensure that all characteristics have equal weighting then we need to rescale the predictors hastie et al 2009 once the strongest relationships are understood then rois are defined using the euclidean distance between the rescaled site characteristics 3 2 fitting an extreme value distribution in this study the ams has been used to fit the at site and regionalised extreme value distributions the generalised extreme value gev distribution has been shown to be appropriate to describe the behaviour of the ams at the majority of station locations in australia green et al 2012b the method of l moments has been used to fit the at site and regionalised gev distributions hosking and wallis 1997 due to its simplicity and robustness to outliers in the data for each site the mean of the ams l cv and l skewness are estimated for the at site estimates these three statistics are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution using eq 1 where ζ is the location parameter α is the scale parameter κ is the shape parameter and f is the cumulative probability for the rainfall depths x note that in this definition a positive shape parameter κ leads to a gev distribution with an upper bound and a negative shape parameter gives an unbounded gev distribution hosking and wallis 1997 the rainfall quantiles are estimated for annual exceedance probabilities aep ranging from 1 in 2 1 in 100 1 x f ξ α 1 log f κ κ κ 0 for the regionalisation once the members of the roi have been identified the ams values at each station are standardised by dividing by the mean of the ams this allows the growth curves to be combined from all members of the roi the growth curve is a representation of the extreme value distribution scaled to have a mean of one from the scaled data the l cv and l skewness are calculated and the weighted average l cv and l skewness are calculated using all stations in the roi the weighting factor is the inverse of the station data length i e number of values in the ams hosking and wallis 1997 the average l cv and l skewness are used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution for the regionalised growth curve this growth curve can then be rescaled by the mean of the ams at the station of interest or by the average of all the stations in the roi in a full leave one out cross validation approach 3 3 evaluation in this work a leave one out cross validation approach is adopted such that the station at the centre of a roi is not included in the regionalisation and then the regionalised quantiles are compared to the at site quantiles for that site the pooled uncertainty measure pum was adopted to summarise the differences between the site and regionalised quantile estimates kjeldsen and jones 2009 as shown in eq 2 2 p u m t i 1 m h i ln z t i ln z t i r 2 i 1 m h i 1 2 where zt i is the at site quantile for the t year return period i e 1 in t aep based on the growth factor for the ith gauge or catchment in the case of the implementation by kdjeldsen and jones 2009 the superscript r indicates the regionalised growth factor and hi is the weight assigned to the ith catchment the weight assigned to each station is defined as 3 h i n i 1 n i 16 where ni is the record length in years for each station such that long record length sites have more influence when calculating the pum the optimal weights vary with return period so the divisor 16 is a compromise suitable for all return periods this error statistic represents the average quantile difference in log space which reduces the influence of the sites with high rainfall totals and is weighted by the record length at a station so errors at sites with long records contribute more to the pum estimate than shorter record sites the pum can be calculated for each quantile separately to understand how the shape of the probability distributions influences the estimates for rare events compared to more frequent extremes the bias of the rainfall quantiles for each aep was also calculated 3 4 influence of individual rainfall events on regionalised estimates in march 2012 a significant rainfall event occurred across south eastern australia with multi day accumulations breaking records at a number of stations as shown in fig 2 the rainfall was due to a slow moving low pressure trough and led to flooding in new south wales and victoria the event was particularly interesting because record high rainfalls were experienced over a wide geographic area it is therefore useful to assess how including it in the regionalisation of design rainfalls affects the quantile estimates the maximum rainfall at each station in 2012 was added into the ams used in the previous analyses to automate this analysis the 2012 rainfall estimates were extracted at each gauge location from the gridded australian water availability project awap rainfall product the site and regionalised quantiles were then re estimated and the differences resulting from the march 2012 event were calculated 4 results 4 1 optimum region size using the simplest regionalisation approach of rois based on latitude and longitude the influence of region size on the predictive uncertainty has been explored using all 8619 stations the cross validation of the results has been undertaken in two ways in fig 3 a the results are based on validating the quantiles estimated from the regionalisation in fig 3b the growth curves are validated i e prior to scaling by the mean of the ams in both cases as expected small region sizes lead to high predictive uncertainty because there is too much variance between individual stations when applied in the leave one out cross validation framework the immediate neighbour may not be closely related to the station of interest due to different periods of record or sampling errors it is only when more stations are included in the regionalisation that the fitted distribution becomes more representative of the site of interest however there is a limit to this behaviour once the regions become too large and the pooled stations are too dissimilar to the station of interest evaluating over the quantiles fig 2a tends to preference smaller regions than when just the regionalised growth curves are considered this suggests that there is more similarity within the regions in terms of the shape of the curve than there is in the mean ams values for the application of revising design rainfalls where the regionalised gev parameters are only required at station locations then it is considered more appropriate to select the region size based on the regionalised growth curve results fig 3b rather than the regionalised quantiles fig 3a thus a region size of 500 years is adopted the roi size considered in fig 3 is the cumulative number of years of data from all stations in the roi another alternative to defining the region size is simply the number of stations included in the roi the pattern is broadly the same as when the calculations are done with the number of years and it was found that 8 stations minimise the pum given that the average station length is 66 years then a total of 528 years corresponds to an average of 8 stations per region which matches relatively well with results shown in fig 3 the advantage of using the station years approach is that it can account for regions with generally shorter records and maintain similar predictive uncertainty compared to using a fixed number of stations to define the region in fig 4 the distance required to satisfy the 500 station year criterion at each location is shown the roi approach inherently accounts for station density when station densities are low the required region size will be larger in australia most areas with low station densities for daily rainfall data tend to occur in areas with relatively smooth climate patterns so it is considered that the larger distances involved in the regionalisation are not a significant issue the only exception is in the cape york area where there are few gauges and the tropical climate leads to large convective events and tropical cyclones which tend to introduce a lot of spatial variability without additional gauging it is not possible to address this problem this highlights the importance of presenting uncertainty bounds with all design rainfall information to ensure that practitioners are aware of these issues in fig 5 a the impact of regionalisation on the shape parameter of the gev distribution is shown it is clear that after regionalisation very small and very large shape parameters have been moderated the gev distribution definition of hosking and wallis 1997 has been used in this study such that the positive shape parameter κ gives a gev distribution with an upper bound and a negative shape parameter gives an unbounded gev distribution positive shape parameters tend to occur at stations with short periods of record as shown in fig 5b and there is much more variability in shape parameters for short record length both negative and positive than for longer record lengths stations consistent with the findings of papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 although there is obviously a physical maximum amount of moisture that the atmosphere can hold c f probable maximum precipitation giving a theoretical reason for a bounded distribution this in general is a far larger amount than the 1 in 100 aep rainfall quantile thus it seems reasonable for the moderate extremes considered for design rainfalls that the unbounded gev distribution is more appropriate and this is much more likely to occur after regionalising the rainfall data papalexiou and koutsoyiannis 2013 find that only 10 of stations with more than 100 years of data are fitted with bounded distributions defined using a negative shape parameter in their study and extrapolate this relationship to suggest that if stations had more than 226 years of data bounded distributions would not occur they propose that the bounded gev distribution reverse weibull should not be fitted to rainfall data and instead if a bounded distribution is suggested by the data it should be replaced with a gumbel distribution shape parameter of zero or the asymptotic estimate of the shape parameter of 0 114 note sign change compared to eq 1 a bayesian framework to fit the distributions could be useful approach to implement this approach in a flexible framework with a prior based on the asymptotic estimates of the shape parameter based on the optimum region size the impacts of regionalisation on individual rainfall quantile estimates are shown in fig 6 the average bias between the site and regionalised estimates is 1 and 90 of stations have a bias of less than 30 although it is clear that at some stations the biases are much larger than this fig 6a and b regionalisation tends to moderates the very largest rainfall quantile estimates consistent with reduced range of shape parameters fig 5a in fig 6c the fitted gev distribution for an individual station 032064 are shown this station has the largest change in its 1 in 100 aep estimate after regionalisation of all stations it is clear that at this station there is a lot of scatter around the fitted gev distribution particularly for the more extreme values this station has a reasonably short record length less than 40 years and the gev fit is biased by the number of low values and leads to a shape parameter of 0 18 after regionalisation the shape parameter is 0 04 in fig 6d the fitted gev distribution for station 070036 is shown which has the smallest difference between the site and regionalised quantile estimates for all stations in this case there is quite a long record and the site gev provides a good fit which is very similar in shape to the regionalised growth curve leading to small differences in the quantile estimates using the 500 station year regions testing was also carried out on whether the gev distribution provided the best fit for the regionalised data it was found that the gev distribution was appropriate at almost 90 regions which was a larger percentage of regions than any of the other four distributions tested namely the generalised logistic generalised normal generalised pareto and pearson type iii using the definitions of hosking and wallis 1997 regions where the gev is not appropriate are scattered across australia although they do tend to cluster together in small areas however as a continent wide regionalisation strategy is required the gev has been used for all regions 4 2 impact of different roi definitions in this section results from a number of different roi formation methods are compared the most simple is the case presented in the previous section based on the location of each station defined in two dimensions latitude and longitude three more cases considered the location in three dimensions with different scaling factors on the elevation the relationship between region size and errors is consistent whether elevation is included in the region definition or not in general including the third dimension in the regionalisation definition does not improve the prediction errors either pum or rmse and has no impact on the bias of the regionalised estimates as shown in table 1 for the optimum 500 year region size increasing the influence of the elevation term by increasing the scaling factor is also not recommended the results presented in table 1 are continent wide averages in the context of mapping extreme rainfall surfaces johnson et al 2016 found that continent wide optimisation does not always lead to the best outcomes in areas of high topographic relief thus to check the importance of elevation in regionalisation the results have been isolated for two areas where orographic effects are known to be important the areas south of cairns point 1 in fig 1a and around wollongong point 2 in fig 1a have been chosen to assess the sensitivity of the regionalisation choices where the topography is highly varied as shown in table 2 for all of australia over 50 of stations are located at an elevation less than 200 m for the two areas of sensitivity analysis there are far more stations located at higher elevations around wollongong the escarpment is so steep that there are only a limited number of stations at elevations between 200 m and 500 m in table 3 the results of the regionalisation including elevation are presented including elevation in the regionalisation improves all statistics for the wollongong study area close to the coast i e close to sea level including elevation slightly degrades the regionalisation results with increases in both pum and bias around cairns however at mid elevations including the elevation data leads to reductions in bias for all exceedance probabilities and generally improves the pum estimates as well different weights for the elevation data were also tested but did not lead to further improvements these results suggest that for the relatively flat coastal strip around cairns picking the closest stations leads to the best regionalisation results on slopes where orographic effects may become more important there is value in ensuring that the effects of elevation are incorporated into the regionalisation these locations tend to be located in the upper parts of relatively heavily populated coastal catchments it is therefore important that the rainfall gradients are correctly assessed to ensure that infrastructure is properly sized this becomes even more important when considering that these catchments have very short response times in the order of just a couple of hours so that flood warnings are difficult to issue with sufficient lead times hapuarachchi et al 2011 4 3 non geographic groupings for rois as listed in section 2 there are a number of other site characteristics that may be useful in determining neighbours for the rois linear regressions were constructed between each of the characteristics and site l cv backward best subset selection using the akaike information criterion aic was then used to reduce the number of predictors and understand which characteristics are most strongly related to the site l cv the results from the best subset selections are shown in table 4 which identifies the characteristics that provide the optimal regression model of each size mean annual rainfall is the most useful predictor in determining l cv followed by the latitude of the station the r2 values are comparable to those found for linear regressions to predict l cv for flood frequency analyses in the united kingdom jakob et al 1999b kjeldsen and jones 2009 the strong rainfall gradients moving away from the coast are reflected in the importance of the distance to the coast characteristic the seasonality of the ams is only a moderately important predictor and this is likely because the latitude characteristic already provides discrimination between sites as australia s seasonal rainfall climatology is strongly related to latitude ten fold cross validation of each regression model with 1 9 predictors suggests that prediction errors are quite similar for models with at least 3 predictors to the full regression model 9 predictors thus rois have been tested using 3 site characteristics mar latitude and distance to the coast as well as the set of all 9 site characteristics these rois can then be compared to the geographic rois defined in the previous section using pum and bias the results are shown in fig 7 when considering the error in the estimated quantiles using pum fig 7a the rois defined using geographic proximity provide much better regionalisation results than either of the options using other site characteristics the difference in the quantile errors discussed in the previous section when using elevation in the circular roi is very small compared to the difference between the geographic and non geographic roi definitions the median relative bias leads to slightly different conclusions with the circular rois including elevation providing better estimates than using all the non geographic measures particularly for the more frequent events the three predictor model also performs well in terms of relative bias for the 1 in 100 aep event there is not much difference in the median bias estimates between the four methods however a review of the distribution of all bias estimates for this event shows that the spread of bias is larger for the non geographic measures standard deviation all 0 30 and mld 0 29 compared to the circular roi standard deviation 0 26 4 4 influence of individual rainfall events on regionalised estimates the march 2012 daily rainfall event is shown in fig 8 highlighting stations where the daily rainfall was the highest on record and also those stations where the march 2012 rainfall was within 80 of the highest rainfall on record at that location the strong band of record and near record rainfalls is clear through northern victoria and southern new south wales in this region 123 stations had their largest daily rainfall on record during this event the ratio of the march 2012 rainfall to the previous record rainfall at each station is shown in fig 8b compared to the number of years of data in the ams at each station at some locations the march 2012 rainfall event was almost double the highest rainfall previously experienced there is no clear relationship between record length and the relative size of the march 2012 event compared to the previous ams maximum fig 8b highlighting its significance in the instrumental period in fig 9 the effect of including the march 2012 event in the fitted gev distributions at all sites is assessed four estimates are made for each aep event at each station the at site estimate using the ams with march 2012 added in at site estimates using the ams without march 2012 a regionalised estimate based on 500 years of data including march 2012 rainfall and finally a regionalised estimate based on 500 years of data not including the march 2012 rainfall event for each aep the ratio of the two at site estimates is shown fig 9 against the ratio of the two regionalised estimates for sites where the march 2012 event was the highest on record ratios greater than 1 indicate that including the march 2012 event has increased the estimated rainfall quantile for the smallest events 1 in 2 aep and 1 in 5 aep the additional data make very little difference to the estimated rainfall quantiles for both at site and regionalised estimates even though fig 9 only shows stations where march 2012 rainfall was the highest on record at some locations these additional data have led to small decreases in the 1 in 2 aep event this is due to changes in the shape parameter of the gev distribution which have pulled down the lower quantile estimates whilst increasing the higher quantiles for the less frequent events the additional data always lead to increases in the estimated rainfall quantiles all ratios greater than 1 however once the design rainfalls are regionalised these increases are substantially moderated for most sites for the 1 in 100 aep event the average increase in the at site estimates was 14 after including the march 2012 event whilst for the regionalised estimates it was 10 how do these results compare to sites where the 2012 rainfall totals were not the highest on record including the maximum daily rainfall from 2012 i e including another year of data in the ams at all 8074 stations leads to an average change of 0 2 for both the at site estimates and regionalised estimates fig 10 shows the relationship between the ratio of 2012 rainfall total to the maximum of the ams against the percentage change in the 1 in 100 aep rainfall quantile the vast majority of stations experience changes of 2 in the regionalised quantile estimate which is well within the natural variability seen in ams rainfall time series a simple local linear regression has been fitted to the data in fig 10 which shows that adding an additional year of data never leads to large decreases in the quantile estimate all less than 5 even when the additional maximum rainfall is particularly small as evident from fig 9 when the additional year of data is the largest on record x value greater than one the regionalised estimate is always larger than that made without 2012 data but the regionalisation moderates the increase such that increases of 50 in the maximum ams only lead to increases of 15 in the 1 in 100 aep quantile station 075114 shown in red in fig 10 represents this general result and the fitted gev distributions at this station are shown in fig 11 station 075114 was open from 1889 to 1939 and had 42 years of data in its ams which is shorter than the average record length of 65 years for all stations when the site data was used to fit the gev distribution the shape parameter was slightly positive κ 0 066 leading to an upper bound on the quantile estimates which is quite typical for relatively short record lengths adding an estimate of the 2012 rainfall event at this location leads to quite large changes in the quantile estimates because the shape parameter becomes negative κ 0 073 leading to an unbounded distribution using bootstrap resampling to estimate the confidence limits on both these estimates efron and tibshirani 1993 it is clear that the new expected values for the quantiles are actually consistent with the pre 2012 ams distribution lying inside the shaded red area in fig 11a the introduction of the large 2012 rainfall event substantially increases the uncertainty associated with the fitted distribution particularly on the upper confidence limit the 95th percentile for the 1 in 100 aep increases from 131 9 mm to 183 3 mm regionalisation stabilises these effects with both regionalised distributions pre 2012 and including 2012 having negative shape parameters and substantially narrower confidence limits the regionalised increases due to the 2012 event are still quite large however they lie within the confidence limits of the pre 2012 data this illustrates the importance of providing uncertainty information along with design rainfall data to allow practitioners to effectively estimate risks from rainfall uncertainty alongside as the other data and modelling choices included in flood assessments increasingly uncertainty estimation is becoming important in flood design and flood forecasting although there considerable work is still required in many jurisdictions to translate uncertainty methods from research into operational practice 5 conclusions the results presented here demonstrate the value of regionalisation in estimating design rainfalls the design of the study has allowed a number of distinct questions to be addressed which will be useful in future studies using regionalisation despite extensive validation of more complex methodologies it was shown that circular regions of influence with approximately 500 years of station data lead to the best balance between reducing uncertainty and bias in the design rainfall estimates which confirms earlier findings from streamflow regionalisation studies although non geographic factors are conceptually attractive in defining region membership it is shown that the resulting estimates are more biased than when simple geographic proximity is used to define the regions some small benefits are obtained by considering geographic proximity including elevation finally the impact of a single regionally significant rainfall event on continent wide design rainfalls was shown to be quite large at particular stations regionalisation moderates these increases and although the general pattern was for increased design rainfalls the increases generally were within the uncertainty of the design rainfalls estimated without the 2012 event this shows that for engineering design based on design rainfalls to be robust it is uncertainty bounds on the rainfall estimates should be provided to practitioners along with additional guidance on decision making under uncertainty acknowledgements the quality controlled daily rainfall data

on sub hourly precipitation event descriptors to quantify the changes in precipitation patterns commonly masked in annual analysis precipitation events were derived from 5 min data collected by usda ars from 1961 to 2015 new hydrological insights for the region during the 1962 2015 period this region experienced successive regional long term wet 1962 1995 and dry 1996 2015 dominated periods of more than 20 years each during the wet period precipitation intensity ranging from 1 to 12mm were 20 less likely to occur while event daily average precipitation and number of events increased by 10 and 11 respectively also the average daily precipitation occurred more often at lower intensities in contrast during the dry period instantaneous intensity ranging from 1 to 12mm became more likely to occur 64 increase 1996 2015 while event daily average precipitation and number of events decreased by 16 and 18 respectively overall comparisons with the baseline data 1962 2015 indicated that in the last 20 years sub hourly precipitation intensities have increased while daily event duration and extreme 5 min precipitation intensities larger than 24mm precipitation intensification below extremes have remained unchanged keywords precipitation variability and change climate trends non stationary precipitation little washita river experimental watershed 1 introduction the annual mean precipitation at the global scale is expected to increase by the end of this century with extreme precipitation events becoming more intense and more frequent in some regions ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 the effects of these changes at the local scales are not clearly understood although the evaluation of projected impacts on ecosystems are typically assessed from trends derived from climate observations e g chu et al 2014 and global circulation models gcms scenarios e g jones et al 2005 perry et al 2005 menzel et al 2006 parmesan 2006 mckenney et al 2007 however westra et al 2014 concluded that intensity variability on sub daily extreme precipitation is more sensitive to change especially at hourly and sub hourly scales when compared to daily precipitation studies indicated that precipitation extremes at hourly and sub hourly temporal scale increase non linearly up to twice as fast with rising temperature as it was originally predicted by gcms lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 mishra et al 2012 however there is also evidence that this rate of increase peaks and decreases beyond the approximated daily average surface temperatures of 24 c most likely driven by moisture availability westra et al 2014 and perhaps changing aerosols linked to vegetation changes cloudiness portmann et al 2009 downscaled high spatio temporal precipitation from gcms are in the early stages of development and may be insufficient to represent sub daily precipitation variability required to quantify critical sub kilometer hydrological responses on the other hand long term continuous ground based sub daily precipitation datasets at watershed scale are scarce especially those that encompasses the boundary of the analog and digital era data collection and also includes periods of records of more than 20 years before and after the anomaly departure in global mean temperatures around 1980 gistemp team 2017 nevertheless analysis of long term high temporal resolution precipitation data is needed to reduce the risk of masking climate signals when assessing future scenarios nonetheless the presence of data inconsistencies e g site relocation change in instrumentation must be identified and accounted for before further data analysis is conducted in this study a dataset of 55 years 5 min watershed average precipitation from the little washita river experimental watershed lwrew located in oklahoma part of the southern great plains were used to assess changes in sub daily precipitation patterns the occurrence of drought conditions in this region is mainly tied to precipitation driving soil moisture depletion livneh and hoerling 2016 and associated to sea temperatures anomalies and teleconnections to the southern oscillation enso the pacific decadal oscillation and the atlantic multi decadal oscillation meinke et al 2005 basara et al 2013 cook et al 2015 in 2012 the great plains experienced the most severe seasonal drought in the past 117 years that was mostly linked to natural variations in weather hoerling et al 2014 however projections in the 21st century from both moderate rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 future emission scenarios indicated that drought intensification will likely exceed the most severe megadrought periods of the medieval climate 1100 1300 ce cook et al 2015 moreover it remains unclear how the storms characteristics are changing along the oscillations between the long term regional wet i e periods of 10 or more years with an average precipitation surplus over the historic mean or dry i e periods of 10 or more years with an average precipitation deficit over the historic mean dominated periods the overall goal of this study was to identify and quantify the changes in precipitation patterns during long term wet or dry dominated periods by comparing the changes in the frequency distribution derived from event metrics total precipitation intensity and duration of events at the watershed scale long term 1962 2015 high spatio temporal resolution precipitation data from more than 20 sites in the lwrew were used to derive the frequency distribution analysis on event metrics at the watershed scale this study was aimed to specifically address three important hypotheses 1 storm characteristics most likely result in different precipitation patterns during long term regional dry and wet oscillations periods 2 characteristics of storm frequency intensity and duration have changed in the lwrew in the last 55 years and 3 the changes in precipitation during the period of record were due to physical changes in its patterns rather than data inconsistences in the observations since climate change is projected to impact the spatio temporal precipitation characteristics at local scales an analysis of locally collected high spatio temporal resolution precipitation can elucidate the implications of climate variability and change that may not be detectable from analysis of individual sites or multiple sites reporting only daily monthly or total annual precipitation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lwrew located in central oklahoma fig 1 a is part of a conservation and research effort initiated in 1961 to mitigate soil erosion in 1961 the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars set up 36 stations as part of the southern great plains research watershed sgprw program to monitor climate precipitation air temperature relative humidity etc and hydrological variables e g groundwater levels this research program focused on evaluating basin scale impacts of flood mitigation strategies specifically headwaters flood retarding structures garbrecht et al 2007 and details of the data collection was a primary focus starks et al 2014 considerable efforts were made to characterize precipitation over the watershed as the main driver of frequent floods and soil erosion occurring during extreme precipitation events starks et al 2014 at the end of the sgprw program in 1994 climatological observational networks transitioned to digital technology and consequentially there were changes in data collection protocols in 1978 the lwrew was selected by the usda and the u s environmental protection agency usepa as one of seven national benchmark watersheds to study the effects of land conservation in water quality garbrecht et al 2007 the lwrew drains an area of approximately 620km2 with predominantly rangeland and pastureland use the elevation of the watershed ranges from 300m to 500m above mean sea level the soil textures range from fine sand to silty loam while the exposed bedrock is sandstone average annual temperature in the watershed is 16 c 2 2 precipitation data instrumenting the lwrew started in 1961 with the establishment of 12 gauging stations using the analog belfort 5 780 dual traverse weighing bucket rain gauges belfort instrument baltimore md fig 1b charts from selected stations where later digitized by the usda ars grazinglands research laboratory to produce breakpoint storm event data in 1994 a transition from the analog rain gauges to met one model 280c digital tipping bucket rain gauges metone instruments inc grants pass or begun also the number of stations deployed increased to a total of 35 these stations were also equipped with instruments to measure air temperature relative humidity incoming solar radiation and soil temperature the measurement network is known today as the micronet http ars mesonet org fig 1c additionally a state run network of meteorological stations the mesonet fig 1d also operated four stations in and around the lwrew mcpherson et al 2007 by 1995 all the analog instruments were replaced by digital rain gauges and in time the network was reshaped due to station relocation and decommissioning for a total number of 20 stations today 15 stations were relocated to a nearby watershed in 2004 in general precipitation in the automated networks was sampled and data were recorded at discrete 5 min intervals a more detailed description of the arrangement and changes in the lwrew weather measurement network can be found in starks et al 2014 in addition to the high spatio temporal resolution precipitation data 1961 2015 a long term time series 1900 2015 of total annual precipitation was reconstructed from 16 sites from the national centers for environmental information database https www ncei noaa gov fig 2 the areal total annual precipitation at the lwrew was computed at the centroid of the watershed by the inverse distance weighting interpolator using the coefficient that resulted in the lower average error from cross validation of the observed data spellmap guzman et al 2013 2 3 data processing digitized breakpoint data from the analog charts 1961 1995 were resampled at 1 min time step using linear interpolation between precipitation breakpoints the resulting 1 min dataset was then aggregated to 5 min time step and adjusted to the 0 254mm tipping bucket rain gauge precision by considering only the accumulated precipitation greater than or equal to 0 254mm in a 5 min interval fig 3 if the accumulated precipitation was less than 0 254mm the precipitation was carried over to the next wet 5 min time step the 5 min analog dataset 1961 1995 was then combined with the 5 min digital dataset from the micronet and mesonet networks 1994 2013 guzman et al 2014 to produce a 55 year continuous 5 min dataset fig 3 digital data at 5 min temporal resolution was evaluated for data quality and cross validated with network operation records the 55 year 5 min resolution time series was then used to generate the total annual precipitation and to derive the precipitation events statistical descriptors used for the frequency analysis 2 4 total annual precipitation the complete 5 min precipitation dataset 1961 2015 local dataset and the regional derived 1900 2015 dataset were used to compute the annual total precipitation the local dataset lwrew comprised of sgprs and micronet was used to compute the statistical descriptors of events using spellmap guzman et al 2013 for the total annual precipitation sites with incomplete yearly records less than 363days of records were eliminated for instance the year 1961 was excluded due to incomplete data as well as all sites that were not fully operational for the complete year within the period 1962 2015 following computations of annual total precipitation at each site the time series were used to estimate the time series of precipitation per network at the lwrew centroid using the idw interpolator with the p value that resulted in minimum error using spellmap guzman et al 2013 annual time series were tested for a the presence of serial auto correlation b normality c the presence of trend using the spearman rank correlation and d detection of a change point using the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1986 khaliq and ouarda 2007 a preliminary evaluation for normality conducted on the annual total precipitation indicated that it was normally distributed parametric tests are considered more assertive in detecting changes in normally distributed data than a non parametric test the spearman test is a non parametric test for detection of trend while the snht is a parametric test used to identify time series non homogeneities by assuming the hypothesis of normality both the non parametric t test and f test were used to assess statistical significant changes in mean and variance respectively for all statistical tests conducted on annual time series a 95 confidence limit was used α 0 05 in the presence of serial correlation a pre whitening procedure based on an autoregressive model was used to remove the first serial correlation dependency burn and hagelnur 2002 1 p t 1 p t 1 r p t where p t 1 is the pre whitened series value for time interval t 1 p t the original time series value for time interval t and r is the estimated first serial correlation coefficient 2 5 precipitation events and data metrics the twelve sites that originally comprised the sgwrw network and later become part of the micronet network were used for the computations of precipitation event descriptors 1961 2015 table 1 a precipitation event was defined as a continuous measurable precipitation followed by a single time step with undetectable precipitation on a 5 min temporal resolution thus a precipitation event was identified in all cases in which the accumulated precipitation was greater than 0 254mm and continuously detected followed by one or more time steps of undetectable precipitation less than 0 254mm the 0 254mm precipitation threshold was based on the detectable precipitation limit of the met one tipping bucket instrument deployed in the watershed since 1994 following the event identification event statistical descriptors i e total mean maximum intensity per event and duration of event precipitation were computed at each site precipitation events were time stamped at the beginning of each precipitation event and the average of the statistical descriptor from the 12 individual sites was recorded at the beginning of the earliest site event the mean descriptor was computed as follows 2 α t i 1 n e v e n t i α n where α t is the arithmetic mean of the descriptor e g total precipitation and event duration at time t e v e n t i α is the event statistical descriptor α at site i and n the number of sites in which a precipitation event was detected at time t the precipitation descriptor for event maximum precipitation intensity was defined as the single site 5 min intensity recorded at any time during the event and was computed as follows 3 max t max e v e n t t i were max t is the maximum intensity at time t recorded at site i at 5 min temporal resolution the statistical descriptors were daily aggregated and then results summarized on monthly and yearly temporal scales analyses of relative frequency were performed on a monthly basis using precipitation log scaled bins i e 0 254 0 5 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 254 512mm results were summarized based on the following time series comprising sub hourly data records a 1962 to 2015 to describe the complete observational period baseline b 1962 to 1994 to describe a long term wet dominated period comprising 33 years of data and c 1995 to 2015 to describe a long term dry dominated period comprising 21 years of data the year 1995 was used to split the time series matching the final year of the instrumentation transition due to its proximity from the starting year of the latest long term wet dominated period 1997 it was assumed that the split of the data both represents a the precipitation patterns frequency intensity and duration of long term dry and wet dominated periods and b served to assess data inconsistency in defining the periods for analysis the following concepts were considered into account 1 data must retain continuity due to the assumption that changes are likely associated to dynamics e g global warming land use change etc interlocked to time 2 duration of long term dry or wet periods should be longer than the decadal oscillation and 3 as possible one period must include a year of the instrumentation transition changes in precipitation patterns were assessed by comparing the empirical cumulative frequency distribution ecfd functions derived from the frequency analysis of event descriptors the kolmogorov smirnov test ks t was used to evaluate the statistical significance of change using 95 confidence intervals significant level α 0 05 by identifying if the tested ecfd belong to a different distribution the ks t test statistic dn computes the separation between the two ecfd 4 d m n α m a x x f m x f n x where d m n α is the ks t critical value at given α f m x and f n x are the two ecfd with m and n populations for sufficiently large populations d m n α approximate to 5 d m n α c m n m n where c is the inverse kolmogorov for a given significant level α results from the ks t were used to identify changes in precipitation patterns the event descriptors of daily total precipitation duration and 5 min maximum intensity were first segregated by month and then the ks t was conducted using the multi year average period 1961 2015 as the baseline for comparison for instance the ecfds from the month of january corresponding to the period 1962 2015 was tested against the 1961 1994 and 1995 2015 periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 total annual precipitation depth the multiyear total annual precipitation in the lwrew was estimated at 843 4mm using 54 years of records 1962 2015 maximum and minimum annual precipitation were measured at 1 303 2 2015 and 467 3mm 2011 respectively fig 4 a the annual time series was identified to be normally distributed by the normality test with a non statistically significant auto correlation α 0 05 linear trend spearman test α 0 05 and change point snht analysis of the data set revealed non statistical significance for these tests thus this time series sgrpw micronet were considered stationary during the 54 year period 1972 1997 was predominantly wet with 16 of the 26 years of records with precipitation above the local network annual mean and an average precipitation surplus of 86 53mmy 1 noted that the 1972 1997 surplus mean is not indicated in fig 4b moreover during this period between 1980 and 1997 the lwrew experienced the largest precipitation surplus of the 116 years of record 109 3mmy 1 following this period and between 1998 and 2014 the watershed experienced more frequent annual total precipitation below the local network annual mean 12 of 17 years for an average water deficit of 92 1mmy 1 note that the long term wet and dry periods were defined by the average slope of the cumulated residual curve residuals were estimated using the total annual mean estimated with respect of each network regional or local longer than 10 years with negative or positive slopes indicating dry or wet periods respectively at the regional scale estimated precipitation at the lwrew centroid using the 116 year records 1900 2015 fig 4a exhibited a non statistically significant increasing trend spearman test α 0 05 fig 4a and an average annual precipitation of 825 8mm also the snht test did not detect a statistically significant change point thus this time series regional was also considered to be stationary a comparison of the means of the total precipitation between the two networks during the period 1962 2015 resulted in 6 8mm difference regional based 850 2mm sgprw micronet based 843 4mm this difference in the means are most likely the result of spatial scale interpolation and differences in instrumentation density cumulated residuals from the regional network fig 4b indicated the presence of a long term dry period 72 years 1908 1980 moderated by the occurrence of successive wet or dry sub cycles not longer than 10 years except 1962 1972 11 years during the period 1908 1980 total annual precipitation below the mean was more frequent 40 of 73 years resulting in an average water deficit of 44 2mmy 1 following 1980 annual precipitation was commonly above the total annual mean for an average water surplus of 86 4mmy 1 until the year 2015 with well defined short term wet and dry oscillations between 2000 and 2015 regional network fig 4b comparison of cumulated residuals curves local and regional networks indicates that records from local network includes the wettest 1980 1997 and driest 1998 2015 long term periods relative to the 116 years of records note that the water deficit recorded by the local network during the latest dry period 1998 2015 92 1mmy 1 fig 4c was similar to the long term dry period between 1962 and 1972 93 6mmy 1 fig 4c but smaller than the recorded by the regional network between 1961 and 1972 122 7mmy 1 not indicated in fig 4c also during this period the network transitioned from analog to digital instrumentation and also changes in network operations protocols and data management occurred these differences in the cumulated residuals between the regional and local network sgprw micronet fig 4c were explained by the smoothing effect of spatial and temporal aggregation and interpolation due changes from regional to local scales reports from other indicators and data from the fort cobb reservoir experimental watershed located approximately 65km north west from lwrew corroborate the dry conditions experienced after 1997 in the lwrew contrasting with the wetter pattern from the regional network fig 4b and c as an example of other indicators fig 4d shows the effect of the spatial variability in water deficits reported by the u s drought monitor usdm http droughtmonitor unl edu mapsanddata maparchive aspx note that these areas subjected to water deficit did not follow regular geometrical spatial pattern circles indicate approximately the extent of the local and regional networks 3 2 instrumental transition and bias differences in total annual precipitation between the two networks are indicated in fig 4e this time series was normally distributed normality test α 0 05 with a statistically significant increasing trend spearman α 0 05 and a detected change point in 1987 snht test test for change in means t test α 0 05 and variances f test α 0 05 conducted on split series in 1987 equal length indicates that the changes in variance were non statistically significant while the difference in means was statistically significant t test α 0 05 thus this time series was considered non stationary the detected change point in 1987 seven years prior to the transition from analog to digital instrumentation support the hypothesis that observed differences in precipitation in the lwrew was not driven by change in systematic errors derived from changes in instrumentation and network operation analog to digital period 3 3 number of precipitation events analysis from the number of precipitation events in the lwrew 12 sites are summarized in fig 5 grouped by season differences in the multi year means between the 1962 2015 and 1995 2015 were statistically significant 15 7 vs 13 6 respectively t test α 0 05 with the larger variations found in the winter season followed by fall and spring while differences between the 1962 2015 and 1962 1994 were not statistically significant note that the 1962 2015 period was used as the baseline for comparison at monthly scales table 1 the digital era representing the period dominated by dry years was in general below the expected long term means 1962 2015 except for the month of october similarly the analog period which represent a long term wet period with a wet and dry cycle oscillation follows the average trend with values greater than the expected means except for the month of october winter was the season where the larger average deviation was observed although the largest monthly deviation occurred during the months of september followed by may thus wet and dry oscillation of total annual precipitation correlates with an increase and decrease in the number of events of precipitation respectively where the winter season exhibited larger variability followed by fall and spring and summer the lowest variability 3 4 analysis of event precipitation descriptors figs 6 8 and table 2 summarize the relative frequency analysis and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks t of the event precipitation descriptors reported on monthly basis and grouped by seasons note that for the analysis the events were not partitioned by fixed time intervals e g 24 h in general the frequency analysis and the ks t indicated that changes in precipitation of the ecfd duration and total precipitation descriptors at daily basis were not statistically significant except for the total precipitation in the months of december and february on the other hand the ks t indicated that for all months changes in the ecfd of the maximum intensity per event at 5 min temporal resolution were statistically significant the presence of long term wet and dry cycles was likely driven by changes in the number of events and changes in the instantaneous precipitation intensity of events and total precipitation per event however the events duration at daily temporal scale remains relatively stable fig 6 tables 1 and 2 precipitation intensification was observed during the long term dry period 1995 2015 as the occurrences of intensities in the range of 0 0 5mm 5 min 1 decreased while occurrences of precipitation in the range of 0 5 16mm 5 min 1 increased shifting the center of mass of pdf to the right fig 7 and table 3 during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 the shape of the pdf increased its degree of positive skewness due to the increase in occurrence of low intensity precipitation in the range of 0 0 5mm 5 min 1 however the larger intensities during the 54 years of records greater than 16mm 5 min 1 were recorded during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 table 3 recall that precipitation intensification was defined as the shift of the center of mass of the pdf to the right rather than the increase in frequency of large precipitation intensities e g larger than 16mm in 5 min with the exception of the months of december and february no significant differences in ecfd from total precipitation per event at daily temporal scale were found by the ks t table 2 generally speaking during the winter season the recurrence of total precipitation lower than 1 5mm bin mean were higher than the long term baseline 1962 2015 during the dry period 1995 2015 while during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 the recurrence of total precipitation larger than 1 5mm were larger than the baseline fig 8 other months show non statistically significant changes e g january march september and november while following a similar pattern than the months of december and february winter season computations of the percent of change estimated using the pdf during the winter season indicates an average of 21 increase in total precipitation during the wet dominated period and an average of 31 decrease in total daily precipitation during the dry dominated long term period table 4 a more comprehensive analysis revealed that the changes in the precipitation patterns during the dry period of 1995 2015 were characterized by the following 1 a decrease in the occurrence of events 2 an increase in the instantaneous precipitation intensity 5 min in the range of the 1 12mm bins and 3 a decrease in the daily total precipitation during the wet dominated period 1962 2015 the precipitation pattern was characterized by 1 an increase in the number of events 2 a decrease in the instantaneous precipitation intensity in the range of the 1 12mm bins although the largest intensities greater than 24mm 5 min bin along the 54 years of records was recorded in this period and 3 an increase in the event daily total precipitation the question is were these changes belong to temporal long term wet dry dominated cycles or the precipitation in this is region transitioning to a more permanently dry condition as predicted by the gcms for oklahoma see data from maurer et al 2007 http gdo dcp ucllnl org the question of whether or not the manifested shift in precipitation patterns was in fact due to the changes in the measuring system became irrelevant rather the detection of these inconsistencies and non homogeneities when using high resolution temporal data became a more important concern considering that these effects were not detected on long term annual trend analysis in addition current hydrologic analysis and future scenarios assessments require an increase in the temporal resolution of precipitation in order to adequately capture the range of watershed responses berne et al 2004 in fact longobardi and villani 2010 suggested disaggregation of annual precipitation to daily precipitation for trend analysis to assess the spatial temporal characteristics and dynamics if this is the case then the detection of the non stationary attributes at high temporal resolution can significantly affect the simulated systemic responses since current protocols to access climate change rely heavily on the analysis of annual trends e g dore 2005 portmann et al 2009 assumptions of stationarity when using precipitation data to project future responses are commonly invoked regardless of the presence of abrupt changes in precipitation patterns 4 conclusions during the study period 1962 2015 a wet dominated period 1962 1997 was followed by a dry dominated 1998 2015 period in which each period lasted more than 10 years during the wet dominated period the 5 min precipitation intensity was more likely to occur during events in the bins range of 0 25 and 0 5mm while less likely to occur in the bins range of 1 0 12mm compared to the baseline 1962 2015 this resulted in an overall 20 decrease in maximum event intensity however the largest 5 min precipitation intensities bins of 24mm or greater were observed during this period in the 54 years of records during the dry dominated period 5 min precipitation intensity in the bins range of 1 12mm were more likely to occur for all months compared to the baseline period this resulted in an overall increase of 64 in event precipitation intensity within the 1996 2015 period however 5 min event intensities greater than the 12 mm remained within the expected variability precipitation intensification below extremes on the seasonal scale precipitation intensification during the dry dominated period ranged from 52 in the summer to 81 in the winter during the wet dominated period a 20 decrease in the 5 min event precipitation was observed for all seasons analysis of the daily average event total precipitation indicated a 10 increase and 16 decrease during the wet and dry dominated periods respectively nevertheless in both long term periods the season that showed the larger variability compared to the baseline was winter wet 21 dry 30 while summer manifested the lowest variability wet 3 dry 4 instead changes in the events duration summarized at daily temporal scale was imperceptible during the wet or dry dominated periods the accuracy of predicting ecosystem responses significantly depends on how the areal precipitation is determined to the scale of the ecosystem process being investigated traditional approaches from ground based or remote sensing derived observations can result in false stationarity masking important local or regional precipitation variability occurring during climate oscillations and thus future scenarios by being able to investigate the changes in precipitation patterns using high spatio temporal resolution datasets with minimal aggregation non stationary conditions that were otherwise unknown were revealed however these datasets are scarce and unfortunately most agencies are focusing its data collection on networks designed by the principle of minimum cross correlation due to operational cost future investigation is needed to improve quantification of precipitation variability occurring during long term climate oscillations at scales significant to hydrological and ecosystems feedback processes e g sediment and nutrient transport soil carbon sequestration etc interlocked to global scales assessments conflict of interest none 
8521,study region the little washita river experimental watershed lwrew is located between chickasha and lawton in southwestern oklahoma us study focus in this study frequency analyses were conducted on sub hourly precipitation event descriptors to quantify the changes in precipitation patterns commonly masked in annual analysis precipitation events were derived from 5 min data collected by usda ars from 1961 to 2015 new hydrological insights for the region during the 1962 2015 period this region experienced successive regional long term wet 1962 1995 and dry 1996 2015 dominated periods of more than 20 years each during the wet period precipitation intensity ranging from 1 to 12mm were 20 less likely to occur while event daily average precipitation and number of events increased by 10 and 11 respectively also the average daily precipitation occurred more often at lower intensities in contrast during the dry period instantaneous intensity ranging from 1 to 12mm became more likely to occur 64 increase 1996 2015 while event daily average precipitation and number of events decreased by 16 and 18 respectively overall comparisons with the baseline data 1962 2015 indicated that in the last 20 years sub hourly precipitation intensities have increased while daily event duration and extreme 5 min precipitation intensities larger than 24mm precipitation intensification below extremes have remained unchanged keywords precipitation variability and change climate trends non stationary precipitation little washita river experimental watershed 1 introduction the annual mean precipitation at the global scale is expected to increase by the end of this century with extreme precipitation events becoming more intense and more frequent in some regions ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 the effects of these changes at the local scales are not clearly understood although the evaluation of projected impacts on ecosystems are typically assessed from trends derived from climate observations e g chu et al 2014 and global circulation models gcms scenarios e g jones et al 2005 perry et al 2005 menzel et al 2006 parmesan 2006 mckenney et al 2007 however westra et al 2014 concluded that intensity variability on sub daily extreme precipitation is more sensitive to change especially at hourly and sub hourly scales when compared to daily precipitation studies indicated that precipitation extremes at hourly and sub hourly temporal scale increase non linearly up to twice as fast with rising temperature as it was originally predicted by gcms lenderink and van meijgaard 2008 2010 mishra et al 2012 however there is also evidence that this rate of increase peaks and decreases beyond the approximated daily average surface temperatures of 24 c most likely driven by moisture availability westra et al 2014 and perhaps changing aerosols linked to vegetation changes cloudiness portmann et al 2009 downscaled high spatio temporal precipitation from gcms are in the early stages of development and may be insufficient to represent sub daily precipitation variability required to quantify critical sub kilometer hydrological responses on the other hand long term continuous ground based sub daily precipitation datasets at watershed scale are scarce especially those that encompasses the boundary of the analog and digital era data collection and also includes periods of records of more than 20 years before and after the anomaly departure in global mean temperatures around 1980 gistemp team 2017 nevertheless analysis of long term high temporal resolution precipitation data is needed to reduce the risk of masking climate signals when assessing future scenarios nonetheless the presence of data inconsistencies e g site relocation change in instrumentation must be identified and accounted for before further data analysis is conducted in this study a dataset of 55 years 5 min watershed average precipitation from the little washita river experimental watershed lwrew located in oklahoma part of the southern great plains were used to assess changes in sub daily precipitation patterns the occurrence of drought conditions in this region

years that was mostly linked to natural variations in weather hoerling et al 2014 however projections in the 21st century from both moderate rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 future emission scenarios indicated that drought intensification will likely exceed the most severe megadrought periods of the medieval climate 1100 1300 ce cook et al 2015 moreover it remains unclear how the storms characteristics are changing along the oscillations between the long term regional wet i e periods of 10 or more years with an average precipitation surplus over the historic mean or dry i e periods of 10 or more years with an average precipitation deficit over the historic mean dominated periods the overall goal of this study was to identify and quantify the changes in precipitation patterns during long term wet or dry dominated periods by comparing the changes in the frequency distribution derived from event metrics total precipitation intensity and duration of events at the watershed scale long term 1962 2015 high spatio temporal resolution precipitation data from more than 20 sites in the lwrew were used to derive the frequency distribution analysis on event metrics at the watershed scale this study was aimed to specifically address three important hypotheses 1 storm characteristics most likely result in different precipitation patterns during long term regional dry and wet oscillations periods 2 characteristics of storm frequency intensity and duration have changed in the lwrew in the last 55 years and 3 the changes in precipitation during the period of record were due to physical changes in its patterns rather than data inconsistences in the observations since climate change is projected to impact the spatio temporal precipitation characteristics at local scales an analysis of locally collected high spatio temporal resolution precipitation can elucidate the implications of climate variability and change that may not be detectable from analysis of individual sites or multiple sites reporting only daily monthly or total annual precipitation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lwrew located in central oklahoma fig 1 a is part of a conservation and research effort initiated in 1961 to mitigate soil erosion in 1961 the u s department of agriculture usda agricultural research service ars set up 36 stations as part of the southern great plains research watershed sgprw program to monitor climate precipitation air temperature relative humidity etc and hydrological variables e g groundwater levels this research program focused on evaluating basin scale impacts of flood mitigation strategies specifically headwaters flood retarding structures garbrecht et al 2007 and details of the data collection was a primary focus starks et al 2014 considerable efforts were made to characterize precipitation over the watershed as the main driver of frequent floods and soil erosion occurring during extreme precipitation events starks et al 2014 at the end of the sgprw program in 1994 climatological observational networks transitioned to digital technology and consequentially there were changes in data collection protocols in 1978 the lwrew was selected by the usda and the u s environmental protection agency usepa as one of seven national benchmark watersheds to study the effects of land conservation in water quality garbrecht et al 2007 the lwrew drains an area of approximately 620km2 with predominantly rangeland and pastureland use the elevation of the watershed ranges from 300m to 500m above mean sea level the soil textures range from fine sand to silty loam while the exposed bedrock is sandstone average annual temperature in the watershed is 16 c 2 2 precipitation data instrumenting the lwrew started in 1961 with the establishment of 12 gauging stations using the analog belfort 5 780 dual traverse weighing bucket rain gauges belfort instrument baltimore md fig 1b charts from selected stations where later digitized by the usda ars grazinglands research laboratory to produce breakpoint storm event data in 1994 a transition from the analog rain gauges to met one model 280c digital tipping bucket rain gauges metone instruments inc grants pass or begun also the number of stations deployed increased to a total of 35 these stations were also equipped with instruments to measure air temperature relative humidity incoming solar radiation and soil temperature the measurement network is known today as the micronet http ars mesonet org fig 1c additionally a state run network of meteorological stations the mesonet fig 1d also operated four stations in and around the lwrew mcpherson et al 2007 by 1995 all the analog instruments were replaced by digital rain gauges and in time the network was reshaped due to station relocation and decommissioning for a total number of 20 stations today 15 stations were relocated to a nearby watershed in 2004 in general precipitation in the automated networks was sampled and data were recorded at discrete 5 min intervals a more detailed description of the arrangement and changes in the lwrew weather measurement network can be found in starks et al 2014 in addition to the high spatio temporal resolution precipitation data 1961 2015 a long term time series 1900 2015 of total annual precipitation was reconstructed from 16 sites from the national centers for environmental information database https www ncei noaa gov fig 2 the areal total annual precipitation at the lwrew was computed at the centroid of the watershed by the inverse distance weighting interpolator using the coefficient that resulted in the lower average error from cross validation of the observed data spellmap guzman et al 2013 2 3 data processing digitized breakpoint data from the analog charts 1961 1995 were resampled at 1 min time step using linear interpolation between precipitation breakpoints the resulting 1 min dataset was then aggregated to 5 min time step and adjusted to the 0 254mm tipping bucket rain gauge precision by considering only the accumulated precipitation greater than or equal to 0 254mm in a 5 min interval fig 3 if the accumulated precipitation was less than 0 254mm the precipitation was carried over to the next wet 5 min time step the 5 min analog dataset 1961 1995 was then combined with the 5 min digital dataset from the micronet and mesonet networks 1994 2013 guzman et al 2014 to produce a 55 year continuous 5 min dataset fig 3 digital data at 5 min temporal resolution was evaluated for data quality and cross validated with network operation records the 55 year 5 min resolution time series was then used to generate the total annual precipitation and to derive the precipitation events statistical descriptors used for the frequency analysis 2 4 total annual precipitation the complete 5 min precipitation dataset 1961 2015 local dataset and the regional derived 1900 2015 dataset were used to compute the annual total precipitation the local dataset lwrew comprised of sgprs and micronet was used to compute the statistical descriptors of events using spellmap guzman et al 2013 for the total annual precipitation sites with incomplete yearly records less than 363days of records were eliminated for instance the year 1961 was excluded due to incomplete data as well as all sites that were not fully operational for the complete year within the period 1962 2015 following computations of annual total precipitation at each site the time series were used to estimate the time series of precipitation per network at the lwrew centroid using the idw interpolator with the p value that resulted in minimum error using spellmap guzman et al 2013 annual time series were tested for a the presence of serial auto correlation b normality c the presence of trend using the spearman rank correlation and d detection of a change point using the standard normal homogeneity test snht alexandersson 1986 khaliq and ouarda 2007 a preliminary evaluation for normality conducted on the annual total precipitation indicated that it was normally distributed parametric tests are considered more assertive in detecting changes in normally distributed data than a non parametric test the spearman test is a non parametric test for detection of trend while the snht is a parametric test used to identify time series non homogeneities by assuming the hypothesis of normality both the non parametric t test and f test were used to assess statistical significant changes in mean and variance respectively for all statistical tests conducted on annual time series a 95 confidence limit was used α 0 05 in the presence of serial correlation a pre whitening procedure based on an autoregressive model was used to remove the first serial correlation dependency burn and hagelnur 2002 1 p t 1 p t 1 r p t where p t 1 is the pre whitened series value for time interval t 1 p t the original time series value for time interval t and r is the estimated first serial correlation coefficient 2 5 precipitation events and data metrics the twelve sites that originally comprised the sgwrw network and later become part of the micronet network were used for the computations of precipitation event descriptors 1961 2015 table 1 a precipitation event was defined as a continuous measurable precipitation followed by a single time step with undetectable precipitation on a 5 min temporal resolution thus a precipitation event was identified in all cases in which the accumulated precipitation was greater than 0 254mm and continuously detected followed by one or more time steps of undetectable precipitation less than 0 254mm the 0 254mm precipitation threshold was based on the detectable precipitation limit of the met one tipping bucket instrument deployed in the watershed since 1994 following the event identification event statistical descriptors i e total mean maximum intensity per event and duration of event precipitation were computed at each site precipitation events were time stamped at the beginning of each precipitation event and the average of the statistical descriptor from the 12 individual sites was recorded at the beginning of the earliest site event the mean descriptor was computed as follows 2 α t i 1 n e v e n t i α n where α t is the arithmetic mean of the descriptor e g total precipitation and event duration at time t e v e n t i α is the event statistical descriptor α at site i and n the number of sites in which a precipitation event was detected at time t the precipitation descriptor for event maximum precipitation intensity was defined as the single site 5 min intensity recorded at any time during the event and was computed as follows 3 max t max e v e n t t i were max t is the maximum intensity at time t recorded at site i at 5 min temporal resolution the statistical descriptors were daily aggregated and then results summarized on monthly and yearly temporal scales analyses of relative frequency were performed on a monthly basis using precipitation log scaled bins i e 0 254 0 5 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128 254 512mm results were summarized based on the following time series comprising sub hourly data records a 1962 to 2015 to describe the complete observational period baseline b 1962 to 1994 to describe a long term wet dominated period comprising 33 years of data and c 1995 to 2015 to describe a long term dry dominated period comprising 21 years of data the year 1995 was used to split the time series matching the final year of the instrumentation transition due to its proximity from the starting year of the latest long term wet dominated period 1997 it was assumed that the split of the data both represents a the precipitation patterns frequency intensity and duration of long term dry and wet dominated periods and b served to assess data inconsistency in defining the periods for analysis the following concepts were considered into account 1 data must retain continuity due to the assumption that changes are likely associated to dynamics e g global warming land use change etc interlocked to time 2 duration of long term dry or wet periods should be longer than the decadal oscillation and 3 as possible one period must include a year of the instrumentation transition changes in precipitation patterns were assessed by comparing the empirical cumulative frequency distribution ecfd functions derived from the frequency analysis of event descriptors the kolmogorov smirnov test ks t was used to evaluate the statistical significance of change using 95 confidence intervals significant level α 0 05 by identifying if the tested ecfd belong to a different distribution the ks t test statistic dn computes the separation between the two ecfd 4 d m n α m a x x f m x f n x where d m n α is the ks t critical value at given α f m x and f n x are the two ecfd with m and n populations for sufficiently large populations d m n α approximate to 5 d m n α c m n m n where c is the inverse kolmogorov for a given significant level α results from the ks t were used to identify changes in precipitation patterns the event descriptors of daily total precipitation duration and 5 min maximum intensity were first segregated by month and then the ks t was conducted using the multi year average period 1961 2015 as the baseline for comparison for instance the ecfds from the month of january corresponding to the period 1962 2015 was tested against the 1961 1994 and 1995 2015 periods 3 results and discussion 3 1 total annual precipitation depth the multiyear total annual precipitation in the lwrew was estimated at 843 4mm using 54 years of records 1962 2015 maximum and minimum annual precipitation were measured at 1 303 2 2015 and 467 3mm 2011 respectively fig 4 a the annual time series was identified to be normally distributed by the normality test with a non statistically significant auto correlation α 0 05 linear trend spearman test α 0 05 and change point snht analysis of the data set revealed non statistical significance for these tests thus this time series sgrpw micronet were considered stationary during the 54 year period 1972 1997 was predominantly wet with 16 of the 26 years of records with precipitation above the local network annual mean and an average precipitation surplus of 86 53mmy 1 noted that the 1972 1997 surplus mean is not indicated in fig 4b moreover during this period between 1980 and 1997 the lwrew experienced the largest precipitation surplus of the 116 years of record 109 3mmy 1 following this period and between 1998 and 2014 the watershed experienced more frequent annual total precipitation below the local network annual mean 12 of 17 years for an average water deficit of 92 1mmy 1 note that the long term wet and dry periods were defined by the average slope of the cumulated residual curve residuals were estimated using the total annual mean estimated with respect of each network regional or local longer than 10 years with negative or positive slopes indicating dry or wet periods respectively at the regional scale estimated precipitation at the lwrew centroid using the 116 year records 1900 2015 fig 4a exhibited a non statistically significant increasing trend spearman test α 0 05 fig 4a and an average annual precipitation of 825 8mm also the snht test did not detect a statistically significant change point thus this time series regional was also considered to be stationary a comparison of the means of the total precipitation between the two networks during the period 1962 2015 resulted in 6 8mm difference regional based 850 2mm sgprw micronet based 843 4mm this difference in the means are most likely the result of spatial scale interpolation and differences in instrumentation density cumulated residuals from the regional network fig 4b indicated the presence of a long term dry period 72 years 1908 1980 moderated by the occurrence of successive wet or dry sub cycles not longer than 10 years except 1962 1972 11 years during the period 1908 1980 total annual precipitation below the mean was more frequent 40 of 73 years resulting in an average water deficit of 44 2mmy 1 following 1980 annual precipitation was commonly above the total annual mean for an average water surplus of 86 4mmy 1 until the year 2015 with well defined short term wet and dry oscillations between 2000 and 2015 regional network fig 4b comparison of cumulated residuals curves local and regional networks indicates that records from local network includes the wettest 1980 1997 and driest 1998 2015 long term periods relative to the 116 years of records note that the water deficit recorded by the local network during the latest dry period 1998 2015 92 1mmy 1 fig 4c was similar to the long term dry period between 1962 and 1972 93 6mmy 1 fig 4c but smaller than the recorded by the regional network between 1961 and 1972 122 7mmy 1 not indicated in fig 4c also during this period the network transitioned from analog to digital instrumentation and also changes in network operations protocols and data management occurred these differences in the cumulated residuals between the regional and local network sgprw micronet fig 4c were explained by the smoothing effect of spatial and temporal aggregation and interpolation due changes from regional to local scales reports from other indicators and data from the fort cobb reservoir experimental watershed located approximately 65km north west from lwrew corroborate the dry conditions experienced after 1997 in the lwrew contrasting with the wetter pattern from the regional network fig 4b and c as an example of other indicators fig 4d shows the effect of the spatial variability in water deficits reported by the u s drought monitor usdm http droughtmonitor unl edu mapsanddata maparchive aspx note that these areas subjected to water deficit did not follow regular geometrical spatial pattern circles indicate approximately the extent of the local and regional networks 3 2 instrumental transition and bias differences in total annual precipitation between the two networks are indicated in fig 4e this time series was normally distributed normality test α 0 05 with a statistically significant increasing trend spearman α 0 05 and a detected change point in 1987 snht test test for change in means t test α 0 05 and variances f test α 0 05 conducted on split series in 1987 equal length indicates that the changes in variance were non statistically significant while the difference in means was statistically significant t test α 0 05 thus this time series was considered non stationary the detected change point in 1987 seven years prior to the transition from analog to digital instrumentation support the hypothesis that observed differences in precipitation in the lwrew was not driven by change in systematic errors derived from changes in instrumentation and network operation analog to digital period 3 3 number of precipitation events analysis from the number of precipitation events in the lwrew 12 sites are summarized in fig 5 grouped by season differences in the multi year means between the 1962 2015 and 1995 2015 were statistically significant 15 7 vs 13 6 respectively t test α 0 05 with the larger variations found in the winter season followed by fall and spring while differences between the 1962 2015 and 1962 1994 were not statistically significant note that the 1962 2015 period was used as the baseline for comparison at monthly scales table 1 the digital era representing the period dominated by dry years was in general below the expected long term means 1962 2015 except for the month of october similarly the analog period which represent a long term wet period with a wet and dry cycle oscillation follows the average trend with values greater than the expected means except for the month of october winter was the season where the larger average deviation was observed although the largest monthly deviation occurred during the months of september followed by may thus wet and dry oscillation of total annual precipitation correlates with an increase and decrease in the number of events of precipitation respectively where the winter season exhibited larger variability followed by fall and spring and summer the lowest variability 3 4 analysis of event precipitation descriptors figs 6 8 and table 2 summarize the relative frequency analysis and the kolmogorov smirnov test ks t of the event precipitation descriptors reported on monthly basis and grouped by seasons note that for the analysis the events were not partitioned by fixed time intervals e g 24 h in general the frequency analysis and the ks t indicated that changes in precipitation of the ecfd duration and total precipitation descriptors at daily basis were not statistically significant except for the total precipitation in the months of december and february on the other hand the ks t indicated that for all months changes in the ecfd of the maximum intensity per event at 5 min temporal resolution were statistically significant the presence of long term wet and dry cycles was likely driven by changes in the number of events and changes in the instantaneous precipitation intensity of events and total precipitation per event however the events duration at daily temporal scale remains relatively stable fig 6 tables 1 and 2 precipitation intensification was observed during the long term dry period 1995 2015 as the occurrences of intensities in the range of 0 0 5mm 5 min 1 decreased while occurrences of precipitation in the range of 0 5 16mm 5 min 1 increased shifting the center of mass of pdf to the right fig 7 and table 3 during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 the shape of the pdf increased its degree of positive skewness due to the increase in occurrence of low intensity precipitation in the range of 0 0 5mm 5 min 1 however the larger intensities during the 54 years of records greater than 16mm 5 min 1 were recorded during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 table 3 recall that precipitation intensification was defined as the shift of the center of mass of the pdf to the right rather than the increase in frequency of large precipitation intensities e g larger than 16mm in 5 min with the exception of the months of december and february no significant differences in ecfd from total precipitation per event at daily temporal scale were found by the ks t table 2 generally speaking during the winter season the recurrence of total precipitation lower than 1 5mm bin mean were higher than the long term baseline 1962 2015 during the dry period 1995 2015 while during the wet dominated period 1962 1994 the recurrence of total precipitation larger than 1 5mm were larger than the baseline fig 8 other months show non statistically significant changes e g january march september and november while following a similar pattern than the months of december and february winter season computations of the percent of change estimated using the pdf during the winter season indicates an average of 21 increase in total precipitation during the wet dominated period and an average of 31 decrease in total daily precipitation during the dry dominated long term period table 4 a more comprehensive analysis revealed that the changes in the precipitation patterns during the dry period of 1995 2015 were characterized by the following 1 a decrease in the occurrence of events 2 an increase in the instantaneous precipitation intensity 5 min in the range of the 1 12mm bins and 3 a decrease in the daily total precipitation during the wet dominated period 1962 2015 the precipitation pattern was characterized by 1 an increase in the number of events 2 a decrease in the instantaneous precipitation intensity in the range of the 1 12mm bins although the largest intensities greater than 24mm 5 min bin along the 54 years of records was recorded in this period and 3 an increase in the event daily total precipitation the question is were these changes belong to temporal long term wet dry dominated cycles or the precipitation in this is region transitioning to a more permanently dry condition as predicted by the gcms for oklahoma see data from maurer et al 2007 http gdo dcp ucllnl org the question of whether or not the manifested shift in precipitation patterns was in fact due to the changes in the measuring system became irrelevant rather the detection of these inconsistencies and non homogeneities when using high resolution temporal data became a more important concern considering that these effects were not detected on long term annual trend analysis in addition current hydrologic analysis and future scenarios assessments require an increase in the temporal resolution of precipitation in order to adequately capture the range of watershed responses berne et al 2004 in fact longobardi and villani 2010 suggested disaggregation of annual precipitation to daily precipitation for trend analysis to assess the spatial temporal characteristics and dynamics if this is the case then the detection of the non stationary attributes at high temporal resolution can significantly affect the simulated systemic responses since current protocols to access climate change rely heavily on the analysis of annual trends e g dore 2005 portmann et al 2009 assumptions of stationarity when using precipitation data to project future responses are commonly invoked regardless of the presence of abrupt changes in precipitation patterns 4 conclusions during the study period 1962 2015 a wet dominated period 1962 1997 was followed by a dry dominated 1998 2015 period in which each period lasted more than 10 years during the wet dominated period the 5 min precipitation intensity was more likely to occur during events in the bins range of 0 25 and 0 5mm while less likely to occur in the bins range of 1 0 12mm compared to the baseline 1962 2015 this resulted in an overall 20 decrease in maximum event intensity however the largest 5 min precipitation intensities bins of 24mm or greater were observed during this period in the 54 years of records during the dry dominated period 5 min precipitation intensity in the bins range of 1 12mm were more likely to occur for all months compared to the baseline period this resulted in an overall increase of 64 in event precipitation intensity within the 1996 2015 period however 5 min event intensities greater than the 12 mm remained within the expected variability precipitation intensification below extremes on the seasonal scale precipitation intensification during the dry dominated period ranged from 52 in the summer to 81 in the winter during the wet dominated period a 20 decrease in the 5 min event precipitation was observed for all seasons analysis of the daily average event total precipitation indicated a 10 increase and 16 decrease during the wet and dry dominated periods respectively nevertheless in both long term periods the season that showed the larger variability compared to the baseline was winter wet 21 dry 30 while summer manifested the lowest variability wet 3 dry 4 instead changes in the events duration summarized at daily temporal scale was imperceptible during the wet or dry dominated periods the accuracy of predicting ecosystem responses significantly depends on how the areal precipitation is determined to the scale of the ecosystem process being investigated traditional approaches from ground based or remote sensing derived observations can result in false stationarity masking important local or regional precipitation variability occurring during climate oscillations and thus future scenarios by being able to investigate the changes in precipitation patterns using high spatio temporal resolution datasets with minimal aggregation non stationary conditions that were otherwise unknown were revealed however these datasets are scarce and unfortunately most agencies are focusing its data collection on networks designed by the principle of minimum cross correlation due to operational cost future investigation is needed to improve quantification of precipitation variability occurring during long term climate oscillations at scales significant to hydrological and ecosystems feedback processes e g sediment and nutrient transport soil carbon sequestration etc interlocked to global scales assessments conflict of interest none 
8522,study region the upper amazon river where the water level measured at the tamshiyacu station peru shows seasonal variability of seven meters study focus key parameters for the flood recession period beginning end and duration of the low water period velocity of water falling and rising and inversions in the direction of stage change known as repiquete events are analyzed for the period 1985 2015 along with their relationship to rainfall integrated in the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu new hydrological insights the low water period lasts about four months beginning on average at the end of july and ending in early november since the late 1990s the low water period has tended to end later last longer and the flood recession ends more abruptly than it used to this may be related to the increased frequency of dry days during the austral winter in the central and southern part of the basin and to increased and more intense rainfall in late spring november december repiquete events are frequent 8 each year on average and sometimes very acute 18 events with a water level reversal greater than one meter were registered during the 1985 2015 period they are related to unusual intense and extended rainfall during the week preceding the repiquete extensions of this preliminary work are suggested as well as possible implications for recessional agriculture keywords

analysis of the flood recession period is also of particular interest because the annual rainfall cycle has changed in recent decades in the amazon basin longer dry seasons have been observed since

arias et al 2015 wright et al 2017 fernandes et al 2015 also suggest the existence of a decadal variability in western amazon rainfall related to the decadal variability in tropical atlantic ocean sea surface temperature sst corresponding to these changes a significant decrease in rainfall during the dry season has been documented in the upper amazon basin since the 1970s espinoza et al 2006 2011

hydrology institute inamhi in ecuador and the hydrology meteorology and environmental studies institute ideam in colombia the hop dataset is available from 1980 to 2009 on a daily time step and a 1 x1 grid guimberteau et al 2012 in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin delimited by the tamshiyacu hydrological station basin integrated rainfall is computed from 234 meteorological stations from the hop dataset espinoza et al 2011 for more details about quality control of rainfall data and geostatistical interpolation of rainfall observations see guimberteau et al 2012 gridded hop daily data are freely available in netcdf format at www so hybam org over the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu monthly wet day frequency wdf is defined as the frequency of days with rainfall greater than 10mm which is about twice the mean annual rainfall in the basin estimated at 4 8mm day espinoza et al 2011 monthly dry day frequency ddf is defined as the frequency of days with rainfall less than 1mm espinoza et al 2016 these data are derived from hop 2 2 definition of the flood recession parameters in the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu the amazon river up to the tamshiyacu station the first gauging station downstream from the confluence of the marañón and ucayali rivers fig 1a has a huge drainage 750 000km2 half of which is in the andes above 500m fig 1a the long term mean discharge at tamshiyacu is 32 000m3 s about 16 of the amazon discharge at the estuary espinoza et al 2006 2009b fig 1b shows the average annual cycles of basin averaged rainfall and water level at tamshiyacu from may when the highest water level values are observed to april rainfall peaks at the end of february about 7 5mm day and the lowest amounts are observed in august about 2mm day accordingly with the 2 months lag between rainfall and discharge in this basin espinoza et al 2006 2011 the peak water level occurs at the very beginning of may 9 2m and the lowest level in mid september 1 9m the range between the two levels is about 7 3m the water recedes rapidly as the dry season starts concomitantly in most of the sub basins of the upper amazon basin fig 1b in contrast the water rises more slowly as the onset of the rainy season occurs earlier in the tropical ucayali sub basin and later in the equatorial marañón sub basin espinoza et al 2009b the huge size of the basin is the reason why the combinations of different hydro climatic regimes produce such hybrid regimes on this topic see for instance molinier et al 1996 ronchail et al 2006 ovando et al 2016 centiles of the water level time series are used to define critical hydrological dates and periods during the annual hydrological cycle focusing on the flood recession period the following are working definitions of the different parameters for the purpose of this study the duration of the low water lw period is defined as a portion of the year when the daily water level is below the lower tercile c33 4 5m of the 1985 2015 period fig 1b the beginning of the lw period is the first date with a water level below c33 first c33 during at least 10days and the end of the lw period is the date following the first c33 with a water level above c33 during at least 10days second c33 the first c33 occurs july 20 on average and the second c33 on november 11 table 1 a the speed at which the water falls before the low water period is estimated by computing the number of days between the first 66th centile c66 7 3m and the first c33 on average the first c66 occurs on june 13 and the first c33 occurs 38days later the speed at which the water rises after the low water period is estimated by computing the number of days between the second c33 and the first following c66 it is remarkable that the average of annual c66 dates january 19 table 1a is not the same as the date of c66 computed on the mean 1985 2015 cycle february 17 fig 1b this is because the water rise is far from linear after reaching c66 the water level may fall again for a while and then begin to rise again finally repiquetes inversions in direction sign of water level change greater or equal to 1cm in amplitude are also considered during the flood recession cycle they are considered when the stage returns to its former level after the inversion from may to september 2 3 statistical methods to identify temporal trends in time series we use the parametric pearson coefficient r and the rank based non parametric spearman spearman 1904 and kendall tests kendall 1975 statistical breaks in the time series are evaluated using the pettitt method pettitt 1979 a non parametric test based on changes in the average and the range of the series the lee and heghinian bayesian test lee and heghinian 1977 which uses the average as an indicator of change in the time series thanks to an a posteriori student s distribution and the hubert segmentation procedure hubert et al 1989 which verifies whether differences in average and standard deviation among periods are significant composite analysis is used to compare groups of years with hydrological parameter values lower than the first tercile to years with parameter values higher than the last tercile during the 1985 2009 period the common period for rainfall and hydrological data this enables us to compare water level rainfall dry day frequency ddf days with rainfall 1mm day wet day frequency wdf days with rainfall 10mm day during years with early and late beginning of the low water period early and late ending long and short duration of the low water period and rapid and slow decrease and increase of the water level the student test allows comparison of the difference between the averages of two sub samples 3 evolution of parameters of the flood recession period 3 1 the beginning of the low water lw period during the 1985 2015 period the water level in the amazon river reaches the 66th centile c66 7 3m on june 13 on average this date changes over time occurring as early as the beginning of may in 1995 or later at the end of july 1989 but there is no notable trend or break table 1a the mean date of the beginning of the lw period defined by the 33rd centile c33 4 5m is july 20 table 1a it used to happen earlier late june in the middle of the 1990s and later in august at the beginning of the 21st century but no significant trend is observed in this time series fig 2 fig 3 shows the composites of water level and rainfall during years with early and late onset of the lw period years with an early onset are characterized by a lower than usual water level during the falling water period and the entire lw period until october fig 3a these years include those with the lowest rainfall described in the literature i e 1995 1998 and 2005 espinoza et al 2011 marengo et al 2008 2011 zeng et al 2008 in contrast years with a late onset are characterized by water levels that are higher than usual during the falling water period from june until the beginning of the lw period fig 3a rainfall is lower during years with an early onset of the lw period than during years with a late onset fig 3c the differences are significant at the 90 level from march to early may and at the 95 level from the end of may until mid june 1 2mm day and from the end of june until july 10 1 5mm day this probably corresponds to rainfall over the northern part of upper amazon basin marañón basin where rainfall is more abundant during the autumn and austral winter compared to the ucayali basin espinoza et al 2009a in accordance with these results wet day frequency wdf values are high low in june and july during years with a late early onset p 0 1 fig 4 a and dry day frequency ddf values are high low p 0 1 in may july and september during years with an early late onset fig 4c 3 2 the end of the low water lw period the end of the lw period generally occurs at the beginning of november with dates varying substantially from the end of september as in 1992 to the beginning of february year 1 as in 2010 table 1a a composite of early ending episodes shows a higher than usual water level during the peak of the lw period and a sharp rise in october and november fig 3b while the composite of late ending episodes is characterized by very low water levels during the peak of the lw period september and water levels below average from october to late december the corresponding difference in rainfall between late and early endings is significant p 0 1 during a few days from mid to late august 0 75mm day fig 3d comparing dry day frequency ddf during late and early endings it appears to be slightly higher from july to october and significant p 0 1 in september fig 4d when the end of the lw period occurs later than usual it is noteworthy that an early ending of the lw period is followed by a stop in water rising from november to january fig 3b and is accompanied by a consistent decrease in wdf fig 4b conversely after a late ending the water level increases more abruptly fig 3b in association with heavy rains fig 3d and high wdf in december fig 4b such an abrupt transition has been observed for example from the extreme september 2010 very low discharge 8300m3 s 1 to one of the highest discharges in april 2011 49 500m3 s 1 recorded at tamshiyacu espinoza et al 2012b a significant positive trend in the date of the end of the lw period r2 0 24 p 0 01 is detected table 1a and fig 2 a significant p 0 10 break point is also observed in 1998 with later dates afterward the end of the lw period occurs at the end of october before 1998 and at the end of november afterward fig 2 this result is consistent with other studies by the authors about trends and breaks in the water level during different periods of the year not shown which highlight the decrease in the september october november son water level r2 0 2 p 0 02 during the 1985 2015 period with a break in 1994 detected by all the tests not shown there is also a significant relationship r2 0 63 p 0 001 between the date of the end of the lw period and the son water level the positive trend of the date of the end of the lw period may be related to the positive trend in ddf in the southern ucayali basin fig 4e 3 3 duration of the low water lw period fig 5 a compares years with short and a long lw duration during years with long lw periods water level is below average from june until the end of the year the water level reaches values as low as one meter or less during the two first weeks of september short lw periods in contrast are characterized by above average water levels especially from mid july until the end of the year the lw period generally lasts 114days between the first july 20 and the second november 11 c33 but it has been as short as 73days in 1986 a year with significant inundations and as long as 165 and 225days during the 2005 and 2010 dry years respectively table 1b and fig 2 fig 2 shows that the duration of the lw period has regularly exceeded 100days since 2005 and that it was nearly a month shorter at the beginning of the studied period a significant trend r2 0 15 p 0 05 is observed in this series as well as a rupture in 1994 as indicated by the pettit test the duration of the lw period was 93days before 1994 and it increased to 125days afterward table 1b other studies by the authors about trends and breaks in the water level during different periods of the year not shown demonstrates that the date of the break in the duration of the lw period is the same as that observed in the son water level series the two series are strongly correlated r2 0 66 p 0 001 again these results are consistent with an upward trend in the frequency of dry days in the upper amazon basin fig 4e and with a break in this time series in 1995 espinoza et al 2016 the duration of the lw period is strongly and positively correlated with the date of the end of the lw period r2 0 66 p 0 001 and negatively correlated with the date of the beginning of the lw period r2 0 30 p 0 001 six out of eight years with a short duration are also years with an early ending and five out of eight years with a long duration are also years with a late ending more rainfall than normal is registered when the duration of the lw period is shorter than usual fig 5b particularly during 10days at the end of june beginning of july 1 3mm day p 0 05 and from mid august to the first days of september 1mm day p 0 05 similarly the number of wet days is significantly higher p 0 1 in july when the lw duration is shorter than usual 1 4days instead of 0 fig 5c when the lw period is long the number of dry days is generally higher from july to october and is significantly higher p 0 05 in july and september 8 8days instead of 5 4 in july and 3 7 instead of 1 4 in september fig 5d it is noteworthy that after a long lw period the water level increases regularly and rapidly fig 5a in association with an onset of the rainy season that occurs later and more vigorously than usual rainfall fig 5b and the number of wet days fig 5c are higher than usual in november and december the opposite is true when the lw period is shorter than usual rainfall and wet days are less abundant and frequent from november to january and the water level remains around 600cm until the end of january 3 4 speed of water falling and rising the speed of the water falling and rising is measured by the numbers of days between the first 66th centile c66 7 3m and the first c33 4 5m for falling water and between the second c33 and the second c66 for rising water the average duration of water falling between the mean date of the first c66 june 13 and the mean date of the first c33 july 20 table 1a is 38days and the mean speed of water falling is 7 4cm day this value is similar to the speed estimated by coomes et al 2016 for the station at iquitos during the 1968 2013 period these values vary between 12days 23cm day in 1988 and 85days 3 3cm day in 2004 table 1c and fig 6 a the speed of water rising is much lower as noted by hiraoka 1985 the average duration between the second c33 and the second c66 is 70days 4cm day and varies from 20days 14cm day in 1993 149days 1 9cm day in 1985 table 1c and fig 7 a unlike water falling which shows considerable interannual variability but no trend fig 6a the speed of the water rising increases with time that is the number of days separating the second c33 and c66 decreases significantly during the 1985 2015 period r2 0 22 p 0 02 table 1c and fig 7a during the first 10 years of the studied period the water level rose from c33 to c66 in about three months 82days on average and the interannual variability was very high the coefficient of variation of the 1985 1996 period is 0 51 since the late 1990s the water level has increased from c33 to c66 in about 50days and even more rapidly since 2009 and the coefficient of variation for the 1997 2015 period decreased to 0 39 figs 6b and 7b show that years with a rapid slow water level decrease are characterized by a higher lower than usual water level during the former flood period years with a rapid slow increase are characterized by a high very low water level during the flood recession period moreover rapid water increases are distinguished by a regular increase of the water level until the beginning of the next year while slow increases are characterized by a break in the water rising from december to mid january fig 7b a rapid falling of the water level compared to a slow falling is related to higher than usual rainfall significant especially in april 0 9mm day p 0 05 and to rainfall lower than usual in part of july 0 8mm day p 0 05 fig 6c consistently a rapid falling is related to a low number of wet days fig 6d and a high number of dry days fig 6e in july while the opposite is observed when the water level falls slowly a rapid increase of the water level after the recession period can be related to higher rainfall than when the increase is slow at the beginning of june 0 7mm day p 0 1 in august 0 7mm day p 0 05 and also from mid november until the end of december 1 2mm day p 0 1 fig 7c consistently a rapid increase is also associated with a high number of wet days in june and august and in november and december p 0 05 fig 7d i e during the lw period and at the beginning of the rainy season and with fewer dry days in august and october p 0 1 fig 7e other studies by the authors about rainfall trends not shown highlight that a positive trend in november december basin averaged rainfall at tamshiyacu r2 0 21 p 0 01 may explain the trend in the velocity of the water rising during the study period not shown the speed of water rising is not significantly related to the duration of the lw period 3 5 repiquetes repiquetes which are inversions in direction sign of stage change greater or equal to 1cm in amplitude are analyzed during the recession period at the tamshiyacu station fig 8 a shows the example of 2007 08 when 10 repiquetes higher than 1cm and six higher than 20cm are observed between mid june and october in association with heavy rainfall during the preceding days an analysis of the distribution of repiquetes from may to september shows that the most frequent are the weak ones those that are lower than 10cm 110 out of 235 fig 8b however 48 out of 235 events exceed a 50cm rise 18 a one meter rise and three a two meter rise the highest 2 64m was observed in june 1990 and the two others in august 1997 2 44m and july 2002 2 27m the frequency of small repiquetes is in accordance with coomes et al 2016 but these authors found repiquetes exceeding five meters at the iquitos station and for a different period 1968 2013 repiquetes lower than 20cm are more frequent in may one per year on average and then are equally distributed from may to september fig 8c while those higher than 20cm are more frequent from the first fortnight of july until the first fortnight of september fig 8d generally there is an average of 7 7 repiquetes by year three if only those higher than 20cm are considered which is in accordance with coomes et al 2016 who found five to six events per year in iquitos the frequency of repiquetes shows an important interannual variability 18 events were registered in 1987 but only four in 1997 as there can be none of them as in 2000 fig 9 a neither the annual number of repiquetes nor the number of repiquetes by elevation range shows any trend fig 9a nevertheless a sudden decrease in the number of weak repiquetes is observed in may since the beginning of the 21st century fig 9b which is not related to changes in rainfall while small repiquetes generally last less than a week those higher than 20cm last 14days on average from the beginning of the inversion until the stage returns to its former level this result is similar to coomes et al 2016 basin averaged daily rainfall up to tamshiyacu has been analyzed during the 10days before and after the beginning d0 of a repiquete event from d 10 to d 10 rising of less than one meter is associated with prior rainfall generally exceeding 3mm the 15 may to 15 september average daily rainfall during three to four days about one week before the beginning of the repiquete event fig 10 a it is noteworthy that weak repiquetes lower than 20cm are related to a rainfall peak on the ninth and eighth days before the beginning of the repiquete d 9 and d 8 those between 20 and 50cm to a peak d 7 and those between 50 and 100cm to a high peak d 6 the rainfall peaks are lower 4 5mm day for repiquetes lower than 50cm and higher 5mm day for repiquetes higher than 50cm rising of more than one meter is associated with daily rainfall exceeding 5mm day during nearly the entire week preceding the repiquete and average accumulated excess rainfall during the entire period is 20mm during the very strong event in july 2002 rainfall excesses when compared to average rainfall reached 70mm during the period between d 7 and d 2 analyzing the intensity of rainfall it appears that a week before a small repiquete daily rainfall higher than 5mm represents about 30 of daily values fig 10b the strongest repiquete events are more frequently related to intense rainfall 40 of the d 7 to d 3days show rainfall exceeding 5mm day in conclusion strong events appear to be related to heavy and continuous rainfall during the week preceding the repiquete smaller repiquete events in contrast are related to a peak in rainfall about a week before the beginning of the event 4 synthesis and perspectives this work contributes to the analysis of key hydrological parameters of the flood recession period dates of beginning and end of the low water period duration of the low water period speed of water falling and rising occurrence of repiquetes in the upper amazon basin at the tamshiyacu station peru and their evolution during the 1985 2015 period the lower tercile of the daily water level 4 5m in the upper amazon river at tamshiyacu peru during the 1985 2015 period is used to define the low water lw period this period begins on average at the end of july and ends in the first days of november lasting about four months the starting date of the lw period varies little during the study period and depends on the amount of rainfall observed from the end of may to the beginning of july the ending date varies substantially over time however and occurs later now end of november than it used to end of october with a significant break in 1998 consequently the duration of the lw period which varies considerably at an interannual time scale from 2 5 to 7 5 months also shows a positive trend with a break in 1994 it lasted 93days on average before 1994 and 125days afterward both variables are highly correlated with the september october november son water level which decreases significantly during the study period and also shows a break in 1994 the trend in the date of the end of the lw period and in the duration of the low stage can be attributed to the increase in dry day frequency reported in the central and southern parts of the upper amazon basin espinoza et al 2016 this is also consistent with the increasing length of the dry season documented in the southern amazon li and fu 2006 carvalho et al 2011 marengo et al 2011 dubreuil et al 2012 fu et al 2013 yin et al 2014 arias et al 2015 debortoli et al 2015 espinoza et al 2016 the duration of falling and rising water level is defined as the number of days between the first and the second terciles of water level before and after the lw season respectively while the water falling duration 38days on average did not change over time the water rising duration at the end of the lw period decreased from three to two months during the study period a rapidly falling water level is related to decreased rainfall in july and an increase in dry day frequency a rapid rising is related to abundant and intense rainfall in november december which also characterizes late endings and long durations of the lw period the positive trend in rainfall in november december may explain the increasing speed of the water rising the choice of thresholds for the flood recession period parameters c33 c66 is actually a limitation of the study it is unclear how the results of this study particularly the observed trends might depend on the chosen value however similar results are obtained when defining the lw period with c20 the 20th centile instead of c33 not shown repiquetes or inversions in the direction sign of stage changes exceeding 1cm are frequent eight per year on average or three when considering those higher than 20cm during the 1985 2015 period 18 events exceeded a one meter rise and three exceeded two meters they are related to unusually high and intense rainfall peaks occurring six to nine days before the beginning of the repiquete depending on its intensity the strongest ones which are more frequent between july and september are associated with rainfall events exceeding 5mm day during nearly the entire week preceding the beginning of the repiquete these events show no trend during the study period our results show that the occurrence of extremes and changes in the parameters of the flood recession period is closely related to changes in rainfall during specific periods of the annual cycle rainfall itself is modulated by interannual and long term variability in the sea surface temperatures sst of the pacific and atlantic oceans and in regional atmospheric circulation marengo 2004 marengo and espinoza 2015 yoon and zeng 2010 satyamurty et al 2013 espinoza et al 2009a 2013 2016 among others during the austral summer for example precipitation is related to the phases of the el niño southern oscillation events with more rainfall during la niña events when the waters of the equatorial pacific are colder than usual and when an abundant moisture transport flux is observed from the tropical north atlantic and the caribbean sea toward the northwestern amazon dry events and high dry day frequencies during the austral winter are related to warmer sst in the tropical north atlantic and to weaker than usual trade winds and vapor transport toward the amazon and enhanced subsidence over the amazon basin they may be amplified by el niño events during the preceding summer zeng et al 2008 marengo et al 2008 2011 espinoza et al 2011 2016 the current increase in dry day frequency and in the duration of the low water period may also be related to a warming trend in the tropical north atlantic marengo et al 2008 2011 yoon and zeng 2010 fernandes et al 2015 espinoza et al 2016 and to land use change in the amazon basin wright et al 2017 relationships between aspects of intra seasonal variability of atmospheric circulation and the occurrence of repiquetes could be analyzed former works show that southern circulation patterns in south america associated with cold fronts are conducive to the development of convection and to rainfall in winter marengo et al 1997 garreaud and wallace 1998 espinoza et al 2012a as a consequence they may favor repiquetes the relationships between rainfall and ocean atmosphere conditions and those between rainfall and flood recession parameters may indicate that these parameters could be predictable at intra seasonal and interannual time scales further work could allow the development of an early warning system to alert farmers of the characteristics of the forthcoming recessional period or the imminent occurrence of a repiquete our results indicate that current hydrology patterns could be positive for recessional agriculture in peru s amazonian lowlands the increased length of the low water period and the decrease in the minimum water level could mean that more land may be available for agriculture during a longer time period which would favor crop maturation but repiquetes one of the greatest risks to rice crops list and coomes 2017 and more abrupt water rising as documented in this study could jeopardize crops of the recessional season decreased precipitation and an increase in dry day frequency could also affect agriculture in a region where there is no irrigation verifying the relationship between hydroclimatology and crop yields would imply 1 adapting the definition of parameters and the selected threshold to the crops of interest vegetation zones related to fluvial dynamics imply that crops with shorter growing seasons are located near the water while perennials and crops with longer growing seasons are cultivated on higher ground denevan 1984 hiraoka 1985 and 2 taking into account other variables such as erosion mendoza et al 2016 sediment quality plant diseases and

8522,study region the upper amazon river where the water level measured at the tamshiyacu station peru shows seasonal variability of seven meters study focus key parameters for the flood recession period beginning end and duration of the low water period velocity of water falling and rising and inversions in the direction of stage change known as repiquete events are analyzed for the period 1985 2015 along with their relationship to rainfall integrated in the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu new hydrological insights the low water period lasts about four months beginning on average at the end of july and ending in early november since the late 1990s the low water period has tended to end later last longer and the flood recession ends more abruptly than it used to this may be related to the increased frequency of dry days during the austral winter in the central and southern part of the basin and to increased and more intense rainfall in late spring november december repiquete events are frequent 8 each year on average and sometimes very acute 18 events with a water level reversal greater than one meter were registered during the 1985 2015 period they are related to unusual intense and extended rainfall during the week preceding the repiquete extensions of this preliminary work are suggested as well as possible implications for recessional agriculture keywords flood recession period water level rainfall amazon river peru 1 introduction while hydroclimatic extremes have been carefully studied in the amazon basin callede et al 2004 marengo and espinoza 2015 marengo et al 2008 2013 zeng et al 2008 chen et al 2010 espinoza et al 2011 2013 2014 satyamurty et al 2013 molina carpio et al 2017 there has been little study of the annual water level cycle of the amazon river in the western amazon precipitation is highly variable with a rainy season in the austral summer which is related to the onset of the south american monsoon system and the translation of convergence in the southern hemisphere and a drier season in the austral winter related to their retreat zhou and lau 1998 vera et al 2006 this rainfall seasonality causes a seven meter fluctuation between low and high water stages of the amazon river at the tamshiyacu station peru upstream from iquitos this study focuses on the flood recession period which is characterized by the decrease of the water level this period of the year is of particular interest for local food security and economic activity in the region the fertile riverbanks and floodplains varzeas which are flooded during the high water period are exposed during the flood recession period junk 1982 junk and furch 1993 making them available for recessional agriculture during those months hiraoka 1985 bahri 1993 noda

constantly changing physical conditions either aquatic or terrestrial depending on the season junk 1982 despite these adaptations losses are high especially when extreme water levels are observed during the high or low water season fish game and fruit are important components of the local diet and shortages can affect both local food security and cash crop systems takasaki et al 2004 nascimento 2017 variations in water level also have an important impact on the quantity and quality of water available to the local population cidade 2017 which affects health and quality of life analysis of the flood recession period is also of particular interest because the annual rainfall cycle has changed in recent decades in the amazon basin longer dry seasons have been observed since the 1980s particularly in the southern amazon with later onsets and earlier ends of the wet season li and fu 2006 carvalho et al 2011 marengo et al 2011 dubreuil et al 2012 fu et al 2013 yin et al 2014 arias et al 2015 debortoli et al 2015 espinoza et al 2016 this may be related to changes in convection due to deforestation and modifications in regional circulation li and fu 2006 yin et al 2014 arias et al 2015 wright et al 2017 fernandes et al 2015 also suggest the existence of a decadal variability in western amazon rainfall related to the decadal variability in tropical atlantic ocean sea surface temperature sst corresponding to these changes a significant decrease in rainfall during the dry season has been documented in the upper amazon basin since the 1970s espinoza et al 2006 2011 including an increase in the frequency of dry days since 1986 espinoza et al 2016 hydrological conditions are expected to change further with climate change rainfall is projected to increase in western amazonia during the wet season contributing to augmented mean and maximum discharge in large rivers draining the andes guimberteau et al 2013 boisier et al 2015 zulkalfi et al 2016 these changes would lead to an average increase of three months in the duration of inundation by the end of the 21st century langerwisch et al 2013 and to more widespread flooding over peruvian floodplains in western amazonia sorribas et al 2016 this paper is a contribution to the analysis of key parameters of the flood recession period dates of beginning and end of the low water period duration of the low water period speed of water falling and rising occurrence of repiquetes in the upper amazon basin at the tamshiyacu station and their evolution during the 1985 2015 period section 2 describes the data and methodologies on which this study is based section 3 describes the time evolution of the main parameters of the flood recession period they will be related to rainfall averaged in the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu and to the frequency of dry and wet days in this basin results are synthetized in section 4 and extensions of this preliminary work are suggested 2 data and methods 2 1 data the national meteorology and hydrology service of peru senamhi provided high quality daily water level data for the amazon river at tamshiyacu fig 1 b these data are gathered by the national observation service sno hybam geodynamical hydrological and biogeochemical control of erosion alteration and material transport in the amazon orinoco and congo basins daily water level values are available as of 1985 sno hybam also provided hybam observed precipitation data hop a gridded dataset for the entire amazon basin derived from 752 meteorological stations in five countries espinoza et al 2009a data are collected by the national institutions in charge of hydro meteorological monitoring national agency of water ana in brazil senamhi in peru and bolivia the national meteorology and hydrology institute inamhi in ecuador and the hydrology meteorology and environmental studies institute ideam in colombia the hop dataset is available from 1980 to 2009 on a daily time step and a 1 x1 grid guimberteau et al 2012 in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin delimited by the tamshiyacu hydrological station basin integrated rainfall is computed from 234 meteorological stations from the hop dataset espinoza et al 2011 for more details about quality control of rainfall data and geostatistical interpolation of rainfall observations see guimberteau et al 2012 gridded hop daily data are freely available in netcdf format at www so hybam org over the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu monthly wet day frequency wdf is defined as the frequency of days with rainfall greater than 10mm which is about twice the mean annual rainfall in the basin estimated at 4 8mm day espinoza et al 2011 monthly dry day frequency ddf is defined as the frequency of days with rainfall less than 1mm espinoza et al 2016 these data are derived from hop 2 2 definition of the flood recession parameters in the upper amazon basin at tamshiyacu the amazon river up to the tamshiyacu station the first gauging station downstream from the confluence of the marañón and ucayali rivers fig 1a has a huge drainage 750 000km2 half of which is in the andes above 500m fig 1a the long term mean discharge at tamshiyacu is 32 000m3 s about 16 of the amazon discharge at the estuary espinoza et al 2006 2009b fig 1b shows the average annual cycles of basin averaged rainfall and water level at tamshiyacu from may when the highest water level values are observed to april rainfall peaks at the end of february about 7 5mm day and the lowest amounts are observed in august about 2mm day accordingly with the 2 months lag between rainfall and discharge in this basin espinoza et al 2006 2011 the peak water level occurs at the very beginning of may 9 2m and the lowest level in mid september 1 9m the range between the two levels is about 7 3m the water recedes rapidly as the dry season starts concomitantly in most of the sub basins of the upper amazon basin fig 1b in contrast the water rises more slowly as the onset of the rainy season occurs earlier in the tropical ucayali sub basin and later in the equatorial marañón sub basin espinoza et al 2009b the huge size of the basin is the reason why the combinations of different hydro climatic regimes produce such hybrid regimes on this topic see for instance molinier et al 1996 ronchail et al 2006 ovando et al 2016 centiles of the water level time series are used to define critical hydrological dates and periods during the annual hydrological cycle focusing on the flood recession period the following are working definitions of the different parameters for the purpose of this study the duration of the low water lw period is defined as a portion of the year when the daily water level is below the lower tercile c33 4 5m of the 1985 2015 period fig 1b the beginning of the lw period is the first date with a water level below c33 first c33 during at least 10days and the end of the lw period is the date following the first c33 with a water level above c33 during at least 10days second c33 the first c33 occurs july 20 on average and the second c33 on november 11 table 1 a the speed at which the water falls before the low water period is estimated by computing the number of days between the first 66th centile c66 7 3m and the first c33 on average the first c66 occurs on june 13 and the first c33 occurs 38days later the speed at which the water rises after the low water period is estimated by computing the number of days between the second c33 and the first following c66 it is remarkable that the average of annual c66 dates january 19 table 1a is not the same as the date of c66 computed on the mean 1985 2015 cycle february 17 fig 1b this is because the water rise is far from linear after reaching c66 the water level may fall again for a while and then begin to rise again finally repiquetes inversions in direction sign of water level change greater or equal to 1cm in amplitude are also considered during the flood recession cycle they are considered when the stage returns to its former level after the inversion from may to september 2 3 statistical methods to identify temporal trends in time series we use the parametric pearson coefficient r and the rank based non parametric spearman spearman 1904 and kendall tests kendall 1975 statistical breaks in the time series are evaluated using the pettitt method pettitt 1979 a non parametric test based on changes in the average and the range of the series the lee and heghinian bayesian test lee and heghinian 1977 which uses the average as an indicator of change in the time series thanks to an a posteriori student s distribution and the hubert segmentation procedure hubert et al 1989 which verifies whether differences in average and standard deviation among periods are significant composite analysis is used to compare groups of years with hydrological parameter values lower than the first tercile to years with parameter values higher than the last tercile during the 1985 2009 period the common period for rainfall and hydrological data this enables us to compare water level rainfall dry day frequency ddf days with rainfall 1mm day wet day frequency wdf days with rainfall 10mm day during years with early and late beginning of the low water period early and late ending long and short duration of the low water period and rapid and slow decrease and increase of the water level the student test allows comparison of the difference between the averages of two sub samples 3 evolution of parameters of the flood recession period 3 1 the beginning of the low water lw period during the 1985 2015 period the water level in the amazon river reaches the 66th centile c66 7 3m on june 13 on average this date changes over time occurring as early as the beginning of may in 1995 or later at the end of july 1989 but there is no notable trend or break table 1a the mean date of the beginning of the lw period defined by the 33rd centile c33 4 5m is july 20 table 1a it used to happen earlier late june in the middle of the 1990s and later in august at the beginning of the 21st century but no significant trend is observed in this time series fig 2 fig 3 shows the composites of water level and rainfall during years with early and late onset of the lw period years with an early onset are characterized by a lower than usual water level during the falling water period and the entire lw period until october fig 3a these years include those with the lowest rainfall described in the literature i e 1995 1998 and 2005 espinoza et al 2011 marengo et al 2008 2011 zeng et al 2008 in contrast years with a late onset are characterized by water levels that are higher than usual during the falling water period from june until the beginning of the lw period fig 3a rainfall is lower during years with an early onset of the lw period than during years with a late onset fig 3c the differences are significant at the 90 level from march to early may and at the 95 level from the end of may until mid june 1 2mm day and from the end of june until july 10 1 5mm day this probably corresponds to rainfall over the northern part of upper amazon basin marañón basin where rainfall is more abundant during the autumn and austral winter compared to the ucayali basin espinoza et al 2009a in accordance with these results wet day frequency wdf values are high low in june and july during years with a late early onset p 0 1 fig 4 a and dry day frequency ddf values are high low p 0 1 in may july and september during years with an early late onset fig 4c 3 2 the end of the low water lw period the end of the lw period generally occurs at the beginning of november with dates varying substantially from the end of september as in 1992 to the beginning of february year 1 as in 2010 table 1a a composite of early ending episodes shows a higher than usual water level during the peak of the lw period and a sharp rise in october and november fig 3b while the composite of late ending episodes is characterized by very low water levels during the peak of the lw period september and water levels below average from october to late december the corresponding difference in rainfall between late and early endings is significant p 0 1 during a few days from mid to late august 0 75mm day fig 3d comparing dry day frequency ddf during late and early endings it appears to be slightly higher from july to october and significant p 0 1 in september fig 4d when the end of the lw period occurs later than usual it is noteworthy that an early ending of the lw period is followed by a stop in water rising from november to january fig 3b and is accompanied by a consistent decrease in wdf fig 4b conversely after a late ending the water level increases more abruptly fig 3b in association with heavy rains fig 3d and high wdf in december fig 4b such an abrupt transition has been observed for example from the extreme september 2010 very low discharge 8300m3 s 1 to one of the highest discharges in april 2011 49 500m3 s 1 recorded at tamshiyacu espinoza et al 2012b a significant positive trend in the date of the end of the lw period r2 0 24 p 0 01 is detected table 1a and fig 2 a significant p 0 10 break point is also observed in 1998 with later dates afterward the end of the lw period occurs at the end of october before 1998 and at the end of november afterward fig 2 this result is consistent with other studies by the authors about trends and breaks in the water level during different periods of the year not shown which highlight the decrease in the september october november son water level r2 0 2 p 0 02 during the 1985 2015 period with a break in 1994 detected by all the tests not shown there is also a significant relationship r2 0 63 p 0 001 between the date of the end of the lw period and the son water level the positive trend of the date of the end of the lw period may be related to the positive trend in ddf in the southern ucayali basin fig 4e 3 3 duration of the low water lw period fig 5 a compares years with short and a long lw duration during years with long lw periods water level is below average from june until the end of the year the water level reaches values as low as one meter or less during the two first weeks of september short lw periods in contrast are characterized by above average water levels especially from mid july until the end of the year the lw period generally lasts 114days between the first july 20 and the second november 11 c33 but it has been as short as 73days in 1986 a year with significant inundations and as long as 165 and 225days during the 2005 and 2010 dry years respectively table 1b and fig 2 fig 2 shows that the duration of the lw period has regularly exceeded 100days since 2005 and that it was nearly a month shorter at the beginning of the studied period a significant trend r2 0 15 p 0 05 is observed in this series as well as a rupture in 1994 as indicated by the pettit test the duration of the lw period was 93days before 1994 and it increased to 125days afterward table 1b other studies by the authors about trends and breaks in the water level during different periods of the year not shown demonstrates that the date of the break in the duration of the lw period is the same as that observed in the son water level series the two series are strongly correlated r2 0 66 p 0 001 again these results are consistent with an upward trend in the frequency of dry days in the upper amazon basin fig 4e and with a break in this time series in 1995 espinoza et al 2016 the duration of the lw period is strongly and positively correlated with the date of the end of the lw period r2 0 66 p 0 001 and negatively correlated with the date of the beginning of the lw period r2 0 30 p 0 001 six out of eight years with a short duration are also years with an early ending and five out of eight years with a long duration are also years with a late ending more rainfall than normal is registered when the duration of the lw period is shorter than usual fig 5b particularly during 10days at the end of june beginning of july 1 3mm day p 0 05 and from mid august to the first days of september 1mm day p 0 05 similarly the number of wet days is significantly higher p 0 1 in july when the lw duration is shorter than usual 1 4days instead of 0 fig 5c when the lw period is long the number of dry days is generally higher from july to october and is significantly higher p 0 05 in july and september 8 8days instead of 5 4 in july and 3 7 instead of 1 4 in september fig 5d it is noteworthy that after a long lw period the water level increases regularly and rapidly fig 5a in association with an onset of the rainy season that occurs later and more vigorously than usual rainfall fig 5b and the number of wet days fig 5c are higher than usual in november and december the opposite is true when the lw period is shorter than usual rainfall and wet days are less abundant and frequent from november to january and the water level remains around 600cm until the end of january 3 4 speed of water falling and rising the speed of the water falling and rising is measured by the numbers of days between the first 66th centile c66 7 3m and the first c33 4 5m for falling water and between the second c33 and the second c66 for rising water the average duration of water falling between the mean date of the first c66 june 13 and the mean date of the first c33 july 20 table 1a is 38days and the mean speed of water falling is 7 4cm day this value is similar to the speed estimated by coomes et al 2016 for the station at iquitos during the 1968 2013 period these values vary between 12days 23cm day in 1988 and 85days 3 3cm day in 2004 table 1c and fig 6 a the speed of water rising is much lower as noted by hiraoka 1985 the average duration between the second c33 and the second c66 is 70days 4cm day and varies from 20days 14cm day in 1993 149days 1 9cm day in 1985 table 1c and fig 7 a unlike water falling which shows considerable interannual variability but no trend fig 6a the speed of the water rising increases with time that is the number of days separating the second c33 and c66 decreases significantly during the 1985 2015 period r2 0 22 p 0 02 table 1c and fig 7a during the first 10 years of the studied period the water level rose from c33 to c66 in about three months 82days on average and the interannual variability was very high the coefficient of variation of the 1985 1996 period is 0 51 since the late 1990s the water level has increased from c33 to c66 in about 50days and even more rapidly since 2009 and the coefficient of variation for the 1997 2015 period decreased to 0 39 figs 6b and 7b show that years with a rapid slow water level decrease are characterized by a higher lower than usual water level during the former flood period years with a rapid slow increase are characterized by a high very low water level during the flood recession period moreover rapid water increases are distinguished by a regular increase of the water level until the beginning of the next year while slow increases are characterized by a break in the water rising from december to mid january fig 7b a rapid falling of the water level compared to a slow falling is related to higher than usual rainfall significant especially in april 0 9mm day p 0 05 and to rainfall lower than usual in part of july 0 8mm day p 0 05 fig 6c consistently a rapid falling is related to a low number of wet days fig 6d and a high number of dry days fig 6e in july while the opposite is observed when the water level falls slowly a rapid increase of the water level after the recession period can be related to higher rainfall than when the increase is slow at the beginning of june 0 7mm day p 0 1 in august 0 7mm day p 0 05 and also from mid november until the end of december 1 2mm day p 0 1 fig 7c consistently a rapid increase is also associated with a high number of wet days in june and august and in november and december p 0 05 fig 7d i e during the lw period and at the beginning of the rainy season and with fewer dry days in august and october p 0 1 fig 7e other studies by the authors about rainfall trends not shown highlight that a positive trend in november december basin averaged rainfall at tamshiyacu r2 0 21 p 0 01 may explain the trend in the velocity of the water rising during the study period not shown the speed of water rising is not significantly related to the duration of the lw period 3 5 repiquetes repiquetes which are inversions in direction sign of stage change greater or equal to 1cm in amplitude are analyzed during the recession period at the tamshiyacu station fig 8 a shows the example of 2007 08 when 10 repiquetes higher than 1cm and six higher than 20cm are observed between mid june and october in association with heavy rainfall during the preceding days an analysis of the distribution of repiquetes from may to september shows that the most frequent are the weak ones those that are lower than 10cm 110 out of 235 fig 8b however 48 out of 235 events exceed a 50cm rise 18 a one meter rise and three a two meter rise the highest 2 64m was observed in june 1990 and the two others in august 1997 2 44m and july 2002 2 27m the frequency of small repiquetes is in accordance with coomes et al 2016 but these authors found repiquetes exceeding five meters at the iquitos station and for a different period 1968 2013 repiquetes lower than 20cm are more frequent in may one per year on average and then are equally distributed from may to september fig 8c while those higher than 20cm are more frequent from the first fortnight of july until the first fortnight of september fig 8d generally there is an average of 7 7 repiquetes by year three if only those higher than 20cm are considered which is in accordance with coomes et al 2016 who found five to six events per year in iquitos the frequency of repiquetes shows an important interannual variability 18 events were registered in 1987 but only four in 1997 as there can be none of them as in 2000 fig 9 a neither the annual number of repiquetes nor the number of repiquetes by elevation range shows any trend fig 9a nevertheless a sudden decrease in the number of weak repiquetes is observed in may since the beginning of the 21st century fig 9b which is not related to changes in rainfall while small repiquetes generally last less than a week those higher than 20cm last 14days on average from the beginning of the inversion until the stage returns to its former level this result is similar to coomes et al 2016 basin averaged daily rainfall up to tamshiyacu has been analyzed during the 10days before and after the beginning d0 of a repiquete event from d 10 to d 10 rising of less than one meter is associated with prior rainfall generally exceeding 3mm the 15 may to 15 september average daily rainfall during three to four days about one week before the beginning of the repiquete event fig 10 a it is noteworthy that weak repiquetes lower than 20cm are related to a rainfall peak on the ninth and eighth days before the beginning of the repiquete d 9 and d 8 those between 20 and 50cm to a peak d 7 and those between 50 and 100cm to a high peak d 6 the rainfall peaks are lower 4 5mm day for repiquetes lower than 50cm and higher 5mm day for repiquetes higher than 50cm rising of more than one meter is associated with daily rainfall exceeding 5mm day during nearly the entire week preceding the repiquete and average accumulated excess rainfall during the entire period is 20mm during the very strong event in july 2002 rainfall excesses when compared to average rainfall reached 70mm during the period between d 7 and d 2 analyzing the intensity of rainfall it appears that a week before a small repiquete daily rainfall higher than 5mm represents about 30 of daily values fig 10b the strongest repiquete events are more frequently related to intense rainfall 40 of the d 7 to d 3days show rainfall exceeding 5mm day in conclusion strong events appear to be related to heavy and continuous rainfall during the week preceding the repiquete smaller repiquete events in contrast are related to a peak in rainfall about a week before the beginning of the event 4 synthesis and perspectives this work contributes to the analysis of key hydrological parameters of the flood recession period dates of beginning and end of the low water period duration of the low water period speed of water falling and rising occurrence of repiquetes in the upper amazon basin at the tamshiyacu station peru and their evolution during the 1985 2015 period the lower tercile of the daily water level 4 5m in the upper amazon river at tamshiyacu peru during the 1985 2015 period is used to define the low water lw period this period begins on average at the end of july and ends in the first days of november lasting about four months the starting date of the lw period varies little during the study period and depends on the amount of rainfall observed from the end of may to the beginning of july the ending date varies substantially over time however and occurs later now end of november than it used to end of october with a significant break in 1998 consequently the duration of the lw period which varies considerably at an interannual time scale from 2 5 to 7 5 months also shows a positive trend with a break in 1994 it lasted 93days on average before 1994 and 125days afterward both variables are highly correlated with the september october november son water level which decreases significantly during the study period and also shows a break in 1994 the trend in the date of the end of the lw period and in the duration of the low stage can be attributed to the increase in dry day frequency reported in the central and southern parts of the upper amazon basin espinoza et al 2016 this is also consistent with the increasing length of the dry season documented in the southern amazon li and fu 2006 carvalho et al 2011 marengo et al 2011 dubreuil et al 2012 fu et al 2013 yin et al 2014 arias et al 2015 debortoli et al 2015 espinoza et al 2016 the duration of falling and rising water level is defined as the number of days between the first and the second terciles of water level before and after the lw season respectively while the water falling duration 38days on average did not change over time the water rising duration at the end of the lw period decreased from three to two months during the study period a rapidly falling water level is related to decreased rainfall in july and an increase in dry day frequency a rapid rising is related to abundant and intense rainfall in november december which also characterizes late endings and long durations of the lw period the positive trend in rainfall in november december may explain the increasing speed of the water rising the choice of thresholds for the flood recession period parameters c33 c66 is actually a limitation of the study it is unclear how the results of this study particularly the observed trends might depend on the chosen value however similar results are obtained when defining the lw period with c20 the 20th centile instead of c33 not shown repiquetes or inversions in the direction sign of stage changes exceeding 1cm are frequent eight per year on average or three when considering those higher than 20cm during the 1985 2015 period 18 events exceeded a one meter rise and three exceeded two meters they are related to unusually high and intense rainfall peaks occurring six to nine days before the beginning of the repiquete depending on its intensity the strongest ones which are more frequent between july and september are associated with rainfall events exceeding 5mm day during nearly the entire week preceding the beginning of the repiquete these events show no trend during the study period our results show that the occurrence of extremes and changes in the parameters of the flood recession period is closely related to changes in rainfall during specific periods of the annual cycle rainfall itself is modulated by interannual and long term variability in the sea surface temperatures sst of the pacific and atlantic oceans and in regional atmospheric circulation marengo 2004 marengo and espinoza 2015 yoon and zeng 2010 satyamurty et al 2013 espinoza et al 2009a 2013 2016 among others during the austral summer for example precipitation is related to the phases of the el niño southern oscillation events with more rainfall during la niña events when the waters of the equatorial pacific are colder than usual and when an abundant moisture transport flux is observed from the tropical north atlantic and the caribbean sea toward the northwestern amazon dry events and high dry day frequencies during the austral winter are related to warmer sst in the tropical north atlantic and to weaker than usual trade winds and vapor transport toward the amazon and enhanced subsidence over the amazon basin they may be amplified by el niño events during the preceding summer zeng et al 2008 marengo et al 2008 2011 espinoza et al 2011 2016 the current increase in dry day frequency and in the duration of the low water period may also be related to a warming trend in the tropical north atlantic marengo et al 2008 2011 yoon and zeng 2010 fernandes et al 2015 espinoza et al 2016 and to land use change in the amazon basin wright et al 2017 relationships between aspects of intra seasonal variability of atmospheric circulation and the occurrence of repiquetes could be analyzed former works show that southern circulation patterns in south america associated with cold fronts are conducive to the development of convection and to rainfall in winter marengo et al 1997 garreaud and wallace 1998 espinoza et al 2012a as a consequence they may favor repiquetes the relationships between rainfall and ocean atmosphere conditions and those between rainfall and flood recession parameters may indicate that these parameters could be predictable at intra seasonal and interannual time scales further work could allow the development of an early warning system to alert farmers of the characteristics of the forthcoming recessional period or the imminent occurrence of a repiquete our results indicate that current hydrology patterns could be positive for recessional agriculture in peru s amazonian lowlands the increased length of the low water period and the decrease in the minimum water level could mean that more land may be available for agriculture during a longer time period which would favor crop maturation but repiquetes one of the greatest risks to rice crops list and coomes 2017 and more abrupt water rising as documented in this study could jeopardize crops of the recessional season decreased precipitation and an increase in dry day frequency could also affect agriculture in a region where there is no irrigation verifying the relationship between hydroclimatology and crop yields would imply 1 adapting the definition of parameters and the selected threshold to the crops of interest vegetation zones related to fluvial dynamics imply that crops with shorter growing seasons are located near the water while perennials and crops with longer growing seasons are cultivated on higher ground denevan 1984 hiraoka 1985 and 2 taking into account other variables such as erosion mendoza et al 2016 sediment quality plant diseases and

introduced to validate existing uhpf guidance as well as provide a nonlinear uhpf scaling relation when effective rainfall does not match that of the uh design event finally a method for quantifying the effect of hydrologic parameter and precipitation magnitude uncertainty on uhpf are demonstrated the goose creek facility is shown to maintain dam safety given current uhpf guidance as it was designed using 25 year return period rainfall keywords unit hydrograph peaking factor dam safety return period rainfall nonlinear scaling relationship 1 introduction 1 1 background in the past the most common rainfall runoff models used in the u s for dam construction usace 1959 1963 1993 employed the unit hydrograph uh theory sherman 1932 dam safety modeling guidelines from across the world specify or recommend the use of simplified hydrograph estimating routines such as the unit hydrograph uh method institute of hydrology 1999 pilgrim 1987 according to sherman 1932 who originally proposed the uh concept the uh of a watershed is the outflow resulting from one unit of direct runoff generated uniformly over the drainage area at a uniform rainfall rate during a specified period of rainfall duration this implies that the ordinates of any hydrograph resulting from a quantity of runoff producing rainfall of unit duration would be equal to corresponding ordinates of a uh for the same areal distribution of rainfall multiplied by the ratio of rainfall excess values for the past 50 years u s army corps of engineers usace practice has been to increase the peak of a uh linearly in relation to the observed rainfall by an additional 25 50 when the observed rainfall excess is significantly greater than the modeled rainfall excess used to create the uh usace 1991 this multiplicative factor is typically referred to as the unit hydrograph peaking factor uhpf the usace policy contained in er 1110 8 2 fr usace 1991 requires that dams designed constructed or operated by the usace will not create a threat of loss of life or inordinate property damage for a dam to be considered hydrologically adequate and in compliance with usace policy an appropriate embankment spillway and regulating outlet must be designed to safely pass an inflow design flood with adequate freeboard if such a structure is necessary usace engineering practice utilizes extreme flood events to evaluate and manage flood risk at most dams extreme flood events are those events defined by large magnitudes and long return periods however it is unclear whether the simplifications employed for selecting design extreme flood events has led to over or under estimations of the watershed runoff and in turn over or under estimations of the required dam size it is thus pertinent to investigate the impact of extreme flood events using physically based rainfall runoff models that were not available during the design and construction of most usace dams to improve dam safety estimates natural variability of environmental systems often causes linear transfer functions childs 1958 minshall 1960 ding 1974 kokkonen et al 2004 as assumed in uh theory to poorly characterize the range of possible outcomes from the same initial state linear transfer functions may be invalid due to multiple factors such as differences in the varying antecedent initial conditions such as soil moisture pradhan et al 2012 hendrickx et al 2016 runoff generation processes like infiltration excess downer and ogden 2004 saturation excess pradhan and ogden 2010 and hydro geomorphology urbanization and land use change ogden et al 2011 in most extreme flood investigations the uhpf is rarely analyzed thoroughly in the context of natural watershed variability variability ultimately manifests as uncertainty in the relationship between precipitation and flood likelihood a thorough analysis method relating hydrologic variables to the uhpf is essential to remove the assumption of linear behavior imposed by commonly employed empirical modeling methods the analysis should also consider and quantify any uncertainty to provide confidence information to decision makers physically based hydrologic modeling is capable of evaluating the non linearity of a watershed response szilagyi 2007 the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha model is a distributed parameter physically based numerical model that has been used by the usace in engineering hydrology downer et al 2016 erosion downer et al 2015 contaminant nutrient fate and transport pradhan et al 2014 as well as storm surge studies massey et al 2013 deploying a physically based hydrologic model will account for nonlinear watershed hydrological properties szilagyi 2007 as well as assist in developing a methodology to analyze improve the estimation of uhpf usace 1991 and rainfall excess relationships in different climatic regions of continental united states wolock et al 2004 1 2 purpose this study investigates the rainfall event magnitude associated with a usace recommended uhpf range between 1 25 and 1 5 to develop a relationship between uhpf and excess rainfall for the goose creek virginia study area using the gssha hydrologic model an uhpf scaling relationship for events of differing effective rainfalls is also provided to validate and supplement existing uhpf design guidance lastly a method for quantifying the effect of hydrologic parameter and precipitation magnitude uncertainty on uhpf are demonstrated to quantify uhpf confidence intervals a dam design deficiencies and modifications studies based on hydrologic analysis usace 1993 are not in the scope of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the goose creek watershed shown in fig 1 was selected as the study area the principal reason for selecting this watershed is a study by usace 1963 provides baseline uh data along with the standard practice in deriving the uh both of which are necessary to study the uh peaks for events of differing effective rainfalls and to develop the uhpf scaling relationship usace 1963 derives the standard uh in the goose creek watershed in loudoun county va latitude 39 019 longitude 77 577 area 878km2 the objectives of the 1963 study were the following to collect the maximum available information on uh methods and uh data to provide standardized methods terminology and forms for the presentation of uhs to present the accumulated data and information in a form useful to hydrologists the study area is in the eastern united states bounded by the potomac river and maryland on the northeast draining eastward into the potomac river the climate of virginia is diverse and varies from warm and temperate in the eastern coastal areas which have temperatures moderated by the atlantic ocean to the cooler continental climate of the mountainous counties in the north and west sanford et al 2011 the mean annual temperature is between 12 and 13 c the rainfall pattern varies across virginia and is affected by topography in the north and west and by the presence of tropical moisture systems in the south and east the mean annual precipitation in the study area is 1067mm temperature and rainfall are adequate to support a substantial agriculture industry with crop and pasture lands evenly scattered between forests of mixed deciduous and evergreen trees across most of virginia including the watershed sanford et al 2011 2 2 data sources the hourly precipitation data was obtained from dulles international airport in dulles va id no coop 448903 coop 2017 the airport is approximately 6km away from the study watershed the discharge data at the outlet in fig 1 were from u s geological survey hydro climatic data network station no 1644000 slack and landwehr 1992 land use data was obtained from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 the soil data were obtained from the natural resources conservation service soil survey geographic database soil survey 2017 the probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates were obtained from the hydrometeorological report no 51 usdoc 1978 historical precipitation for goose creek is well characterized by the precipitation frequency atlas 14 volume 2 of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2017 the precipitation frequency atlas is the standard source of historical extreme precipitation information available in the continental united states the return period precipitation was estimated from the noaa frequency atlas 14 3 methodology two different methods were used to derive uhs for the goose creek watershed utilizing historic discharge and rainfall data utilizing gssha to perform two dimensional 2d watershed modeling to derive a uh from the return period events and the pmp event 3 1 utilizing historic discharge and rainfall data to derive uh as per uh theory the following steps were taken to derive a uh from the observed discharge 1 separate the base flow from the observed streamflow hydrograph to obtain the direct runoff hydrograph qdrh the steps for base flow separation as per linsley et al 1975 are as follows a identify when direct runoff begins i e end of the base flow only period b estimate the duration of the direct runoff period using the empirical relationship below 1 n 0 8 a 0 2 where n is the time from the peak of the hydrograph to the point where the direct runoff finishes in days a is the basin area in square kilometers linsley et al 1975 linsley et al 1975 empirical formula could be complemented with other methodologies based on the use of numerical filter methods willems 2009 or on the analysis of the recession limb gabriel martin et al 2017 1 draw a line connecting the start of the rising limb and the inflection point defined by n in eq 1 as shown by the base flow line in fig 2 for the direct runoff this line separates the direct runoff hydrograph from base flow hydrograph then compute the volume of direct runoff hydrograph vdrh this volume must be equal to the volume of the effective rainfall hyetograph erh 2 v d r h t q d r h t d t where t is the time 1 express vdrh in equivalent units of depth vdrhd 3 v d r h d v d r h a b a s i n where abasin is the basin area 1 obtain the uh by normalizing the qdrh normalizing implies dividing the ordinates of the qdrh by the vdrh in equivalent units of depth in equation 3 4 u h q d r h v d r h d 1 determine the duration d of the erh associated with the uh obtained in step 4 above fig 2 shows the derivation of the uh for the goose creek watershed from the december 10 2003 observed rainfall and discharge data is not often available for isolated storms of sufficient runoff volume to derive uhs if an isolated event is not available the investigator must develop uhs from the records of complex storms with durations of rainfall excess that differ appreciably from the unit duration desired in fig 2 the 6h uh was derived from the 9h uh from s hydrographs usace 1963 the guidelines for computation of s hydrographs and derivation of uhs from s hydrographs is found in usace 1963 3 2 utilizing gssha to perform two dimensional 2d watershed modeling to derive a uh this study deploys the gssha model to transform extreme event rainfall events and pmp into corresponding design discharges gssha computes one dimensional 1d infiltration 2d overland flow and 1d stream flow to simulate the overland runoff to streams and channel transport process to catchment outlet the green and ampt infiltration scheme green and ampt 1911 was employed to simulate the partitioning of input precipitation at the land surface the runoff generated in each computational grid cell flows to adjacent cells through a 2d finite volume numerical scheme a 30m grid size was selected that resulted in 973163 computational grids within the catchment surface runoff is coupled to channel routing where lateral inflow from surface runoff grid cells is numerically routed through a 1d finite volume scheme 3 2 1 infiltration model the infiltration model partitions the rainfall forcing between infiltration and overland runoff the rate of infiltration is governed by the soil physical properties which vary with the soil type the soil map in fig 3 a was employed to define these properties the following are the soil physical parameters specified in the infiltration model effective porosity cm3 cm3 field capacity cm3 cm3 wilting point cm3 cm3 residual saturation cm3 cm3 pore size distribution cm cm saturated hydraulic conductivity cm hr wetting front suction head cm 3 2 2 routing model gssha employs an explicit finite volume scheme to route water for both 1d channel flow and 2d overland flow where flow rates are computed based on heads and volumes are updated based on the computed flow rates the friction slope between one grid cell and its neighbors is calculated as the difference in water surface elevations divided by the grid cell size compared with the kinematic wave approach this diffusive wave approach allows gssha to route water through pits or depressions and regions of adverse slope 3 2 3 calibration single event simulations targeting watershed runoff flood peaks rely mainly on the short term processes of infiltration and runoff routing where evapotranspiration is negligible relative to rainfall as the focus of this study is a single event based runoff peaks focus was given to the infiltration and routing processes defined in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 for single events calibration of the distributed gssha hydrologic model in watersheds is simplified by assignment of soils and hydraulic parameters based on a soil textural index given in fig 3a and a land use index given in fig 3b which limits the number of parameter values that must be estimated in previous gssha model calibrations ogden et al 2011 pradhan et al 2014 parameter values were adjusted manually to achieve an acceptable fit to the observed hydrograph with parameter values bounded by physical understanding and the experience with the model this study undertook a similar manual calibration approach for the december 10 2003 event as shown in fig 4 a table 1 shows the infiltration process parameters taken account of in this study apart from hydraulic conductivity the parameters in table 1 were obtained from rawls et al 1983 based on the soil classifications in fig 3a hydraulic conductivity in table 1 was manually calibrated to account for impervious land developed areas in fig 3b with more than 20 impervious land cover were assigned a significantly lower value of hydraulic conductivity 0 0005cm h this impervious developed area covers less than 3 of the watershed gssha implements manning s equation to relate surface roughness to flow rate in which case the hydraulic roughness is represented by the manning s roughness coefficient n manning 1891 for each land use type shown in fig 3b a manning s roughness coefficient was calibrated within the range of physical values table 2 lists the calibrated manning s roughness coefficients in the study area the calibrated outflow hydrograph for december 10 2003 event was compared to the observed discharge at the outlet as displayed in fig 4a nash sutcliffe efficiency in fig 4a was 90 3 3 calibration verification the rainfall event of 16 may 2003 shown in fig 4b was employed in gssha simulation to verify the model calibration the model parameters used in this verification were those that resulted from the model calibration of section 3 2 3 initial soil moisture condition for the verification period can vary from that of the calibration period ogden et al 2011 additionally seasonal variation in the water table directly affects the base flow the field observations such as latron and gallart 2008 penna et al 2011 peters et al 2003 and various watershed modeling approach such as pradhan et al 2006 2008 2010 suggest that higher base flow signifies a higher water table and the higher water table signifies lower soil moisture deficit and higher effective soil moisture content in the vadose zone the yearly long term series of instantaneous discharge from the u s geological survey hydro climatic data network station no 1644000 shows that the base flow for the calibration period is higher than the verification period therefore the estimated effective soil moisture for the calibration period was 0 3cm3 cm3 and that for the verification event was 0 2cm3 cm3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency in fig 4b was 73 which was deemed reasonable to employ the model in subsequent efforts although the grid resolution effects on the topographic pradhan et al 2006 2008 and land surface details usery et al 2004 are not taken into account in this study a 30m grid size was selected as a compromise between the number of computational grids and the ability to describe topographic and other geospatial details the seasonal change of soil thermodynamics and its effect on the soil hydrologic parameter values pradhan et al 2013 was not taken into account in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 uhpf analysis on 6h accumulated precipitation the 6h historic cumulative event precipitation was obtained from the noaa atlas 14 which gives the 1 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period events in the goose creek watershed as shown in fig 5 a to derive these series noaa collects precipitation measurements from all available sources performs data correction and outlier removal and computes extreme event magnitudes for various durations and return periods using a generalized extreme value gev distribution function fit using l moments to the annual maximum series additionally noaa determines data processing confidence intervals by applying a monte carlo procedure to the gev distribution to obtain the 90 confidence limit the 5 lower bound and 95 upper bound noaa confidence limits only characterize the certainty of the data processing technique used to obtain the return period estimates additional sources of uncertainty such as gage clustering and imperfect historical knowledge are not represented and would only increase the noaa calculated uncertainty limit even so the user of gev data should account for the statistical confidence during hydrologic analysis the noaa confidence intervals at each return period were applied to the watershed and are given in fig 5a noaa precipitation frequency atlas also provides the temporal event profiles event accumulation rates were determined by applying a fixed window at the selected duration to the precipitation series the deciles of the accumulation rate for each duration are provided graphically from these events in addition the event temporal distributions are further divided into quartiles by magnitude with the accumulation deciles calculated for each magnitude quartile design return period events were created by choosing 6h accumulation return period precipitation magnitudes in combination with an appropriate temporal distribution provided by the noaa pfds the return period events along with the pmp event were used as input conditions for the calibrated gssha model the results of which are shown in fig 5a fig 5b shows the gssha model runoff simulation of the return period events fig 5c shows the uh obtained from the gssha model runoff simulations in fig 5b the procedure followed in deriving the uh in fig 5c is described in section 3 1 where the gssha simulated runoff was utilized instead of observed runoff table 3 shows the uhpf derived in terms of 0 25 year return period to 100 year return period the values under the headings peaking factor in terms of x year return period are the uhpfs representing the x year return period where x ranges from 0 25 to 100 the x year return period uhpfs in the rows are the uh peak values of the corresponding event types under heading event type normalized by uh peak value for that x year return period uh peak values are defined under heading unit hydrograph peak for example if the x is 0 25 all the uh peak values from 0 25 year return period to pmp are divided by the uh peak value of 0 25 year return period that is 112 6cm s cm in table 3 therefore table 3 represents a sensitivity analysis of the uhpfs to the return period used to normalize the peak of the uhs fig 6 was developed to illustrate table 3 where four bands are defined based on the uhpf value safe if the uhpf is less than 1 0 moderately safe if between 1 and 1 3 critical if between 1 3 and 1 5 and risky if exceeding 1 5 fig 6 shows that the uhs developed from events at or above the 5 year return period are well within the 1 25 1 5 uhpf range the uhs developed from 5 year return period and above fall into either the safe or moderately safe band in fig 6 table 3 and fig 6 also show that the uhpf from the 1 year return period rainfall uh is close to 1 5 at the pmp in other words the 1 year return period uh may fall into the critical band as shown in fig 6 table 3 and fig 6 show that uhpf from uh of the 0 25 year event is greater than 1 5 at pmp that is a 0 25 year return period uh may fall into the unsafe band as shown in fig 6 this case study in the goose creek watershed found that the upper limit of the uhpf for the uh peak published in the usace 1963 report was 0 9 and that for the uh in fig 2 was 1 4 the average rainfall published in the usace 1963 report was 135 millimeters mm in 36h this rainfall is equivalent to 25 year return period rainfall as per the pfds report the peak of the derived 6h uh for the usace 1963 published report was 189m3 s cm the rainfall for fig 2 was 42mm in 12h which is equivalent to 1 year return period rainfall as per the pfds report 4 2 uhpf analysis on 24h accumulated precipitation the 24h historic cumulative event precipitation was also obtained from the noaa atlas 14 pfds the pfds gives the 1 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period events in the goose creek watershed as shown in fig 7 a design return period events were created by choosing 24h accumulation return period precipitation magnitudes in combination with an appropriate temporal distribution provided by the noaa pfds the return period events are shown in fig 7a along with the pmp event that were employed in the goose creek gssha model fig 7b shows the runoff calculated by the gssha simulations for each of the return period events additionally fig 7c shows the uh obtained from the gssha runoff simulations in fig 7b the procedure followed in deriving the uh in fig 7c is given in section 3 1 where the gssha simulated runoff was utilized instead of historical observed runoff similar to table 3 table 4 represents a sensitivity analysis of the uhpf to the return period used to normalize the peak of the uhs fig 8 was developed to illustrate table 4 in comparison to fig 6 fig 8 shows that the uhpf for all combination of extreme rainfall events are well under the moderately safe limit of 1 3 in fig 8 even a 0 25 year return period uh may falls into the moderately safe band this analysis from fig 8 therefore shows that uhpf is less sensitive to the rainfall intensity as the design considered rainfall accumulation duration gets larger in the goose creek watershed 4 3 development of the uhpf and effective rainfall relationship a uh is derived from and valid for a specific set of storm properties interacting with a specific set of watershed properties the practicalities of engineering analysis often require application of this limited uh to other conditions beyond which it was originally derived including cases such as differing antecedent conditions or spatial precipitation distribution use of a uh under non derived conditions is valid only for a fully linear watershed without any randomness generating uncertainty a common uh use is the scaling of the uh peak when the effective rainfall of a considered event exceeds that of the design event usace practice has been to linearly increase the peak of a uh by an additional 25 to 50 when the rainfall excess of a considered event is significantly greater than the design runoff used to derive the uh usace 1991 this scale factor is intended to maintain a conservative design by correcting the uh for the nonlinear and uncertain watershed response however there is neither documentation underlying this recommendation nor guidance which defines the specific scale factor to be employed in scaling the uh to a larger magnitude event this study introduces the effective rainfall factor erf which is the ratio between the effective rainfall of a considered event and that of the design event for the same duration when the erf is less than one the considered event is of lower magnitude than the design event an erf greater than one implies that the considered event is of larger magnitude than the design event erf provides a means by which to relate the amount of design event exceedance to the peaking factor utilizing the effective rainfall from the gssha simulations given in tables 3 and 4 erf can be plotted as a function of peaking factor by again varying the return period of the design event collapsing all return periods onto a unique curve for each event duration yields a power scaling relationship as shown in fig 9 the uhpf has a strong dependence on the erf with some increased scatter around the trend as the erf becomes large produced by the short duration events the average uhpf for short duration events is greater than long duration for higher erf following intuition as rainfall will have less opportunity to infiltrate fig 9 facilitates evaluation of the usace design practice for scaling the uh as a function of effective rainfall an event with erf of 1 5 is an event 50 larger than the design event applying uh theory should result in a uhpf of at least 1 5 in a fully linear system response prior to the additional usace adjustment fig 9 shows that the predicted uhpf for erf is under 1 15 for the 6h event the lower predicted uhpf compared to uh theory is present across the all erf values greater than one less than erf of one the trend is reversed with higher peaking factors being predicted this difference in the predicted uhpf results from the nonlinearity of the watershed response captured by the distributed hydrologic model in the exceedance of the design event the usace design scaling practice is highly conservative the process displayed in fig 9 can be used to improve design processes employing uh methods to correct uhpf estimates for nonlinear behavior with study across additional watersheds using distributed hydrologic modeling the uhpf dependence on erf can be better characterized to establish a uhpf band for each event duration the uh erf can then be directly calculated from the precipitation depth of the design event and that of the considered event the uh erf value can then be utilized to determine the uhpf range with the final design value being a percentile in that uhpf range the 6h and the 24h cumulative precipitation was selected in this study for return period events as a compromise between rainfall duration intensity and areal distribution relationships areal rainfall patterns depend on the cumulative rainfall duration considered for areas of 500km2 to 800km2 the spatial standard deviation of hourly rainfall from the mean is 50 higher than that for 24h rainfall u s weather bureau 1957 1960 this shows that low accumulation duration rainfall with higher spatial non uniformity is not suitable from the unit hydrograph theory point of view on the other hand rainfall intensity is significantly reduced as the accumulation duration is increased de paola et al 2014 elsebaie 2012 mirhosseini et al 2014 detail study of this rainfall duration intensity and areal relationship is significant for generalization regionalization of the relationships developed in fig 9 expansion of present analysis to regional uhpf dependence on erf is left to subsequent efforts 4 4 land use uncertainty analysis as a simplification the uhpf is often considered independent of both the storm and watershed properties the assumption of storm independence as shown in the previous sections for the storm return period can lead to a lack of understanding of the design safety by underestimating discharge variability this lack of understanding extends readily to other storm and watershed parameters that may have an equal influence on the uhpf it is therefore important to utilize an approach which captures these properties as part of the uhpf analysis as an example of parametric uhpf analysis a case was examined for land use variability in the goose creek watershed to simulate both uncertainty in the spatial distribution of land use and increasing urbanization in the present case study the actual impervious area is less than 3 of the catchment area it was assumed that the watershed had urbanization levels of 0 1 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 75 of land area represented by the fraction of cells in the domain that were considered impervious to infiltration five synthetic infiltration maps were created for each urbanization level with cells in each coverage selected at random to be impervious cell selection was done by weighting the probability of drawing a cell inversely proportional to the distance from the outlet until the level was met those cells that were closer to the watershed entrance were therefore more likely to be chosen this was intended to represent real world cases where watersheds tend to urbanize from the downstream to the upstream tables 2 and 3 were employed to define the parameter values of modified land use maps each land use map was exposed to the same design storm event to isolate land use affects alone fig 10 shows the result of the analysis for each of the considered land use percentage the right axis given by the solid blue line shows the mean discharge of the five samples at each land use percentage the left axis given by the dotted red line provides the standard deviation at each land use percentage each quantity is given as a function of the event time the mean value remains largely unchanged across the events with standard deviations under 0 009m3 s this low value of standard deviation along with stable mean value shows that land use change effects on flood peaks are subdued during extreme rainfall events due to higher soil moisture and lower infiltration capacity as reflected by ogden et al 2011 though the mean in across events is similar the standard deviation varies within the individual events some land use percentages have the peak in standard deviation concurrently with the peak mean discharge others have standard deviation peaks offset from the mean peak such changes are important for understanding the peak event timing as there may be range of times over which the peak can occur taken together the mean and standard deviation curves in combination represent a two dimensional surface of the possible values the hydrograph could take as a function of event time and the independent variable of land use this type of parametric analysis provides insight into how to select hydrographs for uhpf analysis in the presence of variability and uncertainty of storm and watershed parameters by selecting the most critical storm and watershed properties for a watershed of interest curves such as fig 10 can be developed the extent to which the variable space was explored would depend largely on the strength of the hydrograph dependence on each property the computation power and the parameter selection techniques when this was fully explored a hydrograph would be produced that was at a given percentile of each of the independent variables the percentile would be chosen based on the amount of risk able to be accepted at the considered location because this nature of the dependence will vary greatly among watersheds a detailed demonstration of this technique is left as part of follow on efforts 4 5 precipitation magnitude uncertainty analysis an additional source of uhpf uncertainty results from the variable precipitation magnitude of the selected reference event use of a single deterministic reference event to establish an acceptable uhpf implies that the full flood and precipitation frequency curves are known with certainty as complete historical and meteorological knowledge is rarely available probabilistic techniques can be used to capture the various sources of uncertainty to establish a uhpf confidence interval the range and maximum value of the interval can then be incorporated as part of a dam safety assessment as a measure of risk or utilized as outlined in section 4 4 noaa atlas 14 provides three precipitation magnitudes occurring at the 5th 50th and 95th confidence intervals that equally satisfy the event return period as a result of its monte carlo data analysis selection of any depth that lies on the interval would be an acceptable event to represent the return period of interest the range of the calculated precipitation magnitude data analysis confidence intervals is a proxy for the amount of risk accepted by an installation if data processing uncertainty is not considered when calculating the uhpf if a precipitation depth and resulting flood at a low confidence interval is utilized as the design event the uhpf may be underestimated resulting in an unsafe design similarly if a precipitation depth and flood at a high confidence interval is utilized as the norming event a design may be overly conservative leading to increased construction maintenance costs the effect of data processing uncertainty on uhpfs at goose creek was determined by applying the 5 and 95 confidence interval precipitation depths to the watershed in addition to the 50 value fig 11 shows the variation in the uhpf at each return period normalized to the 5 year 50th percentile value the 50th percentile is given by the black line the 95th percentile is given by the upper error bar and the 5th by the lower error bar the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile is as large as 0 052 for the 50 year return period 4 7 of the 50th percentile value while not evident directly at the goose creek watershed this difference in the selected precipitation depth due to data processing uncertainty alone is sufficiently large that it could cause some reference events to become inadequate at maintaining a uhpf below 1 5 at other watersheds the large difference between the percentiles supports greater conservativeness in choosing the precipitation depth confidence level used to establish uhpfs knowledge of the uhpf as a function of return period permits inverse calculation for the return period associated with a desired uhpf magnitude this knowledge is again useful as a proxy for the amount of risk accepted during a uhpf analysis as excess precipitation is approximately linear with increasing precipitation depth a simple logarithmic transform is typically sufficient to extrapolate the uhpf beyond modeled return periods by taking the normalization events at increasing confidence intervals to obtain the uhpf trend and extrapolating the return period at the desired uhpf a range of return periods can be established from lowest safest to highest least safe the return period range informs one as to how sensitive the analysis is to the normalization value equally the lowest range value can determine if a design is sufficiently conservative to meet the return period requirements at the maximum accepted uhpf the procedure above can be applied to determine a return period associated with the pmp as well as the commonly utilized maximum uhpf value of 1 5 although by definition the pmp does not have a return period it is nonetheless a useful exercise the intersection of the uhpf trend lines at each percentile with the uhpf evaluated at the pmp represents the location where the curve in fig 11 becomes asymptotic the magnitude of the return period at the intersection characterizes the maximum protection of the system under the assumptions used to formulate the uhpf analysis table 5 gives the expression for the trend line at each confidence percentile in fig 11 as well as the coefficient of determination the fit to each trend line and in particular the 50th percentile correlates highly to the calculated uhpfs the return period for the pmp uhpf and uhpf of 1 5 are approximated by inverting each function in table 5 to solve for the return period as a function of the uhpf the results for each percentile are given in table 6 a lower uncertainty percentile results in a larger return period for the pmp and uhpf of 1 5 this follows intuition as a longer return period is required for smaller magnitude events to reach the same uhpf the 50th and 95th percentiles show reversed behavior for the maximum uhpf this inversion is a result of the variability in the monte carlo procedure used by noaa to establish the confidence intervals their difference however is not as great as the difference between either and the 5th percentile the 5th percentile predicts almost a three times greater return period at the maximum accepted uhpf than the 50th and 95th percentiles a similar magnitude difference is also present between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the pmp return period the range in return period at the pmp uhpf is approximately 1500 years while that of the 1 5 uhpf is nearly 200 000 years the extent of both ranges demonstrates the importance of accounting for uncertainty when conducting a uhpf analysis to ensure a conservative design 5 conclusions this work utilized the gssha hydrologic model in the goose creek watershed to estimate the watershed response from design events with various precipitation magnitudes the calculated discharges were then used to develop the uhpf relationship with rainfall excess the uh results obtained at various return periods demonstrated that the uhpf from a 5 year return period fell within 1 25 1 5 guidance in contrast the uh derived from events with less than 5 year return period exceeded the 1 25 1 5 uhpf guidance it was also found that a uhpf becomes less sensitive to the rainfall intensity as the design considered rainfall accumulation duration gets larger by comparing 6h and 24h events as the goose creek uh was designed from a 25 year rainfall return period event equivalent it maintains dam safety given the current uhpf guidance in addition this study defined the erf to relate events of different effective rainfalls as there is no formal validated uhpf scaling guidance regardless of return period and design event magnitude it was shown that the uhpf for an event duration is well predicted by erf moreover it was shown that current usace guidance to increase the uhpf by an additional 25 to 50 maintains a conservative design in all cases with additional study the erf could be utilized to develop a generalizable and regionalized uhpf estimation methodology based on the climatic regions of continental united states which would provide guidance and quick information for prediction flood hazard assessment or design purposes on ungauged basins ding 2011 pradhan et al 2016 finally this study examined the effect of uncertainty in hydrologic and precipitation parameters on the predicted uhpf a methodology was shown for creating confidence curves from uncertain or varying hydrologic parameters imperfect knowledge of the true precipitation depth at each return period must also be accounted for to ensure the reference event has a sufficiently large magnitude to maintain dam safety ideally such an uncertainty analysis would consider all sources of uncertainty from the watershed such as antecedent conditions storm spatial temporal properties and data processing decisions which is left as a topic for further research under ideal circumstances a fully distributed hydrologic analysis would be utilized to assess the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the flood magnitude for each infrastructure location in a similar manner as presented here for goose creek however such analyses are not often employed due to various project constraints opting instead for unit hydrograph methods or one dimensional models which lack the same accuracy and temporal spatial model resolutions in the same manner as the natural resources conservation service temporal disaggregation curves classify united states into regions whose behavior is determined by meteorological behavior the authors hypothesize that it should be possible to develop a classification schema for watersheds based on hydrologic properties these may include overlapping similarity between physical properties of catchments such as catchment size slope land use soil type with hydrological similarity based on observations or computational methods such as deterministic modeling and machine learning oudin et al 2010 similarity of watershed behavior in terms of parametric values can be used to select an appropriate mean hydrograph as well as an upper and lower percentile curve to quantify uncertainty yadav et al 2007 the proposed generalized unit hydrograph method provides the convenience of existing unit hydrograph methods and incorporates an improved understanding of watershed behavior the limiting factor in developing such a schema is the existence of a sufficiently large sample of distributed hydrologic models across varied environments for

8523,study region goose creek watershed loudoun county virginia usa study focus existing u s army corps of engineers usace policy suggests that the unit hydrograph peaking factor uhpf taken as the unit hydrograph peak of any flood runoff including the probable maximum flood over unit hydrograph peak of the inflow design flood idf range between 1 25 and 1 50 to ensure dam safety it is pertinent to investigate the impact of extreme flood events on the validity of this range through physically based rainfall runoff models not available during the planning and design of most usace dams the uhpf range was analyzed by deploying the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha model new hydrological insights this study concludes that design events with return periods greater than 5 years are required for the uhpf to fall within the guidance range and that uhpf becomes less sensitive to rainfall intensity with increasing accumulation time an effective rainfall factor erf is introduced to validate existing uhpf guidance as well as provide a nonlinear uhpf scaling relation when effective rainfall does not match that of the uh design event finally a method for quantifying the effect of hydrologic parameter and precipitation magnitude uncertainty on uhpf are demonstrated the goose creek facility is shown to maintain dam safety given current uhpf guidance as it was designed using 25 year return period rainfall keywords unit hydrograph peaking factor dam safety return period rainfall nonlinear scaling relationship 1 introduction 1 1 background in the past the most common rainfall runoff models used in the u s for dam construction usace 1959 1963 1993 employed the unit hydrograph uh theory sherman 1932 dam safety modeling guidelines from across the world specify or recommend the use of simplified hydrograph estimating routines such as the unit hydrograph uh method institute of hydrology 1999 pilgrim 1987 according to sherman 1932 who originally proposed the uh concept the uh of a watershed is the outflow resulting from one unit of direct runoff generated uniformly over the drainage area at a uniform rainfall rate during a specified period of rainfall duration this implies that the ordinates of any hydrograph resulting from a quantity of runoff producing rainfall of unit duration would be equal to corresponding ordinates of a uh for the same areal distribution of rainfall multiplied by the ratio of rainfall excess values for the past 50 years u s army corps of engineers usace practice has been to increase the peak of a uh linearly in relation to the observed rainfall by an additional 25 50 when the observed rainfall excess is significantly greater than the modeled rainfall excess used to create the uh usace 1991 this multiplicative factor is typically referred to as the unit hydrograph peaking factor uhpf the usace policy contained in er 1110 8 2 fr usace 1991 requires that dams designed constructed or operated by the usace will not create a threat of loss of life or inordinate property damage for a dam to be considered hydrologically adequate and in compliance with usace policy an appropriate embankment spillway and regulating outlet must be designed to safely pass an inflow design flood with adequate freeboard if such a structure is necessary usace engineering practice utilizes extreme flood events to evaluate and manage flood risk at most dams extreme flood events are those events defined by large magnitudes and long return periods however it is unclear whether the simplifications employed for selecting design extreme flood events has led to over or under estimations of the watershed runoff and in turn over or under estimations of the required dam size it is thus pertinent to investigate the impact of extreme flood events using physically based rainfall runoff models that were not available during the design and construction of most usace dams to improve dam safety estimates natural variability of environmental systems often causes linear transfer functions childs 1958 minshall 1960 ding 1974 kokkonen et al 2004 as assumed in uh theory to poorly characterize the range of possible outcomes from the same initial state linear transfer functions may be invalid due to multiple factors such as differences in the varying antecedent initial conditions such as soil moisture pradhan et al 2012 hendrickx et al 2016 runoff generation processes like infiltration excess downer and ogden 2004 saturation excess pradhan and ogden 2010 and hydro geomorphology urbanization and land use change ogden et al 2011 in most extreme flood investigations the uhpf is rarely analyzed thoroughly in the context of natural watershed variability variability ultimately manifests as uncertainty in the relationship between precipitation and flood likelihood a thorough analysis method relating hydrologic variables to the uhpf is essential to remove the assumption of linear behavior imposed by commonly employed empirical modeling methods the analysis should also consider and quantify any uncertainty to provide confidence information to decision makers physically based hydrologic modeling is capable of evaluating the non linearity of a watershed response szilagyi 2007 the gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis gssha model is a distributed parameter physically based numerical model that has been used by the usace in engineering hydrology downer et al 2016 erosion downer et al 2015 contaminant nutrient fate and transport pradhan et al 2014 as well as storm surge studies massey et al 2013 deploying a physically based hydrologic model will account for nonlinear watershed hydrological properties szilagyi 2007 as well as assist in developing a methodology to analyze improve the estimation of uhpf usace 1991 and rainfall excess relationships in different climatic regions of continental united states wolock et al 2004 1 2 purpose this study investigates the rainfall event magnitude associated with a usace recommended uhpf range between 1 25 and 1 5 to develop a relationship between uhpf and excess rainfall for the goose creek virginia study area using the gssha hydrologic model an uhpf scaling relationship for events of differing effective rainfalls is also provided to validate and supplement existing uhpf design guidance lastly a method for quantifying the effect of hydrologic parameter and precipitation magnitude uncertainty on uhpf are demonstrated to quantify uhpf confidence intervals a dam design deficiencies and modifications studies based on hydrologic analysis usace 1993 are not in the scope of this study 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the goose creek watershed shown in fig 1 was selected as the study area the principal reason for selecting this watershed is a study by usace 1963 provides baseline uh data along with the standard practice in deriving the uh both of which are necessary to study the uh peaks for events of differing effective rainfalls and to develop the uhpf scaling relationship usace 1963 derives the standard uh in the goose creek watershed in loudoun county va latitude 39 019 longitude 77 577 area 878km2 the objectives of the 1963 study were the following to collect the maximum available information on uh methods and uh data to provide standardized methods terminology and forms for the presentation of uhs to present the accumulated data and information in a form useful to hydrologists the study area is in the eastern united states bounded by the potomac river and maryland on the northeast draining eastward into the potomac river the climate of virginia is diverse and varies from warm and temperate in the eastern coastal areas which have temperatures moderated by the atlantic ocean to the cooler continental climate of the mountainous counties in the north and west sanford et al 2011 the mean annual temperature is between 12 and 13 c the rainfall pattern varies across virginia and is affected by topography in the north and west and by the presence of tropical moisture systems in the south and east the mean annual precipitation in the study area is 1067mm temperature and rainfall are adequate to support a substantial agriculture industry with crop and pasture lands evenly scattered between forests of mixed deciduous and evergreen trees across most of virginia including the watershed sanford et al 2011 2 2 data sources the hourly precipitation data was obtained from dulles international airport in dulles va id no coop 448903 coop 2017 the airport is approximately 6km away from the study watershed the discharge data at the outlet in fig 1 were from u s geological survey hydro climatic data network station no 1644000 slack and landwehr 1992 land use data was obtained from the national land cover database homer et al 2015 the soil data were obtained from the natural resources conservation service soil survey geographic database soil survey 2017 the probable maximum precipitation pmp estimates were obtained from the hydrometeorological report no 51 usdoc 1978 historical precipitation for goose creek is well characterized by the precipitation frequency atlas 14 volume 2 of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa noaa 2017 the precipitation frequency atlas is the standard source of historical extreme precipitation information available in the continental united states the return period precipitation was estimated from the noaa frequency atlas 14 3 methodology two different methods were used to derive uhs for the goose creek watershed utilizing historic discharge and rainfall data utilizing gssha to perform two dimensional 2d watershed modeling to derive a uh from the return period events and the pmp event 3 1 utilizing historic discharge and rainfall data to derive uh as per uh theory the following steps were taken to derive a uh from the observed discharge 1 separate the base flow from the observed streamflow hydrograph to obtain the direct runoff hydrograph qdrh the steps for base flow separation as per linsley et al 1975 are as follows a identify when direct runoff begins i e end of the base flow only period b estimate the duration of the direct runoff period using the empirical relationship below 1 n 0 8 a 0 2 where n is the time from the peak of the hydrograph to the point where the direct runoff finishes in days a is the basin area in square kilometers linsley et al 1975 linsley et al 1975 empirical formula could be complemented with other methodologies based on the use of numerical filter methods willems 2009 or on the analysis of the recession limb gabriel martin et al 2017 1 draw a line connecting the start of the rising limb and the inflection point defined by n in eq 1 as shown by the base flow line in fig 2 for the direct runoff this line separates the direct runoff hydrograph from base flow hydrograph then compute the volume of direct runoff hydrograph vdrh this volume must be equal to the volume of the effective rainfall hyetograph erh 2 v d r h t q d r h t d t where t is the time 1 express vdrh in equivalent units of depth vdrhd 3 v d r h d v d r h a b a s i n where abasin is the basin area 1 obtain the uh by normalizing the qdrh normalizing implies dividing the ordinates of the qdrh by the vdrh in equivalent units of depth in equation 3 4 u h q d r h v d r h d 1 determine the duration d of the erh associated with the uh obtained in step 4 above fig 2 shows the derivation of the uh for the goose creek watershed from the december 10 2003 observed rainfall and discharge data is not often available for isolated storms of sufficient runoff volume to derive uhs if an isolated event is not available the investigator must develop uhs from the records of complex storms with durations of rainfall excess that differ appreciably from the unit duration desired in fig 2 the 6h uh was derived from the 9h uh from s hydrographs usace 1963 the guidelines for computation of s hydrographs and derivation of uhs from s hydrographs is found in usace 1963 3 2 utilizing gssha to perform two dimensional 2d watershed modeling to derive a uh this study deploys the gssha model to transform extreme event rainfall events and pmp into corresponding design discharges gssha computes one dimensional 1d infiltration 2d overland flow and 1d stream flow to simulate the overland runoff to streams and channel transport process to catchment outlet the green and ampt infiltration scheme green and ampt 1911 was employed to simulate the partitioning of input precipitation at the land surface the runoff generated in each computational grid cell flows to adjacent cells through a 2d finite volume numerical scheme a 30m grid size was selected that resulted in 973163 computational grids within the catchment surface runoff is coupled to channel routing where lateral inflow from surface runoff grid cells is numerically routed through a 1d finite volume scheme 3 2 1 infiltration model the infiltration model partitions the rainfall forcing between infiltration and overland runoff the rate of infiltration is governed by the soil physical properties which vary with the soil type the soil map in fig 3 a was employed to define these properties the following are the soil physical parameters specified in the infiltration model effective porosity cm3 cm3 field capacity cm3 cm3 wilting point cm3 cm3 residual saturation cm3 cm3 pore size distribution cm cm saturated hydraulic conductivity cm hr wetting front suction head cm 3 2 2 routing model gssha employs an explicit finite volume scheme to route water for both 1d channel flow and 2d overland flow where flow rates are computed based on heads and volumes are updated based on the computed flow rates the friction slope between one grid cell and its neighbors is calculated as the difference in water surface elevations divided by the grid cell size compared with the kinematic wave approach this diffusive wave approach allows gssha to route water through pits or depressions and regions of adverse slope 3 2 3 calibration single event simulations targeting watershed runoff flood peaks rely mainly on the short term processes of infiltration and runoff routing where evapotranspiration is negligible relative to rainfall as the focus of this study is a single event based runoff peaks focus was given to the infiltration and routing processes defined in sections 3 2 1 and 3 2 2 for single events calibration of the distributed gssha hydrologic model in watersheds is simplified by assignment of soils and hydraulic parameters based on a soil textural index given in fig 3a and a land use index given in fig 3b which limits the number of parameter values that must be estimated in previous gssha model calibrations ogden et al 2011 pradhan et al 2014 parameter values were adjusted manually to achieve an acceptable fit to the observed hydrograph with parameter values bounded by physical understanding and the experience with the model this study undertook a similar manual calibration approach for the december 10 2003 event as shown in fig 4 a table 1 shows the infiltration process parameters taken account of in this study apart from hydraulic conductivity the parameters in table 1 were obtained from rawls et al 1983 based on the soil classifications in fig 3a hydraulic conductivity in table 1 was manually calibrated to account for impervious land developed areas in fig 3b with more than 20 impervious land cover were assigned a significantly lower value of hydraulic conductivity 0 0005cm h this impervious developed area covers less than 3 of the watershed gssha implements manning s equation to relate surface roughness to flow rate in which case the hydraulic roughness is represented by the manning s roughness coefficient n manning 1891 for each land use type shown in fig 3b a manning s roughness coefficient was calibrated within the range of physical values table 2 lists the calibrated manning s roughness coefficients in the study area the calibrated outflow hydrograph for december 10 2003 event was compared to the observed discharge at the outlet as displayed in fig 4a nash sutcliffe efficiency in fig 4a was 90 3 3 calibration verification the rainfall event of 16 may 2003 shown in fig 4b was employed in gssha simulation to verify the model calibration the model parameters used in this verification were those that resulted from the model calibration of section 3 2 3 initial soil moisture condition for the verification period can vary from that of the calibration period ogden et al 2011 additionally seasonal variation in the water table directly affects the base flow the field observations such as latron and gallart 2008 penna et al 2011 peters et al 2003 and various watershed modeling approach such as pradhan et al 2006 2008 2010 suggest that higher base flow signifies a higher water table and the higher water table signifies lower soil moisture deficit and higher effective soil moisture content in the vadose zone the yearly long term series of instantaneous discharge from the u s geological survey hydro climatic data network station no 1644000 shows that the base flow for the calibration period is higher than the verification period therefore the estimated effective soil moisture for the calibration period was 0 3cm3 cm3 and that for the verification event was 0 2cm3 cm3 the nash sutcliffe efficiency in fig 4b was 73 which was deemed reasonable to employ the model in subsequent efforts although the grid resolution effects on the topographic pradhan et al 2006 2008 and land surface details usery et al 2004 are not taken into account in this study a 30m grid size was selected as a compromise between the number of computational grids and the ability to describe topographic and other geospatial details the seasonal change of soil thermodynamics and its effect on the soil hydrologic parameter values pradhan et al 2013 was not taken into account in this study 4 results and discussion 4 1 uhpf analysis on 6h accumulated precipitation the 6h historic cumulative event precipitation was obtained from the noaa atlas 14 which gives the 1 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period events in the goose creek watershed as shown in fig 5 a to derive these series noaa collects precipitation measurements from all available sources performs data correction and outlier removal and computes extreme event magnitudes for various durations and return periods using a generalized extreme value gev distribution function fit using l moments to the annual maximum series additionally noaa determines data processing confidence intervals by applying a monte carlo procedure to the gev distribution to obtain the 90 confidence limit the 5 lower bound and 95 upper bound noaa confidence limits only characterize the certainty of the data processing technique used to obtain the return period estimates additional sources of uncertainty such as gage clustering and imperfect historical knowledge are not represented and would only increase the noaa calculated uncertainty limit even so the user of gev data should account for the statistical confidence during hydrologic analysis the noaa confidence intervals at each return period were applied to the watershed and are given in fig 5a noaa precipitation frequency atlas also provides the temporal event profiles event accumulation rates were determined by applying a fixed window at the selected duration to the precipitation series the deciles of the accumulation rate for each duration are provided graphically from these events in addition the event temporal distributions are further divided into quartiles by magnitude with the accumulation deciles calculated for each magnitude quartile design return period events were created by choosing 6h accumulation return period precipitation magnitudes in combination with an appropriate temporal distribution provided by the noaa pfds the return period events along with the pmp event were used as input conditions for the calibrated gssha model the results of which are shown in fig 5a fig 5b shows the gssha model runoff simulation of the return period events fig 5c shows the uh obtained from the gssha model runoff simulations in fig 5b the procedure followed in deriving the uh in fig 5c is described in section 3 1 where the gssha simulated runoff was utilized instead of observed runoff table 3 shows the uhpf derived in terms of 0 25 year return period to 100 year return period the values under the headings peaking factor in terms of x year return period are the uhpfs representing the x year return period where x ranges from 0 25 to 100 the x year return period uhpfs in the rows are the uh peak values of the corresponding event types under heading event type normalized by uh peak value for that x year return period uh peak values are defined under heading unit hydrograph peak for example if the x is 0 25 all the uh peak values from 0 25 year return period to pmp are divided by the uh peak value of 0 25 year return period that is 112 6cm s cm in table 3 therefore table 3 represents a sensitivity analysis of the uhpfs to the return period used to normalize the peak of the uhs fig 6 was developed to illustrate table 3 where four bands are defined based on the uhpf value safe if the uhpf is less than 1 0 moderately safe if between 1 and 1 3 critical if between 1 3 and 1 5 and risky if exceeding 1 5 fig 6 shows that the uhs developed from events at or above the 5 year return period are well within the 1 25 1 5 uhpf range the uhs developed from 5 year return period and above fall into either the safe or moderately safe band in fig 6 table 3 and fig 6 also show that the uhpf from the 1 year return period rainfall uh is close to 1 5 at the pmp in other words the 1 year return period uh may fall into the critical band as shown in fig 6 table 3 and fig 6 show that uhpf from uh of the 0 25 year event is greater than 1 5 at pmp that is a 0 25 year return period uh may fall into the unsafe band as shown in fig 6 this case study in the goose creek watershed found that the upper limit of the uhpf for the uh peak published in the usace 1963 report was 0 9 and that for the uh in fig 2 was 1 4 the average rainfall published in the usace 1963 report was 135 millimeters mm in 36h this rainfall is equivalent to 25 year return period rainfall as per the pfds report the peak of the derived 6h uh for the usace 1963 published report was 189m3 s cm the rainfall for fig 2 was 42mm in 12h which is equivalent to 1 year return period rainfall as per the pfds report 4 2 uhpf analysis on 24h accumulated precipitation the 24h historic cumulative event precipitation was also obtained from the noaa atlas 14 pfds the pfds gives the 1 year 5 year 10 year 25 year 50 year and 100 year return period events in the goose creek watershed as shown in fig 7 a design return period events were created by choosing 24h accumulation return period precipitation magnitudes in combination with an appropriate temporal distribution provided by the noaa pfds the return period events are shown in fig 7a along with the pmp event that were employed in the goose creek gssha model fig 7b shows the runoff calculated by the gssha simulations for each of the return period events additionally fig 7c shows the uh obtained from the gssha runoff simulations in fig 7b the procedure followed in deriving the uh in fig 7c is given in section 3 1 where the gssha simulated runoff was utilized instead of historical observed runoff similar to table 3 table 4 represents a sensitivity analysis of the uhpf to the return period used to normalize the peak of the uhs fig 8 was developed to illustrate table 4 in comparison to fig 6 fig 8 shows that the uhpf for all combination of extreme rainfall events are well under the moderately safe limit of 1 3 in fig 8 even a 0 25 year return period uh may falls into the moderately safe band this analysis from fig 8 therefore shows that uhpf is less sensitive to the rainfall intensity as the design considered rainfall accumulation duration gets larger in the goose creek watershed 4 3 development of the uhpf and effective rainfall relationship a uh is derived from and valid for a specific set of storm properties interacting with a specific set of watershed properties the practicalities of engineering analysis often require application of this limited uh to other conditions beyond which it was originally derived including cases such as differing antecedent conditions or spatial precipitation distribution use of a uh under non derived conditions is valid only for a fully linear watershed without any randomness generating uncertainty a common uh use is the scaling of the uh peak when the effective rainfall of a considered event exceeds that of the design event usace practice has been to linearly increase the peak of a uh by an additional 25 to 50 when the rainfall excess of a considered event is significantly greater than the design runoff used to derive the uh usace 1991 this scale factor is intended to maintain a conservative design by correcting the uh for the nonlinear and uncertain watershed response however there is neither documentation underlying this recommendation nor guidance which defines the specific scale factor to be employed in scaling the uh to a larger magnitude event this study introduces the effective rainfall factor erf which is the ratio between the effective rainfall of a considered event and that of the design event for the same duration when the erf is less than one the considered event is of lower magnitude than the design event an erf greater than one implies that the considered event is of larger magnitude than the design event erf provides a means by which to relate the amount of design event exceedance to the peaking factor utilizing the effective rainfall from the gssha simulations given in tables 3 and 4 erf can be plotted as a function of peaking factor by again varying the return period of the design event collapsing all return periods onto a unique curve for each event duration yields a power scaling relationship as shown in fig 9 the uhpf has a strong dependence on the erf with some increased scatter around the trend as the erf becomes large produced by the short duration events the average uhpf for short duration events is greater than long duration for higher erf following intuition as rainfall will have less opportunity to infiltrate fig 9 facilitates evaluation of the usace design practice for scaling the uh as a function of effective rainfall an event with erf of 1 5 is an event 50 larger than the design event applying uh theory should result in a uhpf of at least 1 5 in a fully linear system response prior to the additional usace adjustment fig 9 shows that the predicted uhpf for erf is under 1 15 for the 6h event the lower predicted uhpf compared to uh theory is present across the all erf values greater than one less than erf of one the trend is reversed with higher peaking factors being predicted this difference in the predicted uhpf results from the nonlinearity of the watershed response captured by the distributed hydrologic model in the exceedance of the design event the usace design scaling practice is highly conservative the process displayed in fig 9 can be used to improve design processes employing uh methods to correct uhpf estimates for nonlinear behavior with study across additional watersheds using distributed hydrologic modeling the uhpf dependence on erf can be better characterized to establish a uhpf band for each event duration the uh erf can then be directly calculated from the precipitation depth of the design event and that of the considered event the uh erf value can then be utilized to determine the uhpf range with the final design value being a percentile in that uhpf range the 6h and the 24h cumulative precipitation was selected in this study for return period events as a compromise between rainfall duration intensity and areal distribution relationships areal rainfall patterns depend on the cumulative rainfall duration considered for areas of 500km2 to 800km2 the spatial standard deviation of hourly rainfall from the mean is 50 higher than that for 24h rainfall u s weather bureau 1957 1960 this shows that low accumulation duration rainfall with higher spatial non uniformity is not suitable from the unit hydrograph theory point of view on the other hand rainfall intensity is significantly reduced as the accumulation duration is increased de paola et al 2014 elsebaie 2012 mirhosseini et al 2014 detail study of this rainfall duration intensity and areal relationship is significant for generalization regionalization of the relationships developed in fig 9 expansion of present analysis to regional uhpf dependence on erf is left to subsequent efforts 4 4 land use uncertainty analysis as a simplification the uhpf is often considered independent of both the storm and watershed properties the assumption of storm independence as shown in the previous sections for the storm return period can lead to a lack of understanding of the design safety by underestimating discharge variability this lack of understanding extends readily to other storm and watershed parameters that may have an equal influence on the uhpf it is therefore important to utilize an approach which captures these properties as part of the uhpf analysis as an example of parametric uhpf analysis a case was examined for land use variability in the goose creek watershed to simulate both uncertainty in the spatial distribution of land use and increasing urbanization in the present case study the actual impervious area is less than 3 of the catchment area it was assumed that the watershed had urbanization levels of 0 1 1 5 10 20 30 40 50 and 75 of land area represented by the fraction of cells in the domain that were considered impervious to infiltration five synthetic infiltration maps were created for each urbanization level with cells in each coverage selected at random to be impervious cell selection was done by weighting the probability of drawing a cell inversely proportional to the distance from the outlet until the level was met those cells that were closer to the watershed entrance were therefore more likely to be chosen this was intended to represent real world cases where watersheds tend to urbanize from the downstream to the upstream tables 2 and 3 were employed to define the parameter values of modified land use maps each land use map was exposed to the same design storm event to isolate land use affects alone fig 10 shows the result of the analysis for each of the considered land use percentage the right axis given by the solid blue line shows the mean discharge of the five samples at each land use percentage the left axis given by the dotted red line provides the standard deviation at each land use percentage each quantity is given as a function of the event time the mean value remains largely unchanged across the events with standard deviations under 0 009m3 s this low value of standard deviation along with stable mean value shows that land use change effects on flood peaks are subdued during extreme rainfall events due to higher soil moisture and lower infiltration capacity as reflected by ogden et al 2011 though the mean in across events is similar the standard deviation varies within the individual events some land use percentages have the peak in standard deviation concurrently with the peak mean discharge others have standard deviation peaks offset from the mean peak such changes are important for understanding the peak event timing as there may be range of times over which the peak can occur taken together the mean and standard deviation curves in combination represent a two dimensional surface of the possible values the hydrograph could take as a function of event time and the independent variable of land use this type of parametric analysis provides insight into how to select hydrographs for uhpf analysis in the presence of variability and uncertainty of storm and watershed parameters by selecting the most critical storm and watershed properties for a watershed of interest curves such as fig 10 can be developed the extent to which the variable space was explored would depend largely on the strength of the hydrograph dependence on each property the computation power and the parameter selection techniques when this was fully explored a hydrograph would be produced that was at a given percentile of each of the independent variables the percentile would be chosen based on the amount of risk able to be accepted at the considered location because this nature of the dependence will vary greatly among watersheds a detailed demonstration of this technique is left as part of follow on efforts 4 5 precipitation magnitude uncertainty analysis an additional source of uhpf uncertainty results from the variable precipitation magnitude of the selected reference event use of a single deterministic reference event to establish an acceptable uhpf implies that the full flood and precipitation frequency curves are known with certainty as complete historical and meteorological knowledge is rarely available probabilistic techniques can be used to capture the various sources of uncertainty to establish a uhpf confidence interval the range and maximum value of the interval can then be incorporated as part of a dam safety assessment as a measure of risk or utilized as outlined in section 4 4 noaa atlas 14 provides three precipitation magnitudes occurring at the 5th 50th and 95th confidence intervals that equally satisfy the event return period as a result of its monte carlo data analysis selection of any depth that lies on the interval would be an acceptable event to represent the return period of interest the range of the calculated precipitation magnitude data analysis confidence intervals is a proxy for the amount of risk accepted by an installation if data processing uncertainty is not considered when calculating the uhpf if a precipitation depth and resulting flood at a low confidence interval is utilized as the design event the uhpf may be underestimated resulting in an unsafe design similarly if a precipitation depth and flood at a high confidence interval is utilized as the norming event a design may be overly conservative leading to increased construction maintenance costs the effect of data processing uncertainty on uhpfs at goose creek was determined by applying the 5 and 95 confidence interval precipitation depths to the watershed in addition to the 50 value fig 11 shows the variation in the uhpf at each return period normalized to the 5 year 50th percentile value the 50th percentile is given by the black line the 95th percentile is given by the upper error bar and the 5th by the lower error bar the difference between the 5th and 95th percentile is as large as 0 052 for the 50 year return period 4 7 of the 50th percentile value while not evident directly at the goose creek watershed this difference in the selected precipitation depth due to data processing uncertainty alone is sufficiently large that it could cause some reference events to become inadequate at maintaining a uhpf below 1 5 at other watersheds the large difference between the percentiles supports greater conservativeness in choosing the precipitation depth confidence level used to establish uhpfs knowledge of the uhpf as a function of return period permits inverse calculation for the return period associated with a desired uhpf magnitude this knowledge is again useful as a proxy for the amount of risk accepted during a uhpf analysis as excess precipitation is approximately linear with increasing precipitation depth a simple logarithmic transform is typically sufficient to extrapolate the uhpf beyond modeled return periods by taking the normalization events at increasing confidence intervals to obtain the uhpf trend and extrapolating the return period at the desired uhpf a range of return periods can be established from lowest safest to highest least safe the return period range informs one as to how sensitive the analysis is to the normalization value equally the lowest range value can determine if a design is sufficiently conservative to meet the return period requirements at the maximum accepted uhpf the procedure above can be applied to determine a return period associated with the pmp as well as the commonly utilized maximum uhpf value of 1 5 although by definition the pmp does not have a return period it is nonetheless a useful exercise the intersection of the uhpf trend lines at each percentile with the uhpf evaluated at the pmp represents the location where the curve in fig 11 becomes asymptotic the magnitude of the return period at the intersection characterizes the maximum protection of the system under the assumptions used to formulate the uhpf analysis table 5 gives the expression for the trend line at each confidence percentile in fig 11 as well as the coefficient of determination the fit to each trend line and in particular the 50th percentile correlates highly to the calculated uhpfs the return period for the pmp uhpf and uhpf of 1 5 are approximated by inverting each function in table 5 to solve for the return period as a function of the uhpf the results for each percentile are given in table 6 a lower uncertainty percentile results in a larger return period for the pmp and uhpf of 1 5 this follows intuition as a longer return period is required for smaller magnitude events to reach the same uhpf the 50th and 95th percentiles show reversed behavior for the maximum uhpf this inversion is a result of the variability in the monte carlo procedure used by noaa to establish the confidence intervals their difference however is not as great as the difference between either and the 5th percentile the 5th percentile predicts almost a three times greater return period at the maximum accepted uhpf than the 50th and 95th percentiles a similar magnitude difference is also present between the 5th and 95th percentiles of the pmp return period the range in return period at the pmp uhpf is approximately 1500 years while that of the 1 5 uhpf is nearly 200 000 years the extent of both ranges demonstrates the importance of accounting for uncertainty when conducting a uhpf analysis to ensure a conservative design 5 conclusions this work utilized the gssha hydrologic model in the goose creek watershed to estimate the watershed response from design events with various precipitation magnitudes the calculated discharges were then used to develop the uhpf relationship with rainfall excess the uh results obtained at various return periods demonstrated that the uhpf from a 5 year return period fell within 1 25 1 5 guidance in contrast the uh derived from events with less than 5 year return period exceeded the 1 25 1 5 uhpf guidance it was also found that a uhpf becomes less sensitive to the rainfall intensity as the design considered rainfall accumulation duration gets larger by comparing 6h and 24h events as the goose creek uh was designed from a 25 year rainfall return period event equivalent it maintains dam safety given the current uhpf guidance in addition this study defined the erf to relate events of different effective rainfalls as there is no formal validated uhpf scaling guidance regardless of return period and design event magnitude it was shown that the uhpf for an event duration is well predicted by erf moreover it was shown that current usace guidance to increase the uhpf by an additional 25 to 50 maintains a conservative design in all cases with additional study the erf could be utilized to develop a generalizable and regionalized uhpf estimation methodology based on the climatic regions of continental united states which would provide guidance and quick information for prediction flood hazard assessment or design purposes on ungauged basins ding 2011 pradhan et al 2016 finally this study examined the effect of uncertainty in hydrologic and precipitation parameters on the predicted uhpf a methodology was shown for creating confidence curves from uncertain or varying hydrologic parameters imperfect knowledge of the true precipitation depth at each return period must also be accounted for to ensure the reference event has a sufficiently large magnitude to maintain dam safety ideally such an uncertainty analysis would consider all sources of uncertainty from the watershed such as antecedent conditions storm spatial temporal properties and data processing decisions which is left as a topic for further research under ideal circumstances a fully distributed hydrologic analysis would be utilized to assess the nonlinearity and uncertainty of the flood magnitude for each infrastructure location in a similar manner as presented here for goose creek however such analyses are not often employed due to various project constraints opting instead for unit hydrograph methods or one dimensional models which lack the same accuracy and temporal spatial model resolutions in the same manner as the natural resources conservation service temporal disaggregation curves classify united states into regions whose behavior is determined by meteorological behavior the authors hypothesize that it should be possible to develop a classification schema for watersheds based on hydrologic properties these may include overlapping similarity between physical properties of catchments such as catchment size slope land use soil type with hydrological similarity based on observations or computational methods such as deterministic modeling and machine learning oudin et al 2010 similarity of watershed behavior in terms of parametric values can be used to select an appropriate mean hydrograph as well as an upper and lower percentile curve to quantify uncertainty yadav et al 2007 the proposed generalized unit hydrograph method provides the convenience of existing unit hydrograph methods and incorporates an improved understanding of watershed behavior the limiting factor in developing such a schema is the existence of a sufficiently large sample of distributed hydrologic models across varied environments for

8524,region east africa focus a review of catchment studies n 37 conducted in east africa evaluating the impacts of land use and land cover changes lulcc on discharge surface runoff and low flows new hydrological insights forest cover loss is accompanied by increased stream discharges and surface runoff no significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments trend analyses show that despite forest cover loss 63 of the watersheds show non significant changes in annual discharges while 31 show increasing trends half of the watersheds show non significant trends in wet season flows and low flows while 35 reveal decreasing trends in low flows modeling studies estimate that forest cover loss increases annual discharges and surface runoff by 16 5 5 and 45 14 respectively peak flows increased by a mean of 10 2 8 while low flows decreased by a mean of 7 5 3 increased forest cover decreases annual discharges and surface runoff by 13 1 9 and 25 5 respectively weak correlations between forest cover and runoff r 0 42 p 0 05 mean discharge r 0 63 p 0 05 and peak discharge r 0 67 p 0 05 indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in east african catchments the variability in these results supports the need for long term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models keywords land use and land cover changes east africa river discharge flow regimes catchment studies trend analyses modeling 1 introduction the sustainable management of the earth s surface including land use and land cover changes lulcc remains a critical environmental challenge that society must address mustard et al 2004 besides ecosystem vulnerability lulcc are major determinants of global environmental change with potential severe impacts on human livelihoods olson et al 2008 such changes manifest in climatological hydrological and biodiversity responses vitousek et al 1997 estimated that between 39 and 50 of terrestrial ecosystems have undergone modification due to anthropogenic influence the main drivers of lulcc are socio economic development population expansion and pressures for land for agriculture lambin et al 2003 like the rest of the world east africa is not an exception to these dynamics east africa depends largely on rain fed agriculture which makes rural livelihoods and food security highly vulnerable to shifts in water availability land is a critical resource for the livelihood of east africans and there has been a steady decline in the size of land holdings per household in order to meet this demand for land lulcc in this region has resulted in loss of natural forests to human settlements urban centers farmlands and grazing lands maitima et al 2009 between 1990 and 2015 east africa forest cover decreased annually by about 1 while human population increased at an average annual rate of 2 fig 1 the main forest types in east africa that have undergone this decrease include tropical rain forests tropical dry forests tropical shrubs tropical montane forest and mangrove forests while there have been concerted efforts to establish plantation forests lulcc result in a trade off between provisioning of food and fiber for human consumption and minimization of negative impacts on other ecosystem services such as water quantity and quality mustard et al 2004 food production is dependent on water resources and therefore any likely impacts of lulcc on water resources have negative impacts on food production although there has been abundant research on the impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology the evidence from the various studies is still contradictory malmer et al 2009 argue that the general notion that the basics of forest and water relations are well known does not hold for watersheds with fragmented and dynamic land use patterns such as those observed in the tropical developing world this means that the variation in catchment characteristics coupled with lulcc increases the uncertainty to find commonalities in observed hydrological signatures attributed to lulcc it is commonly argued that forests act both as pumps through enhanced evapotranspiration et rates and as sponges through increased infiltration rates and soil moisture retention bruijnzeel 2004 arancibia 2013 forested watersheds therefore exhibit smaller streamflow rates than watersheds dominated by other managed land uses forest cover loss results in changes in albedo reduction in aerodynamic roughness reduction of leaf area and reduction in rooting depth consequently causing a reduction in et which subsequently affects streamflow costa et al 2003 farley et al 2005 the net effect of forest cover loss is increased water yield bosch and hewlett 1982 additionally a reduction in dry season flow is often cited as a consequence of deforestation bruijnzeel 1988 arancibia 2013 ogden et al 2013 liu et al 2015 however despite these general conclusions which are based on experiments at various spatial scales e g plot watershed and regional scales empirical and physically based lumped and spatially distributed modeling and time series analyses isolating the impacts of lulcc on water resources in a landscape is problematic because of uncertain interactions of factors driving these effects eshleman 2004 stated that these water yield increases associated with forest cover loss depend on a number of factors including the method of forest loss beschta 1998 the extent of forest removal bosch and hewlett 1982 the rate of plant regeneration impacting et federer and lash 1978 swank et al 1988 climatic conditions chow 1964 bosch and hewlett 1982 whitehead and robinson 1993 and hydrogeology and catchment physical properties likens et al 1978 the lack of controls in experimental studies which can be used to attribute observed hydrological changes to causal mechanisms has also been noted as a confounding factor to these changes stonestrom et al 2009 the impacts of forest fragmentation and extent of forest loss were demonstrated in a compilation of paired catchment studies in usa where it was observed that timber harvesting could result in a measurable increase in annual water yield in 15 of the catchment area in the rocky mountains while a 50 change is required in the central plains of usa stednick 1996 this may mean that there is a threshold in terms of forest fragmentation extent and effects on water yield and flow regimes studies in small catchments have indicated that measurable changes in water yield are obtained when there is at least 20 forest cover change stednick 1996 as a result of the lack of commonalities in observed impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology the complex relationships between forests and water continue to be debated ellison et al 2012 lacombe et al 2016 filoso et al 2017 we focus our study on the east africa region which includes most of the nile basin an important biodiversity hotspot and the lake victoria the world s largest tropical lake even though only approximately 20 of the lake victoria water inflows are from rivers draining into the lake awange et al 2008 the ecosystem health of the lake depends on the health and flow dynamics of these rivers with this context the main objectives of this study were to review studies that quantify the impacts of lulcc on river discharges surface runoff and low flows through a meta analysis of data for the east africa region and to draw over arching conclusions from these studies and recommendations for future studies 2 methodology 2 1 study region this review was based on research data from studies in the east africa region fig 2 a region that encompasses kenya ethiopia somalia sudan eritrea uganda rwanda burundi and tanzania most of east africa is characterized as tropical wet and dry subtropical dry semi arid and subtropical dry arid köppen and geiger 1930 the region has two main climate types depending on rainfall patterns a tropical type with monomodal summer rainfall pattern is observed to the north of longitude 10 n in eritrea and south of latitude 6 s in tanzania le houérou 2006 the equatorial climate experienced in the north of east africa is characterized by two rainy seasons irrespective of elevation and aridity class the highlands in the east africa region are associated with high rainfalls and over 2000mm per year while some areas mostly below 1000m elevation are classified as arid semiarid and hyper arid le houérou 2006 2 2 research method and literature search we searched peer reviewed articles reporting watershed and catchment river discharges and flow regimes under different land use and land cover lulc the search was conducted using the search engines google scholar and the databases of isi web of science and scopus the key words included were east africa land use land cover deforestation river discharge water yield flow regimes low flow high flow and surface runoff we only selected cases from east africa and then obtained additional publications including theses and white papers using the references in the bibliography section of the retrieved articles we identified 56 articles from this search we selected articles that fulfilled the following criteria i lulc change analyzed i e pre and post land use reported and corresponding hydrological information reported ii quantitative data on methods and results reported from this screening 19 articles were unsuitable for our study and subsequently 37 articles were identified as suitable to evaluate the hydrological impacts of forest cover losses in east africa the selected articles also include four master theses one doctoral theses and two scientific reports the articles were further classified as field experiments n 6 modeling studies n 20 and trend analyses n 12 two case studies gebremicael et al 2013 wagesho 2014 included both simulation modeling and trend analyses the field experiments were sub divided into plot and catchment scale studies the plot studies hurni et al 2005 descheemaeker et al 2006 girmay et al 2009 were undertaken in runoff plots measuring 2 15m 5 2m and 2 10m respectively the locations of selected case studies are shown in fig 2 while table 1 shows the main catchment characteristics of each case study for each study we took into account the spatial scale location method and categorized this information in an alluvial diagram fig 3 to better show the distribution of these variables among the studies 2 3 data analyses the hydrological variables considered in this review are surface runoff mean annual discharge peak discharge and low flows due to the differences in spatial scale data from plot studies and catchment scale studies were analyzed separately because at the catchment scale other interacting factors such as slope could impact on measured hydrological variables where data was available surface runoff coefficients were extracted for the different land uses in the plot studies in order to make comparisons between catchments of different sizes and also varying rainfall where stream discharges were reported we calculated the ratios of specific discharge to rainfall sdr eq 1 1 s d r s p e c i f i c d i s c h a r g e r a i n f a l l as outlined by burbank et al 2012 high sdr indicates that a high fraction of the rainfall becomes stream discharge and less is stored in the soil profile we pooled the data from different catchment and plot studies with similar land uses and the discharge and surface runoff data followed normal distributions shapiro wilk s test subsequently we used a parametric test one way analysis of variance anova to test statistical differences between the hydrological variables i e runoff coefficient and discharge from these catchment studies tukey s honest significance difference hsd test was used for mean separation when the analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the investigated hydrologic variables for all hydrological variables mean values and changes were computed including the standard error se the trend analyses included in this study used the statistical tests mann kendall and sen slope method to estimate changes in mean annual discharges peak discharges and low flows related to lulcc we collated the data from the selected studies to establish whether common trends in the hydrological variables existed from the modeling studies we selected scenarios that represented deforestation or afforestation and calculated the percentage change in the selected hydrological variables 3 results 3 1 distribution and spatial scale of studies fig 3 is an alluvial diagram that shows the distribution of all the selected studies including spatial scale there is a strong focus on studies on catchment scale which are distributed mostly in ethiopia kenya and tanzania while the majority of the trend analyses were conducted in catchments over 1000km2 the modeling applications were in catchments between 100 and 10 000km2 and the field experiments in plots and catchments up to 10km2 in terms of spatial scale and location the field experiments were the most well distributed being applied from plot and catchment scales in three different countries the modeling applications were mostly concentrated in ethiopia and kenya and half of the trend analyses studies were done in tanzania most of the cases studies n 28 are in the tropical wet dry climate köppen and geiger 1930 which is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons and most of the precipitation occurs in the summer season six of the case studies fall in the tropical wet climates with mean annual precipitation greater than 1000mm mostly in the highlands of ethiopia and kenya while the remainder lie in the arid and semi arid zones results for each of the methods catchment studies trend analyses and simulation modeling are presented in the following sections 3 2 catchment and plot experiments compared to other regions of the world e g south america relatively few long term field studies have been undertaken in east africa specifically analyzing the impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology fig 4 shows runoff coefficients from plot studies in this region four main land uses were identified in the plot studies namely cultivated lands on which different crops were grown plots with eucalyptus trees plantation plots in grazing lands used as pastures for livestock and plots in natural forests the results show significantly lower runoff coefficients for forested plots compared to plots under cultivation and grazing lands mean runoff coefficient and se in natural forest plots were 0 39 0 17 while in the cultivated areas they were 22 3 2 there is no statistically significant difference in runoff coefficients from eucalyptus plantation plots and grazing plots the runoff coefficient in the eucalyptus plantation forest were significantly lower mean 9 6 2 1 than in both cultivated and grazing plots but higher than for natural forest plots in the catchment scale studies the main land uses that were compared included pine tree pinus patula sp plantation bamboo forest arundinaria alpine sp with scattered forest tree species tea plantation cultivated catchment with annual and perennial crops and forest catchment covered with native broad leafed montane forest sdr values for five land uses in catchments in kenya and tanzania are shown in fig 5 across the datasets from the five catchments there is no statistically significant difference in sdr between pine plantation and bamboo catchments a significant difference was observed in sdr between tea plantation and pine plantation catchments the mean sdr in the natural forest catchments was the lowest 0 28 0 02 and differed significantly from all other catchments however it is interesting to note that the mean sdr for cultivated catchments was significantly lower than for both bamboo and pine plantation catchments there is a significant decrease in sdr with plantation age in the pine plantation r2 0 38 p 0 01 while in the tea plantation the decrease in sdr with age is non significant fig 7 3 3 trend analyses table 2 summarizes the results from 12 studies in east africa in which trend analyses were performed to estimate the effects of lulcc on mean annual discharge and flow regimes in 18 catchments results from five catchments show statistically significant p 0 05 increasing trends in mean annual discharge with forest cover loss however for the three catchments in the upper blue nile watershed tesemma et al 2010 there is relatively limited information about how forest cover has changed over the years even though trend analyses showed increasing trends in mean annual discharge the watershed is dominated by small holder agriculture with about 1 forest cover mainly in the uplands one catchment gilgel abbay showed decreasing trends while ten catchments exhibited non significant trends in mean annual discharge for dry season flow six catchments showed significantly decreasing trends while three catchments exhibited significantly increasing trends eight catchments showed non significant trends in dry season flows increasing trends in wet season flows were observed in five catchments while eight catchments exhibited non significant wet season flow trends except for three catchments gilgey abbay chemoga and weru weru which show decreasing trends there is no significant trend in annual rainfalls as summarized in table 2 the catchments showed varied level of natural forest loss for the periods in which the trend analyses were applied 3 4 modeling studies the use of hydrological models has been the main method for estimating impacts of lulcc on catchment hydrology in east africa most of these modeling studies used the soil water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 while the other studies were conducted using the hydrologic modeling system hec hms u s army corps of engineers curve number method usda soil conservation service the hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning hbv model bergström 1976 and geospatial stream flow model geosfm model artan et al 2008 from the modeling case studies mean annual discharge water yield surface runoff peak discharges and low flows base flow data were extracted for different land cover scenarios where the information was available for each of these studies the model was calibrated and validated using measured hydrological data from the study catchments with the measured data sets divided into two half the time series data used for calibration and the other half for model validation alternative lulc scenarios were developed from current lulc that were used as baseline each of these alternative scenarios mostly assuming deforestation without climate changes were used as input to the models and mean annual discharge surface runoff peak discharges and low flows were simulated for each watershed for the selected lulc scenarios and simulated water balance components we summarize the change in surface runoff and annual stream discharges fig 7 and low flows and peak discharges fig 8 in the results we refer to percentage changes in surface runoff peak discharges low flows and mean annual discharge in comparison with baseline initial values the forest cover change represented in figs 7 and 8 include both forest losses negative change and forest gain positive change the summarized results fig 7 show that forest cover loss leads to increases in surface runoff 4 90 results from case studies with forest cover increase scenarios show that surface runoff decreased with forest cover gain however the magnitude of surface runoff increase and decrease varied among the watersheds similar results were also observed for mean annual discharge with the exception of mango et al 2011a and nobert and jeremiah 2012 where increases in annual discharge where obtained with the exception of one scenario in the study by sead et al 2010 results show that forest cover loss leads to increases in peak discharges while afforestation results in a reduction in peak discharge fig 8 deforestation resulted in decreased low flows up to 46 with the exception of the study by githui et al 2009 in which an increase in low flows was observed following forest cover loss forest cover change had an inverse relationship with mean annual discharge r 0 63 p 0 001 peak discharge r 0 67 p 0 05 and surface runoff r 0 42 p 0 05 while low flows did not exhibit a significant relationship with forest cover change fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 emerging patterns and comparison with results from other regions our analyses of the literature show that there are emerging patterns on the effects of forest cover loss on hydrological responses results from this review demonstrate that forest cover loss results in stream flow increases mean 16 5 5 from modeling studies in east africa field experiments also show higher discharge in cultivated catchments in comparison to forest catchments fig 5 these results agree with observations in other tropical environments including tomasella et al 2009 and hayhoe et al 2011 the latter observed higher water yields from catchments where natural forest was replaced by croplands in brazil similar results after conversion of natural forests to soya fields in brazil were attributed primarily to decreased et dias et al 2015 in comparison to forest landscapes vegetation in cultivated and disturbed natural ecosystems generally have lower leaf area indices and shallow root depths causing reduced evapotranspiration foley et al 2003 jackson et al 2005 in a global meta analysis of 504 catchments found that stream flow was reduced by 50 while farley et al 2005 observed water yield reductions ranging from 30 to 60 in moderate and high rainfall areas as a result of forest cover increase the flow reductions are also attributed to the increased buffering capacity increasing amount of water retained in the watershed as forest cover increases as well as increased et rates from the catchment studies in kenya and tanzania the general conclusion that forest cover loss results in increased discharge is not prominently evident notably the discharge from pine plantation catchment was higher than from cultivated catchments the results of this review of stream discharge trend analyses indicate a lack of significant trends in stream flow regimes due to lulcc these results do not support the common finding that deforestation results in increased streamflow as concluded in some studies e g brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 in studies done in tropical watersheds in the amazon basin significant trends in the measured hydrological parameters due to lulcc were detected only in low order streams rodriguez et al 2010 increased peak discharges with forest losses were observed in these low order streams and the results agreed with those obtained in paired catchment studies in which there are minimum confounding factors influencing trends large watersheds may have a relatively high buffering capacity that masks forest cover effects on hydrological regimes because of a large number of interacting factors such as soil type and slope bi et al 2014 surface runoff increases were also observed with forest cover loss in field experimentation with significantly higher runoff in cultivated plots than in forest plots fig 4 this is also reflected in the positive change in surface runoff with deforestation scenarios fig 7 in the modeling studies these results agree with those by nóbrega et al 2017 who compared catchments with contrasting land use pasture vs dry forest in the mato grosso state brazil similarly guzha et al 2015 also observed higher runoff in a pasture catchment compared to natural forest catchment in field experiments in the southern amazon region simulation modeling in suiá miçu river basin brazil estimated that deforestation in this basin resulted in a 6 increase in surface runoff maeda et al 2009 similar results increases in surface runoff due to forest cover loss have also been observed by valentin et al 2008 in 27 catchments in south east asia as shown in fig 8 deforestation resulted in decreased low flows mean reduction of 7 5 3 this conforms to the conclusion by bruijnzeel 2004 noting that deforestation and cropland expansion leads to changes in soil hydro physical conditions in tropical forests which subsequently results in reduced low flows due to reduced infiltration and groundwater recharge bewket and sterk 2005 also attributed the decreasing trend in the mean dry season low flows to the expansion of eucalyptus plantations given the high water use of eucalyptus species up to 7 00mm day albaugh et al 2013 which reduces the water stored in the soil profile and ultimately reduces base flow bosch and hewlett 1982 scott and lesch 1997 the modeling study by githui et al 2009 estimated increases in low flows with forest cover loss mohns n d asserts that when there is no soil degradation such as changes in infiltration properties deforestation could lead to increased dry season flows due to lower plant water use studies including eisenbies et al 2007 and webb et al 2007 also found similar results with increased dry season flows due to deforestation and attributed this increase to a reduction in et according to liu et al 2015 changes in low flows involve both vegetation and soil changes and therefore the degree of soil disturbances after deforestation finally determines the responses of low flows the variability in increases in surface runoff 45 14 and annual discharge 16 5 5 in fig 7 peak discharge 10 2 8 and reduction in low flows 7 5 3 fig 8 from our case studies agrees with the results of fritsch 1990 in a tropical catchment in south america french guiana in which they observed increases in peak flows after deforestation ranging from 17 to 166 stednick 1996 noted that changes are less pronounced when less than 20 of the basin area has been deforested regression analyses of the collated data from modelling studies fig 9 showing weak associations between lulcc and the four variables surface runoff mean annual discharge peak discharge and low flows agree with results by stednick 1996 and macdonald and stednick 2003 in conifer forest watersheds in usa our results support the view by van noordwijk et al 2017 that the percentage of forest cover in a watershed is probably not a good metric on its own to infer conclusions on water related ecosystem services provided by a watershed 4 2 factors influencing lulcc impacts results from this study for all three methods show relatively wide variability in magnitudes of hydrological changes cf figs 7 and 8 interactions between diverse site specific factors e g catchment slope soil infiltrability and vegetation age influence mean that standardized watershed responses will hardly be obtained soil depth plays an important role in influencing how watershed discharge responds to lulcc fao 2008 the insignificant increase in discharge in mbeya under cultivation was attributed to the stability of the volcanic ash derived soils in the wet season which impacts runoff generation processes the clay soils in the kericho catchment edwards and blackie 1981 coupled with the very low hydraulic conductivity of ca 0 05cmh 1 obieiro 1996 may have contributed to the reduced infiltration rates and enhanced surface runoff and storm discharge cf fig 5 and thus there are no significant differences in discharge between bamboo pine and tea catchments the deep and porous soils at kimakia kenya with the very high available water capacities of up to 765mm in the top 3m soil layer edwards and blackie 1981 coupled with the canopy cover establishment may also have contributed to the significant reduction in discharge over time another factor emerging from this study is the influence of precipitation events the high sdr for the tea catchment have been attributed partly to the high rainfall intensities frequent high intensity rain storms in already saturated soils result in high surface runoff rates and subsequently higher discharges irrespective of full plant canopy cover fao 2008 the importance of rainfall event characteristics was also noted by niehoff et al 2002 who concluded that lulcc impacts under small scale convective storm events with high precipitation intensities are more pronounced than for long lasting advective rainstorms the high discharge in kericho catchment indicates that at high rainfall intensities the impacts of forest cover in reducing stream flows are masked romero et al 2016 also concluded that the effect of forest cover on peak discharges becomes insignificant with increase in size of hydrological event the kericho experiments were performed in periods with generally very high rainfall averaging 2000mm year in a study in northern china wang et al 2011 observed that runoff was influenced by altitude annual precipitation forest cover and potential et and concluded that geographic differences could buffer the true role of forests in runoff generation in a catchment forests tended to be located at higher altitudes with steeper slopes higher precipitation lower et and therefore higher surface runoff volumes according to the national research council 2008 the spatial arrangement of deforestation or locations of deforestation zones within a watershed forest fragmentation also affects the watershed responses this is reflected in the modeling study by mango et al 2011a b in the mara basin which showed that 100 forest cover loss 248km2 in the uplands of the nyangores watershed had minimal impacts on annual water yield 0 3 increase mwangi et al 2016a also highlighted the influence of spatial location and extent of lulcc forest fragmentation on magnitude of change in hydrology this has also been observed in other regions ziegler et al 2001 and salemi et al 2013 observed that forest fragmentation reduces flow attenuation resulting in increased dominance of overland flow paths in tropical catchments in thailand and brazil respectively leading to higher surface runoff our review also showed relatively weak correlations between lulcc and changes in the hydrological components according to merz and blöschl 2009 the poor correlation of forest cover loss and flow regimes especially peak discharge and low flows can be attributed to spatial scale because at larger scales some of the catchment responses are likely to average out over the catchment area the weak relationship could also be a result of unaccounted water abstractions which are often associated with urbanization beck et al 2013 and le tellier et al 2009 found no significant relationship between low flows runoff and cloud forest cover which agree with the lack of significant correlation found for low flows in the modeling studies included in our analyses gaál et al 2012 found similar results and attributed this observation to the influence of other confounding catchment variables such as watershed topography and geology which influences the subsurface water fluxes as catchments respond non linearly to changes in land use watershed area spatial extent also impacts the observed changes in hydrologic variables due to lulcc large watersheds exhibit a relatively high buffering capacity that masks the effects of lulcc bi et al 2014 in our analyses most of the watersheds that show no significant trends in the measured hydrological variables have catchment areas greater than 1000km2 this may support the conclusion stated by rodriguez et al 2010 that the influence of lucc on river hydrology diminishes with catchment scale compared to the influence of the interactions between areas of different lulcc and other factors e g population density and irrigation practice bloschl et al 2007 also note that at the large scale lulcc impacts are difficult to verify because of long time lags between cause and effect and the influence of other confounding factors including the connectivity of stream networks and flow paths in catchments which may influence how lulcc translates into hydrological responses lack of a clear pattern of significant trends in stream flow regimes with lulcc can be attributed to the influence of spatial scale as in most of the analyses in this review the trends are quantified on discharge data measured only at the catchment outlet there are no trend analyses at the sub catchment scales likely due to missing observational data hall et al 2014 suggest that instead of analyzing a single record an analysis of an ensemble of records in a particular watershed can increase the power of detection by reducing sampling uncertainty our analyses also shows that even after deforestation with vegetation regeneration stream flows may decrease eucalyptus plantation fig 6 or show no significant change tea plantation fig 6 the significant reduction in discharge with time in the pine tree plantation at kimakia can be attributed to the pine tree canopy development over the years i e increase in leaf area and rooting depth leading to higher et rates as noted in other studies such as simic et al 2014 and engel et al 2002 results from paired watershed studies in tropical montane cloud forests tmcf in latin america and the caribbean show that the effects of deforestation on hydrological fluxes are most pronounced immediately after clearing and decline in subsequent years bruijnzeel 2001 ogden et al 2013 as outlined by bruijnzeel 1990 similar results were obtained in the sub humid part of fiji kammer and raj 1979 and in south africa bosch 1979 van lill et al 1980 and they attribute these reductions in flow to increased et loss from the vegetation however from our review there was no significant reduction trend in observed discharge over time in the tea plantation the non significant trend in the tea plantation can be attributed to soil processes filoso et al 2017 highlighted that processes such as infiltration may not recover in such plantations due to factors such as lack of undergrowth vegetation access road construction and the inherent vulnerability of tropical soils to compaction and structural changes 4 3 limitations of the studies and recommendations the case studies reviewed in this study considered three main methodologies i e field experimebts trend analyses and simulation modeling with nearly half of the studies being model applications utilizing the hbv swat hec hms geosfm models and the cn method the hbv swat geosfm and hec hms are semi distributed models which divide the landscape into sub catchments or hydrological response units in swat while the cn method is an empirical model for estimating direct runoff from a landscape the cn method used by kundu and olang 2011 uses a lumped empirical model to quantify total runoff with relatively limited consideration of catchment physiographical factors even though they are data intensive the semi distributed models capture the spatial distribution of the input variables e g land use soil and elevation and therefore improved simulation results in comparison to the lumped cn method as outlined by golmohammadi et al 2014 models performances are very site specific and because no model is superior under all conditions a complete understanding of comparative model performance requires applications under different hydrologic conditions and watershed scales the clarity and reliability of modeling outputs can be improved by the use of model ensembles instead of the use of single models dwarakish and ganasri 2015 we therefore recommend inter comparison of models at local scale as simulating efficiency of the models varies depending on uncertainty introduced by calibration strategy model input and structure and parameterization among other factors in most of the reviewed studies in east africa model calibration and validation is based on short term measured data sets compromising the utility of the model as a prediction tool a further caveat of these model applications is that flow components such as surface runoff interflow and base flow are most often not validated as measured data for such a validation are completely missing it is common knowledge in hydrologic modelling that satisfactory modeling results can be achieved with relative unrealistic representation of the hydrological flux pathways in the model in most swat applications the scs curve number method is used to estimate surface runoff which is an empirical method and it is often modified by using calibration methods in order to correctly simulate the observed discharge this supports the need for intercomparison of models to enhance credibility of model outputs most often swat is calibrated to a given land use map situation and then use a new land use scenario and the same calibrated parameters in most cases this is not feasible as calibration parameters change as land use changes therefore the simulations are basically examining an effect of changes in hru composition but not the effect of the lulcc itself studies such as kebede 2009 and mango et al 2011a b do not report parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and the simulations result in very limited changes in discharge and surface runoff for substantial decreases up to 100 in forest cover therefore as revealed in studies e g eckhardt et al 2003 and breuer et al 2006 to improve our understanding of the significance of simulated changes in hydrological parameters due to lulcc intensive parameter sensitivity analyses need to be carried out to obtain improved model parameterization furthermore as highlighted by van noordwijk et al 2017 key credibility questions for models are consistency of numerical results and how sensitive are these results to bias and random error in data sources parameter sensitivity analyses can assist to improve credibility of obtained simulation results hydrological impacts are not restricted to the influences of lulcc observed signatures are usually a result of the interaction of a wide range of factors including landscape characteristics as well as climate variability and change relatively few studies e g natkhin et al 2015 rwigi 2014 considered the interaction of lulcc and climate therefore further studies should incorporate interactions between lulcc and climate variability into the scenarios simulated in order to achieve reliable assessments of hydrological impacts most of the studies in the east africa region do not evaluate the influence of rainfall event characteristics and therefore undertaking more studies incorporating assessments for different rainfall characteristics will shed light on the associate impacts on surface runoff generation even though deforestation in east africa is associated with expansion of agriculture and human settlements maitima et al 2009 in the case studies reviewed in this study there was no information on water extraction for purposes such as irrigation and domestic uses such anthropogenic activities influence measured flows at catchment outlets thus disturbing the signals of deforestation manifested in stream flows this could explain partly the variability in the quantified changes in stream discharges as influenced by forest cover change in east africa beck et al 2013 in studies in twelve mesoscale humid tropical catchments in puerto rico noted that anthropogenic activities could mask the effects of forest cover change on stream flows due to alterations in stream flow due to extractions for agricultural uses as there is a multiplicity of factors that affect the observed impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology additional studies must also consider the use of principal component analyses pca to investigate which of the important variables play a greater role in the observed changes in hydrological fluxes a further recommendation is that more field experimentation and hydrological data collection for longer temporal scales in a variety of landscapes should be undertaken to support the refinement of models and reduce the uncertainties in their performance space for time substitution field studies pickett 1989 at different spatial scales could also be prioritized and these should take into consideration other catchment hydro physical properties and also examine the impacts of vegetation regeneration due to the prominent use of groundwater for both domestic and use and agriculture in east africa pavelic et al 2012 and given the large complexities in hydrogeology impacts groundwater in this region it is recommended that field experimentation and further studies need to include assessment of impacts of lulcc on groundwater fluxes as base flows and dry season flows are normally generated from groundwater stores the lack of statistical significance in some of the comparisons for field experimentation figs 4 and 5 in this review can be attributed to small sample sizes e g only 14 and 16 measurement points for the tea and pine plant plantation catchments this supports the need for long term studies in a variety of landscapes as most of the direct and indirect hydrological effects of lulcc are not detected in the short term analyses 5 conclusions in order to understand the current state of knowledge on forest cover loss and lulcc impacts on catchment hydrology in the east africa region we compiled relevant available studies including catchment studies simulation modeling studies and trend analyses although there is lack of information for making uniform quantitative generalizations about the impacts of forest cover loss it is evident from the presented studies that lulcc impacts hydrological fluxes specifically discharge and surface runoff despite the wide variability in results our analyses indicates that while lulcc impacts discharge surface runoff and low flows other catchment variables also play significant roles from the field studies and hydrologic modeling case studies reviewed in this study deforestation results in increased surface runoff mean annual and peak river discharges while generally this review shows a decrease in low flows with forest cover loss some studies indicate increased dry season flows despite varying scales of deforestation ranging from 3 to 68 forest cover loss trend analyses of measured data did not consistently show significant negative or positive trends in discharge and flow regimes this lack of common trend indicates the need to take into account spatial scale effects on the hydrologic variables there is heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the changes in hydrological fluxes with lulcc this heterogeneity presents a challenge to water resources managers and therefore point to the need for increased local scale research to understand better the effects of land cover transitions on hydrological fluxes understanding future lulcc and mitigating their impacts on water resources in specific watersheds will require integration of results from regional scale analyses and those from local scale studies this review is based on a relatively limited body of applicable research undertaken in the east africa region and to better understand the impacts of lulcc on hydrological fluxes in east africa requires holistic studies that place emphasis on both time and spatial scales and consider ecological scope and climate variability therefore an overall conclusion is that there is still need for more field studies at longer time scales and variable spatial scales and integrate these with modeling studies that takes full consideration of parameter uncertainty for increased clarity model inter comparison studies are also recommended to verify their predictive power in relation to spatio temporal changes in hydrological fluxes using long term field data for improved model calibration and validation conflicts of interest none acknowledgments this work was carried out with funding by the consultative group on international

8524,region east africa focus a review of catchment studies n 37 conducted in east africa evaluating the impacts of land use and land cover changes lulcc on discharge surface runoff and low flows new hydrological insights forest cover loss is accompanied by increased stream discharges and surface runoff no significant difference in stream discharge is observed between bamboo and pine plantation catchments and between cultivated and tea plantation catchments trend analyses show that despite forest cover loss 63 of the watersheds show non significant changes in annual discharges while 31 show increasing trends half of the watersheds show non significant trends in wet season flows and low flows while 35 reveal decreasing trends in low flows modeling studies estimate that forest cover loss increases annual discharges and surface runoff by 16 5 5 and 45 14 respectively peak flows increased by a mean of 10 2 8 while low flows decreased by a mean of 7 5 3 increased forest cover decreases annual discharges and surface runoff by 13 1 9 and 25 5 respectively weak correlations between forest cover and runoff r 0 42 p 0 05 mean discharge r 0 63 p 0 05 and peak discharge r 0 67 p 0 05 indicate that forest cover alone is not an accurate predictor of hydrological fluxes in east african catchments the variability in these results supports the need for long term field monitoring to better understand catchment responses and to improve the calibration of currently used simulation models keywords land use and land cover changes east africa river discharge flow regimes catchment studies trend analyses modeling 1 introduction the sustainable management of the earth s surface including land use and land cover changes lulcc remains a critical environmental challenge that society must address mustard et al 2004 besides ecosystem vulnerability lulcc are major determinants of global environmental change with potential severe impacts on human livelihoods olson et al 2008 such changes manifest in climatological hydrological and biodiversity responses vitousek et al 1997 estimated that between 39 and 50 of terrestrial ecosystems have undergone modification due to anthropogenic influence the main drivers of lulcc are socio economic development population expansion and pressures for land for agriculture lambin et al 2003 like the rest of the world east africa is not an exception to these dynamics east africa depends largely on rain fed agriculture which makes rural livelihoods and food security highly vulnerable to shifts in water availability land is a critical resource for the livelihood of east africans and there has been a steady decline in the size of land holdings per household in order to meet this demand for land lulcc in this region has resulted in loss of natural forests to human settlements urban centers farmlands and grazing lands maitima et al 2009 between 1990 and 2015 east africa forest cover decreased annually by about 1 while human population increased at an average annual rate of 2 fig 1 the main forest types in east africa that have undergone this decrease include tropical rain forests tropical dry forests tropical shrubs tropical montane forest and mangrove forests while there have been concerted efforts to establish plantation forests lulcc result in a trade off between provisioning of food and fiber for human consumption and minimization of negative impacts on other ecosystem services such as water quantity and quality mustard et al 2004 food production is dependent on water resources and therefore any likely impacts of lulcc on water resources have negative impacts on food production although there has been abundant research on the impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology the evidence from the various studies is still contradictory malmer et al 2009 argue that the general notion that the basics of forest and water relations are well known does not hold for watersheds with fragmented and dynamic land use patterns such as those observed in the tropical developing world this means that the variation in catchment characteristics coupled with lulcc increases the uncertainty to find commonalities in observed hydrological signatures attributed to lulcc it is commonly argued that forests act both as pumps through enhanced evapotranspiration et rates and as sponges through increased infiltration rates and soil moisture retention bruijnzeel 2004 arancibia 2013 forested watersheds therefore exhibit smaller streamflow rates than watersheds dominated by other managed land uses forest cover loss results in changes in albedo reduction in aerodynamic roughness reduction of leaf area and reduction in rooting depth consequently causing a reduction in et which subsequently affects streamflow costa et al 2003 farley et al 2005 the net effect of forest cover loss is increased water yield bosch and hewlett 1982 additionally a reduction in dry season flow is often cited as a consequence of deforestation bruijnzeel 1988 arancibia 2013 ogden et al 2013 liu et al 2015 however despite these general conclusions which are based on experiments at various spatial scales e g plot watershed and regional scales empirical and physically based lumped and spatially distributed modeling and time series analyses isolating the impacts of lulcc on water resources in a landscape is problematic because of uncertain interactions of factors driving these effects eshleman 2004 stated that these water yield increases associated with forest cover loss depend on a number of factors including the method of forest loss beschta 1998 the extent of forest removal bosch and hewlett 1982 the rate of plant regeneration impacting et federer and lash 1978 swank et al 1988 climatic conditions chow 1964 bosch and hewlett 1982 whitehead and robinson 1993 and hydrogeology and catchment physical properties likens et al 1978 the lack of controls in experimental studies which can be used to attribute observed hydrological changes to causal mechanisms has also been noted as a confounding factor to these changes stonestrom et al 2009 the impacts of forest fragmentation and extent of forest loss were demonstrated in a compilation of paired catchment studies in usa where it was observed that timber harvesting could result in a measurable increase in annual water yield in 15 of the catchment area in the rocky mountains while a 50 change is required in the central plains of usa stednick 1996 this may mean that there is a threshold in terms of forest fragmentation extent and effects on water yield and flow regimes studies in small catchments have indicated that measurable changes in water yield are obtained when there is at least 20 forest cover change stednick 1996 as a result of the lack of commonalities in observed impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology the complex relationships between forests and water continue to be debated ellison et al 2012 lacombe et al 2016 filoso et al 2017 we focus our study on the east africa region which includes most of the nile basin an important biodiversity hotspot and the lake victoria the world s largest tropical lake even though only approximately 20 of the lake victoria water inflows are from rivers draining into the lake awange et al 2008 the ecosystem health of the lake depends on the health and flow dynamics of these rivers with this context the main objectives of this study were to review studies that quantify the impacts of lulcc on river discharges surface runoff and low flows through a meta analysis of data for the east africa region and to draw over arching conclusions from these studies and recommendations for future studies 2 methodology 2 1 study region this review was based on research data from studies in the east africa region fig 2 a region that encompasses kenya ethiopia somalia sudan eritrea uganda rwanda burundi and tanzania most of east africa is characterized as tropical wet and dry subtropical dry semi arid and subtropical dry arid köppen and geiger 1930 the region has two main climate types depending on rainfall patterns a tropical type with monomodal summer rainfall pattern is observed to the north of longitude 10 n in eritrea and south of latitude 6 s in tanzania le houérou 2006 the equatorial climate experienced in the north of east africa is characterized by two rainy seasons irrespective of elevation and aridity class the highlands in the east africa region are associated with high rainfalls and over 2000mm per year while some areas mostly below 1000m elevation are classified as arid semiarid and hyper arid le houérou 2006 2 2 research method and literature search we searched peer reviewed articles reporting watershed and catchment river discharges and flow regimes under different land use and land cover lulc the search was conducted using the search engines google scholar and the databases of isi web of science and scopus the key words included were east africa land use land cover deforestation river discharge water yield flow regimes low flow high flow and surface runoff we only selected cases from east africa and then obtained additional publications including theses and white papers using the references in the bibliography section of the retrieved articles we identified 56 articles from this search we selected articles that fulfilled the following criteria i lulc change analyzed i e pre and post land use reported and corresponding hydrological information reported ii quantitative data on methods and results reported from this screening 19 articles were unsuitable for our study and subsequently 37 articles were identified as suitable to evaluate the hydrological impacts of forest cover losses in east africa the selected articles also include four master theses one doctoral theses and two scientific reports the articles were further classified as field experiments n 6 modeling studies n 20 and trend analyses n 12 two case studies gebremicael et al 2013 wagesho 2014 included both simulation modeling and trend analyses the field experiments were sub divided into plot and catchment scale studies the plot studies hurni et al 2005 descheemaeker et al 2006 girmay et al 2009 were undertaken in runoff plots measuring 2 15m 5 2m and 2 10m respectively the locations of selected case studies are shown in fig 2 while table 1 shows the main catchment characteristics of each case study for each study we took into account the spatial scale location method and categorized this information in an alluvial diagram fig 3 to better show the distribution of these variables among the studies 2 3 data analyses the hydrological variables considered in this review are surface runoff mean annual discharge peak discharge and low flows due to the differences in spatial scale data from plot studies and catchment scale studies were analyzed separately because at the catchment scale other interacting factors such as slope could impact on measured hydrological variables where data was available surface runoff coefficients were extracted for the different land uses in the plot studies in order to make comparisons between catchments of different sizes and also varying rainfall where stream discharges were reported we calculated the ratios of specific discharge to rainfall sdr eq 1 1 s d r s p e c i f i c d i s c h a r g e r a i n f a l l as outlined by burbank et al 2012 high sdr indicates that a high fraction of the rainfall becomes stream discharge and less is stored in the soil profile we pooled the data from different catchment and plot studies with similar land uses and the discharge and surface runoff data followed normal distributions shapiro wilk s test subsequently we used a parametric test one way analysis of variance anova to test statistical differences between the hydrological variables i e runoff coefficient and discharge from these catchment studies tukey s honest significance difference hsd test was used for mean separation when the analysis of variance showed statistically significant differences p 0 05 between the investigated hydrologic variables for all hydrological variables mean values and changes were computed including the standard error se the trend analyses included in this study used the statistical tests mann kendall and sen slope method to estimate changes in mean annual discharges peak discharges and low flows related to lulcc we collated the data from the selected studies to establish whether common trends in the hydrological variables existed from the modeling studies we selected scenarios that represented deforestation or afforestation and calculated the percentage change in the selected hydrological variables 3 results 3 1 distribution and spatial scale of studies fig 3 is an alluvial diagram that shows the distribution of all the selected studies including spatial scale there is a strong focus on studies on catchment scale which are distributed mostly in ethiopia kenya and tanzania while the majority of the trend analyses were conducted in catchments over 1000km2 the modeling applications were in catchments between 100 and 10 000km2 and the field experiments in plots and catchments up to 10km2 in terms of spatial scale and location the field experiments were the most well distributed being applied from plot and catchment scales in three different countries the modeling applications were mostly concentrated in ethiopia and kenya and half of the trend analyses studies were done in tanzania most of the cases studies n 28 are in the tropical wet dry climate köppen and geiger 1930 which is characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons and most of the precipitation occurs in the summer season six of the case studies fall in the tropical wet climates with mean annual precipitation greater than 1000mm mostly in the highlands of ethiopia and kenya while the remainder lie in the arid and semi arid zones results for each of the methods catchment studies trend analyses and simulation modeling are presented in the following sections 3 2 catchment and plot experiments compared to other regions of the world e g south america relatively few long term field studies have been undertaken in east africa specifically analyzing the impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology fig 4 shows runoff coefficients from plot studies in this region four main land uses were identified in the plot studies namely cultivated lands on which different crops were grown plots with eucalyptus trees plantation plots in grazing lands used as pastures for livestock and plots in natural forests the results show significantly lower runoff coefficients for forested plots compared to plots under cultivation and grazing lands mean runoff coefficient and se in natural forest plots were 0 39 0 17 while in the cultivated areas they were 22 3 2 there is no statistically significant difference in runoff coefficients from eucalyptus plantation plots and grazing plots the runoff coefficient in the eucalyptus plantation forest were significantly lower mean 9 6 2 1 than in both cultivated and grazing plots but higher than for natural forest plots in the catchment scale studies the main land uses that were compared included pine tree pinus patula sp plantation bamboo forest arundinaria alpine sp with scattered forest tree species tea plantation cultivated catchment with annual and perennial crops and forest catchment covered with native broad leafed montane forest sdr values for five land uses in catchments in kenya and tanzania are shown in fig 5 across the datasets from the five catchments there is no statistically significant difference in sdr between pine plantation and bamboo catchments a significant difference was observed in sdr between tea plantation and pine plantation catchments the mean sdr in the natural forest catchments was the lowest 0 28 0 02 and differed significantly from all other catchments however it is interesting to note that the mean sdr for cultivated catchments was significantly lower than for both bamboo and pine plantation catchments there is a significant decrease in sdr with plantation age in the pine plantation r2 0 38 p 0 01 while in the tea plantation the decrease in sdr with age is non significant fig 7 3 3 trend analyses table 2 summarizes the results from 12 studies in east africa in which trend analyses were performed to estimate the effects of lulcc on mean annual discharge and flow regimes in 18 catchments results from five catchments show statistically significant p 0 05 increasing trends in mean annual discharge with forest cover loss however for the three catchments in the upper blue nile watershed tesemma et al 2010 there is relatively limited information about how forest cover has changed over the years even though trend analyses showed increasing trends in mean annual discharge the watershed is dominated by small holder agriculture with about 1 forest cover mainly in the uplands one catchment gilgel abbay showed decreasing trends while ten catchments exhibited non significant trends in mean annual discharge for dry season flow six catchments showed significantly decreasing trends while three catchments exhibited significantly increasing trends eight catchments showed non significant trends in dry season flows increasing trends in wet season flows were observed in five catchments while eight catchments exhibited non significant wet season flow trends except for three catchments gilgey abbay chemoga and weru weru which show decreasing trends there is no significant trend in annual rainfalls as summarized in table 2 the catchments showed varied level of natural forest loss for the periods in which the trend analyses were applied 3 4 modeling studies the use of hydrological models has been the main method for estimating impacts of lulcc on catchment hydrology in east africa most of these modeling studies used the soil water assessment tool swat arnold and fohrer 2005 while the other studies were conducted using the hydrologic modeling system hec hms u s army corps of engineers curve number method usda soil conservation service the hydrologiska byrans vattenbalansavdelning hbv model bergström 1976 and geospatial stream flow model geosfm model artan et al 2008 from the modeling case studies mean annual discharge water yield surface runoff peak discharges and low flows base flow data were extracted for different land cover scenarios where the information was available for each of these studies the model was calibrated and validated using measured hydrological data from the study catchments with the measured data sets divided into two half the time series data used for calibration and the other half for model validation alternative lulc scenarios were developed from current lulc that were used as baseline each of these alternative scenarios mostly assuming deforestation without climate changes were used as input to the models and mean annual discharge surface runoff peak discharges and low flows were simulated for each watershed for the selected lulc scenarios and simulated water balance components we summarize the change in surface runoff and annual stream discharges fig 7 and low flows and peak discharges fig 8 in the results we refer to percentage changes in surface runoff peak discharges low flows and mean annual discharge in comparison with baseline initial values the forest cover change represented in figs 7 and 8 include both forest losses negative change and forest gain positive change the summarized results fig 7 show that forest cover loss leads to increases in surface runoff 4 90 results from case studies with forest cover increase scenarios show that surface runoff decreased with forest cover gain however the magnitude of surface runoff increase and decrease varied among the watersheds similar results were also observed for mean annual discharge with the exception of mango et al 2011a and nobert and jeremiah 2012 where increases in annual discharge where obtained with the exception of one scenario in the study by sead et al 2010 results show that forest cover loss leads to increases in peak discharges while afforestation results in a reduction in peak discharge fig 8 deforestation resulted in decreased low flows up to 46 with the exception of the study by githui et al 2009 in which an increase in low flows was observed following forest cover loss forest cover change had an inverse relationship with mean annual discharge r 0 63 p 0 001 peak discharge r 0 67 p 0 05 and surface runoff r 0 42 p 0 05 while low flows did not exhibit a significant relationship with forest cover change fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 emerging patterns and comparison with results from other regions our analyses of the literature show that there are emerging patterns on the effects of forest cover loss on hydrological responses results from this review demonstrate that forest cover loss results in stream flow increases mean 16 5 5 from modeling studies in east africa field experiments also show higher discharge in cultivated catchments in comparison to forest catchments fig 5 these results agree with observations in other tropical environments including tomasella et al 2009 and hayhoe et al 2011 the latter observed higher water yields from catchments where natural forest was replaced by croplands in brazil similar results after conversion of natural forests to soya fields in brazil were attributed primarily to decreased et dias et al 2015 in comparison to forest landscapes vegetation in cultivated and disturbed natural ecosystems generally have lower leaf area indices and shallow root depths causing reduced evapotranspiration foley et al 2003 jackson et al 2005 in a global meta analysis of 504 catchments found that stream flow was reduced by 50 while farley et al 2005 observed water yield reductions ranging from 30 to 60 in moderate and high rainfall areas as a result of forest cover increase the flow reductions are also attributed to the increased buffering capacity increasing amount of water retained in the watershed as forest cover increases as well as increased et rates from the catchment studies in kenya and tanzania the general conclusion that forest cover loss results in increased discharge is not prominently evident notably the discharge from pine plantation catchment was higher than from cultivated catchments the results of this review of stream discharge trend analyses indicate a lack of significant trends in stream flow regimes due to lulcc these results do not support the common finding that deforestation results in increased streamflow as concluded in some studies e g brown et al 2005 farley et al 2005 in studies done in tropical watersheds in the amazon basin significant trends in the measured hydrological parameters due to lulcc were detected only in low order streams rodriguez et al 2010 increased peak discharges with forest losses were observed in these low order streams and the results agreed with those obtained in paired catchment studies in which there are minimum confounding factors influencing trends large watersheds may have a relatively high buffering capacity that masks forest cover effects on hydrological regimes because of a large number of interacting factors such as soil type and slope bi et al 2014 surface runoff increases were also observed with forest cover loss in field experimentation with significantly higher runoff in cultivated plots than in forest plots fig 4 this is also reflected in the positive change in surface runoff with deforestation scenarios fig 7 in the modeling studies these results agree with those by nóbrega et al 2017 who compared catchments with contrasting land use pasture vs dry forest in the mato grosso state brazil similarly guzha et al 2015 also observed higher runoff in a pasture catchment compared to natural forest catchment in field experiments in the southern amazon region simulation modeling in suiá miçu river basin brazil estimated that deforestation in this basin resulted in a 6 increase in surface runoff maeda et al 2009 similar results increases in surface runoff due to forest cover loss have also been observed by valentin et al 2008 in 27 catchments in south east asia as shown in fig 8 deforestation resulted in decreased low flows mean reduction of 7 5 3 this conforms to the conclusion by bruijnzeel 2004 noting that deforestation and cropland expansion leads to changes in soil hydro physical conditions in tropical forests which subsequently results in reduced low flows due to reduced infiltration and groundwater recharge bewket and sterk 2005 also attributed the decreasing trend in the mean dry season low flows to the expansion of eucalyptus plantations given the high water use of eucalyptus species up to 7 00mm day albaugh et al 2013 which reduces the water stored in the soil profile and ultimately reduces base flow bosch and hewlett 1982 scott and lesch 1997 the modeling study by githui et al 2009 estimated increases in low flows with forest cover loss mohns n d asserts that when there is no soil degradation such as changes in infiltration properties deforestation could lead to increased dry season flows due to lower plant water use studies including eisenbies et al 2007 and webb et al 2007 also found similar results with increased dry season flows due to deforestation and attributed this increase to a reduction in et according to liu et al 2015 changes in low flows involve both vegetation and soil changes and therefore the degree of soil disturbances after deforestation finally determines the responses of low flows the variability in increases in surface runoff 45 14 and annual discharge 16 5 5 in fig 7 peak discharge 10 2 8 and reduction in low flows 7 5 3 fig 8 from our case studies agrees with the results of fritsch 1990 in a tropical catchment in south america french guiana in which they observed increases in peak flows after deforestation ranging from 17 to 166 stednick 1996 noted that changes are less pronounced when less than 20 of the basin area has been deforested regression analyses of the collated data from modelling studies fig 9 showing weak associations between lulcc and the four variables surface runoff mean annual discharge peak discharge and low flows agree with results by stednick 1996 and macdonald and stednick 2003 in conifer forest watersheds in usa our results support the view by van noordwijk et al 2017 that the percentage of forest cover in a watershed is probably not a good metric on its own to infer conclusions on water related ecosystem services provided by a watershed 4 2 factors influencing lulcc impacts results from this study for all three methods show relatively wide variability in magnitudes of hydrological changes cf figs 7 and 8 interactions between diverse site specific factors e g catchment slope soil infiltrability and vegetation age influence mean that standardized watershed responses will hardly be obtained soil depth plays an important role in influencing how watershed discharge responds to lulcc fao 2008 the insignificant increase in discharge in mbeya under cultivation was attributed to the stability of the volcanic ash derived soils in the wet season which impacts runoff generation processes the clay soils in the kericho catchment edwards and blackie 1981 coupled with the very low hydraulic conductivity of ca 0 05cmh 1 obieiro 1996 may have contributed to the reduced infiltration rates and enhanced surface runoff and storm discharge cf fig 5 and thus there are no significant differences in discharge between bamboo pine and tea catchments the deep and porous soils at kimakia kenya with the very high available water capacities of up to 765mm in the top 3m soil layer edwards and blackie 1981 coupled with the canopy cover establishment may also have contributed to the significant reduction in discharge over time another factor emerging from this study is the influence of precipitation events the high sdr for the tea catchment have been attributed partly to the high rainfall intensities frequent high intensity rain storms in already saturated soils result in high surface runoff rates and subsequently higher discharges irrespective of full plant canopy cover fao 2008 the importance of rainfall event characteristics was also noted by niehoff et al 2002 who concluded that lulcc impacts under small scale convective storm events with high precipitation intensities are more pronounced than for long lasting advective rainstorms the high discharge in kericho catchment indicates that at high rainfall intensities the impacts of forest cover in reducing stream flows are masked romero et al 2016 also concluded that the effect of forest cover on peak discharges becomes insignificant with increase in size of hydrological event the kericho experiments were performed in periods with generally very high rainfall averaging 2000mm year in a study in northern china wang et al 2011 observed that runoff was influenced by altitude annual precipitation forest cover and potential et and concluded that geographic differences could buffer the true role of forests in runoff generation in a catchment forests tended to be located at higher altitudes with steeper slopes higher precipitation lower et and therefore higher surface runoff volumes according to the national research council 2008 the spatial arrangement of deforestation or locations of deforestation zones within a watershed forest fragmentation also affects the watershed responses this is reflected in the modeling study by mango et al 2011a b in the mara basin which showed that 100 forest cover loss 248km2 in the uplands of the nyangores watershed had minimal impacts on annual water yield 0 3 increase mwangi et al 2016a also highlighted the influence of spatial location and extent of lulcc forest fragmentation on magnitude of change in hydrology this has also been observed in other regions ziegler et al 2001 and salemi et al 2013 observed that forest fragmentation reduces flow attenuation resulting in increased dominance of overland flow paths in tropical catchments in thailand and brazil respectively leading to higher surface runoff our review also showed relatively weak correlations between lulcc and changes in the hydrological components according to merz and blöschl 2009 the poor correlation of forest cover loss and flow regimes especially peak discharge and low flows can be attributed to spatial scale because at larger scales some of the catchment responses are likely to average out over the catchment area the weak relationship could also be a result of unaccounted water abstractions which are often associated with urbanization beck et al 2013 and le tellier et al 2009 found no significant relationship between low flows runoff and cloud forest cover which agree with the lack of significant correlation found for low flows in the modeling studies included in our analyses gaál et al 2012 found similar results and attributed this observation to the influence of other confounding catchment variables such as watershed topography and geology which influences the subsurface water fluxes as catchments respond non linearly to changes in land use watershed area spatial extent also impacts the observed changes in hydrologic variables due to lulcc large watersheds exhibit a relatively high buffering capacity that masks the effects of lulcc bi et al 2014 in our analyses most of the watersheds that show no significant trends in the measured hydrological variables have catchment areas greater than 1000km2 this may support the conclusion stated by rodriguez et al 2010 that the influence of lucc on river hydrology diminishes with catchment scale compared to the influence of the interactions between areas of different lulcc and other factors e g population density and irrigation practice bloschl et al 2007 also note that at the large scale lulcc impacts are difficult to verify because of long time lags between cause and effect and the influence of other confounding factors including the connectivity of stream networks and flow paths in catchments which may influence how lulcc translates into hydrological responses lack of a clear pattern of significant trends in stream flow regimes with lulcc can be attributed to the influence of spatial scale as in most of the analyses in this review the trends are quantified on discharge data measured only at the catchment outlet there are no trend analyses at the sub catchment scales likely due to missing observational data hall et al 2014 suggest that instead of analyzing a single record an analysis of an ensemble of records in a particular watershed can increase the power of detection by reducing sampling uncertainty our analyses also shows that even after deforestation with vegetation regeneration stream flows may decrease eucalyptus plantation fig 6 or show no significant change tea plantation fig 6 the significant reduction in discharge with time in the pine tree plantation at kimakia can be attributed to the pine tree canopy development over the years i e increase in leaf area and rooting depth leading to higher et rates as noted in other studies such as simic et al 2014 and engel et al 2002 results from paired watershed studies in tropical montane cloud forests tmcf in latin america and the caribbean show that the effects of deforestation on hydrological fluxes are most pronounced immediately after clearing and decline in subsequent years bruijnzeel 2001 ogden et al 2013 as outlined by bruijnzeel 1990 similar results were obtained in the sub humid part of fiji kammer and raj 1979 and in south africa bosch 1979 van lill et al 1980 and they attribute these reductions in flow to increased et loss from the vegetation however from our review there was no significant reduction trend in observed discharge over time in the tea plantation the non significant trend in the tea plantation can be attributed to soil processes filoso et al 2017 highlighted that processes such as infiltration may not recover in such plantations due to factors such as lack of undergrowth vegetation access road construction and the inherent vulnerability of tropical soils to compaction and structural changes 4 3 limitations of the studies and recommendations the case studies reviewed in this study considered three main methodologies i e field experimebts trend analyses and simulation modeling with nearly half of the studies being model applications utilizing the hbv swat hec hms geosfm models and the cn method the hbv swat geosfm and hec hms are semi distributed models which divide the landscape into sub catchments or hydrological response units in swat while the cn method is an empirical model for estimating direct runoff from a landscape the cn method used by kundu and olang 2011 uses a lumped empirical model to quantify total runoff with relatively limited consideration of catchment physiographical factors even though they are data intensive the semi distributed models capture the spatial distribution of the input variables e g land use soil and elevation and therefore improved simulation results in comparison to the lumped cn method as outlined by golmohammadi et al 2014 models performances are very site specific and because no model is superior under all conditions a complete understanding of comparative model performance requires applications under different hydrologic conditions and watershed scales the clarity and reliability of modeling outputs can be improved by the use of model ensembles instead of the use of single models dwarakish and ganasri 2015 we therefore recommend inter comparison of models at local scale as simulating efficiency of the models varies depending on uncertainty introduced by calibration strategy model input and structure and parameterization among other factors in most of the reviewed studies in east africa model calibration and validation is based on short term measured data sets compromising the utility of the model as a prediction tool a further caveat of these model applications is that flow components such as surface runoff interflow and base flow are most often not validated as measured data for such a validation are completely missing it is common knowledge in hydrologic modelling that satisfactory modeling results can be achieved with relative unrealistic representation of the hydrological flux pathways in the model in most swat applications the scs curve number method is used to estimate surface runoff which is an empirical method and it is often modified by using calibration methods in order to correctly simulate the observed discharge this supports the need for intercomparison of models to enhance credibility of model outputs most often swat is calibrated to a given land use map situation and then use a new land use scenario and the same calibrated parameters in most cases this is not feasible as calibration parameters change as land use changes therefore the simulations are basically examining an effect of changes in hru composition but not the effect of the lulcc itself studies such as kebede 2009 and mango et al 2011a b do not report parameter sensitivity and uncertainty analyses and the simulations result in very limited changes in discharge and surface runoff for substantial decreases up to 100 in forest cover therefore as revealed in studies e g eckhardt et al 2003 and breuer et al 2006 to improve our understanding of the significance of simulated changes in hydrological parameters due to lulcc intensive parameter sensitivity analyses need to be carried out to obtain improved model parameterization furthermore as highlighted by van noordwijk et al 2017 key credibility questions for models are consistency of numerical results and how sensitive are these results to bias and random error in data sources parameter sensitivity analyses can assist to improve credibility of obtained simulation results hydrological impacts are not restricted to the influences of lulcc observed signatures are usually a result of the interaction of a wide range of factors including landscape characteristics as well as climate variability and change relatively few studies e g natkhin et al 2015 rwigi 2014 considered the interaction of lulcc and climate therefore further studies should incorporate interactions between lulcc and climate variability into the scenarios simulated in order to achieve reliable assessments of hydrological impacts most of the studies in the east africa region do not evaluate the influence of rainfall event characteristics and therefore undertaking more studies incorporating assessments for different rainfall characteristics will shed light on the associate impacts on surface runoff generation even though deforestation in east africa is associated with expansion of agriculture and human settlements maitima et al 2009 in the case studies reviewed in this study there was no information on water extraction for purposes such as irrigation and domestic uses such anthropogenic activities influence measured flows at catchment outlets thus disturbing the signals of deforestation manifested in stream flows this could explain partly the variability in the quantified changes in stream discharges as influenced by forest cover change in east africa beck et al 2013 in studies in twelve mesoscale humid tropical catchments in puerto rico noted that anthropogenic activities could mask the effects of forest cover change on stream flows due to alterations in stream flow due to extractions for agricultural uses as there is a multiplicity of factors that affect the observed impacts of lulcc on watershed hydrology additional studies must also consider the use of principal component analyses pca to investigate which of the important variables play a greater role in the observed changes in hydrological fluxes a further recommendation is that more field experimentation and hydrological data collection for longer temporal scales in a variety of landscapes should be undertaken to support the refinement of models and reduce the uncertainties in their performance space for time substitution field studies pickett 1989 at different spatial scales could also be prioritized and these should take into consideration other catchment hydro physical properties and also examine the impacts of vegetation regeneration due to the prominent use of groundwater for both domestic and use and agriculture in east africa pavelic et al 2012 and given the large complexities in hydrogeology impacts groundwater in this region it is recommended that field experimentation and further studies need to include assessment of impacts of lulcc on groundwater fluxes as base flows and dry season flows are normally generated from groundwater stores the lack of statistical significance in some of the comparisons for field experimentation figs 4 and 5 in this review can be attributed to small sample sizes e g only 14 and 16 measurement points for the tea and pine plant plantation catchments this supports the need for long term studies in a variety of landscapes as most of the direct and indirect hydrological effects of lulcc are not detected in the short term analyses 5 conclusions in order to understand the current state of knowledge on forest cover loss and lulcc impacts on catchment hydrology in the east africa region we compiled relevant available studies including catchment studies simulation modeling studies and trend analyses although there is lack of information for making uniform quantitative generalizations about the impacts of forest cover loss it is evident from the presented studies that lulcc impacts hydrological fluxes specifically discharge and surface runoff despite the wide variability in results our analyses indicates that while lulcc impacts discharge surface runoff and low flows other catchment variables also play significant roles from the field studies and hydrologic modeling case studies reviewed in this study deforestation results in increased surface runoff mean annual and peak river discharges while generally this review shows a decrease in low flows with forest cover loss some studies indicate increased dry season flows despite varying scales of deforestation ranging from 3 to 68 forest cover loss trend analyses of measured data did not consistently show significant negative or positive trends in discharge and flow regimes this lack of common trend indicates the need to take into account spatial scale effects on the hydrologic variables there is heterogeneity in the magnitudes of the changes in hydrological fluxes with lulcc this heterogeneity presents a challenge to water resources managers and therefore point to the need for increased local scale research to understand better the effects of land cover transitions on hydrological fluxes understanding future lulcc and mitigating their impacts on water resources in specific watersheds will require integration of results from regional scale analyses and those from local scale studies this review is based on a relatively limited body of applicable research undertaken in the east africa region and to better understand the impacts of lulcc on hydrological fluxes in east africa requires holistic studies that place emphasis on both time and spatial scales and consider ecological scope and climate variability therefore an overall conclusion is that there is still need for more field studies at longer time scales and variable spatial scales and integrate these with modeling studies that takes full consideration of parameter uncertainty for increased clarity model inter comparison studies are also recommended to verify their predictive power in relation to spatio temporal changes in hydrological fluxes using long term field data for improved model calibration and validation conflicts of interest none acknowledgments this work was carried out with funding by the consultative group on international
