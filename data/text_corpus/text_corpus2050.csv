some physiological characteristics and inulin content in chicory plants experiments were conducted as a factorial based on randomized complete block design with five replications at the greenhouse of agricultural faculty of azarbaijan shahid madani university tabriz iran in 2017 2018 experimental factors were different irrigation regimes i irrigation at the 55 ii irrigation at the 30 and iii irrigation at the 10 of total available water capacity in the soil and plant growth regulators including methyl jasmonate uniconazole chlormequat chloride and the solution containing plant growth promoting bacteria results indicated that the lowest relative water content membrane stability index chlorophyll a b total chlorophyll carotenoids soluble sugars and inulin in the roots and the highest thiobarbituric acid reactive substances proline and soluble sugars in the leaves were related to severe water deficit stress in the soil relative water content membrane stability index chlorophyll a b total chlorophyll carotenoids proline except of plant growth promoting bacteria soluble sugars and inulin increased whereas thiobarbituric acid reactive substances decreased by the application of exogenous plant growth regulators plant growth promoting bacteria compared with control plants interaction effects revealed that plant growth regulators plant growth promoting bacteria

2012 in the eastern mediterranean regions leaves of chicory are used to treat diabetes bacterial infections poisoning and rheumatism azaizeh et al 2006 crude extracts from flowers and aerial parts of chicory contain more than one photosensitive compound flowers extracts contain cichoriin shindo et al 1993 root extracts contain lactucin and lactucopicrin norbaek et al 2002 and anthocyanins al akhras et al 2007 chicory root extracts are very rich in inulin and oligofructose that inhibit the growth of various kinds of cancerous tumors kaur and gupta 2002 nowadays most studies on chicory are focused on the properties of inulin in the roots franck 2000 inulin is a blend of fructan chains and it can function as storage carbohydrates inulin is capable of reducing the production of fat and triglycerides in the blood and can facilitate stool production and fecal excretion roberfroid 2004 among various abiotic and biotic stresses water deficit stress is one of the major stress factors

or survive stressful conditions fahad et al 2015 when the plants perceive stress signals the change in the endogenous status of phytohormones occurs munoz espinoza et al 2015 raja et al 2017 for this purpose plants exhibit various mechanisms in their compatibility with drought stress including metabolism alteration by hormones peleg and blumwald 2011 plant growth promoting bacteria pgpbs can synthesize phytohormones mainly auxins that stimulate plant cell growth and division in the roots to become tolerant against environmental stresses such as drought glick and pasternak 2003 inoculation

jasmonic acid ja and methyl jasmonate meja are important plant growth regulators which are widely distributed in plant kingdom and play important roles in various physiological processes in plants such as seed germination root growth flowering fruit ripening tuber formation senescence and nutrient storage wasternack and hause 2013 wasternack 2014 chlormequat chloride ccc is one of the plant growth regulators that influence plants in stress conditions through an increase in the initial root growth increasing the stomatal resistance higher plant water potential and finally increasing the productivity by improving its water use efficiency de et al 1982 uniconazole which belongs to a group of triazoles also has a plant growth regulatory effect that protects plants against various stresses leul and zhou 1998 according to our literature review there is no enough information on the effects of different irrigation regimes and pgrs or pgpbs on chicory plants because these crucial traits have never been measured in a comprehensive experiment these experiments were conducted to assess physiological traits and inulin content of chicory affected by available exogenous pgrs meja chlormequat chloride and uniconazole or pgpbs under different irrigation regimes our work may help to clarify which one of the pgrs or pgpbs can mitigate the effects of water deficit stress 2

630 nm using a spectrophotometer instrument the corresponding content of total soluble sugars was measured against the standard curve created by different glucose concentrations the numerical value of the obtained data was calculated in terms of mg g of fresh weight for chl car contents μmol g of fresh weight for proline and finally mg g of dry weight for total soluble sugars 2 4 5 tbars content the level of lipid peroxidation was measured in terms of tbars content heath and packer 1968 leaf sample 0 5 g was homogenized in 10 ml 0 1 trichloracetic acid tca the homogenate was centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 min to 1 ml aliquot of the supernatant 4 ml of 0 5 thiobarbituric acid tba in 20 tca was added the mixture was heated at 95 c for 30 min in the laboratory electric oven and then cooled in an ice bath after centrifugation at 10000 g for 10 min the absorbance of the supernatant was recorded at 532 nm the tbars content was calculated by its extinction coefficient of 155 mmol 1 cm 1 and expressed as nmol tbars g 1 fresh weight 2 4 6 inulin content accordingly total soluble sugars yemm and willis 1954 and reducing sugars miller 1959 were measured for the determination of inulin content in chicory roots for this purpose after adding 3 ml of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid to 3 ml of aliquots the samples were boiled in a water bath at 90 c for 15 min use of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reagent reacts with reducing sugars to form 3 amino 5 nitrosalicylic acid the hydroxyl group of this compound being finally oxidized and produced a reddish orange color depending on reducing sugars content in samples a color was formed from orange to red and to stabilize the resulting color 1 ml of a 40 solution of the sodium potassium tartrate was added to the mixture of reactants after the development of the color and prior to cooling after cooling the reaction mixture the absorbance was read at 575 nm in a uv vis double beam spectrophotometer t80 beijing china finally inulin content was determined by subtracting total soluble sugars and reducing sugars 2 5 statistical analysis all data were subjected to anova using sas ver 9 2 0 statistical software experimental data were statistically analyzed as a 3 5 factorial using the proc glm by slicing interactions in sas software the assumption of the variance analysis was tested by ensuring that the residuals were random homogeneous and with a normal distribution about a mean of zero using residual plots and the anderson darling test means were separated using fisher s least significant difference flsd test at a 0 01 significance threshold 3 results 3 1 rwc results indicated that different irrigation regimes had a significant effect on the rwc in chicory leaves p 0 01 table 1 so that rwc reduced to 43 67 and 41 60 after depleting 70 and 90 of the available water capacity in the soil table 2 application of pgrs or pgpbs caused a significant increase in rwc of leaves compared with control plants although there was no significant difference among pgrs or pgpbs in terms of increased rwc table 2 interaction effects revealed that rwc reduced in chicory leaves by increasing water deficit stress at all pgrs or pgpbs applied but the highest reduction was related to awc 10 with those of non pgrs treated by 36 97 table 3 3 2 membrane stability leaves of chicory plants showed lower msi in the awc 10 condition than the awc 30 and awc 55 so that msi reduced to 82 63 after depleting 90 of the available water capacity in the soil in addition leaves of chicory plants subjected to exogenous application of pgrs or pgpbs showed a significantly higher msi in the leaves compared with control plants table 2 msi did not differ significantly in leaves under both awc 55 and awc 30 conditions by using all of the treatments however when plants were maintained under awc 10 condition msis in exogenous pgrs or pgpbs significantly were higher than those measured in control plants table 3 3 3 pigments content water deficit stress had a significant effect on chlorophyllous content p 0 01 table 1 and chl a b total chl and car contents decreased under water deficit stresses so that these pigments content showed the lowest amounts in the awc 10 condition by 0 98 0 15 1 12 and 0 46 mg g 1 f wt respectively table 2 application of exogenous pgrs or pgpbs to plants caused to increase in chl a b total chl and car compared to non pgrs application the highest chl a b and total chl contents obtained using pgpbs by 1 33 0 22 and 1 56 mg g 1 f wt respectively although there was no significant difference between pgpbs and pgrs the highest car content was related to chlormequat chloride and pgpbs application table 2 interaction effects between irrigation regimes and pgrs pgpbs on the chlorophyllous and car contents were significant but total chl was not affected significantly p 0 01 table 1 plants indicated different leaf chl a b and car contents under irrigation regimes and the application of pgrs pgpbs the lowest leaf chl a b and car contents was related to control plants at the severe water deficit stress condition awc 10 in the soil in contrast the highest chl a b and car contents were related to pgpbs chlormequat chloride and meja at this water deficit stress condition although there was no significant difference among pgrs and pgpbs fig 1 3 4 tbars content upon the exposure of chicory plants to water deficit stress tbars content increased in detached leaves such that under the awc 30 and awc 10 conditions the detached leaves indicated an significant increase in the concentration of tbars by 25 37 and 36 82 nmol g 1 f wt compared with the awc 55 condition by 13 22 nmol g 1 f wt respectively table 2 applications of pgrs or pgpbs were effective reducing the amounts of tbars and indicated significant difference compared with control plants the lowest tbars content was recorded by using pgpbs by 21 06 nmol g 1 f wt however the application of various pgrs had no significant effects on the tbars content of chicory leaves compared with those of pgpbs treated plants table 2 interaction effects between irrigation regimes and pgrs or pgpbs indicated that tbars content increased under water deficit stress using all of the treatments the highest tbars content was recorded in the awc 10 using control plants by 50 66 3 74 nmol g 1 f wt in a while the lowest tbars content was related to pgpbs and meja at this severe water deficit stress condition by 30 91 3 16 and 31 61 2 21 nmol g 1 f wt table 3 3 5 proline content there was a significant increase in proline content under a water deficit stress conditions when compared with those obtained from the awc 55 condition such that the concentration of proline in the awc 10 reached 4 45 μmol g 1 f wt table 4 application of pgrs increased the concentration of proline in chicory leaves compared with control plants regardless of pgpbs treatment the highest proline content was observed using meja by 4 09 μmol g 1 f wt the lowest concentration of proline was recorded using pgpbs treatment even lower than control plants by 1 71 μmol g 1 f wt table 4 when plants were maintained under water deficit stress conditions the concentration of proline in pgrs treated plants were higher than those measured in control plants regardless of pgpbs treated plants surprisingly the lowest proline content was recorded in the severe water deficit stress condition using pgpbs by 2 33 0 09 μmol g 1 f wt in a while the highest concentration of proline was recorded using meja by 6 51 0 54 μmol g 1 f wt at this water deficit stress condition fig 2 3 6 total soluble sugars water deficit stress had a significant effect on total soluble sugars accumulation in the leaves and roots p 0 01 table 1 so that soluble sugars increased in the leaves and decreased in the roots by increasing severity of water deficit stress the highest soluble sugars in the leaves was recorded in the awc 10 condition by 337 05 mg g 1 d wt and the lowest was related to awc 55 by 141 24 mg g 1 d wt in contrast the lowest soluble sugars in the roots was recorded in the awc 10 condition by 154 88 mg g 1 d wt and the highest was observed in the awc 55 by 322 15 mg g 1 d wt table 4 leaves of chicory plants treated by exogenous pgrs or pgpbs indicated significantly higher soluble sugars in the leaves and roots compared with control plants maximum soluble sugars in the leaves was observed using meja by 282 34 mg g 1 d wt whereas the highest soluble sugars in roots were observed by the application of pgpbs and uniconazole by 299 89 and 301 27 mg g 1 d wt respectively table 4 results showed that total soluble sugars in the leaves increased when plants were maintained under water deficit stress conditions using all of the treatments however this increase significantly was higher than control plants by application of pgrs or pgpbs the highest soluble sugars in the leaves were observed in the awc 10 by application of chlormequat chloride and meja by 370 79 10 90 and 374 44 6 26 mg g 1 d wt respectively in contrast soluble sugars in the roots decreased when plants were maintained under water deficit stress using all of the treatments the lowest soluble sugars content in the roots was related to awc 10 in the control plants and chlormequat chloride by 117 01 11 99 and 118 03 28 17 mg g 1 d wt fig 3 3 7 inulin content inulin was affected significantly using different irrigation regimes p 0 01 table 1 such that inulin content decreased from 28 32 in the awc 55 to 13 53 in the awc 10 pgrs or pgpbs had a significant effect on inulin accumulation in the roots of chicory plants p 0 01 table 1 so that inulin increased by application of pgrs or pgpbs compared with control plants the highest inulin content was related to the application of uniconazole and pgpbs by 27 15 and 26 79 respectively table 4 interaction effects between different irrigation regimes and pgrs pgpbs revealed that inulin content in the roots of chicory plants reduced by increasing severity of water deficit stress in the soil regardless of the type of treatment the highest inulin was recorded from the awc 55 to awc 10 using pgpbs and uniconazole by 37 91 to 16 35 and 31 83 to 20 03 respectively despite inulin content was higher than control plants using chlormequat chloride and meja in the awc 55 but this difference was not significant at the awc 10 fig 4 4 discussion the physiological characteristics measured in these experiments were decreased regardless of tbars proline and total soluble sugars contents in the leaves subjected to water deficit stress the results showed that all these events led to a reduction in inulin content in chicory roots under water deficit stresses plants produced adequate photosynthetic substances under normal conditions in such cases an accumulation of endogenous reactive oxygen species ros and therefore the level of lipid peroxidation were to be found at the lower limit that followed by high membrane stability there was improved stomatal conductance in the leaves and enough water and minerals to flow into the roots subsequently rwc was in an appropriate form in the leaves osmotic compounds such as sugars and proline often dedicated to making other cellular compounds in the leaves hence such compounds were to be found at very low levels in the leaves in these conditions and chicory plants stored carbohydrates in the form of inulin by transferring excess of these substances to the roots in contrast stomatal conductance was in a lower limit and plants closed their stomata apertures under water deficit stress conditions because of the loss of water in the soil rwc in the leaves reduced due to less flow of water from surrounding soil into the roots at first plants responded to these critical conditions by increasing osmolytes in the roots or transferring them from other organs to the roots it is evident that water moves to where it is more concentrated based on the osmotic process however plants have devoted most of their osmotic compounds such as soluble sugars proline polyamides betaines quaternary ammonium compounds polyhydric alcohols and other amino acids and water stress proteins like dehydrins to the leaves to lower osmotic potential and to raise water to the leaves in continued water deficit stress conditions therefore proline and soluble sugars in the leaves of chicory plants increased under the severity of water deficit stress conditions soluble sugars content decreased under these situations in the roots and inulin was stored less than awc 55 in the awc 30 and awc 10 also plants respond to oxidative stresses such as water deficit by increasing antioxidant systems in the form of enzymes including superoxide dismutase sod apx glutathione reductase gr dehydroascorbate reductase dhar cat and metabolites viz ascorbic acid glutathione α tocopherol car and flavonoids etc bowler et al 1992 smirnoff 1995 it seems that by accumulating ros in continuous water deficit stress conditions antioxidant enzymes have been unable to reduce them as a result singlet oxygen s in a high performance have invaded and degraded all cellular structures such as chl and membranes by lipid peroxidation therefore chlorophyllous content and membrane stability of chicory plants reduced by increasing the severity of water deficit stress conditions especially in the awc 10 besides car are responsible for quenching of singlet oxygen s hence reduction in their content under the severity of water deficit stress is related to this function the results showed that endogenous ros destroyed cellular structures including chl and car and led to a lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes under continuous water deficit stresses as mentioned previously in contrast plants have a complex network for identifying different stress signals that help them to survive under stress conditions endogenous ros are key players in the signaling pathways associated with various biotic and abiotic stress responses perez and brown 2014 phytohormones play an important role in countering environmental stresses in addition to performing their functions in the growth and development of plants bali et al 2018 for example in plant cells abscisic acid aba activates ca2 signaling which leads to the control of the s type anion channel slac1 for the regulation of stomatal closure brandt et al 2015 it was suggested that drought stress stops the conversion of ja from the precursor 12 opda which then either acts independently or in conjugation with aba to stimulate stomatal closure and controls plant drought tolerance savchenko et al 2014 aba can also influence the accumulation of proline by regulating the expression of p5cs and p5cr in plants during abiotic stress verslues and bray 2006 gibberellin ga has been found to exhibit positive relationship with proline accumulation and foliar application of ga3 on maize zea mays l plants was found to counteract the adverse effects of salt stress through increased proline and macro ca k mg n na and p and micronutrients fe mn and zn accumulation and also in maintaining the cell membrane permeability tuna et al 2008 ethylene has been reported to interact with other signaling molecules and regulates proline accumulation salicylic acid sa has been shown to induce proline metabolism enhance antioxidant system and confers tolerance to plants against both salt and drought stresses khan et al 2015 nazar et al 2015 ja induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in the activation of defense mechanisms shan and liang 2010 liu et al 2012 shan and liang 2010 showed that ja increased the transcript levels of apx and cat in crested wheat grass agropyron cristatum l gaertn under water stress however continuous oxidative stresses lead to a reduction in pigments content and peroxidation of lipids despite plants have mechanisms such as antioxidant enzymes to control the oxidative damages therefore these measured characteristics reduced more in control plants compared with pgrs treatments in these conditions exogenous pgrs mediated protection in plants subjected to water deficit stress and our results demonstrated that exogenous pgrs application could decrease water deficit stress adverse effects de et al 1982 reported that wheat plants treated with foliar application of chlormequat chloride in concentrations between 40 and 1000 mg l yielded better than did the untreated control in the dry period of a semi arid land due to more root growth increased stomatal resistance and higher leaf water potential uniconazole can improve root growth in winter rape brassica napus l zhou and ye 1996 studies showed that exogenous meja also significantly increases aba levels in soybean under a salt stress environment yoon et al 2009 meja has also been found to increase root hydraulic conductivity in common bean phaseolus vulgaris l tomato solanum lycopersicum l and thale cress arabidopsis thaliana l heynh roots and assist plants to fetch more water from soil with limited moisture sanchez romera et al 2014 however ja inhibits auxin induced root growth by suppressing the expression levels of tfs plethora plt1 and plt2 the central regulators in auxin mediated root meristem and root stem cell niche development chen et al 2011 also the exogenous application of pgrs has shown to protect the plants from induced injuries by increasing their antioxidative capacity anjum et al 2011b reported that the exogenous application of meja caused a noticeable increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes sod peroxidases pod and cat our results indicated that the proline and rwc are in high levels in chicory plants while the membrane lipid peroxidation is in low level in the plants subjected to drought stress by application of pgrs compared with control plants it seems that pgrs regulate some phytohormones such as aba that the latter induce proline production and its accumulation under water deficit stress conditions pgrs also increased effectively soluble sugars in the roots consequently inulin content in the roots compared with control plants yang et al 1994 reported that uniconazole could enhance nitrate reductase activity and plant photosynthetic rate and increase soluble protein and total sugar contents especially under drought stress as shown in the results proline and soluble sugars in the leaves were increased under drought stress conditions or rwc msi pigments content in the leaves inulin content followed by soluble sugars in the roots did not decrease more by application of pgrs compared with control plants in addition pgpbs secrete osmolytes in response to drought stress which acts synergistically with plant produced osmolytes and stimulates plant growth paul et al 2008 inoculation of maize plants with pgpb pseudomonas putida gap p45 sandhya et al 2010 and a lipoferum bano et al 2013 improved plant growth through the accumulation of free amino acids and soluble sugars compared with non treated plants under drought stress it should be noted that in our experiments proline content did not increase more than control plants in the leaves but soluble sugars in the leaves increased slightly compared with control plants in response to water deficit stress using pgpbs it seems that chicory plants were not under stress conditions as much as control plants by increasing water deficit stress in the soil due to induced indole 3 acetic acid iaa by phyllosphere bacteria to root growth and development inoculation with a brasilense cd increased root projection area specific root length and specific root area as compared with non inoculated controls of common bean under drought stress that is related to produce phytohormones mainly auxins german et al 2000 maize plants inoculated with five drought tolerant plant growth promoting pseudomonas spp strains subjected to drought stress showed a significantly lower activity of antioxidant enzymes as compared with uninoculated plants sandhya et al 2010 for control plants the senescence of old leaves and reduction in photosynthesis activity are a very efficient strategies enabling the surviving during water deficit stress conditions by reducing canopy size and minimizing water loss therefore accumulation of total soluble sugars in the leaves transferring them to roots decreased in this treatment and main parts of photosynthetic materials were remained in the leaves due to regulation of osmotic potential besides it seems that exogenous application of chlormequat chloride and meja have failed to regulate ga and cytokinins cks levels as well as pgpbs under water deficit stress conditions and therefore photosynthesis activity has been stopped or prevented transferring photosynthetic materials into the roots liu et al 2015 concluded that exogenous application of ja and cytokinin can antagonistically regulate leaf senescence associated gene expression in rice oryza sativa l it was also proposed that leaf senescence not only depends on the level of ja or cytokinin but also on the balance between ja and cytokinin per et al 2018 therefore inulin followed by soluble sugars in the roots has decreased in these treatments despite the reduction in other effects of water deficit stress on chicory plants uniconazole was the only pgrs that regulated cytokinin level reduced aba and ethylene levels and subsequently delayed the chlorosis and senescence in chicory plants thomas and stoddart 1980 reported that modification of ethylene and aba levels by pre treatment of seedlings with uniconazole might have helped to delay the chlorosis and senescence of plants following waterlogging as these hormones can promote chlorosis and senescence therefore the plants enable to maintain source sink relationships especially transferring non reducing sugars such as inulin during water deficit stress conditions pgpbs perform their role better than exogenous pgrs under water deficit stress conditions pgpbs role in the management of biotic and abiotic stresses include the production of phytohormones like aba cks ga and iaa acc deaminase to reduce the level of ethylene in the roots induced systemic tolerance by bacterial compounds and bacterial exopolysaccharides dimkpa et al 2009 yang et al 2009 timmusk and nevo 2011 kim et al 2013 timmusk et al 2014 the production of aba and gas by a lipoferum alleviated drought stress in maize plants by controlling stomatal closure cohen et al 2009 hence plants responded better to environmental stresses such as water deficit by application of pgpbs and regulation of guard cells anion channel slac1 increased to control stomatal closure on the other hand the concomitant increase in cks would enable the plants to maintain source strength and source sink relationships during stress and relatively higher yield peleg et al 2011 it was reported that lowered ga and cks levels could influence nutrient sink strength thomas and stoddart 1980 and promote membrane deterioration by allowing a more rapid peroxidation dhindsa et al 1982 furthermore it has been postulated that cks acts in the increase in starch contents under drought stress criado et al 2009 it seems that cks and ga producing in plants treated by pgpbs or effectiveness of this treatment on signaling pathways caused to a delay in stress symptoms i e senescence and reduction in photosynthesis activity that contributed to significantly higher soluble sugars in the roots and subsequently inulin content during water deficit stress conditions compared with other treatments 5 conclusion abiotic stresses such as water deficit stress caused damage to some physiological characteristics as well as inulin content however these physiological characteristics increased using exogenous pgrs pgpbs except of tbars content compared with control plants chicory plants had a higher accumulation of chl a b carotenoids proline soluble sugars subsequently inulin content compared with control plants using pgrs or pgpbs under water deficit stress conditions the results of the study indicated that pgpbs could help chicory plants in different ways reducing the effects of water deficit stress better than pgrs and maintained them from stress conditions as mentioned previously the application of pgpbs caused to increase in endogenous phytohormones such as ck ga and iaa in such conditions and delay in stress symptoms therefore it is better chicory seedlings inoculated by pgpbs under water deficit stress in addition uniconazole was the best pgrs to help chicory plants accumulating soluble sugars and finally inulin in the roots compared with other exogenous pgrs used in these experiments it seems that exogenous pgrs should be used or synthesized that reduce water deficit stress effects in the plants by regulating endogenous phytohormones it should be noted that modifying the plant genome or adding genes to the plants that can increase the concentration of enzymes involved in phytohormones production or their activity leads to delay in and tolerance of water deficit stress declaration of

expressed as nmol tbars g 1 fresh weight 2 4 6 inulin content accordingly total soluble sugars yemm and willis 1954 and reducing sugars miller 1959 were measured for the determination of inulin content in chicory roots for this purpose after adding 3 ml of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid to 3 ml of aliquots the samples were boiled in a water bath at 90 c for 15 min use of 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid reagent reacts with reducing sugars to form 3 amino 5 nitrosalicylic acid the hydroxyl group of this compound being finally oxidized and produced a reddish orange color depending on reducing sugars content in samples a color was formed from orange to red and to stabilize the resulting color 1 ml of a 40 solution of the sodium potassium tartrate was added to the mixture of reactants after the development of the color and prior to cooling after cooling the reaction mixture the absorbance was read at 575 nm in a uv vis double beam spectrophotometer t80 beijing china finally inulin content

statistically analyzed as a 3 5 factorial using the proc glm by slicing interactions in sas software the assumption of the variance analysis was tested by ensuring that the residuals were random homogeneous and with a normal distribution about a mean of zero using residual plots and the anderson darling test means were separated using fisher s least significant difference flsd test at a 0 01 significance threshold 3 results 3 1 rwc results indicated that different irrigation regimes had a significant effect on the rwc in chicory leaves p 0 01 table 1 so that rwc reduced to 43 67 and 41 60 after depleting 70 and 90 of the available water capacity in the soil table 2 application of pgrs or pgpbs caused a significant increase in rwc of leaves compared with control plants although there was no significant difference among pgrs or pgpbs in terms of increased rwc table 2 interaction effects revealed that rwc reduced in chicory leaves by increasing water deficit stress at all pgrs or pgpbs applied but the highest reduction was related to awc 10 with those of non pgrs treated by 36 97 table 3 3 2 membrane stability leaves of chicory plants showed lower msi in the awc 10 condition than the awc 30 and awc 55 so that msi reduced to 82 63 after depleting 90 of the available water capacity in the soil in addition leaves of chicory plants subjected to exogenous application of pgrs or pgpbs showed a significantly higher msi in the leaves compared with control plants table 2 msi did not differ significantly in leaves under both awc 55 and awc 30 conditions by using all of the treatments however when plants were maintained under awc 10 condition msis in exogenous pgrs or pgpbs significantly were higher than those measured in control plants table 3 3 3 pigments content water deficit stress had a significant effect on chlorophyllous content p 0 01 table 1 and chl a b total chl and car contents decreased under water deficit stresses so that these pigments content showed the lowest amounts in the awc 10 condition by 0 98 0 15 1 12 and 0 46 mg g 1 f wt respectively table 2 application of exogenous pgrs or pgpbs to plants caused to increase in chl a b total chl and car compared to non pgrs application the highest chl a b and total chl contents obtained using pgpbs by 1 33 0 22 and 1 56 mg g 1 f wt respectively although there was no significant difference between pgpbs and pgrs the highest car content was related to chlormequat chloride and pgpbs application table 2 interaction effects between irrigation regimes and pgrs pgpbs on the chlorophyllous and car contents were significant but total chl was not affected significantly p 0 01 table 1 plants indicated different leaf chl a b and car contents under irrigation regimes and the application of pgrs pgpbs the lowest leaf chl a b and car contents was related to control plants at the severe water deficit stress condition awc 10 in the soil in contrast the highest chl a b and car contents were related to pgpbs chlormequat chloride and meja at this water deficit stress condition although there was no significant difference among pgrs and pgpbs fig 1 3 4 tbars content upon the exposure of chicory plants to water deficit stress tbars content increased in detached leaves such that under the awc 30 and awc 10 conditions the detached leaves indicated an significant increase in the concentration of tbars by 25 37 and 36 82 nmol g 1 f wt compared with the awc 55 condition by 13 22 nmol g 1 f wt respectively table 2 applications of pgrs or pgpbs were effective reducing the amounts of tbars and indicated significant difference compared with control plants the lowest tbars content was recorded by using pgpbs by 21 06 nmol g 1 f wt however the application of various pgrs had no significant effects on the tbars content of chicory leaves compared with those of pgpbs treated plants table 2 interaction effects between irrigation regimes and pgrs or pgpbs indicated that tbars content increased under water deficit stress using all of the treatments the highest tbars content was recorded in the awc 10 using control plants by 50 66 3 74 nmol g 1 f wt in a while the lowest tbars content was related to pgpbs and meja at this severe water deficit stress condition by 30 91 3 16 and 31 61 2 21 nmol g 1 f wt table 3 3 5 proline content there was a significant increase in proline content under a water deficit stress conditions when compared with those obtained from the awc 55 condition such that the concentration of proline in the awc 10 reached 4 45 μmol g 1 f wt table 4 application of pgrs increased the concentration of proline in chicory leaves compared with control plants regardless of pgpbs treatment the highest proline content was observed using meja by 4 09 μmol g 1 f wt the lowest concentration of proline was recorded using pgpbs treatment even lower than control plants by 1 71 μmol g 1 f wt table 4 when plants were maintained under water deficit stress conditions the concentration of proline in pgrs treated plants were higher than those measured in control plants regardless of pgpbs treated plants surprisingly the lowest proline content was recorded in the severe water deficit stress condition using pgpbs by 2 33 0 09 μmol g 1 f wt in a while the highest concentration of proline was recorded using meja by 6 51 0 54 μmol g 1 f wt at this water deficit stress condition fig 2 3 6 total soluble sugars water deficit stress had a significant effect on total soluble sugars accumulation in the leaves and roots p 0 01 table 1 so that soluble sugars increased in the leaves and decreased in the roots by increasing severity of water deficit stress the highest soluble sugars in the leaves was recorded in the awc 10 condition by 337 05 mg g 1 d wt and the lowest was related to awc 55 by 141 24 mg g 1 d wt in contrast the lowest soluble sugars in the roots was recorded in the awc 10 condition by 154 88 mg g 1 d wt and the highest was observed in the awc 55 by 322 15 mg g 1 d wt table 4 leaves of chicory plants treated by exogenous pgrs or pgpbs indicated significantly higher soluble sugars in the leaves and roots compared with control plants maximum soluble sugars in the leaves was observed using meja by 282 34 mg g 1 d wt whereas the highest soluble sugars in roots were observed by the application of pgpbs and uniconazole by 299 89 and 301 27 mg g 1 d wt respectively table 4 results showed that total soluble sugars in the leaves increased when plants were maintained under water deficit stress conditions using all of the treatments however this increase significantly was higher than control plants by application of pgrs or pgpbs the highest soluble sugars in the leaves were observed in the awc 10 by application of chlormequat chloride and meja by 370 79 10 90 and 374 44 6 26 mg g 1 d wt respectively in contrast soluble sugars in the roots decreased when plants were maintained under water deficit stress using all of the treatments the lowest soluble sugars content in the roots was related to awc 10 in the control plants and chlormequat chloride by 117 01 11 99 and 118 03 28 17 mg g 1 d wt fig 3 3 7 inulin content inulin was affected significantly using different irrigation regimes p 0 01 table 1 such that inulin content decreased from 28 32 in the awc 55 to 13 53 in the awc 10 pgrs or pgpbs had a significant effect on inulin accumulation in the roots of chicory plants p 0 01 table 1 so that inulin increased by application of pgrs or pgpbs compared with control plants the highest inulin content was related to the application of uniconazole and pgpbs by 27 15 and 26 79 respectively table 4 interaction effects between different irrigation regimes and pgrs pgpbs revealed that inulin content in the roots of chicory plants reduced by increasing severity of water deficit stress in the soil regardless of the type of treatment the highest inulin was recorded from the awc 55 to awc 10 using pgpbs and uniconazole by 37 91 to 16 35 and 31 83 to 20 03 respectively despite inulin content was higher than control plants using chlormequat chloride and meja in the awc 55 but this difference was not significant at the awc 10 fig 4 4 discussion the physiological characteristics measured in these experiments were decreased regardless of tbars proline and total soluble sugars contents in the leaves subjected to water deficit stress the results showed that all these events led to a reduction in inulin content in chicory roots under water deficit stresses plants produced adequate photosynthetic substances under normal conditions in such cases an accumulation of endogenous reactive oxygen species ros and therefore the level of lipid peroxidation were to be found at the lower limit that followed by high membrane stability there was improved stomatal conductance in the leaves and enough water and minerals to flow into the roots subsequently rwc was in an appropriate form in the leaves osmotic compounds such as sugars and proline often dedicated to making other cellular compounds in the leaves hence such compounds were to be found at very low levels in the leaves in these conditions and chicory plants stored carbohydrates in the form of inulin by transferring excess of these substances to the roots in contrast stomatal conductance was in a lower limit and plants closed their stomata apertures under water deficit stress conditions because of the loss of water in the soil rwc in the leaves reduced due to less flow of water from surrounding soil into the roots at first plants responded to these critical conditions by increasing osmolytes in the roots or transferring them from other organs to the roots it is evident that water moves to where it is more concentrated based on the osmotic process however plants have devoted most of their osmotic compounds such as soluble sugars proline polyamides betaines quaternary ammonium compounds polyhydric alcohols and other amino acids and water stress proteins like dehydrins to the leaves to lower osmotic potential and to raise water to the leaves in continued water deficit stress conditions therefore proline and soluble sugars in the leaves of chicory plants increased under the severity of water deficit stress conditions soluble sugars content decreased under these situations in the roots and inulin was stored less than awc 55 in the awc 30 and awc 10 also plants respond to oxidative stresses such as water deficit by increasing antioxidant systems in the form of enzymes including superoxide dismutase sod apx glutathione reductase gr dehydroascorbate reductase dhar cat and metabolites viz ascorbic acid glutathione α tocopherol car and flavonoids etc bowler et al 1992 smirnoff 1995 it seems that by accumulating ros in continuous water deficit stress conditions antioxidant enzymes have been unable to reduce them as a result singlet oxygen s in a high performance have invaded and degraded all cellular structures such as chl and membranes by lipid peroxidation therefore chlorophyllous content and membrane stability of chicory plants reduced by increasing the severity of water deficit stress conditions especially in the awc 10 besides car are responsible for quenching of singlet oxygen s hence reduction in their content under the severity of water deficit stress is related to this function the results showed that endogenous ros destroyed cellular structures including chl and car and led to a lipid peroxidation in cellular membranes under continuous water deficit stresses as mentioned previously in contrast plants have a complex network for identifying different stress signals that help them to survive under stress conditions endogenous ros are key players in the signaling pathways associated with various biotic and abiotic stress responses perez and brown 2014 phytohormones play an important role in countering environmental stresses in addition to performing their functions in the growth and development of plants bali et al 2018 for example in plant cells abscisic acid aba activates ca2 signaling which leads to the control of the s type anion channel slac1 for the regulation of stomatal closure brandt et al 2015 it was suggested that drought stress stops the conversion of ja from the precursor 12 opda which then either acts independently or in conjugation with aba to stimulate stomatal closure and controls plant drought tolerance savchenko et al 2014 aba can also influence the accumulation of proline by regulating the expression of p5cs and p5cr in plants during abiotic stress verslues and bray 2006 gibberellin ga has been found to exhibit positive relationship with proline accumulation and foliar application of ga3 on maize zea mays l plants was found to counteract the adverse effects of salt stress through increased proline and macro ca k mg n na and p and micronutrients fe mn and zn accumulation and also in maintaining the cell membrane permeability tuna et al 2008 ethylene has been reported to interact with other signaling molecules and regulates proline accumulation salicylic acid sa has been shown to induce proline metabolism enhance antioxidant system and confers tolerance to plants against both salt and drought stresses khan et al 2015 nazar et al 2015 ja induces the expression of a variety of genes involved in the activation of defense mechanisms shan and liang 2010 liu et al 2012 shan and liang 2010 showed that ja increased the transcript levels of apx and cat in crested wheat grass agropyron cristatum l gaertn under water stress however continuous oxidative stresses lead to a reduction in pigments content and peroxidation of lipids despite plants have mechanisms such as antioxidant enzymes to control the oxidative damages therefore these measured characteristics reduced more in control plants compared with pgrs treatments in these conditions exogenous pgrs mediated protection in plants subjected to water deficit stress and our results demonstrated that exogenous pgrs application could decrease water deficit stress adverse effects de et al 1982 reported that wheat plants treated with foliar application of chlormequat chloride in concentrations between 40 and 1000 mg l yielded better than did the untreated control in the dry period of a semi arid land due to more root growth increased stomatal resistance and higher leaf water potential uniconazole can improve root growth in winter rape brassica napus l zhou and ye 1996 studies showed that exogenous meja also significantly increases aba levels in soybean under a salt stress environment yoon et al 2009 meja has also been found to increase root hydraulic conductivity in common bean phaseolus vulgaris l tomato solanum lycopersicum l and thale cress arabidopsis thaliana l heynh roots and assist plants to fetch more water from soil with limited moisture sanchez romera et al 2014 however ja inhibits auxin induced root growth by suppressing the expression levels of tfs plethora plt1 and plt2 the central regulators in auxin mediated root meristem and root stem cell niche development chen et al 2011 also the exogenous application of pgrs has shown to protect the plants from induced injuries by increasing their antioxidative capacity anjum et al 2011b reported that the exogenous application of meja caused a noticeable increase in the activity of antioxidant enzymes sod peroxidases pod and cat our results indicated that the proline and rwc are in high levels in chicory plants while the membrane lipid peroxidation is in low level in the plants subjected to drought stress by application of pgrs compared with control plants it seems that pgrs regulate some phytohormones such as aba that the latter induce proline production and its accumulation under water deficit stress conditions pgrs also increased effectively soluble sugars in the roots consequently inulin content in the roots compared with control plants yang et al 1994 reported that uniconazole could enhance nitrate reductase activity and plant photosynthetic rate and increase soluble protein and total sugar contents especially under drought stress as shown in the results proline and soluble sugars in the leaves were increased under drought stress conditions or rwc msi pigments content in the leaves inulin content followed by soluble sugars in the roots did not decrease more by application of pgrs compared with control plants in addition pgpbs secrete osmolytes in response to drought stress which acts synergistically with plant produced osmolytes and stimulates plant growth paul et al 2008 inoculation of maize plants with pgpb pseudomonas putida gap p45 sandhya et al 2010 and a lipoferum bano et al 2013 improved plant growth through the accumulation of free amino acids and soluble sugars compared with non treated plants under drought stress it should be noted that in our experiments proline content did not increase more than control plants in the leaves but soluble sugars in the leaves increased slightly compared with control plants in response to water deficit stress using pgpbs it seems that chicory plants were not under stress conditions as much as control plants by increasing water deficit stress in the soil due to induced indole 3 acetic acid iaa by phyllosphere bacteria to root growth and development inoculation with a brasilense cd increased root projection area specific root length and specific root area as compared with non inoculated controls of common bean under drought stress that is related to produce phytohormones mainly auxins german et al 2000 maize plants inoculated with five drought tolerant plant growth promoting pseudomonas spp strains subjected to drought stress showed a significantly lower activity of antioxidant enzymes as compared with uninoculated plants sandhya et al 2010 for control plants the senescence of old leaves and reduction in photosynthesis activity are a very efficient strategies enabling the surviving during water deficit stress conditions by reducing canopy size and minimizing water loss therefore accumulation of total soluble sugars in the leaves transferring them to roots decreased in this treatment and main parts of photosynthetic materials were remained in the leaves due to regulation of osmotic potential besides it seems that exogenous application of chlormequat chloride and meja have failed to regulate ga and cytokinins cks levels as well as pgpbs under water deficit stress conditions and therefore photosynthesis activity has been stopped or prevented transferring photosynthetic materials into the roots liu et al 2015 concluded that exogenous application of ja and cytokinin can antagonistically regulate leaf senescence associated gene expression in rice oryza sativa l it was also proposed that leaf senescence not only depends on the level of ja or cytokinin but also on the balance between ja and cytokinin per et al 2018 therefore inulin followed by soluble sugars in the roots has decreased in these treatments despite the reduction in other effects of water deficit stress on chicory plants uniconazole was the only pgrs that regulated cytokinin level reduced aba and ethylene levels and subsequently delayed the chlorosis and senescence in chicory plants thomas and stoddart 1980 reported that modification of ethylene and aba levels by pre treatment of seedlings with uniconazole might have helped to delay the chlorosis and senescence of plants following waterlogging as these hormones can promote chlorosis and senescence therefore the plants enable to maintain source sink relationships especially transferring non reducing sugars such as inulin during water deficit stress conditions pgpbs perform their role better than exogenous pgrs under water deficit stress conditions pgpbs role in the management of biotic and abiotic stresses include the production of phytohormones like aba cks ga and iaa acc deaminase to reduce the level of ethylene in the roots induced systemic tolerance by bacterial compounds and bacterial exopolysaccharides dimkpa et al 2009 yang et al 2009 timmusk and nevo 2011 kim et al 2013 timmusk et al 2014 the production of aba and gas by a lipoferum alleviated drought stress in maize plants by controlling stomatal closure cohen et al 2009 hence plants responded better to environmental stresses such as water deficit by application of pgpbs and regulation of guard cells anion channel slac1 increased to control stomatal closure on the other hand the concomitant increase in cks would enable the plants to maintain source strength and source sink relationships during stress and relatively higher yield peleg et al 2011 it was reported that lowered ga and cks levels could influence nutrient sink strength thomas and stoddart 1980 and promote membrane deterioration by allowing a more rapid peroxidation dhindsa et al 1982 furthermore it has been postulated that cks acts in the increase in starch contents under drought stress criado et al 2009 it seems that cks and ga producing in plants treated by pgpbs or effectiveness of this treatment on signaling pathways caused to a delay in stress symptoms i e senescence and reduction in photosynthesis activity that contributed to significantly higher soluble sugars in the roots and subsequently inulin content during water deficit stress conditions compared with other treatments 5 conclusion abiotic stresses such as water deficit stress caused damage to some physiological characteristics as well as inulin content however these physiological characteristics increased using exogenous pgrs pgpbs except of tbars content compared with control plants chicory plants had a higher accumulation of chl a b carotenoids proline soluble sugars subsequently inulin content compared with control plants using pgrs or pgpbs under water deficit stress conditions the results of the study indicated that pgpbs could help chicory plants in different ways reducing the effects of water deficit stress better than pgrs and maintained them from stress conditions as mentioned previously the application of pgpbs caused to increase in endogenous phytohormones such as ck ga and iaa in such conditions and delay in stress symptoms therefore it is better chicory seedlings inoculated by pgpbs under water deficit stress in addition uniconazole was the best pgrs to help chicory plants accumulating soluble sugars and finally inulin in the roots compared with other exogenous pgrs used in these experiments it seems that exogenous pgrs should be used or synthesized that reduce water deficit stress effects in the plants by regulating endogenous phytohormones it should be noted that modifying the plant genome or adding genes to the plants that can increase the concentration of enzymes involved in phytohormones production or their activity leads to delay in and tolerance of water deficit stress declaration of

10251,accurate determination of temporal variability in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient is essential for appropriate design of surface irrigation systems to improve irrigation performance and reduce water losses the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of temporal variability and different inflow rates on infiltration parameters manning s roughness and irrigation performance the field experiments included three inflow rates 1 1 5 and 2 l s and three irrigation events 3rd 5th and 8th events from 14 sep 2016 to 5 nov 2016 arranged in three replications at salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields located in the southwest of iran also experimental treatments were conducted in nine furrows with a length of 250 m the width of 1 83 m and closed end boundary the results indicated that there was no significant difference in the manning s roughness during the growing season on the other hand there were significant reductions of the manning s roughness for inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s in comparison with that obtained in inflow rate of 1 l s results also indicated that the cut off time and infiltrated volume were significantly affected by the temporal variability of infiltration parameters and roughness coefficient the values of infiltration parameters during the growing season were variable because of various field conditions and sugarcane growth there were significant differences between the values of parameters of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation during the growing season the results showed that changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l sec increased the value of final infiltration rate f0 in the 5th irrigation event by 6 2 and 39 7 in the 8th irrigation event the advance and recession times increased during the growing season in which there was an effective difference in the 8th irrigation event compared to that in the 5th irrigation event the temporal variability during growing season resulted in a significant reduction in application efficiency from 74 to 49 distribution uniformity from 91 to 80 and a significant increase in deep percolation from 25 to 51 the results showed that when the inflow rate increased from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s the mean values of application efficiency decreased by 3 43 and 24 55 deep percolation decreased by 27 34 and 34 17 and finally distribution uniformity increased significantly by 9 7 and 9 3 respectively keywords furrow irrigation temporal variability irrigation performance 1 introduction surface irrigation is the most common irrigation method in the world because of its low cost and energy requirements compared to pressurized irrigation systems surface irrigation covers about 90 of the total irrigated lands in iran lalehzari et al 2014 although it usually suffers from different problems such as low efficiency and distribution uniformity moreover accurate design of surface irrigation systems can save more water and improve irrigation performance indicators ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 thus many studies have been carried out to increase the efficiency of surface irrigation systems walker and skogerboe 1987 mazarei et al 2020 furrow irrigation is one of the most widely used methods of surface irrigation in which water is applied and conveyed over the field surface by gravitational force koech et al 2010 furrow irrigation with blocked end boundary is more common in the sugarcane fields located in the southwest of iran veysi et al 2017 mazarei et al 2020 however furrow irrigation has some problems such as poor irrigation performance unsuitable uniformity and high deep percolation moravejalahkami et al 2009 the unsuitable management poor design and implementation are important reasons for the low performance in furrow irrigation systems which lead to wastage of water and waterlogging ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 lalehzari et al 2014 it should be noted that due to differences in crops grown weather and field conditions irrigation performance varies significantly through the season and lead to main problems in determining the best combination of effective parameters in irrigation performance xu et al 2019 however it is possible to improve the performance of furrow irrigation through the best combination of inflow rates cut off times length and slope of furrows numerous models have been developed for the simulation and optimization of surface irrigation systems such as surdev jurriens et al 2001 sirmod walker 2005 winsrfr bautista et al 2019 sides amadala et al 2014 surcos burguete et al 2014 and sisco gillies smith 2015 xu et al 2019 successfully used winsrfr model to evaluate surface irrigation based on temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning roughness salahoe et al 2018 used winsrfr model to examine the effect of bottom slopes surface roughness values and inflow rates on the surface irrigation performance their results indicated that the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time could improve surface irrigation performance also irrigation performance indicators were evaluated using the winsrfr model for a large sized field by fadul et al 2020 their results indicated that surface irrigation systems could be substantially optimized by adopting alternative design and operational strategies infiltration is one of the most important parameters in the design assessment and management of furrow irrigation esfandiari and maheshwari 1997 nie et al 2017 determination of infiltration parameters is a major problem in irrigation studies because of an accurate selection of the technique used to estimate the parameters of the infiltration models yassin et al 2016 soil infiltration characteristics are determined by a multitude of factors such as soil texture soil structure soil water content and soil organic matter zheng and fan 2000 franzluebbers 2002 li and fan 2006 gillies et al 2011 the major problem in the estimation of infiltration parameters is the management of variability of soil infiltration properties in recent years because of the effects of infiltration variability i e spatial and temporal variability on irrigation performance different researchers evaluated variation of soil infiltration and effects of infiltration variability on irrigation performance salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 oyonarte et al 2002 showed distribution uniformity is very sensitive to infiltration variability also bai et al 2010 reported that variation of soil infiltration has a significant effects on the performance indicators such as application efficiency and the distribution uniformity nie et al 2019 indicated that infiltration variability should be considered in any closed end border irrigation performance evaluation xu et al 2019 also reported that the impact of the variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness on water advance and recession curves was significantly manning s roughness coefficient is one of the most important parameters in the design and evaluation of surface irrigation kamali et al 2018 it should be noted that physical characteristics of furrows such as crop density soil texture filed slope and traffic of agricultural machinery can significantly affect accurate determination of the manning coefficient harun ur rashid 1990 valiantzas 1994 temporal variability in this coefficient due to tillage practices irrigation and crop growth greatly hinders efforts to improve irrigation performance xu et al 2019 bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2016 and anwar et al 2016 recommended field manning s roughness of 0 02 0 04 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 16 respectively some approaches have been developed to determine the manning s coefficient such as multilevel optimization walker 2005 sipar id rodriguez and martos 2008 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 methods mailapalli et al 2008 evaluated the spatial and temporal variation of the manning s roughness in bare and vegetated furrows under different inflow rate the results showed that manning s roughness decreased with time in all furrows especially at lower inﬂow rates abbasi 2013 reported that manning s roughness coefficient is usually considered between 0 02 and 0 04 for furrows and varies with time and place kamali et al 2018 evaluated manning s coefficient for furrow irrigation during the maize growing season with two inflow rates of 0 29 l s low and 0 44 l s high their results indicated that manning s coefficient had the highest value at the end of the furrow also its value in the middle of the furrow was greater than at the beginning of the furrow xu et al 2019 evaluated the effects of infiltration parameters and variation of manning s coefficient for border irrigation with three border lengths also the impacts of temporal variation in infiltration parameters and roughness coefficient were evaluated seyedzadeh et al 2019 developed an analytical relationship for the estimation of manning s roughness coefficient in surface irrigation which the roughness coefficient was regarded as a function of field length and its value at each section is a function of the water depth or time walker 2005 reported that because of increasing water demands and crop production it is necessary to improve the performance of surface irrigation systems evaluating the irrigation performance requires knowledge of the management methods used by farmers and system variable measures i e field dimensions inflow rate manning s roughness cut off time and soil infiltration parameters pereira et al 2002 it is essential to use the most effective parameters for the improvement of irrigation performance bautista et al 2015 mazarei et al 2020 based on gilliess 2008 study different irrigation performance indicators are used to describe the hydraulic performance efficiency and distribution uniformity in irrigation systems many parameters affect irrigation performance which the most effective parameters are field dimensions i e slope and length inflow rate cut off time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties smith et al 2005 bautista et al 2009 morris et al 2015 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 mazarei et al 2020 many researchers have tried to optimize furrow irrigation performance optimizing field dimensions clemmens et al 1999 chen et al 2012 smith et al 2018 salahou et al 2018 mazarei et al 2020 inflow rates and cut off times bautista et al 2009 miao et al 2015 nie et al 2019 smith and uddin 2020 mazarei et al 2020 based on moravejalahkamis 2020 report considering constant values for these parameters can lead to significant errors in the assessment of advance recession trajectories measuring the variation of infiltration and manning s roughness is required to evaluate possible water savings xu et al 2019 also several researchers suggested that we can improve irrigation performance by considering soil spatial temporal variability in manning roughness and soil infiltration bai et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 sugarcane is the crop that contributes immensely to the regional economics of many countries and incidentally in these countries water consumption for sugarcane is inadequate compared to other crops dingre gorantiwar 2020 sugarcane is a tropical and perennial graminaceous crop and cultivated in many countries for the production of sugar and ethanol as energy cane james 2004 this plant is a highly important and strategic cash crop in iran and has a prominent impact on both economic and social issues koohzad mohammadi et al 2017 sugarcane is a major agricultural activity in the southwest of iran which has the largest water consumption sadeghzadeh hemayati et al 2011 veysi et al 2017 therefore accurate assessment and determination of soil infiltration appropriate inflow rate and cut off time and optimal physical design are necessary to improve irrigation performance mazarei et al 2020 mazarei et al 2020 optimized the performance of furrow irrigation in the fields of salman farsi agro industry sugarcane the results indicated that optimizing inflow rate could increase application efficiency and distribution uniformity more than 20 decrease deep percolation up to 30 and that the maximum performance in sugarcane fields obtained for inflow rate of 3 l s and a cut off time of 379 5 min however if soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability are not considered in designing and managing surface irrigation systems irrigation performance would be incorrect as a consequence soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability must be considered to simulate and optimize irrigation performance therefore the main objectives of this study were as follows i to analyze the effect of soil infiltration and manning s roughness temporal variability on furrow irrigation performance in sugarcane fields ii to evaluate winsrfr s ability for simulating furrow irrigation based on the temporal variability iii to evaluate the temporal variation of advance recession trajectories and infiltration volumes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description field experiments were carried out in the salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields located on arid and semi arid climate region in the southwest of iran latitudes 31 00ʹ30ʺ 32 30ʹ00ʺn and longitudes 48 15ʹ00ʺ 48 40ʹ40ʺe with an average annual rainfall of 266 mm and average annual evaporation is 2788 mm fig 1 it should be noted that the selected fields have same soil texture clay loam and subsurface drainage systems the bulk density was determined as 1 41 1 39 and 1 38 g cm 3 for depth of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm respectively the total area of the salman farsi agro industry is over 14 000 ha however its cultivated area is 12 000 ha all fields were divided into rectangular fields of 25 ha area all of which have subsurface drainage in the depth of 1 8 m in this district all fields are irrigated using furrow irrigation and low pressure hydro flume during the sugarcane growth period the applied irrigation water is 3000 mm with peak crop water use of 10 13 mm d veysi et al 2017 field data were collected on r5 22 fields of sugarcane with the age of raton 2 and irrigation events were done during the 2016 irrigation season 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events on 14 sep 11 oct and 5 nov respectively based on salman farsi sugarcane agro industry experience also the required water depth was considered as 100 mm for field experiments the field experiments were measured carried out with length furrows of 250 m width of 1 83 m and closed ends boundary table 1 fig 2 the wsc ﬂumes type 2 were installed at the beginning of the furrows for measuring the inflow rate longitudinal slope of furrows were determined s was determined by using nivo and mannings roughness are the most important parameters in the design assessment and management of surface irrigation systems the irrigation survey camera table 1 it should be noted that the longitudinal slope has significant effects on cut off time and irrigation performance nivo all gonzlez et al 2016 all experimental furrows were divided into 10 stations and the advance and recession trajectories were recorded at all stations because of better control and management of the inflow treatments we considered the same layout for each repetition showed that there were significant differences between the values of the parameter a in all irrigation events soil moisture samples were the depth of water infiltrated in the root zone were determined based on the soil moisture samples which were measured using auger core sampler before and after 48 hr irrigation at the three points first mid and end along the furrow and in the three depths 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm in the current study the depth of surface water along the furrow was measured several times in each station during irrigation event after the advance phase three inﬂow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 l s were considered in this study these inflow rates were a reasonable inflow rate for the sugarcane fields in southwest of iran it should be noted that irrigation events continued about 30 min after reaching water to end of furrows in other words cut off time was equal to summation of total advance time and 30 min for each treatment data were collected for nine block ended furrow under three repetitions all experimental furrows were adjacent in the same form 2 2 winsrfr model the performance indicators were estimated for all furrows using winsrfr model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is an integrated model package for analyzing surface irrigation systems nie et al 2019 winsrfr integrates the earlier model such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 border strelkoff et al 1996 and basin clemmens et al 1995 the initial version of winsrfr model was proposed from 2004 by the usda agricultural research service and the last effort of the model winsrfr 5 1 was released in 2019 by bautista et al 2019 based on the mazarei et al 2020 s report the input data of winsrfr in simulating for each irrigation event included inflow rate cut off time geometric properties and depth of water application the winsrfr model has four analytical functionalities which named winsrfr worlds bautista et al 2019 these worlds are 1 event analysis for evaluation of irrigation performance and estimation of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient 2 physical design for optimizing the physical layout of a field 3 operations analysis for optimizing the inflow rate and cut off time and 4 simulation for simulation of surface irrigation system at first the event analysis world was used to evaluate the actual irrigation performance on the sugarcane field in addition the advance and recession trajectory and irrigation performance under different inflow rates in three irrigation events were simulated using simulation world it should be noted that we considered three inflow rates of 1 0 1 5 and 2 l sec for field experiments and five inflow rates i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l sec in the simulation process finally based on bautista et al 2015 recommendations we employed the zero inertia model for simulation and evaluation of furrow irrigation bautista et al 2015 2 3 infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient 2 3 1 kostiakov lewis equation the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation was used in this study which is expressed as follows 1 z k t α f 0 t where z is cumulative infiltration in units of volume per length of the furrow m3 m 1 t represents elapse time of infiltration min f0 is the basic infiltration rate m3 m 1 min 1 and finally k and a are empirical coefficients a dimensionless k m3 minα m 1 the basic infiltration rate is determined using the following equation 2 walker and skogerboe 1987 2 f 0 q i n q o u t l where l is the length of the furrow m qin and qout are inflow and outflow rate m3 min respectively when outflow rate reaches to a constant value in the current study infiltration parameters were determined at a distance of 100 m from the beginning of the furrows thus using wsc flume type 2 the amount of surface runoff created at a distance of 100 m from the beginning of the furrow was determined 2 3 2 manning s roughness coefficient manning s roughness coefficient is necessary for designing and evaluating furrow irrigation kamali et al 2018 the manning roughness coefficient n can be calculated as follows 3 n a 5 3 s q p 2 3 where a and p are area of cross section m2 and wetted perimeter m of the furrow s is the longitudinal slope of water surface m m and q is inflow rate m3 sec 2 4 calibration of infiltration and roughness parameters the infiltration parameters were calibrated using the event analysis world and merriam keller 1978 method in the winsrfr model bautista et al 2019 in addition the precision of the infiltration parameters can be achieved via a trial and error method which is used to estimate the infiltration parameters bautista et al 2019 initial values of n f0 and kostiakov lewis coefficients in field were determined by the manning s equation eq 3 eq 2 and two point method elliott and walker 1982 respectively these values set as infiltration parameters and manning coefficient in winsrfr the simulated advance and recession trajectory curves were compared with the measured curves and if the fit was poor new combinations of n a k and f0 were tested over an approximate range this method was repeated until the best appropriate match between the measured and simulated curves was achieved finally based on this method the best combinations of infiltration parameters and manning coefficient were obtained salahou et al 2018 mazarei et al 2020 2 5 temporal variability in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness different researchers reported that the effect of temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness on surface irrigation performance is significant koech et al 2013 xu et al 2019 salahou et al 2018 also shahidian and serralheiro 2012 and koech et al 2014 reported that one of the major concerns in the irrigation performance is considering of spatial and temporal variation in the soil infiltration characteristics and manning s roughness in the current study manning s roughness soil infiltration parameters advance recession trajectories and irrigation performance indicators in different irrigation events were evaluated using the winsrfr model to analyze the impact of temporal variation moreover impact of different inflow rates on the aforementioned characteristics was evaluated for each irrigation event 2 6 irrigation performance measures in this study the performance indicators selected for the evaluation of furrow irrigation performance were application efficiency ea low quarter distribution uniformity dumin and deep percolation dp in the current study these indicators were simulated using winsrfr model and compared with measured values in the field these indicators were defined as follows 4 e a d e p t h o f w a t e r a d d e d t o t h e r o o t z o n e d e p t h o f w a t e r a p p l i e d t o t h e f u r r o w 100 5 d u min m i n i m u m m e a n o f t h e l o

institute 2002 software to test the statistically differences of temporal variability and different inflow rate on manning s roughness infiltration parameters advance recession times infiltration volumes and performance indicators for split plot arrangement as rcbd in three replications in the current study statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of manning s coefficient and field characterizes 3 1 1 manning s coefficient the results as shown in table 2 indicated that measured values of manning s roughness ranged from 0 038 to 0 091 in the 3rd event 14 sep 2016 from 0 053 to 0 110 in the 5th event 10 oct 2016 and from 0 014 to 0 099 in the 8th event 5 nov 2016 bautista et al 2009 and salahou et al 2018 reported that manning s roughness varied from 0 06 to 0 09 which is within the basic recommended range of manning s roughness in the field and this is almost in line with our results mean value of manning s roughness was increased from 0 052 in the 3rd event to 0 081 in the 5th event then it decreased to 0 058 in the 8th event table 4 also there was no significant difference at a 5 level of probability for all irrigation events in term of manning s roughness because of the low growth of sugarcane during the 3rd irrigation event water flow resistance in the furrows was low at the next irrigation event sugarcane growth and canopy cover had increased which produced little drag force for inflow rate and increase manning s roughness different researchers found that canopy cover and crop residues on the soil on irrigation season can increase the value of manning s roughness sepaskhah bondar 2002 mailapalli et al 2008 and kamali et al 2018 on the other hand gilley and kottwitz 1994 and xu et al 2019 indicated that the minimum value of manning s roughness was at the beginning of irrigation season and increase until the half of irrigation season and it starts to decrease to the end of irrigation season which these results were in agreement with the results of the current study based on xu et al 2019 study this is because the field surface area became smoother due to traffic of agriculture machine and decomposition of crop residue during the growing season also xu et al 2019 indicated that the greater temporal variability of manning s roughness could be due to crop growth in the irrigation season sepaskhah and bondar 2002 kamali et al 2018 and xu et al 2019 indicated that the relation of manning s roughness with inflow rate and canopy cover is inverse and direct respectively which these results were consistent with the results of the current study according to table 3 the largest values of manning s roughness in all irrigation events occurred for inflow rate of 1 l s the average values of 0 09 0 1 and 0 06 for the 3rd 5th and eight events respectively while manning s roughness decreased by increasing inﬂow rate these results showed that the n values of 1 l s inflow rate are significantly different with the n values of other inflow rates based on sepaskhah bonder 2002 and kamali et al 2018 studies the value of manning s changed inversely with the value of inﬂow rate on bare and vegetated furrow on the other hand the manning roughness equation eq 3 indicates that there is inverse relation between inflow rate and inow rate changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced mannings roughness by 24 4 and 36 6 respectively these the values of n also the results showed that the s the value of dp increased during the growing season dp increased by 56 26 and 96 96 in the 5th and 8th event than in in the 3rd event which these increases were significant when inflow rate will affect the n so increased inflow rate accelerates the advance phase and reduces the drag force thus the values of n decreased so when the inflow rate was increased and xu et al 2019 reported similar results with the current study in furrow it accelerates the advance phase and reduce the drag force thus the values of n decreased when the inflow rate increased from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s the average values of manning s roughness decreased by more than 200 which is reasonably significant in designing and evaluating furrow irrigation on the other hand there is no significant different p 0 05 between inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s in term of manning s roughness on the other hand effects of the different inflow rates on the manning s roughness in the 5th irrigation event were lower than in the first irrigation event in which no significant differences between different inflow rates were observed tables 3 and 4 the results of the analysis of variance in the 8th irrigation event showed that the influence of the inflow rate on manning s roughness was also not significant 3 1 2 cut off time with regards to table 1 the cut off time varied from 696 to 1053 min on 14 september from 749 to 1390 min on 10 october and from 994 to 2300 min on 5 november also the average values of cut off time increased by increasing inflow rate table 4 it should be noted that cut off time is significantly affected by irrigation event and inflow rate in the current study the maximum cut off time was 2300 min while the minimum cut off time was 696 min which these values occurring in the 3rd event 14 sep 2016 and the 8th event 5 nov 2016 respectively there is a direct relation between cut off times and manning s roughness which increasing of manning s roughness led to higher cut off time table 3 as seen in table 3 when the values of the inflow rate increased to 1 5 and 2 l s the average cut off time decreased by 20 and 26 4 in the 3rd event 29 6 and 35 in the 5th event 36 7 and 33 4 in the 8th irrigation event respectively there was significant difference between the first and 8th irrigation events however no significant difference was observed in the 5th event in comparison with the 3rd and 8th events the results of analysis variance did not show a significant difference in cut off time under inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s but the inflow rate of 1 l s resulted in significant difference with other inflow rates table 4 3 1 3 infiltrated volume the closed end furrow irrigation system in this study led to the infiltrated volume was equal to the inflow volume the values of infiltrated volume during the growing season for different inflow rates are presented in table 3 in different irrigation events the largest infiltrated volume vin were obtained in the 8th irrigation event and inflow rate of 2 l s while the lowest value was occurred in the 5th irrigation event and inflow rate of 1 l s this is due to the fact that longer cut off time and unsuitable topography because of the traffic of agricultural machinery occurred in the 5th and 8th repetitions table 1 also morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 fadul et al 2020 and mazarei et al 2020 reported that inappropriate design and unsuitable slope led to non uniform distribution of water and high infiltrated volume infiltrated volume increased during the growing season significant difference was observed between irrigation events in term of infiltrated volume table 4 also the mean infiltrated volume increased by changing the inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s by 9 4 and 41 92 respectively these increases were significant for the inflow rate of 2 l s and no significant for 1 5 l s as compared to the inflow rate of 1 l s table 4 the variation of infiltrated volume under increasing irrigation event i e during the growing season was more than that under increasing inflow rate 3 2 temporal variation of infiltration parameters the results of analysis variance for kostiakov lewis infiltration parameters in different inflow rates and irrigation events are presented in tables 5 and 6 it should be noted that the performance of all irrigation events are different because of temporal variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness table 2 shows the values of α were ranged from 0 15 to 0 34 in the 3rd event from 0 15 to 0 25 in the 5th event and from 0 10 to 0 20 in the 8th event also k value varied between 42 46 and 119 90 mm hr a in the 3rd event 50 62 and 143 00 mm hr a in the 5th event and 86 96 and 175 17 mm hr a in the 8th event the temporal variation of f0 was from 0 73 to 4 00 mm hr for the 3rd event from 0 60 to 3 69 mm hr for the 5th event and from 0 50 to 3 50 mm hr for the 8th event xu et al 2019 reported that soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall which led to changed infiltration parameters of α because of suitable soil structure the infiltration parameter of α in the 3rd event is greater than it in the 5th and 8th events this is might be due to the traffic of agricultural machinery in the 5th and 8th events several studies have reported that the parameter α was influenced by soil bulk density and soil water content li et al 2009 xu et al 2019 the maximum value of α was observed in the 3rd event and inflow rate of 1 l s table 5 increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the mean value of a by 9 5 and 9 5 respectively also the value of a decreased during the growing season which these reductions were 20 and 40 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively there were significant differences between the values of α in different irrigation events whereas there was no significant reduction of α by increasing inflow rate these results are in line with the results of xu et al 2019 who reported that temporal variation of α in the first event was more than in the next irrigation event in line with our results our results showed that the k values were increased by 43 02 and 89 9 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event in which these decrease are significant tables 5 and 6 xu et al 2019 also reported that the value of k had a significant increase during the growing season in general the temporal variability of k is due to variation of manning s roughness canopy cover and soil water content it should be noted that sugarcane roots were developed during the 5th and 8th stages of sugarcane growth on october and november and created channels in the soil root zone that eventually led to quicker movement of water also many cracks were observed in the soil surface of the field which are due to lower soil moisture contents caused by high soil evaporation and plant transpiration and low precipitation in october and november in the southwest of iran finally because of these reasons there was a significant difference between k values during the growing season and the k value increased sharply from 68 77 to 130 63 mm hr a table 6 as seen in table 6 there was no significant difference between the mean values of k under different inflow rates according to the mean values of f0 presented in table 5 the maximum values in temporal variability were 2 01 1 96 and 2 71 mm hr in the 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively under the inflow rate of 2 l s the results showed that changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s increased the mean value of f0 in all irrigation events the mean value of f0 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events was more than that in the 3rd event by 6 2 and 39 7 respectively table 6 it might be due to higher canopy cover and more cracks and channels in soil surface caused by developing sugarcane root in the soil profile also our results indicated that increasing inflow rate and irrigation events resulted in higher mean values of f0 although these increases were not significant fu et al 2019 reported that kostiakov lewis equation could accurately determine cumulative infiltration under different conditions however the empirical parameters in the kostiakov lewis equation were difficult to calculate due to changes in boundary conditions to determine the cumulative infiltration for different irrigation events under three inflow rates the kostiakov lewis parameters were optimized and we calculated the cumulative infiltration using the winsrfr model fig 3 shows the cumulative infiltration curves for different irrigation events and inflow rates in all inflow rates the maximum and minimum of cumulative infiltration was obtained in the 8th and 3rd irrigation events respectively it should be noted that the infiltrated volume in the 8th irrigation event was higher than other events table 4 which leads to higher cumulative infiltration curve in this event the large infiltrated volume in the 8th irrigation event was due to the longer cut off time and unsuitable slope in furrows because of the traffic of agricultural machinery during the growing season also in the current study the manning s roughness in the 3rd irrigation event was lower than in the other irrigation events and this it leads to minimum cumulative infiltration inflow rate of 2 l s increased infiltrated volume by 41 9 and 29 79 in comparison with the inflow rate of 1 and 1 5 l s respectively therefore by changing the inflow rate to 2 l s in all irrigation events the cumulative infiltration increased significantly which was due to higher water head in the furrows dialameh et al 2018 reported that increasing the water head led to higher wetted perimeter and consequently increased the cumulative infiltration which these study are in line with our study 3 3 temporal variation of advance and recession trajectory curves 3 3 1 advance time the temporal variability of advance and recession trajectories under different inflow rates are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively their results of analysis variance in different inflow rates and irrigation events are presented in tables 7 and 8 different researchers such as xu et al 2019 nie et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 indicated that the impacts of different parameters such as field geometry inflow rate infiltration parameters and manning s roughness on advance time are significant the different slope inflow rate and soil characteristics caused the variability of the advance trajectory curve mazarei et al 2020 the results show the measured advance times ranged from 749 to 1053 min in the 3rd event from 749 to 1751 min in the 5th event and from 994 to 1700 min in the 8th event with regards to table 8 the variation of measured advance times was 233 492 and 897 min in the 3rd 5th and 8th events respectively there was a significant increase between 3rd and 5th compared to the 8th event in term of advance time tables 7 and 8 the mean value of the measured advance time was increased by 65 and 50 in the 8th irrigation event in comparison with the 3rd and 5th events respectively it might be due to the fact that larger infiltrated volume and cumulative infiltration were occurred in the 8th irrigation event than in the 3rd and 5th events table 4 and fig 3 the largest advance times were obtained in the 8th irrigation event our results showed that there was a direct relation between advance time and manning s roughness this is might be due to greater resistance to water advance which caused by high manning s roughness and canopy cover during the growing season similar results were reported by araujo et al 2019 xu et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 also indicated that the sufficient inflow rate leads to ensure that advance trajectory reaches to the end of the furrows in a reasonable time there was significant difference between the inflow rate of 1 l s and two other inflow rates tables 7 and 8 araujo et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 indicated that the value of inflow rate had an inverse effect on the advance time and it is more sensitive to the inflow rate in its lower range 3 3 2 recession time recession time depends on how the value of k is influenced by the water infiltration rate and irrigation time xu et al 2019 duration of recession phase ranged from 133 to 285 min in the 3rd event from 180 to 330 min in the 5th event and from 160 to 280 min in the 8th event fig 5 the higher recession times were obtained in the 5th irrigation event compared to two other events the mean values of recession time were 1184 1486 and 1690 min in the 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively there was significant difference between the 3rd and 8th irrigation events but no significant difference was observed between the 5th and 8th irrigation events tables 7 8 the lowest recession times were obtained under the inflow rate of 2 l s increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the recession time by 27 58 and 29 64 respectively which these reductions were significant this might be due to higher infiltrated volume and f0 which led to lower recession times under higher inflow rate no significant difference was observed between the inflow rate of 1 5 and 2 l s similar to xu et al 2019 our results also indicated that there is a direct relation between advance and recession times 3 3 3 opportunity time the infiltrated depth and performance indicators of furrow irrigation depend on the opportunity time and soil properties also the value of opportunity time depends on the advance and recession phases and varied from station to station along the furrows lalehzari et al 2015 nie et al 2017 based on the results the opportunity time varied from 253 to 384 min from 309 to 481 min and from 210 to 340 min in the 3rd 5th and the 8th irrigation 27 34 and 34 17 events respectively table 7 event from 815 to 1751 min in the 5th event and from 994 to 1700 min in the 8th irrigation event the advance time the mean value of the opportunity time was increased by values of mannings roughness for inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s the cut off time was varied from 696 to 1053 min in the 3rd event from 749 to 1390 min in 13 0 in the 5th event and mean values of the parameter k were significantly increased by 43 02 and 89 9 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event also there was no significant difference between the mean values of k in different inflow rates the mean value of f0 in the 5th and 8th irrigation event was more than that in the 3rd event by 6 2 and 39 7 respectively moreover increasing the inflow rate increased f0 in all irrigation events 3the advance times was ranged from 749 to 1053 min in the decreased by 14 4 in the 8th event compared to the 3rd irrigation event mannings roughness values of the 1 l s inflow rate were significantly different with those values of other inflow rates but there was no significant difference between the values of a between different opportunity times under different inflow rates the 30 in the 5th event compared with that in the 3rd event which this difference was not significant this is results of tables 7 and 8 indicated that the largest opportunity times were determined in the 5th irrigation event and the inflow rate of 1 5 l s which these lead to highest distribution uniformity tables 10 and 11 it might be due to the fact that 3 4 larger advance and recession phases and manning roughness were occurred under the inflow rate of 1 5 l s and the larger manning roughness in the 5th irrigation event according to the results the effect of manning roughness on the opportunity times was significant also another reason for the increased opportunity times under inflow rate of 1 5 l s and the 5th irrigation event is the increased wetted perimeter guzmán rojo et al 2019 3 4 evaluation of irrigation performance 3 4 1 application efficiency according to table 9 the mean values of ea were ranged from 43 7 to 92 3 and from 42 0 to 92 3 based on the field and simulation results respectively the values of ea decreased in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd irrigation event which these reductions were 19 43 and 33 49 under the field study and 20 95 and 36 67 under the simulation study respectively our results show the mean value of ea reduced during the growing season which it might be due to higher cut off time unsuitable topography and traffic of agricultural machinery in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event also temporal variation of ea was influenced by increasing infiltrated volume during the growing season which led to higher dp and consequently lower ea tables 3 5 this finding might be due to the effects of increasing the manning s roughness and k parameters during the growing season these results were agreed with the results of xu et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 during the growing season increasing inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced ea by 3 43 and 24 55 respectively in average although cut off time was reduced by increasing inflow rate the applied or infiltrated volume was increased and caused more water deep percolation i e over irrigation it should be noted that the variation of ea under increasing irrigation event i e during the growing season was more significant than that under increasing inflow rate tables 10 11 3 4 2 distribution uniformity according to table 9 the values of dumin ranged from 68 3 to 93 8 under various conditions there was no significant difference between the 3rd and 5th irrigation events however significant decrease was observed in the 8th event in comparison with the 3rd irrigation event table 10 according to table 11 dumin was significantly increased by increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 l s however there was no significant difference between the inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s the mean value of dumin under the field study was more than it under the simulation study it should be noted that these differences were not significant between the measured and simulated values indicating appropriate accuracy of winsrfr in simulating furrow irrigation performance chen et al 2012 morris et al 2015 sayari et al 2017 nie et al 2019 salahou et al 2018 and mazarei et al 2020 also reported similar results bai et al 2010 and nie et al 2017 indicated that the infiltration variability has a significant influence on the distribution uniformity and should not be neglected in practical applications on the other hand araujo et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 found that the field geometry i e slope and length and inflow variable parameters i e inflow rate and cut off time have significant effects on dumin our results showed that the largest values of dumin were obtained in the 5th irrigation event in comparison with other irrigation events during the sugarcane growing season no significant difference was observed between the 3rd and 5th irrigation events which could be due to no significant differences in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness lower value of dumin in the 8th irrigation event might be attributed to higher infiltration rate which discussed previously 3 4 3 deep percolation the mean values of dp were ranged from 7 7 to 56 3 and from 7 7 to 58 0 based on the field and simulation results respectively table 9 there was a direct relationship between dp and increasing irrigation event table 10 on average the values of dp increased by 56 26 and 96 96 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events in comparison with the 3rd event significant difference was observed between the values of dp and irrigation events the value of dp was reduced by increasing the inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s by 27 4 and 34 2 respectively table 11 there was an inverse relation between the inflow rate and dp because irrigation cut off time was increased by decreasing inflow rate and consequently infiltrated volume or deep percolation increased in other words the longer opportunity time in inflow rate of 1 l s led to the highest dp value our results indicated that the value of dp increased during the growing season this finding may be due to higher cut off time and inflow volume during the growing season which caused by higher manning s roughness infiltration parameters and unsuitable topography also based on the mazarei et al 2020 s study suitable slope and low compact soil led to lower infiltrated volume and dp xu et al 2019 also showed dp variation due to temporal variability of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness 4 conclusion in this study infiltration parameters and manning s roughness in different irrigation events under three inflow rates were evaluated to analyze the effects of them on furrow irrigation performance the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 the mean value of manning s roughness was varied from 0 038 to 0 091 in the 3rd irrigation event 14 sep 2016 from 0 053 to 0 110 in the 5th event 10 oct 2016 and from 0 014 to 0 099 in the 8th event that mannings the manning s roughness increased during the growing season but this increase was no significant mannings and affected by temporal variability on the other hand the results indicated that manning s roughness decreased by increasing had greater role in increasing infiltrated volume as compared to inﬂow rate 2 the mean values of a k and f0 ranged from 0 10 to 0 34 from 42 46 to 175 17 mm hr a and 0 50 to 4 00 mm hr in all irrigation events the results event 5 nov 2016 indicated that all infiltration parameters a k f0 were mainly affected by temporal variability and significantly changed during growing season based on the results infiltration parameters of a and k are not sensitive to the values of inflow rate but the values of f0 were changed under higher inflow rate 3 the results indicated that from 994 to 2300 min in the 8th event which there was a significant difference in cut off time due to the temporal the advance and recession phases and the opportunity time mainly affected by temporal variability of manning s roughness with increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s the variation of advance time was significant the mean value of recession times was ranged from 133 to 285 min for the 3rd event 180 to 330 min for the 5th event and 160 to 280 min for the 8th event compared to the 3rd event recession times significantly increased in the 8th irrigation event while there were no significant differences between the 5th and 8th irrigation events inflow rate of 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the mean value of recession time by 27 6 and 29 6 respectively compared to inflow rate of 1 l s and infiltration parameters the advance and recession phases were slightly increased for temporal variability and decreased for higher inflow rate which these reductions were significant no significant difference was observed between mannings roughness values the results also showed that there was a direct relationship between advance time and manning s roughness 4 season and by higher inflow rate dumin value was significantly the measured and simulated values of ea and dumin were significantly reduced significant the maximum value of ea dumin and dp were 92 3 93 8 and 56 3 while their minimum values were 43 7 68 3 and 7 7 respectively the value of ea in the 5th and 8th irrigation events reduced by 19 4 and 33 5 relative to the 3rd event respectively based on the field measurements these reductions were 20 95 and 36 67 based on the simulation results respectively ea reduced during by temporal variability while the values of dp increased it is due to the higher manning s roughness and infiltration parameters during the growing season also the results indicated that the ea values decreased and dp increased under higher inflow rates 5 if the temporal variation of manning s roughness and infiltration parameters during the growing season were considered in designing and managing furrow irrigation systems furrow irrigation performance could be improved 6 in the 8th irrigation event compared to two other irrigation events also dumin in the inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s was significantly increased relative to the determination of optimized inflow rate depends on many parameters such as field slope infiltration parameters manning s roughness and crop or soil type based on the results under the real current conditions in the studied sugarcane fields the inflow rate of 1 l s lead to higher irrigation performance which it might be due to heavy soil texture and low field slope declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10251,accurate determination of temporal variability in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient is essential for appropriate design of surface irrigation systems to improve irrigation performance and reduce water losses the objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of temporal variability and different inflow rates on infiltration parameters manning s roughness and irrigation performance the field experiments included three inflow rates 1 1 5 and 2 l s and three irrigation events 3rd 5th and 8th events from 14 sep 2016 to 5 nov 2016 arranged in three replications at salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields located in the southwest of iran also experimental treatments were conducted in nine furrows with a length of 250 m the width of 1 83 m and closed end boundary the results indicated that there was no significant difference in the manning s roughness during the growing season on the other hand there were significant reductions of the manning s roughness for inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s in comparison with that obtained in inflow rate of 1 l s results also indicated that the cut off time and infiltrated volume were significantly affected by the temporal variability of infiltration parameters and roughness coefficient the values of infiltration parameters during the growing season were variable because of various field conditions and sugarcane growth there were significant differences between the values of parameters of the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation during the growing season the results showed that changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l sec increased the value of final infiltration rate f0 in the 5th irrigation event by 6 2 and 39 7 in the 8th irrigation event the advance and recession times increased during the growing season in which there was an effective difference in the 8th irrigation event compared to that in the 5th irrigation event the temporal variability during growing season resulted in a significant reduction in application efficiency from 74 to 49 distribution uniformity from 91 to 80 and a significant increase in deep percolation from 25 to 51 the results showed that when the inflow rate increased from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s the mean values of application efficiency decreased by 3 43 and 24 55 deep percolation decreased by 27 34 and 34 17 and finally distribution uniformity increased significantly by 9 7 and 9 3 respectively keywords furrow irrigation temporal variability irrigation performance 1 introduction surface irrigation is the most common irrigation method in the world because of its low cost and energy requirements compared to pressurized irrigation systems surface irrigation covers about 90 of the total irrigated lands in iran lalehzari et al 2014 although it usually suffers from different problems such as low efficiency and distribution uniformity moreover accurate design of surface irrigation systems can save more water and improve irrigation performance indicators ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 thus many studies have been carried out to increase the efficiency of surface irrigation systems walker and skogerboe 1987 mazarei et al 2020 furrow irrigation is one of the most widely used methods of surface irrigation in which water is applied and conveyed over the field surface by gravitational force koech et al 2010 furrow irrigation with blocked end boundary is more common in the sugarcane fields located in the southwest of iran veysi et al 2017 mazarei et al 2020 however furrow irrigation has some problems such as poor irrigation performance unsuitable uniformity and high deep percolation moravejalahkami et al 2009 the unsuitable management poor design and implementation are important reasons for the low performance in furrow irrigation systems which lead to wastage of water and waterlogging ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 lalehzari et al 2014 it should be noted that due to differences in crops grown weather and field conditions irrigation performance varies significantly through the season and lead to main problems in determining the best combination of effective parameters in irrigation performance xu et al 2019 however it is possible to improve the performance of furrow irrigation through the best combination of inflow rates cut off times length and slope of furrows numerous models have been developed for the simulation and optimization of surface irrigation systems such as surdev jurriens et al 2001 sirmod walker 2005 winsrfr bautista et al 2019 sides amadala et al 2014 surcos burguete et al 2014 and sisco gillies smith 2015 xu et al 2019 successfully used winsrfr model to evaluate surface irrigation based on temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning roughness salahoe et al 2018 used winsrfr model to examine the effect of bottom slopes surface roughness values and inflow rates on the surface irrigation performance their results indicated that the best combination of inflow rate and cut off time could improve surface irrigation performance also irrigation performance indicators were evaluated using the winsrfr model for a large sized field by fadul et al 2020 their results indicated that surface irrigation systems could be substantially optimized by adopting alternative design and operational strategies infiltration is one of the most important parameters in the design assessment and management of furrow irrigation esfandiari and maheshwari 1997 nie et al 2017 determination of infiltration parameters is a major problem in irrigation studies because of an accurate selection of the technique used to estimate the parameters of the infiltration models yassin et al 2016 soil infiltration characteristics are determined by a multitude of factors such as soil texture soil structure soil water content and soil organic matter zheng and fan 2000 franzluebbers 2002 li and fan 2006 gillies et al 2011 the major problem in the estimation of infiltration parameters is the management of variability of soil infiltration properties in recent years because of the effects of infiltration variability i e spatial and temporal variability on irrigation performance different researchers evaluated variation of soil infiltration and effects of infiltration variability on irrigation performance salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 oyonarte et al 2002 showed distribution uniformity is very sensitive to infiltration variability also bai et al 2010 reported that variation of soil infiltration has a significant effects on the performance indicators such as application efficiency and the distribution uniformity nie et al 2019 indicated that infiltration variability should be considered in any closed end border irrigation performance evaluation xu et al 2019 also reported that the impact of the variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness on water advance and recession curves was significantly manning s roughness coefficient is one of the most important parameters in the design and evaluation of surface irrigation kamali et al 2018 it should be noted that physical characteristics of furrows such as crop density soil texture filed slope and traffic of agricultural machinery can significantly affect accurate determination of the manning coefficient harun ur rashid 1990 valiantzas 1994 temporal variability in this coefficient due to tillage practices irrigation and crop growth greatly hinders efforts to improve irrigation performance xu et al 2019 bautista et al 2009a zhang et al 2016 and anwar et al 2016 recommended field manning s roughness of 0 02 0 04 0 04 0 10 and 0 04 0 16 respectively some approaches have been developed to determine the manning s coefficient such as multilevel optimization walker 2005 sipar id rodriguez and martos 2008 and sisco gillies and smith 2015 methods mailapalli et al 2008 evaluated the spatial and temporal variation of the manning s roughness in bare and vegetated furrows under different inflow rate the results showed that manning s roughness decreased with time in all furrows especially at lower inﬂow rates abbasi 2013 reported that manning s roughness coefficient is usually considered between 0 02 and 0 04 for furrows and varies with time and place kamali et al 2018 evaluated manning s coefficient for furrow irrigation during the maize growing season with two inflow rates of 0 29 l s low and 0 44 l s high their results indicated that manning s coefficient had the highest value at the end of the furrow also its value in the middle of the furrow was greater than at the beginning of the furrow xu et al 2019 evaluated the effects of infiltration parameters and variation of manning s coefficient for border irrigation with three border lengths also the impacts of temporal variation in infiltration parameters and roughness coefficient were evaluated seyedzadeh et al 2019 developed an analytical relationship for the estimation of manning s roughness coefficient in surface irrigation which the roughness coefficient was regarded as a function of field length and its value at each section is a function of the water depth or time walker 2005 reported that because of increasing water demands and crop production it is necessary to improve the performance of surface irrigation systems evaluating the irrigation performance requires knowledge of the management methods used by farmers and system variable measures i e field dimensions inflow rate manning s roughness cut off time and soil infiltration parameters pereira et al 2002 it is essential to use the most effective parameters for the improvement of irrigation performance bautista et al 2015 mazarei et al 2020 based on gilliess 2008 study different irrigation performance indicators are used to describe the hydraulic performance efficiency and distribution uniformity in irrigation systems many parameters affect irrigation performance which the most effective parameters are field dimensions i e slope and length inflow rate cut off time manning s roughness coefficient and soil infiltration properties smith et al 2005 bautista et al 2009 morris et al 2015 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 mazarei et al 2020 many researchers have tried to optimize furrow irrigation performance optimizing field dimensions clemmens et al 1999 chen et al 2012 smith et al 2018 salahou et al 2018 mazarei et al 2020 inflow rates and cut off times bautista et al 2009 miao et al 2015 nie et al 2019 smith and uddin 2020 mazarei et al 2020 based on moravejalahkamis 2020 report considering constant values for these parameters can lead to significant errors in the assessment of advance recession trajectories measuring the variation of infiltration and manning s roughness is required to evaluate possible water savings xu et al 2019 also several researchers suggested that we can improve irrigation performance by considering soil spatial temporal variability in manning roughness and soil infiltration bai et al 2017 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 xu et al 2019 sugarcane is the crop that contributes immensely to the regional economics of many countries and incidentally in these countries water consumption for sugarcane is inadequate compared to other crops dingre gorantiwar 2020 sugarcane is a tropical and perennial graminaceous crop and cultivated in many countries for the production of sugar and ethanol as energy cane james 2004 this plant is a highly important and strategic cash crop in iran and has a prominent impact on both economic and social issues koohzad mohammadi et al 2017 sugarcane is a major agricultural activity in the southwest of iran which has the largest water consumption sadeghzadeh hemayati et al 2011 veysi et al 2017 therefore accurate assessment and determination of soil infiltration appropriate inflow rate and cut off time and optimal physical design are necessary to improve irrigation performance mazarei et al 2020 mazarei et al 2020 optimized the performance of furrow irrigation in the fields of salman farsi agro industry sugarcane the results indicated that optimizing inflow rate could increase application efficiency and distribution uniformity more than 20 decrease deep percolation up to 30 and that the maximum performance in sugarcane fields obtained for inflow rate of 3 l s and a cut off time of 379 5 min however if soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability are not considered in designing and managing surface irrigation systems irrigation performance would be incorrect as a consequence soil infiltration and manning s roughness variability must be considered to simulate and optimize irrigation performance therefore the main objectives of this study were as follows i to analyze the effect of soil infiltration and manning s roughness temporal variability on furrow irrigation performance in sugarcane fields ii to evaluate winsrfr s ability for simulating furrow irrigation based on the temporal variability iii to evaluate the temporal variation of advance recession trajectories and infiltration volumes 2 materials and methods 2 1 field description field experiments were carried out in the salman farsi agro industry sugarcane fields located on arid and semi arid climate region in the southwest of iran latitudes 31 00ʹ30ʺ 32 30ʹ00ʺn and longitudes 48 15ʹ00ʺ 48 40ʹ40ʺe with an average annual rainfall of 266 mm and average annual evaporation is 2788 mm fig 1 it should be noted that the selected fields have same soil texture clay loam and subsurface drainage systems the bulk density was determined as 1 41 1 39 and 1 38 g cm 3 for depth of 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm respectively the total area of the salman farsi agro industry is over 14 000 ha however its cultivated area is 12 000 ha all fields were divided into rectangular fields of 25 ha area all of which have subsurface drainage in the depth of 1 8 m in this district all fields are irrigated using furrow irrigation and low pressure hydro flume during the sugarcane growth period the applied irrigation water is 3000 mm with peak crop water use of 10 13 mm d veysi et al 2017 field data were collected on r5 22 fields of sugarcane with the age of raton 2 and irrigation events were done during the 2016 irrigation season 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events on 14 sep 11 oct and 5 nov respectively based on salman farsi sugarcane agro industry experience also the required water depth was considered as 100 mm for field experiments the field experiments were measured carried out with length furrows of 250 m width of 1 83 m and closed ends boundary table 1 fig 2 the wsc ﬂumes type 2 were installed at the beginning of the furrows for measuring the inflow rate longitudinal slope of furrows were determined s was determined by using nivo and mannings roughness are the most important parameters in the design assessment and management of surface irrigation systems the irrigation survey camera table 1 it should be noted that the longitudinal slope has significant effects on cut off time and irrigation performance nivo all gonzlez et al 2016 all experimental furrows were divided into 10 stations and the advance and recession trajectories were recorded at all stations because of better control and management of the inflow treatments we considered the same layout for each repetition showed that there were significant differences between the values of the parameter a in all irrigation events soil moisture samples were the depth of water infiltrated in the root zone were determined based on the soil moisture samples which were measured using auger core sampler before and after 48 hr irrigation at the three points first mid and end along the furrow and in the three depths 0 30 30 60 and 60 90 cm in the current study the depth of surface water along the furrow was measured several times in each station during irrigation event after the advance phase three inﬂow rates of 1 1 5 and 2 l s were considered in this study these inflow rates were a reasonable inflow rate for the sugarcane fields in southwest of iran it should be noted that irrigation events continued about 30 min after reaching water to end of furrows in other words cut off time was equal to summation of total advance time and 30 min for each treatment data were collected for nine block ended furrow under three repetitions all experimental furrows were adjacent in the same form 2 2 winsrfr model the performance indicators were estimated for all furrows using winsrfr model developed by the agricultural research service of the united states department of agriculture is an integrated model package for analyzing surface irrigation systems nie et al 2019 winsrfr integrates the earlier model such as srfr strelkoff et al 1998 border strelkoff et al 1996 and basin clemmens et al 1995 the initial version of winsrfr model was proposed from 2004 by the usda agricultural research service and the last effort of the model winsrfr 5 1 was released in 2019 by bautista et al 2019 based on the mazarei et al 2020 s report the input data of winsrfr in simulating for each irrigation event included inflow rate cut off time geometric properties and depth of water application the winsrfr model has four analytical functionalities which named winsrfr worlds bautista et al 2019 these worlds are 1 event analysis for evaluation of irrigation performance and estimation of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient 2 physical design for optimizing the physical layout of a field 3 operations analysis for optimizing the inflow rate and cut off time and 4 simulation for simulation of surface irrigation system at first the event analysis world was used to evaluate the actual irrigation performance on the sugarcane field in addition the advance and recession trajectory and irrigation performance under different inflow rates in three irrigation events were simulated using simulation world it should be noted that we considered three inflow rates of 1 0 1 5 and 2 l sec for field experiments and five inflow rates i e 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 l sec in the simulation process finally based on bautista et al 2015 recommendations we employed the zero inertia model for simulation and evaluation of furrow irrigation bautista et al 2015 2 3 infiltration parameters and manning s roughness coefficient 2 3 1 kostiakov lewis equation the kostiakov lewis infiltration equation was used in this study which is expressed as follows 1 z k t α f 0 t where z is cumulative infiltration in units of volume per length of the furrow m3 m 1 t represents elapse time of infiltration min f0 is the basic infiltration rate m3 m 1 min 1 and finally k and a are empirical coefficients a dimensionless k m3 minα m 1 the basic infiltration rate is determined using the following equation 2 walker and skogerboe 1987 2 f 0 q i n q o u t l where l is the length of the furrow m qin and qout are inflow and outflow rate m3 min respectively when outflow rate reaches to a constant value in the current study infiltration parameters were determined at a distance of 100 m from the beginning of the furrows thus using wsc flume type 2 the amount of surface runoff created at a distance of 100 m from the beginning of the furrow was determined 2 3 2 manning s roughness coefficient manning s roughness coefficient is necessary for designing and evaluating furrow irrigation kamali et al 2018 the manning roughness coefficient n can be calculated as follows 3 n a 5 3 s q p 2 3 where a and p are area of cross section m2 and wetted perimeter m of the furrow s is the longitudinal slope of water surface m m and q is inflow rate m3 sec 2 4 calibration of infiltration and roughness parameters the infiltration parameters were calibrated using the event analysis world and merriam keller 1978 method in the winsrfr model bautista et al 2019 in addition the precision of the infiltration parameters can be achieved via a trial and error method which is used to estimate the infiltration parameters bautista et al 2019 initial values of n f0 and kostiakov lewis coefficients in field were determined by the manning s equation eq 3 eq 2 and two point method elliott and walker 1982 respectively these values set as infiltration parameters and manning coefficient in winsrfr the simulated advance and recession trajectory curves were compared with the measured curves and if the fit was poor new combinations of n a k and f0 were tested over an approximate range this method was repeated until the best appropriate match between the measured and simulated curves was achieved finally based on this method the best combinations of infiltration parameters and manning coefficient were obtained salahou et al 2018 mazarei et al 2020 2 5 temporal variability in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness different researchers reported that the effect of temporal variation of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness on surface irrigation performance is significant koech et al 2013 xu et al 2019 salahou et al 2018 also shahidian and serralheiro 2012 and koech et al 2014 reported that one of the major concerns in the irrigation performance is considering of spatial and temporal variation in the soil infiltration characteristics and manning s roughness in the current study manning s roughness soil infiltration parameters advance recession trajectories and irrigation performance indicators in different irrigation events were evaluated using the winsrfr model to analyze the impact of temporal variation moreover impact of different inflow rates on the aforementioned characteristics was evaluated for each irrigation event 2 6 irrigation performance measures in this study the performance indicators selected for the evaluation of furrow irrigation performance were application efficiency ea low quarter distribution uniformity dumin and deep percolation dp in the current study these indicators were simulated using winsrfr model and compared with measured values in the field these indicators were defined as follows 4 e a d e p t h o f w a t e r a d d e d t o t h e r o o t z o n e d e p t h o f w a t e r a p p l i e d t o t h e f u r r o w 100 5 d u min m i n i m u m m e a n o f t h e l o

institute 2002 software to test the statistically differences of temporal variability and different inflow rate on manning s roughness infiltration parameters advance recession times infiltration volumes and performance indicators for split plot arrangement as rcbd in three replications in the current study statistically significant comparisons were identified using least significant difference lsd at the probability level of p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 temporal variation of manning s coefficient and field characterizes 3 1 1 manning s coefficient the results as shown in table 2 indicated that measured values of manning s roughness ranged from 0 038 to 0 091 in the 3rd event 14 sep 2016 from 0 053 to 0 110 in the 5th event 10 oct 2016 and from 0 014 to 0 099 in the 8th event 5 nov 2016 bautista et al 2009 and salahou et al 2018 reported that manning s roughness varied from 0 06 to 0 09 which is within the basic recommended range of manning s roughness in the field and this is almost in line with our results mean value of manning s roughness was increased from 0 052 in the 3rd event to 0 081 in the 5th event then it decreased to 0 058 in the 8th event table 4 also there was no significant difference at a 5 level of probability for all irrigation events in term of manning s roughness because of the low growth of sugarcane during the 3rd irrigation event water flow resistance in the furrows was low at the next irrigation event sugarcane growth and canopy cover had increased which produced little drag force for inflow rate and increase manning s roughness different researchers found that canopy cover and crop residues on the soil on irrigation season can increase the value of manning s roughness sepaskhah bondar 2002 mailapalli et al 2008 and kamali et al 2018 on the other hand gilley and kottwitz 1994 and xu et al 2019 indicated that the minimum value of manning s roughness was at the beginning of irrigation season and increase until the half of irrigation season and it starts to decrease to the end of irrigation season which these results were in agreement with the results of the current study based on xu et al 2019 study this is because the field surface area became smoother due to traffic of agriculture machine and decomposition of crop residue during the growing season also xu et al 2019 indicated that the greater temporal variability of manning s roughness could be due to crop growth in the irrigation season sepaskhah and bondar 2002 kamali et al 2018 and xu et al 2019 indicated that the relation of manning s roughness with inflow rate and canopy cover is inverse and direct respectively which these results were consistent with the results of the current study according to table 3 the largest values of manning s roughness in all irrigation events occurred for inflow rate of 1 l s the average values of 0 09 0 1 and 0 06 for the 3rd 5th and eight events respectively while manning s roughness decreased by increasing inﬂow rate these results showed that the n values of 1 l s inflow rate are significantly different with the n values of other inflow rates based on sepaskhah bonder 2002 and kamali et al 2018 studies the value of manning s changed inversely with the value of inﬂow rate on bare and vegetated furrow on the other hand the manning roughness equation eq 3 indicates that there is inverse relation between inflow rate and inow rate changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced mannings roughness by 24 4 and 36 6 respectively these the values of n also the results showed that the s the value of dp increased during the growing season dp increased by 56 26 and 96 96 in the 5th and 8th event than in in the 3rd event which these increases were significant when inflow rate will affect the n so increased inflow rate accelerates the advance phase and reduces the drag force thus the values of n decreased so when the inflow rate was increased and xu et al 2019 reported similar results with the current study in furrow it accelerates the advance phase and reduce the drag force thus the values of n decreased when the inflow rate increased from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s the average values of manning s roughness decreased by more than 200 which is reasonably significant in designing and evaluating furrow irrigation on the other hand there is no significant different p 0 05 between inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s in term of manning s roughness on the other hand effects of the different inflow rates on the manning s roughness in the 5th irrigation event were lower than in the first irrigation event in which no significant differences between different inflow rates were observed tables 3 and 4 the results of the analysis of variance in the 8th irrigation event showed that the influence of the inflow rate on manning s roughness was also not significant 3 1 2 cut off time with regards to table 1 the cut off time varied from 696 to 1053 min on 14 september from 749 to 1390 min on 10 october and from 994 to 2300 min on 5 november also the average values of cut off time increased by increasing inflow rate table 4 it should be noted that cut off time is significantly affected by irrigation event and inflow rate in the current study the maximum cut off time was 2300 min while the minimum cut off time was 696 min which these values occurring in the 3rd event 14 sep 2016 and the 8th event 5 nov 2016 respectively there is a direct relation between cut off times and manning s roughness which increasing of manning s roughness led to higher cut off time table 3 as seen in table 3 when the values of the inflow rate increased to 1 5 and 2 l s the average cut off time decreased by 20 and 26 4 in the 3rd event 29 6 and 35 in the 5th event 36 7 and 33 4 in the 8th irrigation event respectively there was significant difference between the first and 8th irrigation events however no significant difference was observed in the 5th event in comparison with the 3rd and 8th events the results of analysis variance did not show a significant difference in cut off time under inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s but the inflow rate of 1 l s resulted in significant difference with other inflow rates table 4 3 1 3 infiltrated volume the closed end furrow irrigation system in this study led to the infiltrated volume was equal to the inflow volume the values of infiltrated volume during the growing season for different inflow rates are presented in table 3 in different irrigation events the largest infiltrated volume vin were obtained in the 8th irrigation event and inflow rate of 2 l s while the lowest value was occurred in the 5th irrigation event and inflow rate of 1 l s this is due to the fact that longer cut off time and unsuitable topography because of the traffic of agricultural machinery occurred in the 5th and 8th repetitions table 1 also morris et al 2015 salahou et al 2018 nie et al 2019 fadul et al 2020 and mazarei et al 2020 reported that inappropriate design and unsuitable slope led to non uniform distribution of water and high infiltrated volume infiltrated volume increased during the growing season significant difference was observed between irrigation events in term of infiltrated volume table 4 also the mean infiltrated volume increased by changing the inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s by 9 4 and 41 92 respectively these increases were significant for the inflow rate of 2 l s and no significant for 1 5 l s as compared to the inflow rate of 1 l s table 4 the variation of infiltrated volume under increasing irrigation event i e during the growing season was more than that under increasing inflow rate 3 2 temporal variation of infiltration parameters the results of analysis variance for kostiakov lewis infiltration parameters in different inflow rates and irrigation events are presented in tables 5 and 6 it should be noted that the performance of all irrigation events are different because of temporal variation of soil infiltration and manning s roughness table 2 shows the values of α were ranged from 0 15 to 0 34 in the 3rd event from 0 15 to 0 25 in the 5th event and from 0 10 to 0 20 in the 8th event also k value varied between 42 46 and 119 90 mm hr a in the 3rd event 50 62 and 143 00 mm hr a in the 5th event and 86 96 and 175 17 mm hr a in the 8th event the temporal variation of f0 was from 0 73 to 4 00 mm hr for the 3rd event from 0 60 to 3 69 mm hr for the 5th event and from 0 50 to 3 50 mm hr for the 8th event xu et al 2019 reported that soil structure is periodically disturbed and destroyed due to cultivation irrigation and rainfall which led to changed infiltration parameters of α because of suitable soil structure the infiltration parameter of α in the 3rd event is greater than it in the 5th and 8th events this is might be due to the traffic of agricultural machinery in the 5th and 8th events several studies have reported that the parameter α was influenced by soil bulk density and soil water content li et al 2009 xu et al 2019 the maximum value of α was observed in the 3rd event and inflow rate of 1 l s table 5 increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the mean value of a by 9 5 and 9 5 respectively also the value of a decreased during the growing season which these reductions were 20 and 40 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively there were significant differences between the values of α in different irrigation events whereas there was no significant reduction of α by increasing inflow rate these results are in line with the results of xu et al 2019 who reported that temporal variation of α in the first event was more than in the next irrigation event in line with our results our results showed that the k values were increased by 43 02 and 89 9 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event in which these decrease are significant tables 5 and 6 xu et al 2019 also reported that the value of k had a significant increase during the growing season in general the temporal variability of k is due to variation of manning s roughness canopy cover and soil water content it should be noted that sugarcane roots were developed during the 5th and 8th stages of sugarcane growth on october and november and created channels in the soil root zone that eventually led to quicker movement of water also many cracks were observed in the soil surface of the field which are due to lower soil moisture contents caused by high soil evaporation and plant transpiration and low precipitation in october and november in the southwest of iran finally because of these reasons there was a significant difference between k values during the growing season and the k value increased sharply from 68 77 to 130 63 mm hr a table 6 as seen in table 6 there was no significant difference between the mean values of k under different inflow rates according to the mean values of f0 presented in table 5 the maximum values in temporal variability were 2 01 1 96 and 2 71 mm hr in the 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively under the inflow rate of 2 l s the results showed that changing the inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s increased the mean value of f0 in all irrigation events the mean value of f0 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events was more than that in the 3rd event by 6 2 and 39 7 respectively table 6 it might be due to higher canopy cover and more cracks and channels in soil surface caused by developing sugarcane root in the soil profile also our results indicated that increasing inflow rate and irrigation events resulted in higher mean values of f0 although these increases were not significant fu et al 2019 reported that kostiakov lewis equation could accurately determine cumulative infiltration under different conditions however the empirical parameters in the kostiakov lewis equation were difficult to calculate due to changes in boundary conditions to determine the cumulative infiltration for different irrigation events under three inflow rates the kostiakov lewis parameters were optimized and we calculated the cumulative infiltration using the winsrfr model fig 3 shows the cumulative infiltration curves for different irrigation events and inflow rates in all inflow rates the maximum and minimum of cumulative infiltration was obtained in the 8th and 3rd irrigation events respectively it should be noted that the infiltrated volume in the 8th irrigation event was higher than other events table 4 which leads to higher cumulative infiltration curve in this event the large infiltrated volume in the 8th irrigation event was due to the longer cut off time and unsuitable slope in furrows because of the traffic of agricultural machinery during the growing season also in the current study the manning s roughness in the 3rd irrigation event was lower than in the other irrigation events and this it leads to minimum cumulative infiltration inflow rate of 2 l s increased infiltrated volume by 41 9 and 29 79 in comparison with the inflow rate of 1 and 1 5 l s respectively therefore by changing the inflow rate to 2 l s in all irrigation events the cumulative infiltration increased significantly which was due to higher water head in the furrows dialameh et al 2018 reported that increasing the water head led to higher wetted perimeter and consequently increased the cumulative infiltration which these study are in line with our study 3 3 temporal variation of advance and recession trajectory curves 3 3 1 advance time the temporal variability of advance and recession trajectories under different inflow rates are shown in figs 4 and 5 respectively their results of analysis variance in different inflow rates and irrigation events are presented in tables 7 and 8 different researchers such as xu et al 2019 nie et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 indicated that the impacts of different parameters such as field geometry inflow rate infiltration parameters and manning s roughness on advance time are significant the different slope inflow rate and soil characteristics caused the variability of the advance trajectory curve mazarei et al 2020 the results show the measured advance times ranged from 749 to 1053 min in the 3rd event from 749 to 1751 min in the 5th event and from 994 to 1700 min in the 8th event with regards to table 8 the variation of measured advance times was 233 492 and 897 min in the 3rd 5th and 8th events respectively there was a significant increase between 3rd and 5th compared to the 8th event in term of advance time tables 7 and 8 the mean value of the measured advance time was increased by 65 and 50 in the 8th irrigation event in comparison with the 3rd and 5th events respectively it might be due to the fact that larger infiltrated volume and cumulative infiltration were occurred in the 8th irrigation event than in the 3rd and 5th events table 4 and fig 3 the largest advance times were obtained in the 8th irrigation event our results showed that there was a direct relation between advance time and manning s roughness this is might be due to greater resistance to water advance which caused by high manning s roughness and canopy cover during the growing season similar results were reported by araujo et al 2019 xu et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 also indicated that the sufficient inflow rate leads to ensure that advance trajectory reaches to the end of the furrows in a reasonable time there was significant difference between the inflow rate of 1 l s and two other inflow rates tables 7 and 8 araujo et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 indicated that the value of inflow rate had an inverse effect on the advance time and it is more sensitive to the inflow rate in its lower range 3 3 2 recession time recession time depends on how the value of k is influenced by the water infiltration rate and irrigation time xu et al 2019 duration of recession phase ranged from 133 to 285 min in the 3rd event from 180 to 330 min in the 5th event and from 160 to 280 min in the 8th event fig 5 the higher recession times were obtained in the 5th irrigation event compared to two other events the mean values of recession time were 1184 1486 and 1690 min in the 3rd 5th and 8th irrigation events respectively there was significant difference between the 3rd and 8th irrigation events but no significant difference was observed between the 5th and 8th irrigation events tables 7 8 the lowest recession times were obtained under the inflow rate of 2 l s increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the recession time by 27 58 and 29 64 respectively which these reductions were significant this might be due to higher infiltrated volume and f0 which led to lower recession times under higher inflow rate no significant difference was observed between the inflow rate of 1 5 and 2 l s similar to xu et al 2019 our results also indicated that there is a direct relation between advance and recession times 3 3 3 opportunity time the infiltrated depth and performance indicators of furrow irrigation depend on the opportunity time and soil properties also the value of opportunity time depends on the advance and recession phases and varied from station to station along the furrows lalehzari et al 2015 nie et al 2017 based on the results the opportunity time varied from 253 to 384 min from 309 to 481 min and from 210 to 340 min in the 3rd 5th and the 8th irrigation 27 34 and 34 17 events respectively table 7 event from 815 to 1751 min in the 5th event and from 994 to 1700 min in the 8th irrigation event the advance time the mean value of the opportunity time was increased by values of mannings roughness for inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s the cut off time was varied from 696 to 1053 min in the 3rd event from 749 to 1390 min in 13 0 in the 5th event and mean values of the parameter k were significantly increased by 43 02 and 89 9 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event also there was no significant difference between the mean values of k in different inflow rates the mean value of f0 in the 5th and 8th irrigation event was more than that in the 3rd event by 6 2 and 39 7 respectively moreover increasing the inflow rate increased f0 in all irrigation events 3the advance times was ranged from 749 to 1053 min in the decreased by 14 4 in the 8th event compared to the 3rd irrigation event mannings roughness values of the 1 l s inflow rate were significantly different with those values of other inflow rates but there was no significant difference between the values of a between different opportunity times under different inflow rates the 30 in the 5th event compared with that in the 3rd event which this difference was not significant this is results of tables 7 and 8 indicated that the largest opportunity times were determined in the 5th irrigation event and the inflow rate of 1 5 l s which these lead to highest distribution uniformity tables 10 and 11 it might be due to the fact that 3 4 larger advance and recession phases and manning roughness were occurred under the inflow rate of 1 5 l s and the larger manning roughness in the 5th irrigation event according to the results the effect of manning roughness on the opportunity times was significant also another reason for the increased opportunity times under inflow rate of 1 5 l s and the 5th irrigation event is the increased wetted perimeter guzmán rojo et al 2019 3 4 evaluation of irrigation performance 3 4 1 application efficiency according to table 9 the mean values of ea were ranged from 43 7 to 92 3 and from 42 0 to 92 3 based on the field and simulation results respectively the values of ea decreased in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd irrigation event which these reductions were 19 43 and 33 49 under the field study and 20 95 and 36 67 under the simulation study respectively our results show the mean value of ea reduced during the growing season which it might be due to higher cut off time unsuitable topography and traffic of agricultural machinery in the 5th and 8th irrigation events compared to the 3rd event also temporal variation of ea was influenced by increasing infiltrated volume during the growing season which led to higher dp and consequently lower ea tables 3 5 this finding might be due to the effects of increasing the manning s roughness and k parameters during the growing season these results were agreed with the results of xu et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 during the growing season increasing inflow rate from 1 to 1 5 and 2 l s reduced ea by 3 43 and 24 55 respectively in average although cut off time was reduced by increasing inflow rate the applied or infiltrated volume was increased and caused more water deep percolation i e over irrigation it should be noted that the variation of ea under increasing irrigation event i e during the growing season was more significant than that under increasing inflow rate tables 10 11 3 4 2 distribution uniformity according to table 9 the values of dumin ranged from 68 3 to 93 8 under various conditions there was no significant difference between the 3rd and 5th irrigation events however significant decrease was observed in the 8th event in comparison with the 3rd irrigation event table 10 according to table 11 dumin was significantly increased by increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 l s however there was no significant difference between the inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s the mean value of dumin under the field study was more than it under the simulation study it should be noted that these differences were not significant between the measured and simulated values indicating appropriate accuracy of winsrfr in simulating furrow irrigation performance chen et al 2012 morris et al 2015 sayari et al 2017 nie et al 2019 salahou et al 2018 and mazarei et al 2020 also reported similar results bai et al 2010 and nie et al 2017 indicated that the infiltration variability has a significant influence on the distribution uniformity and should not be neglected in practical applications on the other hand araujo et al 2019 and mazarei et al 2020 found that the field geometry i e slope and length and inflow variable parameters i e inflow rate and cut off time have significant effects on dumin our results showed that the largest values of dumin were obtained in the 5th irrigation event in comparison with other irrigation events during the sugarcane growing season no significant difference was observed between the 3rd and 5th irrigation events which could be due to no significant differences in infiltration parameters and manning s roughness lower value of dumin in the 8th irrigation event might be attributed to higher infiltration rate which discussed previously 3 4 3 deep percolation the mean values of dp were ranged from 7 7 to 56 3 and from 7 7 to 58 0 based on the field and simulation results respectively table 9 there was a direct relationship between dp and increasing irrigation event table 10 on average the values of dp increased by 56 26 and 96 96 in the 5th and 8th irrigation events in comparison with the 3rd event significant difference was observed between the values of dp and irrigation events the value of dp was reduced by increasing the inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s by 27 4 and 34 2 respectively table 11 there was an inverse relation between the inflow rate and dp because irrigation cut off time was increased by decreasing inflow rate and consequently infiltrated volume or deep percolation increased in other words the longer opportunity time in inflow rate of 1 l s led to the highest dp value our results indicated that the value of dp increased during the growing season this finding may be due to higher cut off time and inflow volume during the growing season which caused by higher manning s roughness infiltration parameters and unsuitable topography also based on the mazarei et al 2020 s study suitable slope and low compact soil led to lower infiltrated volume and dp xu et al 2019 also showed dp variation due to temporal variability of infiltration parameters and manning s roughness 4 conclusion in this study infiltration parameters and manning s roughness in different irrigation events under three inflow rates were evaluated to analyze the effects of them on furrow irrigation performance the following conclusions were drawn from the results 1 the mean value of manning s roughness was varied from 0 038 to 0 091 in the 3rd irrigation event 14 sep 2016 from 0 053 to 0 110 in the 5th event 10 oct 2016 and from 0 014 to 0 099 in the 8th event that mannings the manning s roughness increased during the growing season but this increase was no significant mannings and affected by temporal variability on the other hand the results indicated that manning s roughness decreased by increasing had greater role in increasing infiltrated volume as compared to inﬂow rate 2 the mean values of a k and f0 ranged from 0 10 to 0 34 from 42 46 to 175 17 mm hr a and 0 50 to 4 00 mm hr in all irrigation events the results event 5 nov 2016 indicated that all infiltration parameters a k f0 were mainly affected by temporal variability and significantly changed during growing season based on the results infiltration parameters of a and k are not sensitive to the values of inflow rate but the values of f0 were changed under higher inflow rate 3 the results indicated that from 994 to 2300 min in the 8th event which there was a significant difference in cut off time due to the temporal the advance and recession phases and the opportunity time mainly affected by temporal variability of manning s roughness with increasing inflow rate from 1 l s to 1 5 and 2 l s the variation of advance time was significant the mean value of recession times was ranged from 133 to 285 min for the 3rd event 180 to 330 min for the 5th event and 160 to 280 min for the 8th event compared to the 3rd event recession times significantly increased in the 8th irrigation event while there were no significant differences between the 5th and 8th irrigation events inflow rate of 1 5 and 2 l s reduced the mean value of recession time by 27 6 and 29 6 respectively compared to inflow rate of 1 l s and infiltration parameters the advance and recession phases were slightly increased for temporal variability and decreased for higher inflow rate which these reductions were significant no significant difference was observed between mannings roughness values the results also showed that there was a direct relationship between advance time and manning s roughness 4 season and by higher inflow rate dumin value was significantly the measured and simulated values of ea and dumin were significantly reduced significant the maximum value of ea dumin and dp were 92 3 93 8 and 56 3 while their minimum values were 43 7 68 3 and 7 7 respectively the value of ea in the 5th and 8th irrigation events reduced by 19 4 and 33 5 relative to the 3rd event respectively based on the field measurements these reductions were 20 95 and 36 67 based on the simulation results respectively ea reduced during by temporal variability while the values of dp increased it is due to the higher manning s roughness and infiltration parameters during the growing season also the results indicated that the ea values decreased and dp increased under higher inflow rates 5 if the temporal variation of manning s roughness and infiltration parameters during the growing season were considered in designing and managing furrow irrigation systems furrow irrigation performance could be improved 6 in the 8th irrigation event compared to two other irrigation events also dumin in the inflow rates of 1 5 and 2 l s was significantly increased relative to the determination of optimized inflow rate depends on many parameters such as field slope infiltration parameters manning s roughness and crop or soil type based on the results under the real current conditions in the studied sugarcane fields the inflow rate of 1 l s lead to higher irrigation performance which it might be due to heavy soil texture and low field slope declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

10252,super absorbent polymers saps are a family of functional polymer material with a high water absorption function it absorbs water hundreds to thousands of times heavier than itself and has excellent water retention performance once the water absorption expands into a hydrogel it is difficult to separate the water even under pressure this article describes the water absorption and retention capacity of polymer water absorbent resin a compound that can solve the problem of water shortages in agriculture which is very important for the development of modern agriculture keywords super absorbent polymer water absorption water retention modern agriculture 1 introduction 1 1 recent development and application of saps saps is a water soluble polymeric cross linked substance developed in the past 20 years lee et al 2004 lin et al 2005 kiatkamjornwong et al 2000 francis et al 2004 lee et al 2005 due to its high swelling ability it can store a lot of water in its network structure so it attracted the attention of agronomists when it first appeared macromolecule absorbent resin is a new functional polymer material developed successfully by the united states and japan kiatkamjornwong et al 2002 lanthong et al 2006 because of its large water absorption capacity it is different from absorbent cotton sponge absorbent paper and other common water absorption materials since 1974 many organizations have studied the synthesis and application of sap such as grainproces sing herclues national starch dow chemical company sumitomo chemical company of japan wang shi base company catalytic chemical company sanyo into a company etc abdel aal et al 2006 xu et al 2007 cao et al 2002 zheng et al 2007 since the 1980s more than 20 groups in china have studied water absorbent resin and published dozens of scientific research papers in this area which has greatly promoted the development of polymer resin synthesis technology and product application in china worldwide demand of high molecular injectivity resins is also increasing liu et al 2007 islam et al 2015 guilherme et al 2010 ghazali et al 2017 seki et al 2014 with an estimated annual growth rate of 30 40 and applications for the product are also gradually expanding from personal hygiene items to medical materials anti seepage materials used in construction efficient sustained release drugs slow release fertilizers and soil moisture agents desiccants food preservatives and a wide range of air fresheners gawande and mungray 2015 divakaran et al 2015 ouml et al 2011 kangwansupamonkon et al 2010 fanta et al 1967 1 2 main features and classification of saps there are many classification methods for saps which can be divided into starch derivatives cellulose derivatives and synthetic resins according to the different chemical processes of resin preparation these products can be divided into copolymers carboxymethyl compounds and water soluble polymer crosslinking resins according to the final form the products can be divided into powder resins film resins and fiber absorbent resins pourjavadi and mahdavinia 2014 macromolecule water absorbing resin is a kind of macromolecule compound with strong water absorbing abilities its water absorbing capacity is dozens to thousands of times its own mass ordinary natural materials cannot be compared to this compound not only are its water absorption and water retention capacities very high it absorbs water with a high degree of retention hamed and jaber f hamed 2015 the water absorption of saps includes water absorption ability water absorption speed and moisture absorption ability its water absorption ability mainly depends on the composition and structure of the water absorption resin itself as well as on the salt in the water solution and the water s ph value haraguchi et al 2005 generally speaking the water absorption capacity of the cellulose graft modified type resin is higher than that of starch graft modified type and that of ionic polymer is higher than that of nonionic polymer the higher the ionization degree of the polymer the stronger the water absorption capacity the same macromolecule absorbent resin in pure water absorbent capacity stronger absorbent ratio for its own mass 400 1000 times some as high as 200 3000 times with increased salt content in the solution the water absorption ratio decreases greatly when the ph value of a solution is 6 7 the water absorption capacity of polymer absorbent resin water retention agent is the strongest in strongly acidic or alkaline solutions the water absorption capacity is significantly reduced the salt content and ph value of a solution have a great influence on the water absorption capacity of ionic water absorption resin but do not have a significant influence on the water absorption capacity of nonionic water absorption resin water absorption resin not only water absorption capacity and water absorption speed is fast ionic water absorption resin saturation needs a few hours in 0 5 h or so it can reach half saturation in nonionic water absorption resin saturation takes only 20 60 min generally in about 2 min it can reach saturated water absorption of 1 2 above in addition to holding liquid water absorbent resin can also absorb liquid water molecules in the air and soil environment hygroscopic ability and hygroscopic velocity mainly depend on the type of water absorbent resin and the level of environmental humidity yadav and rhee 2012 the polymer absorbent resin becomes a gel after absorbing water the absorbed water evaporates under natural conditions and the pressure is not easy to isolate rao et al 1981 the evaporation test of schmancy resin produced by american schmancy company under constant temperature showed that the schmancy resin has a remarkable inhibiting effect on water evaporation on the 17th day of the experiment the water content of 1 2 schmancy was 9 times higher than that of the control treatment without schmancy sanwetim 300 water absorbing resin absorbs water fully and is filtered under pressure when the pressure is 588 kpa the water retention rate is above 55 low fiber water retention is less than 2 at 98 147 kpa absorbent resin only repeats water absorption function namely water s absorption release water dry water absorption according to indoor measurements water absorption resin passes water absorption repeatedly general the water absorption multiple drops 50 70 after tending to be stable some varieties have even lost their water absorption function according to field measurements the water absorbing resin needs to be degraded gradually after 35 days in the soil but its water retention effect has been greatly reduced and its sustainability is related to its own quality and amount of soil good properties of water absorbent resin are that it is not only effective for the current crop but also for the next crop however poor performing water absorbing resin only has an effect on one crop and the resilience of water absorbing resin was relatively longer on sandy soil the higher the dosage was the longer the resilience was 1 3 application of saps in modern agriculture saps are mainly used in agriculture in seed coatings and root transplantation suda et al 2000 high polymer absorbent resin seed dressing is simple effective labor saving and easily accepted by farmers the method is done according to the proportion of 0 injectivity resin diluent such as 3 kg with 100 kg of water absorbent resin powder it is formed into a paste making the water absorbing resin fully dissolve not agglomerate to do this first put the water in the container and add the corresponding amount of water absorbing resin powder evenly into the water while stirring the faster the water is stirred the less able it is to form clumps if there is a small number of blocks with the hand slowly pinched open the last to the water without blocks as appropriate next soak all the seeds in the mixture and mix well let it stand for a while then remove the seeds spread them out and let them dry seeds can be sown when a film coating is formed on the seed surface this method is suitable for artificial seeding of wheat corn peanuts soybeans and small area direct planting tree species li et al 2014 soak the root system of crops in a certain concentration of water absorbent resin making the hydrogel evenly coat the root system of seedlings or entire seedlings then directly plant or take out to dry bundle and then plant trees this method is suitable for seeding sweet potatoes and for seedling transplanting or transportation for this make absorbent resin according to the volume fraction 1 5 for seedling grain crops 1 2 for cash crops 3 5 for long distance transportation the compound can be on the root after adding soil and wrapping in plastic high molecular injectivity resin can be either surface broadcast on soil or can be sprayed on the ground sojka et al 2006a broadcasting should be done before sowing or planting injectivity resin can be directly sprinkled on the surface usually when laying turf or live planting a large area when laying turf injectivity resin dosage is 90 150 kg hm 2 the field is usually 37 5 75 kg hm 2 furrow is directly to the seeds and water absorption resin with evenly scattered planting groove and then turns the soil rake flat hole is first the injectivity resin and blending into the cave and soil and then seeded earth ditch hole applying the general dosage of water absorbent resin is 22 5750 kg hm 2 ground spraying involves mixing water absorbent resin into a solution of a certain concentration and spraying it on the ground with an atomizer to form a film and reduce evaporation from the ground the application of ground spray wet method in planting and seeding of cash crops is effective the volume of prepared water absorption ester is generally 1 2 seed granulation can make small seeds large suitable for precise sowing this is often used for aircraft sowing selecting forests and planting grass harsh and gehrke 1991 the method involves soaking seeds in a certain concentration of water absorbing resin solution the seeds then form a thin film surface coatiwaysng the other method will be water absorbing resin and chemical fertilizer micronutrient fertilizer pesticide and shatter evenly sieving humus soil evenly mixed according to the ratio of the mass fraction 1 then the seed of your over coat with mixed good soil in mass ratio of 1 3 in pelletizing machine small mixer granulation absorbent resin commonly adopt the 1 3 of seed quality is better macromolecule absorbent resin has strong absorption water retention and good water retention characteristics it is applied to the soil to improve soil absorption capacity in irrigation and precipitation reduce the evaporation loss of soil water and increase the soil water content sojka et al 2006a water absorbent resin can absorb most of the crop can be used but in the actual operation attention must be paid to the coordination of soil properties and precipitation characteristics there is a relationship between the law of crop water requirement and resin water absorption and water supply characteristics and water absorption resin in agriculture has significant drought resistance water saving and crop growth and improvement effects 1 4 working conditions and application prospect of saps macromolecule water absorption resin can only water absorption it holds water but cannot product water only suitable soil moisture conditions can play a role of water conservation zhang et al 2007 it has been reported that when the soil moisture content is 12 16 super absorbent resin can give full play to its function of retaining water and moisture if the soil s moisture content is too small or too large the use effect is not significant from the water characteristics of different soils it can be seen that within the suction range of 0 1 15 bar there was a significant positive correlation between the resin content and the water retention effect however the amount of water at the wilting point is 15 bar that is the amount of invalid water is also increased different soils have different water retaining effects when absorbent resin is applied the order is coarse sandy soil loam sandy soil sand soil sand loam as an ionic soil structure modifier the interaction between super absorbent resin and clay particles when applied to the soil belongs to the surface characteristics yoshimura et al 2005 the better the molecular unfoldability is the more conducive it is to flocculation to form an aggregate structure the extensional state and electroviscous effect of the molecular chain of the super absorbent resin are affected by electrolytes and the molecular unstretchability and agglomeration of the resin decrease in the presence of salt such cationic water absorption resin salt is slower water absorption speed is worse and nonionic water absorption speed is faster salt resistance is better but water absorption capacity is lower in this case at present the synthetic materials of absorbent resin are mainly the raw materials of petroleum synthesis cellulose starch and their derivatives zhang et al 2006 manufacturing cost is high in the future we should improve or develop newer cheaper synthetic raw materials research out water absorption capacity is strong water absorption speed is fast hold the effective period is long the price is low and adapt to a wide range of series products in arid or semi arid regions in the north the shortage of agricultural water leads to the shortage of agricultural water while environmental pollution has a serious impact on agricultural water quality making the situation of agricultural water use in these regions more severe wenhua et al 2007 hongpeng et al 2008 antifouling technology of superabsorbent resin is a kind of chemical antifouling technology is to reduce the agricultural environment pollution prevention and control of fertilizer pollution degree as the instruction in order to improve the water use efficiency as the core technology through its function and structure features of polymer surface electrochemistry acting on the soil and crop root system in order to realize from the source to reduce fertilizer consumption promoting the transformation of fertilizer used in the application in the process of reducing fertilizer volatilization and deep seepage for the purpose of antifouling technology for example the utilization efficiency of fertilizer can be greatly improved by combining superabsorbent resin and fertilizer into a controlled release fertilizer integrated with materials and functions through mixing coating or chemical methods jiayong et al 2010 superabsorbent can also change the soil environmental conditions and effects of soil physical and chemical properties microbial community structure the character of crop root growth and development affecting the water of the soil to the characteristics of water and solute movement in the soil of rule change and crop physiology can hold water storage reduce pollutants leaching loss he et al 2006 mikkelsen 1994 macromolecule absorbent resin can be widely used in agriculture and promotes the development of agriculture 2 structure and water absorption mechanism of super absorbent resin 2 1 microstructure of saps saps absorb water but do not dissolve in water or conventional organic solvents the structures of various super absorbent resins synthesized by different methods are also very different for most super absorbent resins from the perspective of chemical structure its main chain or graft side chain contains strong hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups fig 1 andfig 2 the affinity of these hydrophilic groups with water is the most important internal cause of its water absorption from the perspective of physical structure it is necessary to realize that for high water absorption the resin must be a three dimensional network with a low degree of cross linking the skeleton of the network can be natural polymers such as starch and cellulose or it can be a synthetic resin such as polydactyly acid from the perspective of microstructure high water absorption the microstructure of the resin also shows diversity due to its different synthesis system the starch grafted acrylic acid studied has a sea island structure cellulose grafted acrylamide studied by sakata has a peak and socket structure while the partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide resin has a granular structure sakata 1994 sakata et al used the frozen sem lens method to study the microstructure of the super absorbent resin this method has the advantage of high accuracy and objective reflection of the original structure in addition the porous network structure of the hydrogel formed by the resin after water absorption was investigated it is still great significance to discuss its water absorption mechanism and improve its performance shan and liu 1998 2 2 water absorption theory of saps 2 2 1 flory huggins thermodynamic theory super absorbent resin is a polymer with a three dimensional spatial network structure the water is absorbed by physical and chemical adsorption therefore it has a magical water absorption capacity and can absorb hundreds of thousands of times of water haixia et al 2003 flory 1980 considering the contribution of fixed ions in the polymer to the water absorption capacity the maximum water absorption formula when the super absorbent resin swells to equilibrium is derived from the osmotic pressure caused by the difference in ion concentration between the inside and outside of the polymer gel q 5 3 i 2 v u s 1 2 2 1 2 x 1 v v e v 0 in the formula q water absorption i the number of charges each structural unit has v u the molar volume of the repeating unit s the ionic strength of the external solution x 1 hudgens parameters of the interaction between water absorbing resin and water v 1 the molar volume of water v e v 0 crosslinking density the first term of the molecule in the formula represents the osmotic pressure and the second term represents the affinity for water these two are the parts that increase the water absorption capacity according to the elastic theory of rubber the crosslinking density term of the denominator indicates if the crosslink density is lowered the water absorption rate will increase for nonelectrolyte water absorbent resins there is no first term in the formula so it has poorer water absorption capacity than the electrolyte water absorbent so it does not have high water absorption in super absorbent resin showing the elastic behavior of rubber its rigidity g is proportional to the crosslink density g r t v e v 0 the water absorption rate q means that when the cross linking density is small the value increases but the rigidity decreases obviously only controlling the cross linking density to improve the water absorption capacity you cannot get a high water absorbent resin with a certain strength when swollen saps are a family functional polymer material with strong hydrophilic groups and moderate cross linking and three dimensional network structure now saps are dominated by synthetics polyacrylate a weak acid with a carboxyl group at one end and a cc double bond at the other cc makes it have high reactivity and easy to undergo polymerization to obtain macromolecular polymer the carboxyl group makes it easy to prepare polyelectrolytes there are a large number of ionizable groups on the polyelectrolyte molecular chain which are ionized into positive or negative charges in water due to the repulsion force of the same charge the polyelectrolyte has the tendency to expand into a completely rod shaped chain in water if the polyelectrolyte is slightly cross linked it appears to expand in water due to the large charge of macromolecular ions they strongly attract counter ions and hold them down therefore ion concentration difference is formed inside and outside the polymer so the osmotic pressure inside and outside becomes larger under this action the external solvent enters the polymer which appears to absorb a large amount of water 2 2 2 solution thermodynamic theory lin runxiong and jiwei 2000 et al used the thermodynamics theory and the elastic free energy of the cross linked network to derive the following formula q 5 3 m c 1 2 x 1 ρ 2 v 1 where ρ 2 density of polymer v 1 the molar volume of the solvent m c the size of the cross linked network of cross linked polymers and x 1 the interaction parameters of cross linked polymers and solvents although the above two formulas have different forms they reveal a common essence that is the water absorption capacity of the super absorbent resin is related to the hydrophilic group ions and the cross linked structure the osmotic pressure generated by the hydrophilic group ions is the dynamic factor of water absorption the existence of the network like structure is the structural factor of water absorption 2 3 water absorption and water retention properties of super absorbent resin lin runxiong and yuli 1999 and other researchers on water absorption and water retention of water absorbent resins have investigated the water absorption performance and water retention performance of the water absorbent resin bhh a under different conditions the water absorption capacity in the aqueous electrolyte solution decreases the water absorption ability in the non electrolyte aqueous solution is not affected and the ability of ph to absorb water in 4 10 aqueous solutions is not affected at room temperature and 60 c the evaporation and diffusion of the absorbed water are extremely slow fig 3 andfig 4 saps absorb water and fertilizer and slowly release the fertilizer needed for crop growth reducing the leaching loss of fertilizer with rain and irrigation water and ensuring sufficient and timely nutrient supply for crops during the growth period taking cucumber as the research object si si et al 2009 added controlled release fertilizer and water retaining agent into the seedling substrate and the results showed that under the condition of reducing the nitrogen use of base fertilizer by 80 the plant could normally complete the development process of the vegetation growth stage after transplanting and at the same time the nitrogen leaching loss could be reduced li li et al 2007 studied the effects of compound saps on water and fertilizer leaching and agronomic traits of corn and the results showed that compound water retaining agent could reduce the liquid leaching volume significantly reduce the cumulative npk leaching rate and improve the biological yield and fertilizer utilization rate of corn erroj erro j zamarreflo and oarcia mina 2009 found that made of metal ions humus phosphate mixed saps insoluble in water but soluble in root secretion of organic acids which can make the saps as the root system growth slow release of phosphorus removal for crops need to grow in applying this saps to phosphorus loss of corn production results showed that maize growth was restored and the effect of the application of water soluble phosphate this is why study of water absorbent resins under various conditions are of practical significance for the understanding of water absorbent resins especially the promotion and development of water absorbent resins 3 the application of sap in agriculture water and soil resources are the basis of human survival and development in recent years with the global warming of the atmosphere the amount of arid and semi arid land in the world has been expanding in addition soil erosion and ecology have been worsening which has seriously affected the development of agriculture and the living environment for human beings in various countries how to use soil water effectively to overcome the adverse effects of drought on plant growth has become a focus of attention and research at home and abroad table 1 3 1 governance of deserts since ancient times many scholars have been striving to turn deserts into oases but they have not been able to do so the main reason is that the desert is always dry and short of rain even if it rains occasionally it will soon evaporate xiongcai et al 2008 the appearance of superabsorbent resin brings new hope for desert oases because in deserts and arid areas super absorbent resin can be used as a water conservation agent and a fertilizer release agent it has a positive effect on forestation and soil and water conservation due to the mesh in the molecular structure of the high absorbent resin molecular chain if it is in the soil and rain water infiltrates the soil the water molecule structure of polymer electrolytes makes contact immediately after dissociation of positive and negative ions the ions and water have a strong affinity thus has strong water absorption and water retention sojka et al 2006b when the weather is dry the water absorbed in the absorbent resin is absorbed by the root hair of the plant and can be transported to the plant body to meet the water needs in the plant s growth 3 2 drought resistance and water retention the most significant characteristic of superabsorbent resin is its high water absorption capacity up to thousands of times its own weight it also has strong water retention ability does not dehydrate when pressurized and is difficult to evaporate under natural conditions water retention time is long so plant effectively use the water to grow therefore super absorbent resin can be said to be a molecular reservoir if it is dispersed in the soil there are a lot of small reservoirs scattered in the soil so when it rains a large amount of water is absorbed and then constantly released for plant development and growth this kind of absorbent resin can repeatedly absorb and release water so it can be a long term water supply drought resistance solution silberbush swietlik 1989 studied the application of superabsorbent resin in sandy soil showing that the above water in the superabsorbent resin can be absorbed and utilized by crops according to the different properties of superabsorbent resin some versions can be maintained in the current season for 2 3 months and some can maintain their effect in the soil for more than 2 years tang et al han et al 2005 studied the soil water distribution using water absorbent resin and found that superabsorbent resin and the soil mixed with it form a water absorption network to absorb and retain water the results of zhao et al showed that the total evaporation of accumulated water in soils with superabsorbent resin was significantly lower than that in soils without superabsorbent resin li and colleagues study acrylic acid aa 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid amps polyvinyl alcohol pva resin under the microwave radiation and the absorption rate curve of non microwave aa amps pva resin xuewei et al 2009 fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 the aa amps pva resin prepared had a good water absorption rate under microwave radiation within the first 30 min the water absorption ratio reached 750 g g which is higher than that of the resin without microwave radiation thus it has a good rate of water absorption the aa amps pva resin prepared has a good water retention rate under microwave radiation at different temperatures fig 6 and fig 7 fig 5 and fig 6 show water retention curves of different resins at 15 and 45 respectively the aa amps pva resin prepared under microwave irradiation has better water retention performance than the resin without microwave radiation at these two temperatures at both 15 and 45 c the water retention performance of the resin is above 80 indicating that the resin prepared has better performance 4 conclusions the use of super absorbent resin reduces soil s water loss improves water content and also improves soil conditions to a certain extent it is conducive to the germination and growth of plant seeds and can significantly increase the output of crops such as grain cotton vegetables and fruits the agricultural application of super absorbent resin is still in the small scale experimental demonstration stage systematic application research and findings in the mechanism of water saving and water retaining research are not yet many it is still necessary to carry out extensive experimental research in different regions different soil types and different crops summarize experience obtains reliable data for popularization and application strengthen the research on the interaction mechanism of water absorbent resin and soil perfect the function of super absorbent resin and realize the four functions of water retention soil retention fertilizer retention and growth

10252,super absorbent polymers saps are a family of functional polymer material with a high water absorption function it absorbs water hundreds to thousands of times heavier than itself and has excellent water retention performance once the water absorption expands into a hydrogel it is difficult to separate the water even under pressure this article describes the water absorption and retention capacity of polymer water absorbent resin a compound that can solve the problem of water shortages in agriculture which is very important for the development of modern agriculture keywords super absorbent polymer water absorption water retention modern agriculture 1 introduction 1 1 recent development and application of saps saps is a water soluble polymeric cross linked substance developed in the past 20 years lee et al 2004 lin et al 2005 kiatkamjornwong et al 2000 francis et al 2004 lee et al 2005 due to its high swelling ability it can store a lot of water in its network structure so it attracted the attention of agronomists when it first appeared macromolecule absorbent resin is a new functional polymer material developed successfully by the united states and japan kiatkamjornwong et al 2002 lanthong et al 2006 because of its large water absorption capacity it is different from absorbent cotton sponge absorbent paper and other common water absorption materials since 1974 many organizations have studied the synthesis and application of sap such as grainproces sing herclues national starch dow chemical company sumitomo chemical company of japan wang shi base company catalytic chemical company sanyo into a company etc abdel aal et al 2006 xu et al 2007 cao et al 2002 zheng et al 2007 since the 1980s more than 20 groups in china have studied water absorbent resin and published dozens of scientific research papers in this area which has greatly promoted the development of polymer resin synthesis technology and product application in china worldwide demand of high molecular injectivity resins is also increasing liu et al 2007 islam et al 2015 guilherme et al 2010 ghazali et al 2017 seki et al 2014 with an estimated annual growth rate of 30 40 and applications for the product are also gradually expanding from personal hygiene items to medical materials anti seepage materials used in construction efficient sustained release drugs slow release fertilizers and soil moisture agents desiccants food preservatives and a wide range of air fresheners gawande and mungray 2015 divakaran et al 2015 ouml et al 2011 kangwansupamonkon et al 2010 fanta et al 1967 1 2 main features and classification of saps there are many classification methods for saps which can be divided into starch derivatives cellulose derivatives and synthetic resins according to the different chemical processes of resin preparation these products can be divided into copolymers carboxymethyl compounds and water soluble polymer crosslinking resins according to the final form the products can be divided into powder resins film resins and fiber absorbent resins pourjavadi and mahdavinia 2014 macromolecule water absorbing resin is a kind of macromolecule compound with strong water absorbing abilities its water absorbing capacity is dozens to thousands of times its own mass ordinary natural materials cannot be compared to this compound not only are its water absorption and water retention capacities very high it absorbs water with a high degree of retention hamed and jaber f hamed 2015 the water absorption of saps includes water absorption ability water absorption speed and moisture absorption ability its water absorption ability mainly depends on the composition and structure of the water absorption resin itself as well as on the salt in the water solution and the water s ph value haraguchi et al 2005 generally speaking the water absorption capacity of the cellulose graft modified type resin is higher than that of starch graft modified type and that of ionic polymer is higher than that of nonionic polymer the higher the ionization degree of the polymer the stronger the water absorption capacity the same macromolecule absorbent resin in pure water absorbent capacity stronger absorbent ratio for its own mass 400 1000 times some as high as 200 3000 times with increased salt content in the solution the water absorption ratio decreases greatly when the ph value of a solution is 6 7 the water absorption capacity of polymer absorbent resin water retention agent is the strongest in strongly acidic or alkaline solutions the water absorption capacity is significantly reduced the salt content and ph value of a solution have a great influence on the water absorption capacity of ionic water absorption resin but do not have a significant influence on the water absorption capacity of nonionic water absorption resin water absorption resin not only water absorption capacity and water absorption speed is fast ionic water absorption resin saturation needs a few hours in 0 5 h or so it can reach half saturation in nonionic water absorption resin saturation takes only 20 60 min generally in about 2 min it can reach saturated water absorption of 1 2 above in addition to holding liquid water absorbent resin can also absorb liquid water molecules in the air and soil environment hygroscopic ability and hygroscopic velocity mainly depend on the type of water absorbent resin and the level of environmental humidity yadav and rhee 2012 the polymer absorbent resin becomes a gel after absorbing water the absorbed water evaporates under natural conditions and the pressure is not easy to isolate rao et al 1981 the evaporation test of schmancy resin produced by american schmancy company under constant temperature showed that the schmancy resin has a remarkable inhibiting effect on water evaporation on the 17th day of the experiment the water content of 1 2 schmancy was 9 times higher than that of the control treatment without schmancy sanwetim 300 water absorbing resin absorbs water fully and is filtered under pressure when the pressure is 588 kpa the water retention rate is above 55 low fiber water retention is less than 2 at 98 147 kpa absorbent resin only repeats water absorption function namely water s absorption release water dry water absorption according to indoor measurements water absorption resin passes water absorption repeatedly general the water absorption multiple drops 50 70 after tending to be stable some varieties have even lost their water absorption function according to field measurements the water absorbing resin needs to be degraded gradually after 35 days in the soil but its water retention effect has been greatly reduced and its sustainability is related to its own quality and amount of soil good properties of water absorbent resin are that it is not only effective for the current crop but also for the next crop however poor performing water absorbing resin only has an effect on one crop and the resilience of water absorbing resin was relatively longer on sandy soil the higher the dosage was the longer the resilience was 1 3 application of saps in modern agriculture saps are mainly used in agriculture in seed coatings and root transplantation suda et al 2000 high polymer absorbent resin seed dressing is simple effective labor saving and easily accepted by farmers the method is done according to the proportion of 0 injectivity resin diluent such as 3 kg with 100 kg of water absorbent resin powder it is formed into a paste making the water absorbing resin fully dissolve not agglomerate to do this first put the water in the container and add the corresponding amount of water absorbing resin powder evenly into the water while stirring the faster the water is stirred the less able it is to form clumps if there is a small number of blocks with the hand slowly pinched open the last to the water without blocks as appropriate next soak all the seeds in the mixture and mix well let it stand for a while then remove the seeds spread them out and let them dry seeds can be sown when a film coating is formed on the seed surface this method is suitable for artificial seeding of wheat corn peanuts soybeans and small area direct planting tree species li et al 2014 soak the root system of crops in a certain concentration of water absorbent resin making the hydrogel evenly coat the root system of seedlings or entire seedlings then directly plant or take out to dry bundle and then plant trees this method is suitable for seeding sweet potatoes and for seedling transplanting or transportation for this make absorbent resin according to the volume fraction 1 5 for seedling grain crops 1 2 for cash crops 3 5 for long distance transportation the compound can be on the root after adding soil and wrapping in plastic high molecular injectivity resin can be either surface broadcast on soil or can be sprayed on the ground sojka et al 2006a broadcasting should be done before sowing or planting injectivity resin can be directly sprinkled on the surface usually when laying turf or live planting a large area when laying turf injectivity resin dosage is 90 150 kg hm 2 the field is usually 37 5 75 kg hm 2 furrow is directly to the seeds and water absorption resin with evenly scattered planting groove and then turns the soil rake flat hole is first the injectivity resin and blending into the cave and soil and then seeded earth ditch hole applying the general dosage of water absorbent resin is 22 5750 kg hm 2 ground spraying involves mixing water absorbent resin into a solution of a certain concentration and spraying it on the ground with an atomizer to form a film and reduce evaporation from the ground the application of ground spray wet method in planting and seeding of cash crops is effective the volume of prepared water absorption ester is generally 1 2 seed granulation can make small seeds large suitable for precise sowing this is often used for aircraft sowing selecting forests and planting grass harsh and gehrke 1991 the method involves soaking seeds in a certain concentration of water absorbing resin solution the seeds then form a thin film surface coatiwaysng the other method will be water absorbing resin and chemical fertilizer micronutrient fertilizer pesticide and shatter evenly sieving humus soil evenly mixed according to the ratio of the mass fraction 1 then the seed of your over coat with mixed good soil in mass ratio of 1 3 in pelletizing machine small mixer granulation absorbent resin commonly adopt the 1 3 of seed quality is better macromolecule absorbent resin has strong absorption water retention and good water retention characteristics it is applied to the soil to improve soil absorption capacity in irrigation and precipitation reduce the evaporation loss of soil water and increase the soil water content sojka et al 2006a water absorbent resin can absorb most of the crop can be used but in the actual operation attention must be paid to the coordination of soil properties and precipitation characteristics there is a relationship between the law of crop water requirement and resin water absorption and water supply characteristics and water absorption resin in agriculture has significant drought resistance water saving and crop growth and improvement effects 1 4 working conditions and application prospect of saps macromolecule water absorption resin can only water absorption it holds water but cannot product water only suitable soil moisture conditions can play a role of water conservation zhang et al 2007 it has been reported that when the soil moisture content is 12 16 super absorbent resin can give full play to its function of retaining water and moisture if the soil s moisture content is too small or too large the use effect is not significant from the water characteristics of different soils it can be seen that within the suction range of 0 1 15 bar there was a significant positive correlation between the resin content and the water retention effect however the amount of water at the wilting point is 15 bar that is the amount of invalid water is also increased different soils have different water retaining effects when absorbent resin is applied the order is coarse sandy soil loam sandy soil sand soil sand loam as an ionic soil structure modifier the interaction between super absorbent resin and clay particles when applied to the soil belongs to the surface characteristics yoshimura et al 2005 the better the molecular unfoldability is the more conducive it is to flocculation to form an aggregate structure the extensional state and electroviscous effect of the molecular chain of the super absorbent resin are affected by electrolytes and the molecular unstretchability and agglomeration of the resin decrease in the presence of salt such cationic water absorption resin salt is slower water absorption speed is worse and nonionic water absorption speed is faster salt resistance is better but water absorption capacity is lower in this case at present the synthetic materials of absorbent resin are mainly the raw materials of petroleum synthesis cellulose starch and their derivatives zhang et al 2006 manufacturing cost is high in the future we should improve or develop newer cheaper synthetic raw materials research out water absorption capacity is strong water absorption speed is fast hold the effective period is long the price is low and adapt to a wide range of series products in arid or semi arid regions in the north the shortage of agricultural water leads to the shortage of agricultural water while environmental pollution has a serious impact on agricultural water quality making the situation of agricultural water use in these regions more severe wenhua et al 2007 hongpeng et al 2008 antifouling technology of superabsorbent resin is a kind of chemical antifouling technology is to reduce the agricultural environment pollution prevention and control of fertilizer pollution degree as the instruction in order to improve the water use efficiency as the core technology through its function and structure features of polymer surface electrochemistry acting on the soil and crop root system in order to realize from the source to reduce fertilizer consumption promoting the transformation of fertilizer used in the application in the process of reducing fertilizer volatilization and deep seepage for the purpose of antifouling technology for example the utilization efficiency of fertilizer can be greatly improved by combining superabsorbent resin and fertilizer into a controlled release fertilizer integrated with materials and functions through mixing coating or chemical methods jiayong et al 2010 superabsorbent can also change the soil environmental conditions and effects of soil physical and chemical properties microbial community structure the character of crop root growth and development affecting the water of the soil to the characteristics of water and solute movement in the soil of rule change and crop physiology can hold water storage reduce pollutants leaching loss he et al 2006 mikkelsen 1994 macromolecule absorbent resin can be widely used in agriculture and promotes the development of agriculture 2 structure and water absorption mechanism of super absorbent resin 2 1 microstructure of saps saps absorb water but do not dissolve in water or conventional organic solvents the structures of various super absorbent resins synthesized by different methods are also very different for most super absorbent resins from the perspective of chemical structure its main chain or graft side chain contains strong hydrophilic functional groups such as carboxyl groups and hydroxyl groups fig 1 andfig 2 the affinity of these hydrophilic groups with water is the most important internal cause of its water absorption from the perspective of physical structure it is necessary to realize that for high water absorption the resin must be a three dimensional network with a low degree of cross linking the skeleton of the network can be natural polymers such as starch and cellulose or it can be a synthetic resin such as polydactyly acid from the perspective of microstructure high water absorption the microstructure of the resin also shows diversity due to its different synthesis system the starch grafted acrylic acid studied has a sea island structure cellulose grafted acrylamide studied by sakata has a peak and socket structure while the partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide resin has a granular structure sakata 1994 sakata et al used the frozen sem lens method to study the microstructure of the super absorbent resin this method has the advantage of high accuracy and objective reflection of the original structure in addition the porous network structure of the hydrogel formed by the resin after water absorption was investigated it is still great significance to discuss its water absorption mechanism and improve its performance shan and liu 1998 2 2 water absorption theory of saps 2 2 1 flory huggins thermodynamic theory super absorbent resin is a polymer with a three dimensional spatial network structure the water is absorbed by physical and chemical adsorption therefore it has a magical water absorption capacity and can absorb hundreds of thousands of times of water haixia et al 2003 flory 1980 considering the contribution of fixed ions in the polymer to the water absorption capacity the maximum water absorption formula when the super absorbent resin swells to equilibrium is derived from the osmotic pressure caused by the difference in ion concentration between the inside and outside of the polymer gel q 5 3 i 2 v u s 1 2 2 1 2 x 1 v v e v 0 in the formula q water absorption i the number of charges each structural unit has v u the molar volume of the repeating unit s the ionic strength of the external solution x 1 hudgens parameters of the interaction between water absorbing resin and water v 1 the molar volume of water v e v 0 crosslinking density the first term of the molecule in the formula represents the osmotic pressure and the second term represents the affinity for water these two are the parts that increase the water absorption capacity according to the elastic theory of rubber the crosslinking density term of the denominator indicates if the crosslink density is lowered the water absorption rate will increase for nonelectrolyte water absorbent resins there is no first term in the formula so it has poorer water absorption capacity than the electrolyte water absorbent so it does not have high water absorption in super absorbent resin showing the elastic behavior of rubber its rigidity g is proportional to the crosslink density g r t v e v 0 the water absorption rate q means that when the cross linking density is small the value increases but the rigidity decreases obviously only controlling the cross linking density to improve the water absorption capacity you cannot get a high water absorbent resin with a certain strength when swollen saps are a family functional polymer material with strong hydrophilic groups and moderate cross linking and three dimensional network structure now saps are dominated by synthetics polyacrylate a weak acid with a carboxyl group at one end and a cc double bond at the other cc makes it have high reactivity and easy to undergo polymerization to obtain macromolecular polymer the carboxyl group makes it easy to prepare polyelectrolytes there are a large number of ionizable groups on the polyelectrolyte molecular chain which are ionized into positive or negative charges in water due to the repulsion force of the same charge the polyelectrolyte has the tendency to expand into a completely rod shaped chain in water if the polyelectrolyte is slightly cross linked it appears to expand in water due to the large charge of macromolecular ions they strongly attract counter ions and hold them down therefore ion concentration difference is formed inside and outside the polymer so the osmotic pressure inside and outside becomes larger under this action the external solvent enters the polymer which appears to absorb a large amount of water 2 2 2 solution thermodynamic theory lin runxiong and jiwei 2000 et al used the thermodynamics theory and the elastic free energy of the cross linked network to derive the following formula q 5 3 m c 1 2 x 1 ρ 2 v 1 where ρ 2 density of polymer v 1 the molar volume of the solvent m c the size of the cross linked network of cross linked polymers and x 1 the interaction parameters of cross linked polymers and solvents although the above two formulas have different forms they reveal a common essence that is the water absorption capacity of the super absorbent resin is related to the hydrophilic group ions and the cross linked structure the osmotic pressure generated by the hydrophilic group ions is the dynamic factor of water absorption the existence of the network like structure is the structural factor of water absorption 2 3 water absorption and water retention properties of super absorbent resin lin runxiong and yuli 1999 and other researchers on water absorption and water retention of water absorbent resins have investigated the water absorption performance and water retention performance of the water absorbent resin bhh a under different conditions the water absorption capacity in the aqueous electrolyte solution decreases the water absorption ability in the non electrolyte aqueous solution is not affected and the ability of ph to absorb water in 4 10 aqueous solutions is not affected at room temperature and 60 c the evaporation and diffusion of the absorbed water are extremely slow fig 3 andfig 4 saps absorb water and fertilizer and slowly release the fertilizer needed for crop growth reducing the leaching loss of fertilizer with rain and irrigation water and ensuring sufficient and timely nutrient supply for crops during the growth period taking cucumber as the research object si si et al 2009 added controlled release fertilizer and water retaining agent into the seedling substrate and the results showed that under the condition of reducing the nitrogen use of base fertilizer by 80 the plant could normally complete the development process of the vegetation growth stage after transplanting and at the same time the nitrogen leaching loss could be reduced li li et al 2007 studied the effects of compound saps on water and fertilizer leaching and agronomic traits of corn and the results showed that compound water retaining agent could reduce the liquid leaching volume significantly reduce the cumulative npk leaching rate and improve the biological yield and fertilizer utilization rate of corn erroj erro j zamarreflo and oarcia mina 2009 found that made of metal ions humus phosphate mixed saps insoluble in water but soluble in root secretion of organic acids which can make the saps as the root system growth slow release of phosphorus removal for crops need to grow in applying this saps to phosphorus loss of corn production results showed that maize growth was restored and the effect of the application of water soluble phosphate this is why study of water absorbent resins under various conditions are of practical significance for the understanding of water absorbent resins especially the promotion and development of water absorbent resins 3 the application of sap in agriculture water and soil resources are the basis of human survival and development in recent years with the global warming of the atmosphere the amount of arid and semi arid land in the world has been expanding in addition soil erosion and ecology have been worsening which has seriously affected the development of agriculture and the living environment for human beings in various countries how to use soil water effectively to overcome the adverse effects of drought on plant growth has become a focus of attention and research at home and abroad table 1 3 1 governance of deserts since ancient times many scholars have been striving to turn deserts into oases but they have not been able to do so the main reason is that the desert is always dry and short of rain even if it rains occasionally it will soon evaporate xiongcai et al 2008 the appearance of superabsorbent resin brings new hope for desert oases because in deserts and arid areas super absorbent resin can be used as a water conservation agent and a fertilizer release agent it has a positive effect on forestation and soil and water conservation due to the mesh in the molecular structure of the high absorbent resin molecular chain if it is in the soil and rain water infiltrates the soil the water molecule structure of polymer electrolytes makes contact immediately after dissociation of positive and negative ions the ions and water have a strong affinity thus has strong water absorption and water retention sojka et al 2006b when the weather is dry the water absorbed in the absorbent resin is absorbed by the root hair of the plant and can be transported to the plant body to meet the water needs in the plant s growth 3 2 drought resistance and water retention the most significant characteristic of superabsorbent resin is its high water absorption capacity up to thousands of times its own weight it also has strong water retention ability does not dehydrate when pressurized and is difficult to evaporate under natural conditions water retention time is long so plant effectively use the water to grow therefore super absorbent resin can be said to be a molecular reservoir if it is dispersed in the soil there are a lot of small reservoirs scattered in the soil so when it rains a large amount of water is absorbed and then constantly released for plant development and growth this kind of absorbent resin can repeatedly absorb and release water so it can be a long term water supply drought resistance solution silberbush swietlik 1989 studied the application of superabsorbent resin in sandy soil showing that the above water in the superabsorbent resin can be absorbed and utilized by crops according to the different properties of superabsorbent resin some versions can be maintained in the current season for 2 3 months and some can maintain their effect in the soil for more than 2 years tang et al han et al 2005 studied the soil water distribution using water absorbent resin and found that superabsorbent resin and the soil mixed with it form a water absorption network to absorb and retain water the results of zhao et al showed that the total evaporation of accumulated water in soils with superabsorbent resin was significantly lower than that in soils without superabsorbent resin li and colleagues study acrylic acid aa 2 acrylamido 2 methyl propane sulfonic acid amps polyvinyl alcohol pva resin under the microwave radiation and the absorption rate curve of non microwave aa amps pva resin xuewei et al 2009 fig 5 fig 6 fig 7 the aa amps pva resin prepared had a good water absorption rate under microwave radiation within the first 30 min the water absorption ratio reached 750 g g which is higher than that of the resin without microwave radiation thus it has a good rate of water absorption the aa amps pva resin prepared has a good water retention rate under microwave radiation at different temperatures fig 6 and fig 7 fig 5 and fig 6 show water retention curves of different resins at 15 and 45 respectively the aa amps pva resin prepared under microwave irradiation has better water retention performance than the resin without microwave radiation at these two temperatures at both 15 and 45 c the water retention performance of the resin is above 80 indicating that the resin prepared has better performance 4 conclusions the use of super absorbent resin reduces soil s water loss improves water content and also improves soil conditions to a certain extent it is conducive to the germination and growth of plant seeds and can significantly increase the output of crops such as grain cotton vegetables and fruits the agricultural application of super absorbent resin is still in the small scale experimental demonstration stage systematic application research and findings in the mechanism of water saving and water retaining research are not yet many it is still necessary to carry out extensive experimental research in different regions different soil types and different crops summarize experience obtains reliable data for popularization and application strengthen the research on the interaction mechanism of water absorbent resin and soil perfect the function of super absorbent resin and realize the four functions of water retention soil retention fertilizer retention and growth

10253,the long term utilization of brackish water for irrigation in arid areas will decrease the oxygen content required for root growth leading to the deterioration of soil environment in the root zone and the inhibition of plant growth this study investigated the effects of oxygenated brackish water on the physiological characteristics of seed germination and seedling growth characteristics of spring wheat the dissolved oxygen do of 20 mg l 1 in brackish water had a significant promotion effect on the seed germination and seedling growth specifically at this do concentration of 20 mg l 1 the germination rate germination potential germination index vigor index and plant height on the 23rd day after sowing of wheat seeds were significantly higher than those of brackish water treatment ck furthermore compared with ck the α amylase activity in wheat seeds was significantly increased germination rate could be used as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under the condition of oxygenated brackish water irrigation according to the relationship between germination rate and do concentration the do concentration with the maximum germination rate was 19 mg l 1 during the wheat seedling growth period compared with ck the oxygenated brackish water with do concentration of 20 mg l 1 significantly increased the contents of soluble sugar and soluble protein in the leaves whereas significantly decreased the proline content soluble sugar content was selected as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seedling growth the electrical conductivity and the activities of alkaline phosphatase and nitrate reductase in the root zone soil were significantly influenced thus the oxygenation of brackish water with appropriate do concentration could effectively improve the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation these results provide an effective method for the safe and efficient utilization of brackish water keywords dissolved oxygen germination rate oxygenated brackish water physiological index wheat 1 introduction the imbalance between supply and demand of freshwater resources has led to water shortage in most countries of the world gilbert 2018 in particular it is important to address the shortage of freshwater resources in order to maintain food production new technical measures are being implemented to develop new water resources to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources jiang 2009 for example the reasonable development of brackish water irrigation could effectively relieve the water pressure caused by the shortage of freshwater resources pérez pérez et al 2016 there are about 27 countries in the world which irrigate with brackish water for agriculture including israel ghermandi and minich 2017 china chen et al 2018a the united states ozturk et al 2018 italy cantore 2003 etc accounting for about 29 7 of the land area fig 1 short term irrigation with brackish water could increase crop yields jin et al 2016 and improve crop quality bustan et al 2005 however the long term utilization of brackish water irrigation would lead to the accumulation of salt in the root zone of crops rengasamy 2006 thereby reducing the crop yield and leading to secondary salinization of land cao et al 2016 studies have shown that high nacl concentration absorbed by root caused a great reduction of leaf area fresh and dry weight of leaves and roots and nitrate reductase activity of leaves thereby inhibiting the growth of sugar beet ghoulam et al 2002 furthermore high nacl concentration could inhibit the absorption of soil water by tomato roots romero aranda et al 2001 and then reduce the accumulation of minerals in tomato leaves and fruit yields han et al 2005 therefore it is very important to find more efficient brackish water treatment techniques to reduce the adverse effects of brackish water irrigation the oxygenated irrigation technique has achieved remarkable benefits in agricultural irrigation in recent years mechanical oxygenation is considered to be a common method of oxygenation in the oxygenated irrigation technique the devices employed for oxygenation mainly include oxygenation pump venturi bhattarai et al 2015 and micro nanofoamer systems sang et al 2018 compared with other oxygenation methods the micro nanobubble oxygenation method could significantly increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water and improve the efficiency of oxygen transfer thereby enhancing the activity and physiological effects of irrigation water park et al 2010 moreover the micro nanobubble oxygenation device has the advantages of simplicity low energy consumption less investment eco friendliness and high efficiency studies have shown that oxygenated irrigation could improve the soil respiration bhattarai et al 2004 and promote the activities of soil microorganism zhao et al 2018 furthermore it accelerates the absorption and accumulation of nutrients by root and promotes plant growth bhattarai et al 2008 studies have shown that irrigation with oxygenated freshwater by a mazzei venturi could increase the nitrogen accumulation in crops chen et al 2018a 2018b the biomass of sweet corn lei et al 2016 and the total fresh weight of red cabbages tunc and sahin 2016 in addition bhattarai et al 2006 found that the oxygenated freshwater irrigation by a mazzei venturi could decrease the water stress index and increase the tomato yield water use efficiency and chlorophyll content of leaves in the application of oxygenated brackish water irrigation studies have shown that the infiltration of appropriate oxygenated brackish water by micro nanobubble rapid generation device increased the soil infiltration rate and accelerated the salt leaching sun et al 2019 however previous research into the oxygenated irrigation technique has mainly focused on the agricultural freshwater irrigation whereas there has limited research into the use of oxygenated brackish water for irrigation especially the study on the influence of brackish water irrigation with micro nanobubble oxygenation method on crop seedling growth moreover the crop seedling stage is very sensitive to salt stress chang et al 2019 therefore based on the theory of oxygenated freshwater irrigation our study combined the micro nanobubble oxygenation method with brackish water irrigation was to explore the characteristics of wheat seed germination and seedling growth which aimed to provide some theoretical basis for finding safer and more effective measures to improve the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation on crop growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and soil description the experiment was performed using surface 0 15 cm saline soil collected from fuping shaanxi

oxygenated brackish water on the wheat seed germination process 3 1 1 germination and physiological characteristics of wheat seeds when the do concentration in the brackish water increased from 8 to 10 mg l 1 ck to 30 mg 1 1 the germination indices germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight and vitality index and the α amylase activity almost increased initially and then decreased whereas the malondialdehyde content almost exhibited the opposite trend compared with ck the germination index and vitality index of wheat seeds were increased significantly by 30 and 49 under the do20 treatment respectively table 1 the daily germination rate was significantly higher under the do20 treatment fig 2 and the germination rate and germination potential increased by 30 and 27 respectively in addition compared with do20 the germination index root fresh weight and vitality index were inhibited under the do25 treatment which decreased by 27 17 and 40 respectively overall compared with do20 the seed germination was inhibited to a certain extent under the do25 treatment and was stopped after the fifth day under the do30 treatment the α amylase activity of seeds significantly increased by 11 15 and 18 under the do20 treatment respectively compared with the treatments of ck do25 and do30 table 2 compared with do25 the mda content was significantly reduced by 36 under the do20 treatment the α amylase activity of wheat seeds represented the maximum value under the do20 treatment indicating that the α amylase activity would be inhibited in wheat seeds when exceeded the optimum do concentration in brackish water 3 1 2 quantitative evaluation index for germinated wheat seeds according to the analysis based on pearson s correlation coefficients there were significant correlations between the germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight vitality index α amylase activity and mda content during seed germination table 3 the results showed that the germination rate was the most representative index according to the analysis where all the indicators were positively correlated with the germination rate except for the negative correlation between the mda content and germination rate and in terms of the experimental operability the determination of germination rate was more convenient and faster than the other indicators therefore the germination rate could be used as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under irrigation with oxygenated brackish water based on the relationship between the quantitative evaluation index germination rate and dissolved oxygen concentration table 1 the following quadratic formula was used for fitting formula 4 fig 3 the calculated do concentration when the germination rate was maximized was about 19 mg l 1 4 gr 0 091do2 3 422do 41 087 3 2 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings 3 2 1 plant height of wheat seedlings compared with ck the plant heights of wheat seedling on the 8th 13th 18th and 23rd days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 39 35 55 and 35 under the do20 treatment respectively fig 4 moreover the plant heights on the 8th 13th and 18th days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 46 27 and 32 under the do30 treatment respectively the plant heights on the 8th and 18th days after seed sowing of do20 were 16 and 38 significantly higher than do15 respectively compared with do25 the plant heights on the 13th 18th and 23rd days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 28 47 and 28 under the do20 treatment respectively therefore compared with other treatments do20 had a better promoting effect on wheat plant height 3 2 2 physiological indexes of wheat seedlings as the do concentration increased from ck to 30 mg l 1 the contents of soluble sugar and soluble protein in the wheat leaves increased initially and then decreased where the maximum value was obtained under the do20 treatment the proline content of the leaves decreased initially and then increased where the minimum value was obtained under the do20 treatment table 4 in addition the contents of soluble sugar and proline in leaves of do20 were significantly higher and lower than those of other treatments respectively compared with ck the soluble sugar content significantly increased by 115 and the proline content significantly decreased by 51 under the do20 treatment moreover the soluble protein content significantly increased by 13 and 12 under the do20 and do30 treatments respectively thus the do20 treatment could promote the growth of wheat seedling the growth and development of wheat seedlings was inhibited when the do concentration exceeded 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 quantitative evaluation index for the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the plant height and leaf physiological indexes soluble sugar soluble protein and proline were analyzed for the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the soluble sugar content of leaves changed significantly compared with ck so the soluble sugar content could be used as a quantitative index for evaluating the growth characteristics of wheat at the seedling stage under the irrigation with oxygenated brackish water 3 3 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the soil physicochemical properties in the seedling stage 3 3 1 soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity there was no significant difference in soil moisture distribution in the root zone of 0 10 cm depth fig 5 a compared with ck the soil moisture of do30 in the root zone at 10 15 cm depth significantly increased by 13 moreover the soil moisture of do20 do25 and do30 in the root zone at 15 20 cm depth significantly increased by 14 14 and 17 respectively in the present study the soil moisture was higher in the 10 20 cm deep root zone under the oxygenated brackish water irrigation with the increase of do concentration the standard deviations of soil moisture in the 0 20 cm depth root zone were 0 013 0 012 0 002 0 007 and 0 003 respectively the minimum appeared under the do20 treatment indicating that the uniform soil moisture distribution at the dissolved oxygen concentration of 20 mg l 1 was the best among the oxygenated treatments the soil electrical conductivity of do20 and do25 at 10 20 cm depth was significantly higher than that of ck while the soil electrical conductivity of do30 at 15 20 cm depth was significantly higher fig 5b the soil electrical conductivity of do30 at 0 5 cm depth was significantly higher than do15 in addition the average electrical conductivity under the treatments of ck do15 do20 do25 and do30 were 577 5 550 75 696 25 719 75 and 707 75 us cm 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer as the main root zone depth respectively the remaining salt was leached below 20 cm of soil layer in general the electrical conductivity of the soil surface layer 0 5 cm was higher than that of the lower soil layer additionally approximate desalination rate and approximate salt accumulation rate were calculated with the formula conductivity of each treatment initial conductivity initial conductivity the negative value is defined as the approximate desalination rate and the positive value is defined as the approximate salt accumulation rate the results showed that the approximate desalination rate of oxygenated brackish water treatment could reach up to 21 whereas that of brackish water treatment was 18 3 3 2 activities of soil alkaline phosphatase and soil nitrate reductase compared with ck except for the do15 treatment different treatments of oxygenated brackish water irrigation had significant inhibitory effects on the soil alkaline phosphatase activity in the 0 20 cm depth root zone soil fig 6 a under the do15 treatment the soil alkaline phosphatase activity increased at the depth of 0 10 cm but decreased in the 10 20 cm soil layer compared with ck different treatments of oxygenated brackish water irrigation showed significant inhibition of soil nitrate reductase activity in the 0 15 cm deep root zone soil fig 6b do20 and do25 showed significant inhibition of nitrate reductase activity in the 15 20 cm deep root zone soil while do15 showed significant promotion 4 discussion 4 1 effects of oxygenated brackish water on wheat seed germination germination parameters i e germination rate germination potential germination index fresh root weight and vitality index and α amylase activity can reflect the germination capacity of seeds to a certain extent wen et al 2018 in the present study the germination parameters and α amylase activity of do20 treatment were significantly higher than those of ck indicating that the do20 treatment could promote seed germination in addition germination parameters can be used as the salt tolerance indicators for wheat seeds during germination sharma and yamdagni 1989 the higher germination parameters also suggested that the do20 treatment enhanced the resistance of wheat seeds to salt the mda content can indicate the degree of membrane peroxidation montjean et al 2010 mda can damage the integrity of cell membranes and disrupt the osmotic balance in cells wang et al 2013a 2013b thus inhibiting seed germination the mda content of wheat seeds in do20 were significantly lower than that in do25 which indicated that the do concentration of 20 mg l 1 improved the imbalanced permeation caused by the brackish water irrigation however when the do concentration in the brackish water increased from 8 to 10 mg l 1 ck to 30 mg 1 1 the germination indices and α amylase activity initially increased marginally and then decreased whereas the mda content exhibited the opposite trend oxygen is one of the main factors that affects the germination of seeds ahmed et al 2018 after germination their respiration increased and they need oxygen to maintain basic life activities on the one hand micro nanobubbles can increase the oxygen concentration li et al 2014 and the oxygen retention in the water takahashi 2009 which can increase the contact time of oxygen with seeds on the other hand micro nanobubbles can improve the efficiency of oxygen transfer han et al 2010 and reduce the resistance of seeds to oxygen absorption therefore when the concentration of dissolved oxygen was less than 20 mg l 1 the micro nanobubbles might mainly provide the oxygen needed to facilitate seed germination however reactive oxygen species ros are generated during the micro nanobubble disappearing process bailly et al 2008 and there is a positive correlation between the number of micro nanobubbles and ros concentration liu et al 2016 ros can cause membrane peroxidation or damage to proteins and other cell components laloi et al 2004 and inhibit seed germination if their concentration exceeds a certain level in the present study when the concentration of dissolved oxygen exceeded 20 mg l 1 the germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight vitality index germination rate and α amylase activity in the wheat seeds tended to decrease whereas the mda content exhibited an increasing trend studies have shown that the vitality index is highly sensitive to the salt damage sharma and yamdagni 1989 in the present study there was a highly significant positive correlation between the germination rate and vitality index which indicated that the germination rate could reflect seed germination under different do concentrations as well as the degree of salt damage to seeds therefore the germination rate was selected as a quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under the condition of oxygenated brackish water irrigation 4 2 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the do20 treatment significantly increased the plant height during the seedling stage at this concentration of oxygenation 20 mg l 1 brackish water irrigation could effectively improve the soil aeration bhattarai et al 2004 thereby enhancing the activities of soil microorganism zhao et al 2018 ultimately accelerating the nutrient absorption and promoting the plant growth bhattarai et al 2008 in addition the soluble sugar and protein contents in the wheat leaves of do20 were significantly higher than those of ck which indicated that brackish water irrigation could enhance the water absorption ability of cells munns 1993 by increasing the concentration of osmoregulation substance in the leaves the soluble protein content of the leaves can also reflect the capacity for salt resistance by plants gulen et al 2006 irrigation with brackish water can cause salt stress which affects the normal growth of wheat seedlings the soluble protein content of the wheat leaves in do20 was significantly higher than that in the ck which indicated that this treatment also improved the resistance of wheat seedlings to salt there was a positive correlation between the proline content and degree of salt stress javadi et al 2015 proline would accumulate in plants when plants were exposed to salt stress ghoulam et al 2002 in the present study the salinity of irrigated brackish water was uniform the lower proline content indicated that the plants were subjected to less salt stress the proline content of the wheat leaves in do20 was significantly lower than that in the ck which indicated that do20 could alleviate salt stress in wheat seedlings following irrigation with brackish water therefore the do20 treatment improved salt resistance in wheat seedlings by increasing osmoregulation substance concentration and water absorption wheat seedling growth was inhibited to some extent when the do concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 the maximum plant height and the chlorophyll soluble sugar and soluble protein contents as well as the minimum proline contents were found in the do20 treatment during the seedling stage which indicates that dissolved oxygen promoted the growth of crops in the optimal concentration range similar results were obtained by zheng et al 2007 who found that the optimum do concentration was 30 mg l 1 when tomatoes were cultured in a nutrient solution with do concentrations of 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 these different observations were possibly due to the differences in the cultivation environment crop type water quality and cultivation time 4 3 effects of oxygenated brackish water on soil moisture and salt distribution water is one of the four major factors related to soil fertility and it is strongly associated with plant growth and development it is important to study the salt content of salt stressed soils under irrigation with brackish water in order to prevent the secondary salinization of soil in the present study the soil moisture content in the 10 20 cm deep root zone with oxygenated brackish water irrigation was higher than that of ck on the one hand the oxygenated brackish water for irrigation could improve water use efficiency bhattarai et al 2006 on the other hand when the micro nanobubbles entered the soil they would rupture under pressure and might have an impact on the soil structure garwal et al 2011 thus the total number of soil pores might increase which increases the water preservation and soil moisture the soil electric conductivity was higher in the 0 5 cm deep root zone probably because the intense evaporation in the summer caused salt in the deeper soil to rise to the surface at the soil surface the soil water entered the atmosphere through evaporation but the salt remained on the surface of the soil additionally the inhibitory effect on crop growth in case of do30 might be due to the higher soil water content in the root zone which led to the high salt content carried with water and the salt accumulation in the root zone the effect of soil desalination in ck was better than that in do20 but wheat germination and seedling growth were inferior in the ck this is probably because crop growth was inhibited owing to the water stress munns 1993 the soil moisture content of the ck at 10 20 cm soil depth was lower than that of do20 treatment fig 5b 4 4 effects of oxygenated brackish water on soil enzyme activities in the seedling stage compared with ck the different irrigation treatments except for the do15 treatment had inhibitory effects on the alkaline phosphatase activities in the 0 20 cm deep soil root zone and on the nitrate reductase activities in the 0 15 cm deep soil root zone the soil alkaline phosphatase activities might have decreased owing to the increased soil moisture wei et al 2016 and thus these activities were consistent with the changes in soil moisture in addition it is likely that excessive ros generation caused by micro nanobubbles breakage could result in the oxidative damage to proteins and the inhibition of soil enzyme activities laloi et al 2004 these findings indicated that brackish water irrigation could promote the retention of soil moisture in the root zone during the wheat seedling stage but they inhibited the soil alkaline phosphatase activities to some extent nitrate reductase participates in the denitrification of nitrogen in the soil where no3 is converted into no2 lea et al 2006 thus more no3 is converted into no2 when the soil nitrate reductase activity is high plants mainly absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of no3 miller et al 2007 thus lower soil nitrate reductase activities are more favorable for the absorption of no3 by plants in the present study compared with ck the oxygenated irrigation treatments with brackish water significantly inhibited the nitrate reductase activity in the 0 15 cm deep root zone of the soil therefore irrigation with oxygenated brackish water was beneficial for the uptake of no3 by plants 4 5 mechanisms that improve salt stress and regulate wheat seedling growth when the do concentration in brackish water was less than or equal to 20 mg l 1 micro nanobubbles mainly provided oxygen and improved the efficiency of oxygen transfer with an increase in the do concentration li et al 2014 this could reduce the resistance of seeds to oxygen absorption and the osmotic imbalance caused by salt stress which could increase the germination rate germination potential germination index fresh root weight vitality index and α amylase activity of wheat seeds and reduce the mda content for wheat seedlings irrigation with oxygenated brackish water could effectively improve soil aeration and promote soil respiration bhattarai et al 2004 thereby increasing soil microbial activity zhao et al 2018 and accelerating nutrient uptake by roots and promoting wheat seedling growth bhattarai et al 2008 in addition the soluble sugar and protein content in the leaves increased indicating that the increase in do concentration could enhance the water absorption capacity of plant cells munns 1993 and improve the osmotic imbalance caused by salt stress which could in turn improve the salt tolerance of crops when the do concentration in brackish water exceeded 20 mg l 1 the stimulating effect of ros generated during the micro nanobubble disappearing process bailly et al 2008 on wheat growth might play a major role the reactive oxygen concentration will increase with an increase in do treatment and it has obvious concentration effect liu et al 2016 when the ros is at a lower concentration e g do25 treatment it will lead to cell membrane lipid peroxidation montjean et al 2010 an increase in mda content and the destruction of cell membrane integrity and intracellular osmotic balance wang et al 2013a 2013b for example ros can oxidize and damage the protein in the cells reduce α amylase activity and inhibit seed germination laloi et al 2004 however when the ros concentration reaches a higher level e g do30 treatment it is possible to further induce the regulation and protection mechanisms of various antioxidant enzymes in crops georgiou et al 2006 simultaneously it may also induce an increase in the intracellular levels of osmotic regulation components including soluble sugar and protein contents therefore in the present study when the do concentration increased to 30 mg l 1 the antioxidant capacity of wheat seeds and seedlings was improved which significantly promoted the growth of wheat seedlings in the present study the oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration promoted the germination of wheat seeds and was conducive to the growth of wheat seedlings this can be explained by improving the effect of salt stress on soil and crop growth on the one hand compared with brackish water treatment although the influence of oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration on soil moisture and soil desalination was not obvious the combination of soil moisture and soil salt had a significant promoting effect on wheat growth wheat is a moderately salt tolerant crop and can grow normally in soil with a certain amount of salt resham et al 2017 in addition it was suggested that oxygenated treatment might mainly improve soil aeration bhattarai et al 2004 stimulate the activities of microorganisms zhao et al 2018 promote the transformation of nutrients and thus enhance the adaptability of wheat under salt stress therefore the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation could be improved by regulating the combination between soil water salt fertilizer and oxygen under the condition of moderate oxygen containing brackish water irrigation on the other hand the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation stimulated the osmotic regulation mechanism in the wheat seeds and seedlings in particular compared with ck the oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration significantly increased the activity of α amylase and the content of soluble protein and sugar in the leaves while significantly decreased the mda content and proline content during the growth of wheat seedlings the wheat seeds and seedlings could actively accumulate soluble protein and sugar to increase the concentration of cell fluid reduce the osmotic potential and improve the water absorption or retention capacity of cells so as to adapt to the salt stress environment according to the selected quantitative evaluation index compared with brackish water treatment the germination rate and soluble sugar content of moderately oxygenated brackish water significantly increased by 27 and 115 respectively studies indicated that these two indicators could represent the salt tolerance of crops to some extent lee and zhu 2010 gao et al 2018 therefore the oxygenation of brackish water promoted seed germination and seedling growth by enhancing the osmotic regulation mechanism in wheat thereby indirectly improving the effect of salt stress on crop growth caused by brackish water irrigation 5 conclusion the dissolved oxygen of 20 mg l 1 in brackish water could significantly promote the seed germination and growth of wheat seedlings this was mainly through regulating the soil moisture fertility and gas conditions enhancing the osmotic regulation mechanism in wheat and thus improving the effect of salt stress on crop growth caused by brackish water irrigation the germination rate and soluble sugar content were used as the quantitative evaluation index for seed germination and seeding growth respectively the present study only investigated the influence of oxygenated brackish water with specific salinity on wheat germination and seedling growth therefore the effects of oxygenated brackish water at different salinity levels during various wheat growth stages should be explored in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10253,the long term utilization of brackish water for irrigation in arid areas will decrease the oxygen content required for root growth leading to the deterioration of soil environment in the root zone and the inhibition of plant growth this study investigated the effects of oxygenated brackish water on the physiological characteristics of seed germination and seedling growth characteristics of spring wheat the dissolved oxygen do of 20 mg l 1 in brackish water had a significant promotion effect on the seed germination and seedling growth specifically at this do concentration of 20 mg l 1 the germination rate germination potential germination index vigor index and plant height on the 23rd day after sowing of wheat seeds were significantly higher than those of brackish water treatment ck furthermore compared with ck the α amylase activity in wheat seeds was significantly increased germination rate could be used as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under the condition of oxygenated brackish water irrigation according to the relationship between germination rate and do concentration the do concentration with the maximum germination rate was 19 mg l 1 during the wheat seedling growth period compared with ck the oxygenated brackish water with do concentration of 20 mg l 1 significantly increased the contents of soluble sugar and soluble protein in the leaves whereas significantly decreased the proline content soluble sugar content was selected as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seedling growth the electrical conductivity and the activities of alkaline phosphatase and nitrate reductase in the root zone soil were significantly influenced thus the oxygenation of brackish water with appropriate do concentration could effectively improve the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation these results provide an effective method for the safe and efficient utilization of brackish water keywords dissolved oxygen germination rate oxygenated brackish water physiological index wheat 1 introduction the imbalance between supply and demand of freshwater resources has led to water shortage in most countries of the world gilbert 2018 in particular it is important to address the shortage of freshwater resources in order to maintain food production new technical measures are being implemented to develop new water resources to alleviate the shortage of freshwater resources jiang 2009 for example the reasonable development of brackish water irrigation could effectively relieve the water pressure caused by the shortage of freshwater resources pérez pérez et al 2016 there are about 27 countries in the world which irrigate with brackish water for agriculture including israel ghermandi and minich 2017 china chen et al 2018a the united states ozturk et al 2018 italy cantore 2003 etc accounting for about 29 7 of the land area fig 1 short term irrigation with brackish water could increase crop yields jin et al 2016 and improve crop quality bustan et al 2005 however the long term utilization of brackish water irrigation would lead to the accumulation of salt in the root zone of crops rengasamy 2006 thereby reducing the crop yield and leading to secondary salinization of land cao et al 2016 studies have shown that high nacl concentration absorbed by root caused a great reduction of leaf area fresh and dry weight of leaves and roots and nitrate reductase activity of leaves thereby inhibiting the growth of sugar beet ghoulam et al 2002 furthermore high nacl concentration could inhibit the absorption of soil water by tomato roots romero aranda et al 2001 and then reduce the accumulation of minerals in tomato leaves and fruit yields han et al 2005 therefore it is very important to find more efficient brackish water treatment techniques to reduce the adverse effects of brackish water irrigation the oxygenated irrigation technique has achieved remarkable benefits in agricultural irrigation in recent years mechanical oxygenation is considered to be a common method of oxygenation in the oxygenated irrigation technique the devices employed for oxygenation mainly include oxygenation pump venturi bhattarai et al 2015 and micro nanofoamer systems sang et al 2018 compared with other oxygenation methods the micro nanobubble oxygenation method could significantly increase the dissolved oxygen concentration in irrigation water and improve the efficiency of oxygen transfer thereby enhancing the activity and physiological effects of irrigation water park et al 2010 moreover the micro nanobubble oxygenation device has the advantages of simplicity low energy consumption less investment eco friendliness and high efficiency studies have shown that oxygenated irrigation could improve the soil respiration bhattarai et al 2004 and promote the activities of soil microorganism zhao et al 2018 furthermore it accelerates the absorption and accumulation of nutrients by root and promotes plant growth bhattarai et al 2008 studies have shown that irrigation with oxygenated freshwater by a mazzei venturi could increase the nitrogen accumulation in crops chen et al 2018a 2018b the biomass of sweet corn lei et al 2016 and the total fresh weight of red cabbages tunc and sahin 2016 in addition bhattarai et al 2006 found that the oxygenated freshwater irrigation by a mazzei venturi could decrease the water stress index and increase the tomato yield water use efficiency and chlorophyll content of leaves in the application of oxygenated brackish water irrigation studies have shown that the infiltration of appropriate oxygenated brackish water by micro nanobubble rapid generation device increased the soil infiltration rate and accelerated the salt leaching sun et al 2019 however previous research into the oxygenated irrigation technique has mainly focused on the agricultural freshwater irrigation whereas there has limited research into the use of oxygenated brackish water for irrigation especially the study on the influence of brackish water irrigation with micro nanobubble oxygenation method on crop seedling growth moreover the crop seedling stage is very sensitive to salt stress chang et al 2019 therefore based on the theory of oxygenated freshwater irrigation our study combined the micro nanobubble oxygenation method with brackish water irrigation was to explore the characteristics of wheat seed germination and seedling growth which aimed to provide some theoretical basis for finding safer and more effective measures to improve the salt stress caused by brackish water irrigation on crop growth 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site and soil description the experiment was performed using surface 0 15 cm saline soil collected from fuping shaanxi

oxygenated brackish water on the wheat seed germination process 3 1 1 germination and physiological characteristics of wheat seeds when the do concentration in the brackish water increased from 8 to 10 mg l 1 ck to 30 mg 1 1 the germination indices germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight and vitality index and the α amylase activity almost increased initially and then decreased whereas the malondialdehyde content almost exhibited the opposite trend compared with ck the germination index and vitality index of wheat seeds were increased significantly by 30 and 49 under the do20 treatment respectively table 1 the daily germination rate was significantly higher under the do20 treatment fig 2 and the germination rate and germination potential increased by 30 and 27 respectively in addition compared with do20 the germination index root fresh weight and vitality index were inhibited under the do25 treatment which decreased by 27 17 and 40 respectively overall compared with do20 the seed germination was inhibited to a certain extent under the do25 treatment and was stopped after the fifth day under the do30 treatment the α amylase activity of seeds significantly increased by 11 15 and 18 under the do20 treatment respectively compared with the treatments of ck do25 and do30 table 2 compared with do25 the mda content was significantly reduced by 36 under the do20 treatment the α amylase activity of wheat seeds represented the maximum value under the do20 treatment indicating that the α amylase activity would be inhibited in wheat seeds when exceeded the optimum do concentration in brackish water 3 1 2 quantitative evaluation index for germinated wheat seeds according to the analysis based on pearson s correlation coefficients there were significant correlations between the germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight vitality index α amylase activity and mda content during seed germination table 3 the results showed that the germination rate was the most representative index according to the analysis where all the indicators were positively correlated with the germination rate except for the negative correlation between the mda content and germination rate and in terms of the experimental operability the determination of germination rate was more convenient and faster than the other indicators therefore the germination rate could be used as the quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under irrigation with oxygenated brackish water based on the relationship between the quantitative evaluation index germination rate and dissolved oxygen concentration table 1 the following quadratic formula was used for fitting formula 4 fig 3 the calculated do concentration when the germination rate was maximized was about 19 mg l 1 4 gr 0 091do2 3 422do 41 087 3 2 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings 3 2 1 plant height of wheat seedlings compared with ck the plant heights of wheat seedling on the 8th 13th 18th and 23rd days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 39 35 55 and 35 under the do20 treatment respectively fig 4 moreover the plant heights on the 8th 13th and 18th days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 46 27 and 32 under the do30 treatment respectively the plant heights on the 8th and 18th days after seed sowing of do20 were 16 and 38 significantly higher than do15 respectively compared with do25 the plant heights on the 13th 18th and 23rd days after seed sowing were significantly increased by 28 47 and 28 under the do20 treatment respectively therefore compared with other treatments do20 had a better promoting effect on wheat plant height 3 2 2 physiological indexes of wheat seedlings as the do concentration increased from ck to 30 mg l 1 the contents of soluble sugar and soluble protein in the wheat leaves increased initially and then decreased where the maximum value was obtained under the do20 treatment the proline content of the leaves decreased initially and then increased where the minimum value was obtained under the do20 treatment table 4 in addition the contents of soluble sugar and proline in leaves of do20 were significantly higher and lower than those of other treatments respectively compared with ck the soluble sugar content significantly increased by 115 and the proline content significantly decreased by 51 under the do20 treatment moreover the soluble protein content significantly increased by 13 and 12 under the do20 and do30 treatments respectively thus the do20 treatment could promote the growth of wheat seedling the growth and development of wheat seedlings was inhibited when the do concentration exceeded 20 mg l 1 3 2 3 quantitative evaluation index for the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the plant height and leaf physiological indexes soluble sugar soluble protein and proline were analyzed for the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the soluble sugar content of leaves changed significantly compared with ck so the soluble sugar content could be used as a quantitative index for evaluating the growth characteristics of wheat at the seedling stage under the irrigation with oxygenated brackish water 3 3 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the soil physicochemical properties in the seedling stage 3 3 1 soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity there was no significant difference in soil moisture distribution in the root zone of 0 10 cm depth fig 5 a compared with ck the soil moisture of do30 in the root zone at 10 15 cm depth significantly increased by 13 moreover the soil moisture of do20 do25 and do30 in the root zone at 15 20 cm depth significantly increased by 14 14 and 17 respectively in the present study the soil moisture was higher in the 10 20 cm deep root zone under the oxygenated brackish water irrigation with the increase of do concentration the standard deviations of soil moisture in the 0 20 cm depth root zone were 0 013 0 012 0 002 0 007 and 0 003 respectively the minimum appeared under the do20 treatment indicating that the uniform soil moisture distribution at the dissolved oxygen concentration of 20 mg l 1 was the best among the oxygenated treatments the soil electrical conductivity of do20 and do25 at 10 20 cm depth was significantly higher than that of ck while the soil electrical conductivity of do30 at 15 20 cm depth was significantly higher fig 5b the soil electrical conductivity of do30 at 0 5 cm depth was significantly higher than do15 in addition the average electrical conductivity under the treatments of ck do15 do20 do25 and do30 were 577 5 550 75 696 25 719 75 and 707 75 us cm 1 in the 0 20 cm soil layer as the main root zone depth respectively the remaining salt was leached below 20 cm of soil layer in general the electrical conductivity of the soil surface layer 0 5 cm was higher than that of the lower soil layer additionally approximate desalination rate and approximate salt accumulation rate were calculated with the formula conductivity of each treatment initial conductivity initial conductivity the negative value is defined as the approximate desalination rate and the positive value is defined as the approximate salt accumulation rate the results showed that the approximate desalination rate of oxygenated brackish water treatment could reach up to 21 whereas that of brackish water treatment was 18 3 3 2 activities of soil alkaline phosphatase and soil nitrate reductase compared with ck except for the do15 treatment different treatments of oxygenated brackish water irrigation had significant inhibitory effects on the soil alkaline phosphatase activity in the 0 20 cm depth root zone soil fig 6 a under the do15 treatment the soil alkaline phosphatase activity increased at the depth of 0 10 cm but decreased in the 10 20 cm soil layer compared with ck different treatments of oxygenated brackish water irrigation showed significant inhibition of soil nitrate reductase activity in the 0 15 cm deep root zone soil fig 6b do20 and do25 showed significant inhibition of nitrate reductase activity in the 15 20 cm deep root zone soil while do15 showed significant promotion 4 discussion 4 1 effects of oxygenated brackish water on wheat seed germination germination parameters i e germination rate germination potential germination index fresh root weight and vitality index and α amylase activity can reflect the germination capacity of seeds to a certain extent wen et al 2018 in the present study the germination parameters and α amylase activity of do20 treatment were significantly higher than those of ck indicating that the do20 treatment could promote seed germination in addition germination parameters can be used as the salt tolerance indicators for wheat seeds during germination sharma and yamdagni 1989 the higher germination parameters also suggested that the do20 treatment enhanced the resistance of wheat seeds to salt the mda content can indicate the degree of membrane peroxidation montjean et al 2010 mda can damage the integrity of cell membranes and disrupt the osmotic balance in cells wang et al 2013a 2013b thus inhibiting seed germination the mda content of wheat seeds in do20 were significantly lower than that in do25 which indicated that the do concentration of 20 mg l 1 improved the imbalanced permeation caused by the brackish water irrigation however when the do concentration in the brackish water increased from 8 to 10 mg l 1 ck to 30 mg 1 1 the germination indices and α amylase activity initially increased marginally and then decreased whereas the mda content exhibited the opposite trend oxygen is one of the main factors that affects the germination of seeds ahmed et al 2018 after germination their respiration increased and they need oxygen to maintain basic life activities on the one hand micro nanobubbles can increase the oxygen concentration li et al 2014 and the oxygen retention in the water takahashi 2009 which can increase the contact time of oxygen with seeds on the other hand micro nanobubbles can improve the efficiency of oxygen transfer han et al 2010 and reduce the resistance of seeds to oxygen absorption therefore when the concentration of dissolved oxygen was less than 20 mg l 1 the micro nanobubbles might mainly provide the oxygen needed to facilitate seed germination however reactive oxygen species ros are generated during the micro nanobubble disappearing process bailly et al 2008 and there is a positive correlation between the number of micro nanobubbles and ros concentration liu et al 2016 ros can cause membrane peroxidation or damage to proteins and other cell components laloi et al 2004 and inhibit seed germination if their concentration exceeds a certain level in the present study when the concentration of dissolved oxygen exceeded 20 mg l 1 the germination rate germination potential germination index root fresh weight vitality index germination rate and α amylase activity in the wheat seeds tended to decrease whereas the mda content exhibited an increasing trend studies have shown that the vitality index is highly sensitive to the salt damage sharma and yamdagni 1989 in the present study there was a highly significant positive correlation between the germination rate and vitality index which indicated that the germination rate could reflect seed germination under different do concentrations as well as the degree of salt damage to seeds therefore the germination rate was selected as a quantitative evaluation index for wheat seed germination under the condition of oxygenated brackish water irrigation 4 2 effects of oxygenated brackish water on the growth characteristics of wheat seedlings the do20 treatment significantly increased the plant height during the seedling stage at this concentration of oxygenation 20 mg l 1 brackish water irrigation could effectively improve the soil aeration bhattarai et al 2004 thereby enhancing the activities of soil microorganism zhao et al 2018 ultimately accelerating the nutrient absorption and promoting the plant growth bhattarai et al 2008 in addition the soluble sugar and protein contents in the wheat leaves of do20 were significantly higher than those of ck which indicated that brackish water irrigation could enhance the water absorption ability of cells munns 1993 by increasing the concentration of osmoregulation substance in the leaves the soluble protein content of the leaves can also reflect the capacity for salt resistance by plants gulen et al 2006 irrigation with brackish water can cause salt stress which affects the normal growth of wheat seedlings the soluble protein content of the wheat leaves in do20 was significantly higher than that in the ck which indicated that this treatment also improved the resistance of wheat seedlings to salt there was a positive correlation between the proline content and degree of salt stress javadi et al 2015 proline would accumulate in plants when plants were exposed to salt stress ghoulam et al 2002 in the present study the salinity of irrigated brackish water was uniform the lower proline content indicated that the plants were subjected to less salt stress the proline content of the wheat leaves in do20 was significantly lower than that in the ck which indicated that do20 could alleviate salt stress in wheat seedlings following irrigation with brackish water therefore the do20 treatment improved salt resistance in wheat seedlings by increasing osmoregulation substance concentration and water absorption wheat seedling growth was inhibited to some extent when the do concentration increased from 20 mg l 1 to 30 mg l 1 the maximum plant height and the chlorophyll soluble sugar and soluble protein contents as well as the minimum proline contents were found in the do20 treatment during the seedling stage which indicates that dissolved oxygen promoted the growth of crops in the optimal concentration range similar results were obtained by zheng et al 2007 who found that the optimum do concentration was 30 mg l 1 when tomatoes were cultured in a nutrient solution with do concentrations of 20 30 and 40 mg l 1 these different observations were possibly due to the differences in the cultivation environment crop type water quality and cultivation time 4 3 effects of oxygenated brackish water on soil moisture and salt distribution water is one of the four major factors related to soil fertility and it is strongly associated with plant growth and development it is important to study the salt content of salt stressed soils under irrigation with brackish water in order to prevent the secondary salinization of soil in the present study the soil moisture content in the 10 20 cm deep root zone with oxygenated brackish water irrigation was higher than that of ck on the one hand the oxygenated brackish water for irrigation could improve water use efficiency bhattarai et al 2006 on the other hand when the micro nanobubbles entered the soil they would rupture under pressure and might have an impact on the soil structure garwal et al 2011 thus the total number of soil pores might increase which increases the water preservation and soil moisture the soil electric conductivity was higher in the 0 5 cm deep root zone probably because the intense evaporation in the summer caused salt in the deeper soil to rise to the surface at the soil surface the soil water entered the atmosphere through evaporation but the salt remained on the surface of the soil additionally the inhibitory effect on crop growth in case of do30 might be due to the higher soil water content in the root zone which led to the high salt content carried with water and the salt accumulation in the root zone the effect of soil desalination in ck was better than that in do20 but wheat germination and seedling growth were inferior in the ck this is probably because crop growth was inhibited owing to the water stress munns 1993 the soil moisture content of the ck at 10 20 cm soil depth was lower than that of do20 treatment fig 5b 4 4 effects of oxygenated brackish water on soil enzyme activities in the seedling stage compared with ck the different irrigation treatments except for the do15 treatment had inhibitory effects on the alkaline phosphatase activities in the 0 20 cm deep soil root zone and on the nitrate reductase activities in the 0 15 cm deep soil root zone the soil alkaline phosphatase activities might have decreased owing to the increased soil moisture wei et al 2016 and thus these activities were consistent with the changes in soil moisture in addition it is likely that excessive ros generation caused by micro nanobubbles breakage could result in the oxidative damage to proteins and the inhibition of soil enzyme activities laloi et al 2004 these findings indicated that brackish water irrigation could promote the retention of soil moisture in the root zone during the wheat seedling stage but they inhibited the soil alkaline phosphatase activities to some extent nitrate reductase participates in the denitrification of nitrogen in the soil where no3 is converted into no2 lea et al 2006 thus more no3 is converted into no2 when the soil nitrate reductase activity is high plants mainly absorb nitrogen from the soil in the form of no3 miller et al 2007 thus lower soil nitrate reductase activities are more favorable for the absorption of no3 by plants in the present study compared with ck the oxygenated irrigation treatments with brackish water significantly inhibited the nitrate reductase activity in the 0 15 cm deep root zone of the soil therefore irrigation with oxygenated brackish water was beneficial for the uptake of no3 by plants 4 5 mechanisms that improve salt stress and regulate wheat seedling growth when the do concentration in brackish water was less than or equal to 20 mg l 1 micro nanobubbles mainly provided oxygen and improved the efficiency of oxygen transfer with an increase in the do concentration li et al 2014 this could reduce the resistance of seeds to oxygen absorption and the osmotic imbalance caused by salt stress which could increase the germination rate germination potential germination index fresh root weight vitality index and α amylase activity of wheat seeds and reduce the mda content for wheat seedlings irrigation with oxygenated brackish water could effectively improve soil aeration and promote soil respiration bhattarai et al 2004 thereby increasing soil microbial activity zhao et al 2018 and accelerating nutrient uptake by roots and promoting wheat seedling growth bhattarai et al 2008 in addition the soluble sugar and protein content in the leaves increased indicating that the increase in do concentration could enhance the water absorption capacity of plant cells munns 1993 and improve the osmotic imbalance caused by salt stress which could in turn improve the salt tolerance of crops when the do concentration in brackish water exceeded 20 mg l 1 the stimulating effect of ros generated during the micro nanobubble disappearing process bailly et al 2008 on wheat growth might play a major role the reactive oxygen concentration will increase with an increase in do treatment and it has obvious concentration effect liu et al 2016 when the ros is at a lower concentration e g do25 treatment it will lead to cell membrane lipid peroxidation montjean et al 2010 an increase in mda content and the destruction of cell membrane integrity and intracellular osmotic balance wang et al 2013a 2013b for example ros can oxidize and damage the protein in the cells reduce α amylase activity and inhibit seed germination laloi et al 2004 however when the ros concentration reaches a higher level e g do30 treatment it is possible to further induce the regulation and protection mechanisms of various antioxidant enzymes in crops georgiou et al 2006 simultaneously it may also induce an increase in the intracellular levels of osmotic regulation components including soluble sugar and protein contents therefore in the present study when the do concentration increased to 30 mg l 1 the antioxidant capacity of wheat seeds and seedlings was improved which significantly promoted the growth of wheat seedlings in the present study the oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration promoted the germination of wheat seeds and was conducive to the growth of wheat seedlings this can be explained by improving the effect of salt stress on soil and crop growth on the one hand compared with brackish water treatment although the influence of oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration on soil moisture and soil desalination was not obvious the combination of soil moisture and soil salt had a significant promoting effect on wheat growth wheat is a moderately salt tolerant crop and can grow normally in soil with a certain amount of salt resham et al 2017 in addition it was suggested that oxygenated treatment might mainly improve soil aeration bhattarai et al 2004 stimulate the activities of microorganisms zhao et al 2018 promote the transformation of nutrients and thus enhance the adaptability of wheat under salt stress therefore the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation could be improved by regulating the combination between soil water salt fertilizer and oxygen under the condition of moderate oxygen containing brackish water irrigation on the other hand the salt stress induced by brackish water irrigation stimulated the osmotic regulation mechanism in the wheat seeds and seedlings in particular compared with ck the oxygenated brackish water with moderate do concentration significantly increased the activity of α amylase and the content of soluble protein and sugar in the leaves while significantly decreased the mda content and proline content during the growth of wheat seedlings the wheat seeds and seedlings could actively accumulate soluble protein and sugar to increase the concentration of cell fluid reduce the osmotic potential and improve the water absorption or retention capacity of cells so as to adapt to the salt stress environment according to the selected quantitative evaluation index compared with brackish water treatment the germination rate and soluble sugar content of moderately oxygenated brackish water significantly increased by 27 and 115 respectively studies indicated that these two indicators could represent the salt tolerance of crops to some extent lee and zhu 2010 gao et al 2018 therefore the oxygenation of brackish water promoted seed germination and seedling growth by enhancing the osmotic regulation mechanism in wheat thereby indirectly improving the effect of salt stress on crop growth caused by brackish water irrigation 5 conclusion the dissolved oxygen of 20 mg l 1 in brackish water could significantly promote the seed germination and growth of wheat seedlings this was mainly through regulating the soil moisture fertility and gas conditions enhancing the osmotic regulation mechanism in wheat and thus improving the effect of salt stress on crop growth caused by brackish water irrigation the germination rate and soluble sugar content were used as the quantitative evaluation index for seed germination and seeding growth respectively the present study only investigated the influence of oxygenated brackish water with specific salinity on wheat germination and seedling growth therefore the effects of oxygenated brackish water at different salinity levels during various wheat growth stages should be explored in the future declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the

10254,solar desalination is one of the techniques to overcome the water scarcity in agriculture sector in the areas having saline water condensation irrigation is a combination of subsurface irrigation and solar water distillation in this study a condensation irrigation was developed in a greenhouse a reservoir humidifier was constructed in which saline water evaporated using an electric heating element the water vapor warmed and humidified the airflow above the saline water surface and this humid air was blown into a series of perforated pipes with the length of 2 m buried in the planting medium the vapor of humid air condensed on pipe walls and planting medium and supplied water requirement of basil plants the experiments were carried out without first experiment and with plastic coating on the planting medium second experiment the measurements showed that dry matter production in the first and second experiments were respectively 63 and 286 higher than that of the conventional irrigation furthermore the water vapor was transmitted by humidifier to the perforated pipes with the rate of 12 5 lit day of which 33 2 in the first experiment and 50 8 in the second experiment was condensed in the planting medium and pipes accordingly the average irrigation rate in the first and second experiments was 2 08 and 3 18 mm day respectively the average temperatures of the planting medium in the first and second experiments were 34 1 and 34 8 c respectively it was concluded that condensation irrigation was able to meet the basil water requirement in greenhouse cultivation and the temperature due to condensation did not limit the plant growth keywords desalination irrigation saline water solar energy 1 introduction the increasing population of the world and the industrial development have put more pressure on natural resources to supply needed water and energy sarkodie et al 2019 it is predicted that by the year 2050 the world s water resources will not be sufficient to supply food for the world s population nayar and lienhard v 2020 because the water requirements will be 40 higher than before nazari et al 2018 at present increasing the water demand especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world is forcing the farmers and producers of crops to use low quality water such as saline and wastewater to irrigate the crops these waters must be treated and desalinated prior to use so as not to damage the crop as well as the soil and the environment mashaly et al 2015 desalination in greenhouse cultivation can play a major role in the world s food supply because the water productivity in greenhouse plants is high zarzo et al 2013 common methods of desalination such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis are energy intensive li et al 2013 maia et al 2019 and lead to emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide sharon and reddy 2015 because for the production of 1000 ton desalinated water per day 10 000 tons oil per year is required gude 2016 the consumption of water obtained from desalination plants in the agricultural sector is not affordable and therefore only two percent of the water produced from these plans is consumed in this sector burn et al 2015 many countries such as iran located in the middle belt of the earth have a high potential for utilizing the solar energy so that the amount of radiation received in iran during the two months is equal to the total fossil fuel resources of this country bahrami and abbaszadeh 2013 gorjian et al 2013 there are also significant sources of saline water in these countries and therefore the conditions for using solar energy for desalination are very good gorjian and ghobadian 2015 solar distillation is a thermal method for removing contaminants from gross or saline water using solar energy solar distillation technology is divided into two categories passive direct solar distillation and active indirect solar distillation passive solar distillation technology uses direct solar energy while active solar distillation uses some external energy sources thermal collector energy storage photovoltaic panels hybrid system etc bait 2020 manchanda and kumar 2017 passive solar distillation is a simple low cost and environmental friendly method for freshwater production that is used all around the world tiwari and sahota 2017 condensation irrigation ci is actually a combination of a simple solar evaporator and a subsurface irrigation system the procedure is that saline water first enters the solar evaporator humidifier and evaporates with the absorption of solar energy the vapor generated makes the airflow above the saline water surface warm and humid this warm and humid air is transmitted to buried perforated pipes under the ground condensed by cooling of the water vapor and fresh water droplets are formed which irrigate the soil of the root zone through the pores of the pipe in addition some water vapor enters the soil which is condensed into liquid water and participates in irrigation chouaib and chaibi 2014 condensation irrigation also improves the soil aeration lindblom and nordell 2007 fig 1 shows a schematic view of condensation irrigation system for irrigating plants when the water vapor condenses inside the pipes and soil the latent heat from the condensation causes the pipe and soil around it to heat up and the condensation rate decreases in order to prevent the reduction in the condensation rate cold ambient air can be flowed through the pipes during the night to reduce the temperature again and increase the production rate of the fresh water lindblom and nordell 2006a when designing the condensation irrigation taking the length and spacing of the pipes and the soil type into account is important for example large spacing of the pipes will produce high fresh water per unit length of pipe however this will reduce the amount of water produced per unit area the condensation also decreases due to the cooling of the airflow through the pipe lindblom and nordell 2006b the plant s water requirement root depth and plant sensitivity to the root zone temperature should also be considered lindblom 2012 subsurface irrigation systems have many advantages over other irrigation methods including high irrigation efficiency reduction in evaporation from the planting medium and deep penetration removal of runoff and no interference of pipes and installation with agricultural operations ayars et al 2015 on the other hand the condensation irrigation has more advantages than other irrigation methods for example in these systems solar energy can be used to irrigate the plants with low quality water in addition in these systems the amount of water produced for irrigation will follow the plant s water requirement so that on sunny days when the plant s water requirement is high the humidifier can produce more water vapor lindblom 2012 design of condensation irrigation can be in such a way that intolerable temperatures for root growth occur near the wall of the pipes however in the area between two pipes the temperature is less than this therefore the plant root can easily grow in the space between the pipes but never enter the pipes it is important to note that roots entry into the pores or emitters of subsurface irrigation systems is one of the major problems of these systems camp 1998 meanwhile the condensation irrigation can naturally prevent this problem lindblom 2012 the idea of condensation irrigation was first declared by widegren 1986 gustafsson and lindblom 2001 calculated the irrigation rate by condensation irrigation as 4 6 mm day they also developed a pilot study without plants in the field and concluded that due to some assumptions the accuracy of calculations cannot be confirmed lindblom 2012 presented a mathematical model for condensation irrigation to simulate warm and humid airflow in unsaturated soil their results showed that if the temperature of saturated air inflow was 70 c for pipe spacing of 1 2 m and depth of 0 4 m the irrigation rate would be 3 44 mm day lindblom and nordell 2012 investigated the condensation irrigation in a small scale for example in an experiment that continued for 10 days without the plant the air inflow rate was 2 5 m s the temperature was 46 2 c and relative humidity was 71 with an irrigation rate of 1 16 mm day in tunisia chouaib and chaibi 2014 conducted a pilot study of condensation irrigation with the aim of feasibility of greenhouse cultivation of tomato they concluded that most of the condensation occurred at night and morning in addition the calculations of evapotranspiration showed that the maximum water requirement of tomato was 3 5 mm day and the condensation irrigation was able to supply 15 of the plant s water requirement okati et al 2016 numerically investigated the condensation irrigation equations and concluded that fresh water production could be 3 8 kg h using the numerical calculations okati et al 2018 calculated the condensation irrigation rate as 264 86 lit day with 8 perforated pipes with lengths of 50 m that was much higher than those obtained in previous studies in their calculations it was assumed that all water vapor condenses in the soil yousefi et al 2017 developed a condensation irrigation plan in a field with loamy soil but without plant their plan consisted of a 25 meter perforated pipe attached to a humidifier their results showed that the irrigation rate was 1 5 mm day in all previous studies condensation irrigation with the presence of plant was not practically investigated so far limited research has been done on condensation irrigation and the potential advantages and disadvantages of this irrigation method based on water desalination the main objective of this research is to investigate the condensation irrigation as a way to produce low cost and high quality water using solar energy and saline water sources for greenhouse cultivation as it is mentioned in previous studies condensation irrigation makes the soil or planting medium warmer and ventilates it one of this study aims is finding the effect of using condensation irrigation on crops growth in this study a small condensation irrigation plan was developed in a greenhouse and the possibility of greenhouse cultivation of basil was investigated the amount of fresh water produced and the amount of water vapor exiting the planting medium were also estimated and the temperature of the planting medium was monitored at different periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment a small greenhouse cultivation plan using condensation irrigation was created at the greenhouse of the university of tehran the experiments were carried out in two stages in which the second experiments were designed according to the results of the first experiments a schematic view of the studied condensation irrigation system is shown in fig 2 a photo of developed condensation irrigation system in the greenhouse is shown in fig 3 warm and humid airflow was generated by a humidifier that was 170 cm long 70 cm wide and 15 cm high and was made of galvanized iron the top of that was made of transparent plastic in the humidifier a thermostat element was installed to keep the water temperature in the humidifier at the desired temperature it should be noted however that the water temperature in the greenhouse can raise to the required level using such systems as solar water heater and there is no limitation the design of condensation irrigation should be such that maximum fresh water production is achieved however high temperature of the planting medium does not threaten the plant growth and for this purpose the humidifier thermostat was set at 45 c to allow the humid air to flow through the perforated pipes a blower was used to direct the ambient airflow into the humidifier to install the blower on one side of the humidifier a circular pore with the diameter of 40 mm was inserted and on the other side of the humidifier five pores with the diameter of 40 mm were created to connect with the perforated pipes in addition to keep the saline water depth to be constant an inlet of 6 mm in diameter was fitted to connect with the water depth regulator with a hose the water depth regulator consisted of a bucket equipped with a floater valve and a water tank and the volume of water reduced in the water tank is equal to the volume of water entering the humidifier for condensation irrigation the planting box was filled by planting medium of 200 cm long and 100 cm wide to 30 cm deep five perforated pipes with diameter of 40 mm were buried in the planting medium basils have shallow root depth so the distance from the center of the pipes and planting medium surface was 8 cm and each pipe was 200 cm in length these pipes were attached to the humidifier on one side to transfer the humid and warm airflow produced by the humidifier into the planting medium the distance between the buried pipes was 20 cm the end of the pipes was closed by a cap condensation irrigation has an appropriate performance on light and porous soils lindblom 2012 therefore the planting medium of the first experiment was a volumetric combination of one part sand one part cow manure and three parts compost in the second experiment the hydroponic planting medium was used which was a volumetric combination of one part coco peat and one part horticulture pumice in the first experiment the planting medium was uncoated and in the second experiment the planting medium was covered with a transparent plastic with the pores of 3 cm diameter for seed cultivation in the surface in addition to compare the plant growth and potential transpiration a number of pots were assigned as the control cultivars that were fully irrigated using conventional method the pots were placed in the same greenhouse which the condensation irrigation was tested in accordingly the effect of condensation irrigation and water and thermal stresses were compared with control treatments because all factors such as air temperature and humidity and the type of planting medium were similar in condensation irrigation and control pots and the only different factor was the use or not to use the condensation irrigation basil was selected as the studied plant 2 2 data measurements during the experiments the electrical conductivity of saline water in the humidifier was kept constant at 10 ds m 1 for this purpose 60 liters of water with an electrical conductivity of 10 ds m 1 was first prepared and poured into the humidifier the next day some water was evaporated and the water vapor was flowed to the buried pipes therefore in the next day distilled water was poured into the water tank as a result at the beginning of each day the water with an electrical conductivity of 10 ds m 1 was always existed in the humidifier the water was poured into the tank and the inlet valve to the humidifier was opened at 8 00 then by adjusting the heating element the water temperature reached 45 ᵒc the blower was then switched on to allow the warm and humid airflow to flow into the perforated pipes the system shut down every day at 18 00 so there was no cooling at nights in the first experiment on march 15 2019 and after five days when the system was in equilibrium and some moisture was stored in planting medium of the condensation irrigation basil transplant was cultivated in an area of 20 20 cm2 a basil transplant was planted in each of the control pots thus there were 50 basil plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation it should be noted that in order to stabilize the transplanted seedlings in planting medium of the condensation irrigation conventional irrigation with the amount of 40 ml was performed one time with high quality water for each transplants the second experiment was conducted in the same way except that the basil seed was sown instead of the basil transplant on may 16 2019 it is necessary to note that to ensure germination five seeds were planted in each control pot and each planting point in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and 20 ml of water was applied once for each of them after 15 days of seed cultivation the planting medium of the condensation irrigation and control pots were thinned and the tallest plant was left for further examination germination in the second experiment occurred on the sixth day after seed cultivation sowing and there was no difference between control pots and condensation irrigation the amount of water produced by the system was measured by measuring the moisture content in the planting medium of the condensation irrigation to measure the moisture content of the planting medium nine samples were taken from beginning middle and the end of planting medium of the condensation irrigation points 2 4 and 6 in fig 2 at depths of 4 12 and 20 cm at 18 00 every day and dry weight of the samples was also measured in both experiments at 16 00 every day the greenhouse temperature the water temperature temperature of the humid air inflow to the buried pipes and the planting medium temperature of the control pots and the six points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation was measured at the depth of 8 cm fig 2 also the temperature of above mentioned points of condensation irrigation were measured every two hours from 8 00 16 00 in the both experiments the composition of planting medium of control pots and condensation irrigation were similar for each of the experiments in order to measure the transpiration rate in control pots the field capacity mass moisture of the studied planting medium in the first and second experiments were measured 35 43 and 138 94 respectively due to the high capacity of coco peat in moisture adsorption then the planting medium was poured into control pots and the pots weight was recorded while their water content was in the field capacity after that the pots were weighed and irrigated every day until their water content reached the field capacity and the irrigation rate was recorded so the control pots were completely irrigated the planting medium of control pots was also covered to prevent evaporation in the first experiment the mean final wet weight of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and plants of three control pots was not significantly different based on the assumption that the plants with the same weight have the same transpiration rate de wit 1958 the mean total transpiration rate in the three control pots was considered as the mean total transpiration in the condensation irrigation in the second experiment the mean weight of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation was higher than that of control pots since production rate was linearly related to transpiration rate de wit 1958 therefore the regression equation for wet weight of plants in the control pots and their total transpiration was obtained and the total transpiration rate of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation was estimated every two days the height of all plants was measured in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and control pots and these measurements continued until harvesting day after harvesting the wet and dry weights of the plants were also measured table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the first and second experiments in this study it was tried to measure different components of water balance in the studied condensation irrigation system of all the water evaporated in the humidifier and entered into the perforated pipes as vapor some were condensed in the planting medium and the pipes which was the fresh water produced by the system and some exited as the water vapor from planting medium which was considered as the system s losses eq 1 from the water produced in the planting medium and pipes some water changed the water storage in the planting medium and some water consumed as transpiration rate eq 2 because of the subsurface irrigation it seems that surface evaporation can be neglected in order to determine the plant transpiration rates in the studied condensation irrigation the transpiration measured in control pots was used as described previously different components of water balance in the studied condensation irrigation system are presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 ew cw esw 2 cw t crop δ s in which ew is the saline water evaporated in the humidifier cw is the water produced in the planting medium and pipes esw is the water exited from the planting medium tcrop is transpiration by the plant and δs is the water storage changes in the planting medium the parameter δs in the studied condensation irrigation system were determined based on continuous measurement of water content in planting medium based on eq 2 and measured values of cw and ew the parameter esw was estimated during the plant growth period 3 results and discussion 3 1 the temperature of greenhouse saline water in humidifier humid air inflow into the pipes and planting medium the temperature of greenhouse saline water humid air inflow into the pipes and the six points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation measured in the first and second experiments fig 2 are shown in table 2 the measurements showed that the coverage of the planting medium in the second experiment increased the uniformity of the planting medium temperature at different locations in many plants soil temperatures up to 32 c stimulate root growth arai sanoh et al 2010 however high temperatures can lead to decrease respiration and the root growth rachmilevitch et al 2006 generally in both experiments the temperature of the planting medium at different points 1 6 is close to each other and their values are close to the values of the humid air inflow into the pipes measuring the planting medium temperature of control pots showed that their temperature was approximately equal to the greenhouse temperature the average temperature of the greenhouse saline water in humidifier humid air inflow into pipes and different points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation at different hours in the first and second experiments is shown in fig 4 as it can be seen in the graphs the temperature of planting medium in points 2 4 and 6 were less than points 1 3 and 5 in first hours of days but planting medium temperature became almost the same after 14 00 temperatures of different points of planting medium in the second experiment were more similar than the first experiment it seems that this similarity is because of more prosity and plastic surface cover in the second experiment 3 2 crop growth and production fig 5 shows the mean plant height changes during the growth period for the first and second experiments respectively in the first experiment basil transplants were planted so the first day of experiment was the transplanting day in the second experiment five basil seeds planted in each pots and planting points of condensation irrigation planting medium after 15 days of seed cultivation the young basil plants were thinned and the experiment started at 16th day after planting as can be seen the plants have more growth in condensation irrigation than that of the control pots mean plant height of plants on harvesting day in the condensation irrigation was 35 and 52 2 cm and in the control pots was 26 1 and 31 7 cm in the first and second experiments respectively fig 6 show the plants status in the harvest day in the first and second experiment fig 7 shows the mean wet and dry matter of plants in the condensation irrigation and control pots in the first and second experiments the standard deviations are also shown on the bars as shown in the first experiment the mean wet and dry matter in the condensation irrigation were respectively 32 and 63 higher than mean wet and dry matter of the control pots in the second experiment this difference was 223 and 286 respectively therefore crop production in the condensation irrigation was higher than that of the control pots which can be attributed to the good aeration and proper temperature of the planting medium in the studied condensation irrigation system table 2 it seems that in the second experiment the plants growth was more uniform than the first experiment this can be because of more uniform irrigation and temperature in the planting medium because of using plastic cover and more planting medium porosity in the second experiment previous studies have shown that injecting air into the planting medium had a positive effect on plant growth ben noah and friedman 2016 in addition appropriate planting medium temperature had a positive effect on root growth moisture adsorption nutrient uptake and plant growth onwuka 2018 obtained results presented in figs 5 to 7 show that the condensation irrigation system is capable to supply the basil water requirements and the temperature stress risk can be controlled in this system and there is no temperature stress for plant growth in the second experiment despite the presence of transparent porous coating on the planting medium the temperature of the planting medium at different points points 1 6 of fig 2 had a slight increase compared to those in the first experiment showing the porous coating on the planting medium did not cause a temperature stress for plant growth 3 3 water balance table 3 shows the total transpiration rates of plants in the condensation irrigation the total evaporated water in the humidifier the changes in the water content of the planting medium on the last day compared to the first day of measurements the total amount of water exited from the planting medium and the total freshwater produced in the planting medium and pipes for both experiments in the first experiment the total transpiration rate of the control pots was directly used to estimate the transpiration rate in the condensation irrigation system furthermore in the second experiment as mentioned before the total transpiration of the irrigated plants by the condensation irrigation was obtained using the regression equation of the total transpiration of the control plants relative to their wet matter eq 3 3 t 0 106 w t 1 1771 r 2 0 93 where t is the transpiration rate lit and wt is the wet matter of plants g during the first experiment 251 liters of saline water evaporated ew and entered into the perforated pipes as vapor of all this evaporated saline water 75 9 liter of water consumed by plant as transpiration tcrop and 7 45 liter of water stored in the planting medium δs so the total fresh water production cw is 83 35 liters and 167 65 liters of water exited as water vapor from planting medium esw so the average daily fresh water production wp is 4 17 liters and the average irrigation rate i is 2 08 mm day in the second experiment the total evaporated saline water ew was 301 liters from which 135 6 liters consumed by plants as transpiration tcrop 17 21 liters stored in the planting medium δs and 148 19 liters exited from planting medium esw so the total water production cw was 152 81 liters and the daily irrigation rate was 3 18 mm day in the first experiment about 33 2 of the total evaporated water in the humidifier was converted to fresh water and about 66 8 of the water evaporated exited from the planting medium as water vapor because of high water vapor loss from the planting medium in the second experiment condensation irrigation planting medium was covered with plastic for reducing water vapor exiting in the second experiment since the plastic coating of the planting medium slightly prevented vapor exiting about 50 8 of the evaporated water was converted to fresh water and the amount of water vapor exiting from the planting medium was 49 2 in fact plastic coating of the planting medium caused the reduction in the amount of water vapor exited from the planting medium in the second experiment and more fresh water was produced water balance was measured in the first experiment for 20 days and for the second experiment for 24 days therefore the amount of evaporated water in the second experiment was higher than that of the first experiment however the daily average amount of evaporated water in the humidifier in the first and second experiments were not highly different on average the irrigation rate in the condensation irrigation system in the first and second experiments were 2 08 mm day and 3 18 mm day respectively the high porosity of the planting medium in the condensation irrigation may result in better heat exchange and increase the fresh water production lindblom and nordell 2012 in the second experiment given the high porosity of coco peat and horticultural pumice the air and heat exchanges were easier than that of the first experiment on the other hand it seems that the plastic coating on the planting medium caused a large part of the condensation to occur below the plastic surface which probably increased the irrigation rate in the second experiment compared to the first experiment based on mathematical simulation lindblom 2012 calculated the irrigation rate of 3 44 mm day using the saturated inflow air temperature of 70 c to perforated pipes the pipes spacing of 1 2 m and the simulation period of 30 days in the physical model of lindblom and nordell 2012 one perforated pipe buried in container which was filled with sand the depth of the pipes was 22 5 cm and the width of the container was 40 cm eight tests were done with different humid airflow properties in one of this eight test for a three day experiment in which airflow with a relative humidity of 93 and a temperature of 39 7 c was blown into the perforated pipe the irrigation rate was 1 02 mm day the irrigation rate of the first present study was almost double that of the lindblom s study it seems that there are three reasons for difference between the results of the first present experiment and lindblom s physical model first the interval between pipes in this study was 20 cm but in lindblom s study the container width was 40 cm secondly in the first experiment because of using cow manure and compost the porosity of planting medium was more than lindblom s study more porosity can lead to more water production in condensation irrigation lindblom and nordell 2012 third in this study the perforated pipes were closed at the end but in lindblom s study the airflow continued to flow in a closed circle the soil surface in one of eight lindblom s study was covered with plastic film the relative humidity and temperature of airflow was 65 and 45 5 c during five day experiment the irrigation rate was 0 69 mm day in the second experiment of present study the planting medium was covered with plastic too but the irrigation rate was 3 18 mm day it seems there are some reasons which cause this difference in the second experiment the planting medium was covered by plastic with 50 pores each 3 cm in diameter therefore there was heat exchange with the surrounding and this fact increased the condensation and irrigation rate compared to lindblom and nordell 2012 research condensation is a heating phenomenon and by decreasing the planting medium temperature the amount of fresh water is increased the depth of perforated pipes in the present study was 8 cm and in lindblom s study was 22 5 cm it seems that the low depth of the pipes has improved heat exchange and increased the condensation in lindblum s research 100 sandy soil was used however in the second experiment of present study due to the use of organic matter and horticultural pumice in the planting medium heat exchange was better and irrigation rate was higher than that of the lindblum s research another point is that the end of the pipe was open in lindblum s research but in the present study the end of perforated pipes was closed and the airflow had to go through the planting medium and this is maybe the main reason of higher irrigation rate in this study compared to lindblum s research fig 8 shows the water content of the planting medium in the first and second experiments as can be observed at the beginning the transpiration rate was low and the moisture content of the planting medium was increased however as the plant s water requirement increased the plants consumed both the water produced by the condensation irrigation system and the water storage of the planting medium in other words in the first experiment the water content of the planting medium in the ninth day after transplanting was 30 7 and 14 days later reached 35 8 and then decreased to 33 7 on the day before harvesting in the second experiment the same trend was observed so that 15 days after planting the water content of the planting medium was 81 4 and 14 days later reached the maximum level of 120 and the water content of the planting medium reached 101 on the harvesting day the results of this study showed that the condensation irrigation is able to fully meet the plant s water requirement 4 conclusion to investigate the feasibility of greenhouse cultivation by condensation irrigation a small plan of condensation irrigation was developed in a greenhouse and tested twice in the first experiment the planting medium was uncoated and the volumetric composition of the planting medium was one part sand one part cow manure and three parts compost the results of the first experiment showed that height wet and dry matter of plants irrigated with condensation irrigation was 34 32 and 63 higher than those of control pots respectively the humidifier vaporized 251 liters of water over a 20 day period and transferred it to perforated pipes as warm and humid airflow 33 2 of which was converted into fresh water in the planting medium and pipe thereby the average amount of irrigation was 2 08 mm day planting medium temperature also reached 34 1 in the second experiment the planting medium was covered with a transparent plastic and some pores were created for the seed planting the volumetric composition of the planting medium was coco peat and horticultural pumice the results of the second experiment showed that height wet and dry matter of plants irrigated with condensation irrigation was respectively 65 223 and 286 more than those of control pots that were fully irrigated the humidifier vaporized 301 lit of water over a 24 day period and transferred it to the pipes as warm and humid airflow accordingly irrigation value was 3 18 mm day planting medium temperature reached 34 8 in general the results of these two experiments showed that condensation irrigation can meet the basil s water requirement in greenhouse cultivation it is suggested that the condensation irrigation will be further investigated for irrigation of such plants as tomato which is one of the main crops of greenhouse cultivation it is also recommended to construct a high precise physical model with the possibility of changes in different parameters and based on the results of the physical model a mathematical model is developed to estimate the irrigation rate funding this research was funded by iran national science

10254,solar desalination is one of the techniques to overcome the water scarcity in agriculture sector in the areas having saline water condensation irrigation is a combination of subsurface irrigation and solar water distillation in this study a condensation irrigation was developed in a greenhouse a reservoir humidifier was constructed in which saline water evaporated using an electric heating element the water vapor warmed and humidified the airflow above the saline water surface and this humid air was blown into a series of perforated pipes with the length of 2 m buried in the planting medium the vapor of humid air condensed on pipe walls and planting medium and supplied water requirement of basil plants the experiments were carried out without first experiment and with plastic coating on the planting medium second experiment the measurements showed that dry matter production in the first and second experiments were respectively 63 and 286 higher than that of the conventional irrigation furthermore the water vapor was transmitted by humidifier to the perforated pipes with the rate of 12 5 lit day of which 33 2 in the first experiment and 50 8 in the second experiment was condensed in the planting medium and pipes accordingly the average irrigation rate in the first and second experiments was 2 08 and 3 18 mm day respectively the average temperatures of the planting medium in the first and second experiments were 34 1 and 34 8 c respectively it was concluded that condensation irrigation was able to meet the basil water requirement in greenhouse cultivation and the temperature due to condensation did not limit the plant growth keywords desalination irrigation saline water solar energy 1 introduction the increasing population of the world and the industrial development have put more pressure on natural resources to supply needed water and energy sarkodie et al 2019 it is predicted that by the year 2050 the world s water resources will not be sufficient to supply food for the world s population nayar and lienhard v 2020 because the water requirements will be 40 higher than before nazari et al 2018 at present increasing the water demand especially in arid and semiarid regions of the world is forcing the farmers and producers of crops to use low quality water such as saline and wastewater to irrigate the crops these waters must be treated and desalinated prior to use so as not to damage the crop as well as the soil and the environment mashaly et al 2015 desalination in greenhouse cultivation can play a major role in the world s food supply because the water productivity in greenhouse plants is high zarzo et al 2013 common methods of desalination such as reverse osmosis and electrodialysis are energy intensive li et al 2013 maia et al 2019 and lead to emission of large amounts of carbon dioxide sharon and reddy 2015 because for the production of 1000 ton desalinated water per day 10 000 tons oil per year is required gude 2016 the consumption of water obtained from desalination plants in the agricultural sector is not affordable and therefore only two percent of the water produced from these plans is consumed in this sector burn et al 2015 many countries such as iran located in the middle belt of the earth have a high potential for utilizing the solar energy so that the amount of radiation received in iran during the two months is equal to the total fossil fuel resources of this country bahrami and abbaszadeh 2013 gorjian et al 2013 there are also significant sources of saline water in these countries and therefore the conditions for using solar energy for desalination are very good gorjian and ghobadian 2015 solar distillation is a thermal method for removing contaminants from gross or saline water using solar energy solar distillation technology is divided into two categories passive direct solar distillation and active indirect solar distillation passive solar distillation technology uses direct solar energy while active solar distillation uses some external energy sources thermal collector energy storage photovoltaic panels hybrid system etc bait 2020 manchanda and kumar 2017 passive solar distillation is a simple low cost and environmental friendly method for freshwater production that is used all around the world tiwari and sahota 2017 condensation irrigation ci is actually a combination of a simple solar evaporator and a subsurface irrigation system the procedure is that saline water first enters the solar evaporator humidifier and evaporates with the absorption of solar energy the vapor generated makes the airflow above the saline water surface warm and humid this warm and humid air is transmitted to buried perforated pipes under the ground condensed by cooling of the water vapor and fresh water droplets are formed which irrigate the soil of the root zone through the pores of the pipe in addition some water vapor enters the soil which is condensed into liquid water and participates in irrigation chouaib and chaibi 2014 condensation irrigation also improves the soil aeration lindblom and nordell 2007 fig 1 shows a schematic view of condensation irrigation system for irrigating plants when the water vapor condenses inside the pipes and soil the latent heat from the condensation causes the pipe and soil around it to heat up and the condensation rate decreases in order to prevent the reduction in the condensation rate cold ambient air can be flowed through the pipes during the night to reduce the temperature again and increase the production rate of the fresh water lindblom and nordell 2006a when designing the condensation irrigation taking the length and spacing of the pipes and the soil type into account is important for example large spacing of the pipes will produce high fresh water per unit length of pipe however this will reduce the amount of water produced per unit area the condensation also decreases due to the cooling of the airflow through the pipe lindblom and nordell 2006b the plant s water requirement root depth and plant sensitivity to the root zone temperature should also be considered lindblom 2012 subsurface irrigation systems have many advantages over other irrigation methods including high irrigation efficiency reduction in evaporation from the planting medium and deep penetration removal of runoff and no interference of pipes and installation with agricultural operations ayars et al 2015 on the other hand the condensation irrigation has more advantages than other irrigation methods for example in these systems solar energy can be used to irrigate the plants with low quality water in addition in these systems the amount of water produced for irrigation will follow the plant s water requirement so that on sunny days when the plant s water requirement is high the humidifier can produce more water vapor lindblom 2012 design of condensation irrigation can be in such a way that intolerable temperatures for root growth occur near the wall of the pipes however in the area between two pipes the temperature is less than this therefore the plant root can easily grow in the space between the pipes but never enter the pipes it is important to note that roots entry into the pores or emitters of subsurface irrigation systems is one of the major problems of these systems camp 1998 meanwhile the condensation irrigation can naturally prevent this problem lindblom 2012 the idea of condensation irrigation was first declared by widegren 1986 gustafsson and lindblom 2001 calculated the irrigation rate by condensation irrigation as 4 6 mm day they also developed a pilot study without plants in the field and concluded that due to some assumptions the accuracy of calculations cannot be confirmed lindblom 2012 presented a mathematical model for condensation irrigation to simulate warm and humid airflow in unsaturated soil their results showed that if the temperature of saturated air inflow was 70 c for pipe spacing of 1 2 m and depth of 0 4 m the irrigation rate would be 3 44 mm day lindblom and nordell 2012 investigated the condensation irrigation in a small scale for example in an experiment that continued for 10 days without the plant the air inflow rate was 2 5 m s the temperature was 46 2 c and relative humidity was 71 with an irrigation rate of 1 16 mm day in tunisia chouaib and chaibi 2014 conducted a pilot study of condensation irrigation with the aim of feasibility of greenhouse cultivation of tomato they concluded that most of the condensation occurred at night and morning in addition the calculations of evapotranspiration showed that the maximum water requirement of tomato was 3 5 mm day and the condensation irrigation was able to supply 15 of the plant s water requirement okati et al 2016 numerically investigated the condensation irrigation equations and concluded that fresh water production could be 3 8 kg h using the numerical calculations okati et al 2018 calculated the condensation irrigation rate as 264 86 lit day with 8 perforated pipes with lengths of 50 m that was much higher than those obtained in previous studies in their calculations it was assumed that all water vapor condenses in the soil yousefi et al 2017 developed a condensation irrigation plan in a field with loamy soil but without plant their plan consisted of a 25 meter perforated pipe attached to a humidifier their results showed that the irrigation rate was 1 5 mm day in all previous studies condensation irrigation with the presence of plant was not practically investigated so far limited research has been done on condensation irrigation and the potential advantages and disadvantages of this irrigation method based on water desalination the main objective of this research is to investigate the condensation irrigation as a way to produce low cost and high quality water using solar energy and saline water sources for greenhouse cultivation as it is mentioned in previous studies condensation irrigation makes the soil or planting medium warmer and ventilates it one of this study aims is finding the effect of using condensation irrigation on crops growth in this study a small condensation irrigation plan was developed in a greenhouse and the possibility of greenhouse cultivation of basil was investigated the amount of fresh water produced and the amount of water vapor exiting the planting medium were also estimated and the temperature of the planting medium was monitored at different periods 2 materials and methods 2 1 experiment a small greenhouse cultivation plan using condensation irrigation was created at the greenhouse of the university of tehran the experiments were carried out in two stages in which the second experiments were designed according to the results of the first experiments a schematic view of the studied condensation irrigation system is shown in fig 2 a photo of developed condensation irrigation system in the greenhouse is shown in fig 3 warm and humid airflow was generated by a humidifier that was 170 cm long 70 cm wide and 15 cm high and was made of galvanized iron the top of that was made of transparent plastic in the humidifier a thermostat element was installed to keep the water temperature in the humidifier at the desired temperature it should be noted however that the water temperature in the greenhouse can raise to the required level using such systems as solar water heater and there is no limitation the design of condensation irrigation should be such that maximum fresh water production is achieved however high temperature of the planting medium does not threaten the plant growth and for this purpose the humidifier thermostat was set at 45 c to allow the humid air to flow through the perforated pipes a blower was used to direct the ambient airflow into the humidifier to install the blower on one side of the humidifier a circular pore with the diameter of 40 mm was inserted and on the other side of the humidifier five pores with the diameter of 40 mm were created to connect with the perforated pipes in addition to keep the saline water depth to be constant an inlet of 6 mm in diameter was fitted to connect with the water depth regulator with a hose the water depth regulator consisted of a bucket equipped with a floater valve and a water tank and the volume of water reduced in the water tank is equal to the volume of water entering the humidifier for condensation irrigation the planting box was filled by planting medium of 200 cm long and 100 cm wide to 30 cm deep five perforated pipes with diameter of 40 mm were buried in the planting medium basils have shallow root depth so the distance from the center of the pipes and planting medium surface was 8 cm and each pipe was 200 cm in length these pipes were attached to the humidifier on one side to transfer the humid and warm airflow produced by the humidifier into the planting medium the distance between the buried pipes was 20 cm the end of the pipes was closed by a cap condensation irrigation has an appropriate performance on light and porous soils lindblom 2012 therefore the planting medium of the first experiment was a volumetric combination of one part sand one part cow manure and three parts compost in the second experiment the hydroponic planting medium was used which was a volumetric combination of one part coco peat and one part horticulture pumice in the first experiment the planting medium was uncoated and in the second experiment the planting medium was covered with a transparent plastic with the pores of 3 cm diameter for seed cultivation in the surface in addition to compare the plant growth and potential transpiration a number of pots were assigned as the control cultivars that were fully irrigated using conventional method the pots were placed in the same greenhouse which the condensation irrigation was tested in accordingly the effect of condensation irrigation and water and thermal stresses were compared with control treatments because all factors such as air temperature and humidity and the type of planting medium were similar in condensation irrigation and control pots and the only different factor was the use or not to use the condensation irrigation basil was selected as the studied plant 2 2 data measurements during the experiments the electrical conductivity of saline water in the humidifier was kept constant at 10 ds m 1 for this purpose 60 liters of water with an electrical conductivity of 10 ds m 1 was first prepared and poured into the humidifier the next day some water was evaporated and the water vapor was flowed to the buried pipes therefore in the next day distilled water was poured into the water tank as a result at the beginning of each day the water with an electrical conductivity of 10 ds m 1 was always existed in the humidifier the water was poured into the tank and the inlet valve to the humidifier was opened at 8 00 then by adjusting the heating element the water temperature reached 45 ᵒc the blower was then switched on to allow the warm and humid airflow to flow into the perforated pipes the system shut down every day at 18 00 so there was no cooling at nights in the first experiment on march 15 2019 and after five days when the system was in equilibrium and some moisture was stored in planting medium of the condensation irrigation basil transplant was cultivated in an area of 20 20 cm2 a basil transplant was planted in each of the control pots thus there were 50 basil plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation it should be noted that in order to stabilize the transplanted seedlings in planting medium of the condensation irrigation conventional irrigation with the amount of 40 ml was performed one time with high quality water for each transplants the second experiment was conducted in the same way except that the basil seed was sown instead of the basil transplant on may 16 2019 it is necessary to note that to ensure germination five seeds were planted in each control pot and each planting point in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and 20 ml of water was applied once for each of them after 15 days of seed cultivation the planting medium of the condensation irrigation and control pots were thinned and the tallest plant was left for further examination germination in the second experiment occurred on the sixth day after seed cultivation sowing and there was no difference between control pots and condensation irrigation the amount of water produced by the system was measured by measuring the moisture content in the planting medium of the condensation irrigation to measure the moisture content of the planting medium nine samples were taken from beginning middle and the end of planting medium of the condensation irrigation points 2 4 and 6 in fig 2 at depths of 4 12 and 20 cm at 18 00 every day and dry weight of the samples was also measured in both experiments at 16 00 every day the greenhouse temperature the water temperature temperature of the humid air inflow to the buried pipes and the planting medium temperature of the control pots and the six points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation was measured at the depth of 8 cm fig 2 also the temperature of above mentioned points of condensation irrigation were measured every two hours from 8 00 16 00 in the both experiments the composition of planting medium of control pots and condensation irrigation were similar for each of the experiments in order to measure the transpiration rate in control pots the field capacity mass moisture of the studied planting medium in the first and second experiments were measured 35 43 and 138 94 respectively due to the high capacity of coco peat in moisture adsorption then the planting medium was poured into control pots and the pots weight was recorded while their water content was in the field capacity after that the pots were weighed and irrigated every day until their water content reached the field capacity and the irrigation rate was recorded so the control pots were completely irrigated the planting medium of control pots was also covered to prevent evaporation in the first experiment the mean final wet weight of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and plants of three control pots was not significantly different based on the assumption that the plants with the same weight have the same transpiration rate de wit 1958 the mean total transpiration rate in the three control pots was considered as the mean total transpiration in the condensation irrigation in the second experiment the mean weight of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation was higher than that of control pots since production rate was linearly related to transpiration rate de wit 1958 therefore the regression equation for wet weight of plants in the control pots and their total transpiration was obtained and the total transpiration rate of the plants in planting medium of the condensation irrigation was estimated every two days the height of all plants was measured in planting medium of the condensation irrigation and control pots and these measurements continued until harvesting day after harvesting the wet and dry weights of the plants were also measured table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the first and second experiments in this study it was tried to measure different components of water balance in the studied condensation irrigation system of all the water evaporated in the humidifier and entered into the perforated pipes as vapor some were condensed in the planting medium and the pipes which was the fresh water produced by the system and some exited as the water vapor from planting medium which was considered as the system s losses eq 1 from the water produced in the planting medium and pipes some water changed the water storage in the planting medium and some water consumed as transpiration rate eq 2 because of the subsurface irrigation it seems that surface evaporation can be neglected in order to determine the plant transpiration rates in the studied condensation irrigation the transpiration measured in control pots was used as described previously different components of water balance in the studied condensation irrigation system are presented in eqs 1 and 2 1 ew cw esw 2 cw t crop δ s in which ew is the saline water evaporated in the humidifier cw is the water produced in the planting medium and pipes esw is the water exited from the planting medium tcrop is transpiration by the plant and δs is the water storage changes in the planting medium the parameter δs in the studied condensation irrigation system were determined based on continuous measurement of water content in planting medium based on eq 2 and measured values of cw and ew the parameter esw was estimated during the plant growth period 3 results and discussion 3 1 the temperature of greenhouse saline water in humidifier humid air inflow into the pipes and planting medium the temperature of greenhouse saline water humid air inflow into the pipes and the six points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation measured in the first and second experiments fig 2 are shown in table 2 the measurements showed that the coverage of the planting medium in the second experiment increased the uniformity of the planting medium temperature at different locations in many plants soil temperatures up to 32 c stimulate root growth arai sanoh et al 2010 however high temperatures can lead to decrease respiration and the root growth rachmilevitch et al 2006 generally in both experiments the temperature of the planting medium at different points 1 6 is close to each other and their values are close to the values of the humid air inflow into the pipes measuring the planting medium temperature of control pots showed that their temperature was approximately equal to the greenhouse temperature the average temperature of the greenhouse saline water in humidifier humid air inflow into pipes and different points of planting medium of the condensation irrigation at different hours in the first and second experiments is shown in fig 4 as it can be seen in the graphs the temperature of planting medium in points 2 4 and 6 were less than points 1 3 and 5 in first hours of days but planting medium temperature became almost the same after 14 00 temperatures of different points of planting medium in the second experiment were more similar than the first experiment it seems that this similarity is because of more prosity and plastic surface cover in the second experiment 3 2 crop growth and production fig 5 shows the mean plant height changes during the growth period for the first and second experiments respectively in the first experiment basil transplants were planted so the first day of experiment was the transplanting day in the second experiment five basil seeds planted in each pots and planting points of condensation irrigation planting medium after 15 days of seed cultivation the young basil plants were thinned and the experiment started at 16th day after planting as can be seen the plants have more growth in condensation irrigation than that of the control pots mean plant height of plants on harvesting day in the condensation irrigation was 35 and 52 2 cm and in the control pots was 26 1 and 31 7 cm in the first and second experiments respectively fig 6 show the plants status in the harvest day in the first and second experiment fig 7 shows the mean wet and dry matter of plants in the condensation irrigation and control pots in the first and second experiments the standard deviations are also shown on the bars as shown in the first experiment the mean wet and dry matter in the condensation irrigation were respectively 32 and 63 higher than mean wet and dry matter of the control pots in the second experiment this difference was 223 and 286 respectively therefore crop production in the condensation irrigation was higher than that of the control pots which can be attributed to the good aeration and proper temperature of the planting medium in the studied condensation irrigation system table 2 it seems that in the second experiment the plants growth was more uniform than the first experiment this can be because of more uniform irrigation and temperature in the planting medium because of using plastic cover and more planting medium porosity in the second experiment previous studies have shown that injecting air into the planting medium had a positive effect on plant growth ben noah and friedman 2016 in addition appropriate planting medium temperature had a positive effect on root growth moisture adsorption nutrient uptake and plant growth onwuka 2018 obtained results presented in figs 5 to 7 show that the condensation irrigation system is capable to supply the basil water requirements and the temperature stress risk can be controlled in this system and there is no temperature stress for plant growth in the second experiment despite the presence of transparent porous coating on the planting medium the temperature of the planting medium at different points points 1 6 of fig 2 had a slight increase compared to those in the first experiment showing the porous coating on the planting medium did not cause a temperature stress for plant growth 3 3 water balance table 3 shows the total transpiration rates of plants in the condensation irrigation the total evaporated water in the humidifier the changes in the water content of the planting medium on the last day compared to the first day of measurements the total amount of water exited from the planting medium and the total freshwater produced in the planting medium and pipes for both experiments in the first experiment the total transpiration rate of the control pots was directly used to estimate the transpiration rate in the condensation irrigation system furthermore in the second experiment as mentioned before the total transpiration of the irrigated plants by the condensation irrigation was obtained using the regression equation of the total transpiration of the control plants relative to their wet matter eq 3 3 t 0 106 w t 1 1771 r 2 0 93 where t is the transpiration rate lit and wt is the wet matter of plants g during the first experiment 251 liters of saline water evaporated ew and entered into the perforated pipes as vapor of all this evaporated saline water 75 9 liter of water consumed by plant as transpiration tcrop and 7 45 liter of water stored in the planting medium δs so the total fresh water production cw is 83 35 liters and 167 65 liters of water exited as water vapor from planting medium esw so the average daily fresh water production wp is 4 17 liters and the average irrigation rate i is 2 08 mm day in the second experiment the total evaporated saline water ew was 301 liters from which 135 6 liters consumed by plants as transpiration tcrop 17 21 liters stored in the planting medium δs and 148 19 liters exited from planting medium esw so the total water production cw was 152 81 liters and the daily irrigation rate was 3 18 mm day in the first experiment about 33 2 of the total evaporated water in the humidifier was converted to fresh water and about 66 8 of the water evaporated exited from the planting medium as water vapor because of high water vapor loss from the planting medium in the second experiment condensation irrigation planting medium was covered with plastic for reducing water vapor exiting in the second experiment since the plastic coating of the planting medium slightly prevented vapor exiting about 50 8 of the evaporated water was converted to fresh water and the amount of water vapor exiting from the planting medium was 49 2 in fact plastic coating of the planting medium caused the reduction in the amount of water vapor exited from the planting medium in the second experiment and more fresh water was produced water balance was measured in the first experiment for 20 days and for the second experiment for 24 days therefore the amount of evaporated water in the second experiment was higher than that of the first experiment however the daily average amount of evaporated water in the humidifier in the first and second experiments were not highly different on average the irrigation rate in the condensation irrigation system in the first and second experiments were 2 08 mm day and 3 18 mm day respectively the high porosity of the planting medium in the condensation irrigation may result in better heat exchange and increase the fresh water production lindblom and nordell 2012 in the second experiment given the high porosity of coco peat and horticultural pumice the air and heat exchanges were easier than that of the first experiment on the other hand it seems that the plastic coating on the planting medium caused a large part of the condensation to occur below the plastic surface which probably increased the irrigation rate in the second experiment compared to the first experiment based on mathematical simulation lindblom 2012 calculated the irrigation rate of 3 44 mm day using the saturated inflow air temperature of 70 c to perforated pipes the pipes spacing of 1 2 m and the simulation period of 30 days in the physical model of lindblom and nordell 2012 one perforated pipe buried in container which was filled with sand the depth of the pipes was 22 5 cm and the width of the container was 40 cm eight tests were done with different humid airflow properties in one of this eight test for a three day experiment in which airflow with a relative humidity of 93 and a temperature of 39 7 c was blown into the perforated pipe the irrigation rate was 1 02 mm day the irrigation rate of the first present study was almost double that of the lindblom s study it seems that there are three reasons for difference between the results of the first present experiment and lindblom s physical model first the interval between pipes in this study was 20 cm but in lindblom s study the container width was 40 cm secondly in the first experiment because of using cow manure and compost the porosity of planting medium was more than lindblom s study more porosity can lead to more water production in condensation irrigation lindblom and nordell 2012 third in this study the perforated pipes were closed at the end but in lindblom s study the airflow continued to flow in a closed circle the soil surface in one of eight lindblom s study was covered with plastic film the relative humidity and temperature of airflow was 65 and 45 5 c during five day experiment the irrigation rate was 0 69 mm day in the second experiment of present study the planting medium was covered with plastic too but the irrigation rate was 3 18 mm day it seems there are some reasons which cause this difference in the second experiment the planting medium was covered by plastic with 50 pores each 3 cm in diameter therefore there was heat exchange with the surrounding and this fact increased the condensation and irrigation rate compared to lindblom and nordell 2012 research condensation is a heating phenomenon and by decreasing the planting medium temperature the amount of fresh water is increased the depth of perforated pipes in the present study was 8 cm and in lindblom s study was 22 5 cm it seems that the low depth of the pipes has improved heat exchange and increased the condensation in lindblum s research 100 sandy soil was used however in the second experiment of present study due to the use of organic matter and horticultural pumice in the planting medium heat exchange was better and irrigation rate was higher than that of the lindblum s research another point is that the end of the pipe was open in lindblum s research but in the present study the end of perforated pipes was closed and the airflow had to go through the planting medium and this is maybe the main reason of higher irrigation rate in this study compared to lindblum s research fig 8 shows the water content of the planting medium in the first and second experiments as can be observed at the beginning the transpiration rate was low and the moisture content of the planting medium was increased however as the plant s water requirement increased the plants consumed both the water produced by the condensation irrigation system and the water storage of the planting medium in other words in the first experiment the water content of the planting medium in the ninth day after transplanting was 30 7 and 14 days later reached 35 8 and then decreased to 33 7 on the day before harvesting in the second experiment the same trend was observed so that 15 days after planting the water content of the planting medium was 81 4 and 14 days later reached the maximum level of 120 and the water content of the planting medium reached 101 on the harvesting day the results of this study showed that the condensation irrigation is able to fully meet the plant s water requirement 4 conclusion to investigate the feasibility of greenhouse cultivation by condensation irrigation a small plan of condensation irrigation was developed in a greenhouse and tested twice in the first experiment the planting medium was uncoated and the volumetric composition of the planting medium was one part sand one part cow manure and three parts compost the results of the first experiment showed that height wet and dry matter of plants irrigated with condensation irrigation was 34 32 and 63 higher than those of control pots respectively the humidifier vaporized 251 liters of water over a 20 day period and transferred it to perforated pipes as warm and humid airflow 33 2 of which was converted into fresh water in the planting medium and pipe thereby the average amount of irrigation was 2 08 mm day planting medium temperature also reached 34 1 in the second experiment the planting medium was covered with a transparent plastic and some pores were created for the seed planting the volumetric composition of the planting medium was coco peat and horticultural pumice the results of the second experiment showed that height wet and dry matter of plants irrigated with condensation irrigation was respectively 65 223 and 286 more than those of control pots that were fully irrigated the humidifier vaporized 301 lit of water over a 24 day period and transferred it to the pipes as warm and humid airflow accordingly irrigation value was 3 18 mm day planting medium temperature reached 34 8 in general the results of these two experiments showed that condensation irrigation can meet the basil s water requirement in greenhouse cultivation it is suggested that the condensation irrigation will be further investigated for irrigation of such plants as tomato which is one of the main crops of greenhouse cultivation it is also recommended to construct a high precise physical model with the possibility of changes in different parameters and based on the results of the physical model a mathematical model is developed to estimate the irrigation rate funding this research was funded by iran national science
