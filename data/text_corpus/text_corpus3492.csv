17460,lake warming induced by climate change has constituted a particular challenge for the restoration of eutrophic lakes however a quantitative analysis about impacts of lake warming on the internal nutrient cycling in eutrophic lakes is limited in this study monthly nutrient monitoring data set in 2015 2016 in eutrophic lake chaohu china revealed a regular seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration a process based water quality model was established to quantify contributions from internal loadings on seasonal nutrient variations and predict responses under climate change scenarios results indicated that internal nutrient loading was responsible for the intra annual variations of nutrient concentrations in the lake and the internal loadings fluctuated much more between different seasons than the external nutrient inputs we predicted that lake warming might probably result in stronger seasonal fluctuations of internal loading and create conditions beneficial for longer duration of cyanobacteria blooms in the year evidence derived from this study could help water managers to rethink the existing mitigation strategies in the restoration of eutrophic lakes and

the limitations of nutrient deng et al 2019 2020 wang et al 2019 such influence was indicated in the regular intra annual variations of nutrients in many eutrophic lakes such as lakes michigan

rarely analyzed several major issues have been raised during the attempts on lake restoration 1 what are roles of internal nutrient loadings in seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration and limitation in eutrophic lakes 2 how could lake warming affect internal nutrient cycling and plankton biomasses under climate change scenarios based on a nutrient monitoring data set in the eutrophic lake chaohu we had characterized the seasonal variations of nutrient concentrations and limitations a process based water quality model was established to interpret the coupling relations among

scenarios 2 materials and methods 2 1 lake description and field monitoring lake chaohu is located in the middle yangtze river basin china e 117o16 117o51 n 31o25 31o43 fig 1 a hefei is the most important industrial city in the watershed which contributes the majorities of nutrient discharges into the lake jiang and yuan 2015 huang et al 2018 it is a subtropical shallow eutrophic lake with a water area of 780 km2 an average depth of 2 8 m and a volume of 2 1 109 m3 huang et al 2018 the annual average air temperature is about 17 c and it fluctuated largely among different months with a peak in august above 34 c and a valley in january only 1 2 c cma 2015 2016 fig s1 along with the changes of air temperatures surface water temperatures in lake chaohu reached a peak value in august 33 c and a valley in february only 2 3 c fig s1 since the 1980s lake chaohu had experienced a quick increase in the surface water temperatures with a rate of 0 026 0 012 c per year li et al 2019 fig 1b as a shallow lake lake chaohu is generally well mixed and does not have large variations in mixing regimes throughout the year li et al 2019 since the 2000s a series of mitigation measures e g by improving the wastewater treatment reducing fertilizer usages have been carried out to reduce the external nutrient inputs into the lake however these effects have not been reflected in habs occurrence which had a continuous increase in coverage frequency and duration during 2000 2014 duan et al 2017 to identify the seasonal patterns of nutrients in the lake 6 water sampling sites located in the western middle and eastern sections of the lake were monitored at a monthly scale in 2015 and 2016 fig 1a the combined water quality data set includes surface water temperatures wt c secchi

previous studies wang et al 2016 li et al 2017 guan et al 2020 monthly changes of these variables in the lake were provided in fig s2 the details about water analytical methods and their method detection limits for each parameter were provided in supplementary text s1 with the same time 7 water sampling sites in the inflow rivers e g nanfei pai hangbu rivers and the outflow river e g yuxi river for the lake chaohu were investigated to estimate the external nutrient inputs into the lake and output from the lake fig 1a data about river runoffs was obtained from hydrological stations operated by ministry of water resources china mwr 2015 2016 the estimated external nutrient inputs into the lake and output from the lake were shown in fig s3 the meteorological data e g air temperature wind speeds in the lake chaohu was obtained from china meteorological administration data of which was applied in the subsequent hydrodynamic and water quality modeling in the lake 2 2 an overview about the modeling processes due to advantages in linking in lake biological and biochemical processes with water temperatures wu and xu 2011 kim et al 2017 the modeling for internal nutrient cycling and growth of plankton in lake chaohu was primarily performed by a 3 d hydrodynamic and water quality model environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 us epa 2007 by involving both physical and biological processes efdc was good at revealing the spatio temporal variations of nutrient concentration internal nutrient loading and biomasses of phytoplankton zhao et al 2020 torres bejarano et al 2020 the governing mass balance equation for each variable in the simulations could be expressed as follows 1 c t u c x v c y w c z x k x c x y k y c y z k z c z s c where c represents concentration of a certain water quality variable e g no3 n nh4 n biomasses of phytoplankton t represents the time step in simulations u v and w represent the velocity components in x y and z directions kx ky and kz represent the turbulent diffusivities in x y and z directions sc represents the biochemical transformations of nutrient species within the cell or inputs from other cells with the physical transports the major biochemical processes involved in the modeling were summarized in fig 1c and table s1 s2 in general reaction rates for internal processes were determined by water chemistry variables related with the reactions and water temperatures for instance the reaction rate for the nitrification was simulated according to the concentrations of do and nh4 n in the waters and temperatures the arrhenius equation was adopted to simulate the impacts of water temperatures on reaction atkins 1978 in the modeling biomass of phytoplankton was influenced by nutrient availability ambient light and water temperature huang et al 2018 the kinetic equation for this process could be expressed as follows 2 b x t p x b m x p r x b x z w s x b x w b x v where bx is biomass of different phytoplankton gc m3 t is the time step in the simulations d px is the production rate of phytoplankton 1 d depending on light intensity water temperature and nutrient

phytoplankton from other cells with physical transports gc d z is the water depth m v is the volume of the cell m3 table s2 impacts of water temperature on the growth rates of phytoplankton were simulated as follows chapra et al 2017 3 k g max t k g m a x e k 1 t t 1 2 i f t t 1 4 k g max t k g m a x i f t 1 t t 2 5 k g max t k g m a x e k 2 t t 2 2 i f t t 2 where k g max t represents the maximum growth rate 1 d at water temperatures of t c k 1 and k 2 are parameters which describe rates of decrease in the growth for temperatures below and above the optimal temperature t1 and t2 are the lower and upper temperatures defining ranges of plateau for the plankton growth c chapra et al 2017 the michaelis menten formula and half saturation constants are used to describe the nutrient limitations for the plankton growth which are now standards in the process based water quality models chapra et al 1997 2017 more details about the modeling procedures and values of selected parameters are provided in the supplementary text s2 in the simulation three phytoplankton groups were distinguished including green algae cyanobacteria and diatoms since non n2 fixing microcystis spp is dominant plankton species in the lake li et al 2020a only non n2 fixing cyanobacteria were considered in modeling different plankton species could behave differently in responses to the changes of water temperatures paerl and paul 2012 huisman et al 2018 ho and michalak 2020 diatoms generally prefer cooler waters and have higher growth and respiration rates chapra et al 2017 green algae grow slower than the diatoms but they could tolerate the higher water temperatures chapra et al 2017 compared with diatoms and green algae cyanobacteria have higher optimal water temperature for growth 25 c paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 in freshwaters green algae and diatoms are the beneficial groups which are important food sources for zooplankton and planktivorous fish cyanobacteria are rarely grazed gulati and demott 1997 by addressing these differences potential responses of different plankton e g growth respiration grazing to the changes of water temperatures in modeling were presented in fig 2 other major parameters and their values applied in the modeling were summarized in table s3 2 3 predictions under climate change scenarios to predict changes of surface water temperature in the lake chaohu and simulate responses in internal nutrient loadings and biomass of phytoplankton three climate change scenarios performed by miroc5 model of project cmip5 which represents a future with different extents of increases in the air temperatures during 2020 2050 were introduced esgf 2020 miroc5 was selected due to its good performance against the historical temperature records in this region liu et al 2019 yazd et al 2018 ma and zhu 2019 three representative concentration pathways rcps were considered which were rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these scenarios can represent an increase of 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 in the radiative forcing by 2100 relative to 1750 extracted data in 2016 was used for the comparisons with historical records in the study area and the data from 2020 to 2050 was applied for the future simulations linear scaling which was the simplest statistical downscaling method teutschbein and seibert 2012 ervinia et al 2020 was applied to correct the biases between the miroc5 outputs and observed meteorological data in the future simulation we assumed that riverine nutrient discharges into the lake remained unchanged which was the same as the input in 2016 potential changes of air and water temperatures in lake chaohu under different rcp scenarios were provided in fig s4 2 4 model s performance and validations similar as the previous studies huang et al 2018 gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 robustness of the model in the predictions was examined by calibration and validation processes and sensitivity analysis the monthly monitoring data collected from 6 water sampling sites in lake chaohu fig 1 were applied in calibrations and validations since the efdc contained both hydrodynamic and water quality simulations the performances of predicted results were examined for both modules performance on hydrodynamics was examined by the monthly measured water temperatures and water levels in the lake fig s5 performance on water quality predictions was examined by the monthly nutrient monitoring data and biomasses of phytoplankton see the section of results nutrient monitoring data in 2015 was used to calibrate the model and the measured data in 2016 was used to validate the model the root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination performed by pearson correlation between predicted results and field monitoring results were calculated arhonditsis et al 2007 li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 the morris method which was well known as the one step at a time method morris 1991 was applied for the sensitivity analysis for the key parameters in the modeling the parameters were set to be 90 or 110 of the original values cao et al 2004 kong et al 2014 while the other parameters remained constant the corresponding model outputs were recorded and the sensitivity coefficients were then calculated this method has been widely applied in the process based models to reveal the importance of parameters in modeling kong et al 2014 2018 results for the sensitivity analysis were provided in fig s6 3 results 3 1 nutrient monitoring results and seasonal pattern nutrient monitoring results displayed strong seasonal patterns in the lake chaohu although the amplitudes of fluctuations partly depend on nutrient types figs 3 and s2 in 2016 annual average tn and tp concentrations in lake chaohu were 1470 425 and 93 34 μg l respectively average and standard deviation which were higher than the grade iii limits in china 1000 μg l for tn and 50 μg l tp mee 2002 opposite to the seasonal variations of water temperatures the higher concentrations of n species occurred in spring and winter while lower values were observed in summer and autumn fig 3 for instance no3 n generally peaked in spring then it declined gradually during the may september period and reached the minimum in september by contrast the lake tp concentrations displayed an opposite trend driven by asynchronous seasonal alterations lake tn tp mass ratios had a strong seasonal pattern with the higher values in spring and winter 22 3 5 5 and lower values in autumn 10 7 2 4 fig 3 similar trends on nutrients have also been observed in other eutrophic lakes e g lakes taihu and dianchi tong et al 2019a china lakes mendota farrell et al 2020 and acton andersen et al 2020a the us lake hinge denmark andersen et al 2020b summarized in fig s7 although the amplitudes in the fluctuations could be varied probably due to differences in extents of eutrophication and local climate conditions wang et al 2019 farrell et al 2020 3 2 model evaluation and seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loading efdc model was applied to interpret the coupling relations among the nutrient concentrations external and internal loadings and biomass of phytoplankton in lake chaohu in general this model had well reproduced the seasonal peaks and valleys of nutrient and biomass of phytoplankton in the lake fig s2 the rmse and r values between the predicted and monitored concentrations were 53 μg l and 0 67 for tp p 0 01 n 144 626 μg l and 0 57 for no3 n p 0 01 n 144 264 μg l and 0 74 for nh4 n p 0 01 n 144 225 μg l and 0 55 for on p 0 01 n 144 4 1 μg l and 0 73 for chl a p 0 01 n 144 723 μg l and 0 77 for biomasses of phytoplankton p 0 01 n 144 fig 4 besides the simulated results had also well characterized the spatial variations of water quality in different sections within the lake with the worse water quality in western section and better water quality in the eastern section of lake chaohu fig s8 year based nutrient loadings for major environmental processes in the lake were provided in fig s9 in 2016 nh4 n no3 n on and tp loadings into the lake by inflow rivers were 4 7 2 7 3 5 and 0 5 gg respectively with the higher loadings in summer and lower loadings in winter fig s3 by contrast only 0 5 0 7 0 6 and 0 3 gg respectively of nh4 n no3 n on and tp were discharged out of the lake by the outflow rivers 83 and 40 of riverine n and p inputs were retained or removed within the lake which indicated importance of internal nutrient cycling in influencing lake nutrients tong et al 2019b qin et al 2020 phytoplankton played an important role in linking different internal processes in 2016 8 3 gg of inorganic n in water columns was adsorbed by phytoplankton 23 1 gg was further released into the water columns in the form of on after decay the majority of the released on were mineralized into nh4 n which was further transformed into no3 n by the nitrification fig s9 a comparison between the external and internal nutrient loadings the sum of all internal processes was provided in fig 5 although year based external nutrient loading may be approaching or even higher than the internal loading the amplitudes of seasonal fluctuations in the internal loadings were much larger for instance the maximum intra annual fluctuation defined as the maximum daily loading minus the minimum loading in the year for no3 n in the internal loading could be up to 55 3 mgn m3 day with a maximum of 27 5 mgn m3 day in april and a minimum of 27 8 mgn m3 day in july by contrast the maximum fluctuation for no3 n in the external loading was only 13 3 mgn m3 day these fluctuations in internal nutrient loadings could easily overlap synergistic effect or counteract the external nutrient loadings antagonistic effect differences in seasonal changes of the external and internal loadings might result in the differential impacts in affecting lake nutrient concentrations for instance for no3 n on and tp their seasonal variations were more related with the internal loadings r 0 57 p 0 01 n 24 for no3 n r 0 49 p 0 01 n 24 for on and r 0 31 p 0 01 n 24 for tp rather than the external loadings p 0 1 however the temporal variation of nh4 n in the lake was more related with the external loading r 0 36 p 0 01 n 24 than internal loading p 0 1 fig 6 loading for each of the major internal nutrient processes in the lake was provided in fig 7 as an indispensable process for the n removal denitrification rates in the lake ranged from 2 1 to 45 7 mg m3 day within the year with a peak in august 35 5 6 4 mg m3 day and a valley in february 2 8 0 2 mg m3 day these estimates were generally consistent with previous field monitoring results in lake chaohu 21 4 mgn m3 day annual average jiang et al 2016 and the other lakes table s4 such as a rate of 17 5 mgn m3 day in august but only 0 4 mgn m3 day in april in lake dianchi wu et al 2019 the internal nh4 n cycling might be strengthened with mineralization of on while intensified nitrification and uptake by phytoplankton might promote its removals from water columns for on the major route of input was through the decay of phytoplankton in summer and it was mainly removed by mineralization and settling into the sediment fig 7 lake sediment could play a dual role in regulating tp in water columns from april to november the sediment could act as a source for p in the waters with a release rate of 0 2 3 3 mgp m3 day from december to march sediment could act as a sink of p in waters with an adsorption rate of 0 1 0 7 mgp m3 day this trend was consistent with field measurement results in the lake chaohu which had a higher soluble reactive p release rate in summer and autumn 3 mgp m3 day than the other seasons yang et al 2020 3 3 response of internal nutrient loadings to climate change potential responses in internal nutrient loadings were predicted in lake chaohu under climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during 2020 2050 the surface air temperature in lake chaohu is predicted to increase at a rate of 0 04 0 06 c year fig s4a this rate is even higher than the increasing rates during 1980 2015 0 03 c year li et al 2019 increase of air temperatures would potentially lead to an increase of 0 037 0 051 c year in surface water temperatures fig s4b the modeling results indicated that if with lake warming the seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loadings might be intensified in the lake fig 8 in particular the maximum intra annual fluctuation of internal nutrient loadings in the year might be intensified largely for instance in 2050 the maximum fluctuation of internal nh4 n loadings 45 4 53 6 mg m3 day might increase by 2 5 20 1 relative to 2016 44 mg m3 day maximum fluctuation of internal on loadings 53 5 81 2 mg m3 day could increase by a percent of 8 3 64 4 in 2050 relative to 2016 50 mg m3 day with lake warming the time when the peak or valley of internal loadings occurred in the year might be shifted to an earlier date in 2016 the valley value for nh4 n loadings occurred in june while in 2050 the corresponding time could be shifted to late april similarly the peak for the internal no3 n loadings occurred in may in 2016 while it could be brought forward to april in 2050 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 impacts on phytoplankton biomass and community structure potential responses in the biomass of phytoplankton under scenarios with warmer surface waters were predicted in lake chaohu modeling results suggested that with lake warming durations of algal blooms in the year could be prolonged and the time when algae start to bloom would be shifted to an earlier date fig 9 for instance the cyanobacteria are predicted to start to bloom in middle april in 2050 which is brought forward by one month relative to 2016 as a consequence durations of algal blooms defined as the days with chl a above 5 μg l liu et al 2018 in the year would increase from 240 days in 2016 to 252 269 days in 2050 it should be noted that the impacts of warmer temperatures on algae could also depend on the detailed species cyanobacteria are predicted to be dominant among three species under the climate change scenarios for diatoms which prefer the lower water temperatures 20 c their biomasses might decrease largely by a percent of 4 0 21 9 in 2050 relative to 2016 fig 9 4 2 implication for restorations of eutrophic lakes in the future internal nutrient cycling has demonstrated to be a crucial factor in influencing the seasonal patterns of nutrient concentration and limitation in eutrophic lakes globally lurling et al 2016 farrell et al 2020 qin et al 2020 our modeling results indicated that with lake warming seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loadings may be strengthened which might impose stronger impacts in regulating the nutrient concentrations and limitations in the waters fig 8 compared with 2016 the seasonal variations of internal nutrient loadings might be intensified largely in 2050 in spring the internal no3 n loadings can be elevated by a percent of 2 8 14 7 in 2050 relative to 2016 while in summer the sediment p releases could be elevated by 27 5 36 5 with stronger internal loadings effects of external nutrient reductions to nutrient concentrations in the lake might be overlapped more easily this indicates that water quality improvement by solely relying on reductions of external nutrient inputs would less likely occur under climate change scenarios resultant seasonal fluctuations in water nutrient concentrations could make the nutrient control targets which are usually fixed throughout the year regardless of seasons impractical in water quality management tong et al 2019a for instance in china nutrient control target e g 1000 μg l for tn 50 μg l for tp is usually set in advance for eutrophic lakes and rivers for a certain period which constitutes an important part of the assessment from the senior government mee 2019 initial objective of this practice is to provide guidance for the reduction of external nutrient inputs into the lake however in reality these effects could be obscured by the strong seasonal variations of internal nutrient loadings as the case of lake chaohu has suggested in summer lake tp concentrations could be easily elevated to be over 100 μg l due to the intensified sediment releases while tn concentrations could be well controlled due to the intensified nitrification we propose that a more effective external nutrient reduction strategy should consider potential impacts from internal loadings to the lake a season specific nutrient reduction strategy which is focused on the n reductions in spring and p reductions in summer could be more effective in reducing lake nutrient concentrations than the strategy without addressing seasonal variations figure s10 the potential engineering measures to achieve the seasonal reductions of riverine nutrient input might include the applications of some effective p sorbents e g fe3o4 la oh 3 nanocomposite ahmed and lo 2020 fe0 fe3o4 2 facilitated by fe2 wan et al 2020 and modified zeolite yin et al 2018 and applications of the constructed wetlands with effective n removals tan et al 2020 however these measures still need to be systematically evaluated before the large scale application with climate changes stronger interactions between water temperatures nutrient concentration and growth of phytoplankton might be expected in the eutrophic lakes paerl and huisman 2008 rigosi et al 2014 deng et al 2020 lake warming could not only influence biomasses of plankton directly due to their adaptions in the physiologists jenny et al 2020 but also regulate the nutrient availability ready for uptakes of plankton chapra et al 2017 it is well acknowledged that the growth of plankton and their community structures in the waters could be largely influenced by nutrient concentrations derolez et al 2020 nutrient stoichiometry tong et al 2020 and relative abundances of different n species andersen et al 2020 li et al 2020b previous studies have attempted to elucidate the impacts of seasonal nutrient patterns on algae growth in lake taihu xu et al 2010 2015 hampel et al 2018 a eutrophic lake nearby lake chaohu by the standard nutrient addition bioassay experiments they found n could be a growth limiting factor for the proliferation and maintenance of toxic microcystis spp blooms in summer while p limitation can be more prevalent during initiations of the spring bloom although seasonal nutrient patterns in the lake could regulate the growth of plankton algal blooms could also create positive feedbacks on sediment biogeochemistry and internal nutrient loading researchers had reported that denitrification process could be altered with changes of water ph and do gao et al 2014 cottingham et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the nutrient uptakes by algae in lake chaohu might be low compared with other internal processes however it might aggravate nutrient limitations in certain period from april to september water nh4 n consumptions could be aggravated by the intensified nitrification and co occurrence of intensified algae uptake may aggravate the nh4 n limitations for the growth of plankton a more complete understanding about the causations between the internal nutrient loadings and growth of algae is necessary in the future it should be noted that due to the huge computing work and data requirements by the efdc the modeling was primarily based on a two year nutrient monitoring data in this study the coupling relationships between water temperatures and internal nutrient loadings may partly depend on the lake trophic states farrell et al 2020 nutrient conditions in lake chaohu are changing during the past decades duan et al 2017 tong et al 2019a therefore a longer historical monitoring data set may be beneficial to quantify the impacts of internal loading in the lake at different stages of eutrophication secondly in this study internal nutrient loading was estimated for the whole lake however at different specific locations within the lake the internal nutrient loadings e g nitrification denitrification may also vary due to differences in nutrient concentrations and hydrological conditions a full analysis addressing the spatial variations of internal loadings would be necessary thirdly lake warming is one of the most important but not the only impacts that will be induced by climate changes other impacts may include increasing nutrient inputs into lake by extreme rainfalls paerl and paul 2012 kalcic et al 2019 enhanced thermal stratification woolway and merchant 2019 and alteration in water volumes kalcic et al 2019 overall impacts from climate factors to the lakes are worth of being investigated in the future in summary scientific evidence is quite clear that the climate is changing and will continue to change in future kalcic et al 2019 woolway et al 2019 thus these potential changes in the lake chaohu revealed by this study will not be unique but also exist in other eutrophic lakes with lake warming internal nutrient loadings can be intensified and have a stronger impact on seasonal variations of lake nutrients these changes might be beneficial for the growth of cyanobacteria in the future evidence from this study may help water managers to rethink existing mitigation measures and emphasize potential interactions among lake warming eutrophication and internal nutrient loading in the lake restoration an effective nutrient reduction strategy needs a case specific diagnosis in which all aspects of intended mitigation measurements should be a part of system analysis compared with the history more

17460,lake warming induced by climate change has constituted a particular challenge for the restoration of eutrophic lakes however a quantitative analysis about impacts of lake warming on the internal nutrient cycling in eutrophic lakes is limited in this study monthly nutrient monitoring data set in 2015 2016 in eutrophic lake chaohu china revealed a regular seasonal pattern of nutrient concentration a process based water quality model was established to quantify contributions from internal loadings on seasonal nutrient variations and predict responses under climate change scenarios results indicated that internal nutrient loading was responsible for the intra annual variations of nutrient concentrations in the lake and the internal loadings fluctuated much more between different seasons than the external nutrient inputs we predicted that lake warming might probably result in stronger seasonal fluctuations of internal loading and create conditions beneficial for longer duration of cyanobacteria blooms in the year evidence derived from this study could help water managers to rethink the existing mitigation strategies in the restoration of eutrophic lakes and

temperature wind speeds in the lake chaohu was obtained from china meteorological administration data of which was applied in the subsequent hydrodynamic and water quality modeling in the lake 2 2 an overview about the modeling processes due to advantages in linking in lake biological and biochemical processes with water temperatures wu and xu 2011 kim et al 2017 the modeling for internal nutrient cycling and growth of plankton in lake chaohu was primarily performed by a 3 d hydrodynamic and water quality model environmental fluid dynamics code efdc hamrick 1992 us epa 2007 by involving both physical and biological processes efdc was good at revealing the spatio temporal variations of nutrient concentration internal nutrient loading and biomasses of phytoplankton zhao et al 2020 torres bejarano et al 2020 the governing mass balance equation for each variable in the simulations could be expressed as follows 1 c t u c x v c y w c z x k x c x y k y c y z k z c z s c where c represents concentration of a certain water quality variable e g no3 n nh4 n biomasses of phytoplankton t represents the time step in simulations u v and w represent the velocity components in x y and z directions kx ky and kz represent the turbulent diffusivities in x y and z directions sc represents the biochemical transformations of nutrient species within the cell or inputs from other cells with the physical transports the major biochemical processes involved in the modeling were summarized in fig 1c and table s1 s2 in general reaction rates for internal processes were determined by water chemistry variables related with the reactions and water temperatures for instance the reaction rate for the nitrification was simulated according to the concentrations of do and nh4 n in the waters and temperatures the arrhenius equation was adopted to simulate the impacts of water temperatures on reaction atkins 1978 in the modeling biomass of phytoplankton was influenced by nutrient availability ambient light and water temperature huang et al 2018 the kinetic equation for this process could be expressed as follows 2 b x t p x b m x p r x b x z w s x b x w b x v where bx is biomass of different phytoplankton gc m3 t is the time step in the simulations d px is the production rate of phytoplankton 1 d depending on light intensity water temperature and nutrient

the lower and upper temperatures defining ranges of plateau for the plankton growth c chapra et al 2017 the michaelis menten formula and half saturation constants are used to describe the nutrient limitations for the plankton growth which are now standards in the process based water quality models chapra et al 1997 2017 more details about the modeling procedures and values of selected parameters are provided in the supplementary text s2 in the simulation three phytoplankton groups were distinguished including green algae cyanobacteria and diatoms since non n2 fixing microcystis spp is dominant plankton species in the lake li et al 2020a only non n2 fixing cyanobacteria were considered in modeling different plankton species could behave differently in responses to the changes of water temperatures paerl and paul 2012 huisman et al 2018 ho and michalak 2020 diatoms generally prefer cooler waters and have higher growth and respiration rates chapra et al 2017 green algae grow slower than the diatoms but they could tolerate the higher water temperatures chapra et al 2017 compared with diatoms and green algae cyanobacteria have higher optimal water temperature for growth 25 c paerl and huisman 2008 paerl and otten 2013 in freshwaters green algae and diatoms are the beneficial groups which are important food sources for zooplankton and planktivorous fish cyanobacteria are rarely grazed gulati and demott 1997 by addressing these differences potential responses of different plankton e g growth respiration grazing to the changes of water temperatures in modeling were presented in fig 2 other major parameters and their values applied in the modeling were summarized in table s3 2 3 predictions under climate change scenarios to predict changes of surface water temperature in the lake chaohu and simulate responses in internal nutrient loadings and biomass of phytoplankton three climate change scenarios performed by miroc5 model of project cmip5 which represents a future with different extents of increases in the air temperatures during 2020 2050 were introduced esgf 2020 miroc5 was selected due to its good performance against the historical temperature records in this region liu et al 2019 yazd et al 2018 ma and zhu 2019 three representative concentration pathways rcps were considered which were rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 these scenarios can represent an increase of 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 in the radiative forcing by 2100 relative to 1750 extracted data in 2016 was used for the comparisons with historical records in the study area and the data from 2020 to 2050 was applied for the future simulations linear scaling which was the simplest statistical downscaling method teutschbein and seibert 2012 ervinia et al 2020 was applied to correct the biases between the miroc5 outputs and observed meteorological data in the future simulation we assumed that riverine nutrient discharges into the lake remained unchanged which was the same as the input in 2016 potential changes of air and water temperatures in lake chaohu under different rcp scenarios were provided in fig s4 2 4 model s performance and validations similar as the previous studies huang et al 2018 gao et al 2019 chen et al 2020 robustness of the model in the predictions was examined by calibration and validation processes and sensitivity analysis the monthly monitoring data collected from 6 water sampling sites in lake chaohu fig 1 were applied in calibrations and validations since the efdc contained both hydrodynamic and water quality simulations the performances of predicted results were examined for both modules performance on hydrodynamics was examined by the monthly measured water temperatures and water levels in the lake fig s5 performance on water quality predictions was examined by the monthly nutrient monitoring data and biomasses of phytoplankton see the section of results nutrient monitoring data in 2015 was used to calibrate the model and the measured data in 2016 was used to validate the model the root mean squared error rmse and coefficient of determination performed by pearson correlation between predicted results and field monitoring results were calculated arhonditsis et al 2007 li et al 2015 wu et al 2017 the morris method which was well known as the one step at a time method morris 1991 was applied for the sensitivity analysis for the key parameters in the modeling the parameters were set to be 90 or 110 of the original values cao et al 2004 kong et al 2014 while the other parameters remained constant the corresponding model outputs were recorded and the sensitivity coefficients were then calculated this method has been widely applied in the process based models to reveal the importance of parameters in modeling kong et al 2014 2018 results for the sensitivity analysis were provided in fig s6 3 results 3 1 nutrient monitoring results and seasonal pattern nutrient monitoring results displayed strong seasonal patterns in the lake chaohu although the amplitudes of fluctuations partly depend on nutrient types figs 3 and s2 in 2016 annual average tn and tp concentrations in lake chaohu were 1470 425 and 93 34 μg l respectively average and standard deviation which were higher than the grade iii limits in china 1000 μg l for tn and 50 μg l tp mee 2002 opposite to the seasonal variations of water temperatures the higher concentrations of n species occurred in spring and winter while lower values were observed in summer and autumn fig 3 for instance no3 n generally peaked in spring then it declined gradually during the may september period and reached the minimum in september by contrast the lake tp concentrations displayed an opposite trend driven by asynchronous seasonal alterations lake tn tp mass ratios had a strong seasonal pattern with the higher values in spring and winter 22 3 5 5 and lower values in autumn 10 7 2 4 fig 3 similar trends on nutrients have also been observed in other eutrophic lakes e g lakes taihu and dianchi tong et al 2019a china lakes mendota farrell et al 2020 and acton andersen et al 2020a the us lake hinge denmark andersen et al 2020b summarized in fig s7 although the amplitudes in the fluctuations could be varied probably due to differences in extents of eutrophication and local climate conditions wang et al 2019 farrell et al 2020 3 2 model evaluation and seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loading efdc model was applied to interpret the coupling relations among the nutrient concentrations external and internal loadings and biomass of phytoplankton in lake chaohu in general this model had well reproduced the seasonal peaks and valleys of nutrient and biomass of phytoplankton in the lake fig s2 the rmse and r values between the predicted and monitored concentrations were 53 μg l and 0 67 for tp p 0 01 n 144 626 μg l and 0 57 for no3 n p 0 01 n 144 264 μg l and 0 74 for nh4 n p 0 01 n 144 225 μg l and 0 55 for on p 0 01 n 144 4 1 μg l and 0 73 for chl a p 0 01 n 144 723 μg l and 0 77 for biomasses of phytoplankton p 0 01 n 144 fig 4 besides the simulated results had also well characterized the spatial variations of water quality in different sections within the lake with the worse water quality in western section and better water quality in the eastern section of lake chaohu fig s8 year based nutrient loadings for major environmental processes in the lake were provided in fig s9 in 2016 nh4 n no3 n on and tp loadings into the lake by inflow rivers were 4 7 2 7 3 5 and 0 5 gg respectively with the higher loadings in summer and lower loadings in winter fig s3 by contrast only 0 5 0 7 0 6 and 0 3 gg respectively of nh4 n no3 n on and tp were discharged out of the lake by the outflow rivers 83 and 40 of riverine n and p inputs were retained or removed within the lake which indicated importance of internal nutrient cycling in influencing lake nutrients tong et al 2019b qin et al 2020 phytoplankton played an important role in linking different internal processes in 2016 8 3 gg of inorganic n in water columns was adsorbed by phytoplankton 23 1 gg was further released into the water columns in the form of on after decay the majority of the released on were mineralized into nh4 n which was further transformed into no3 n by the nitrification fig s9 a comparison between the external and internal nutrient loadings the sum of all internal processes was provided in fig 5 although year based external nutrient loading may be approaching or even higher than the internal loading the amplitudes of seasonal fluctuations in the internal loadings were much larger for instance the maximum intra annual fluctuation defined as the maximum daily loading minus the minimum loading in the year for no3 n in the internal loading could be up to 55 3 mgn m3 day with a maximum of 27 5 mgn m3 day in april and a minimum of 27 8 mgn m3 day in july by contrast the maximum fluctuation for no3 n in the external loading was only 13 3 mgn m3 day these fluctuations in internal nutrient loadings could easily overlap synergistic effect or counteract the external nutrient loadings antagonistic effect differences in seasonal changes of the external and internal loadings might result in the differential impacts in affecting lake nutrient concentrations for instance for no3 n on and tp their seasonal variations were more related with the internal loadings r 0 57 p 0 01 n 24 for no3 n r 0 49 p 0 01 n 24 for on and r 0 31 p 0 01 n 24 for tp rather than the external loadings p 0 1 however the temporal variation of nh4 n in the lake was more related with the external loading r 0 36 p 0 01 n 24 than internal loading p 0 1 fig 6 loading for each of the major internal nutrient processes in the lake was provided in fig 7 as an indispensable process for the n removal denitrification rates in the lake ranged from 2 1 to 45 7 mg m3 day within the year with a peak in august 35 5 6 4 mg m3 day and a valley in february 2 8 0 2 mg m3 day these estimates were generally consistent with previous field monitoring results in lake chaohu 21 4 mgn m3 day annual average jiang et al 2016 and the other lakes table s4 such as a rate of 17 5 mgn m3 day in august but only 0 4 mgn m3 day in april in lake dianchi wu et al 2019 the internal nh4 n cycling might be strengthened with mineralization of on while intensified nitrification and uptake by phytoplankton might promote its removals from water columns for on the major route of input was through the decay of phytoplankton in summer and it was mainly removed by mineralization and settling into the sediment fig 7 lake sediment could play a dual role in regulating tp in water columns from april to november the sediment could act as a source for p in the waters with a release rate of 0 2 3 3 mgp m3 day from december to march sediment could act as a sink of p in waters with an adsorption rate of 0 1 0 7 mgp m3 day this trend was consistent with field measurement results in the lake chaohu which had a higher soluble reactive p release rate in summer and autumn 3 mgp m3 day than the other seasons yang et al 2020 3 3 response of internal nutrient loadings to climate change potential responses in internal nutrient loadings were predicted in lake chaohu under climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 during 2020 2050 the surface air temperature in lake chaohu is predicted to increase at a rate of 0 04 0 06 c year fig s4a this rate is even higher than the increasing rates during 1980 2015 0 03 c year li et al 2019 increase of air temperatures would potentially lead to an increase of 0 037 0 051 c year in surface water temperatures fig s4b the modeling results indicated that if with lake warming the seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loadings might be intensified in the lake fig 8 in particular the maximum intra annual fluctuation of internal nutrient loadings in the year might be intensified largely for instance in 2050 the maximum fluctuation of internal nh4 n loadings 45 4 53 6 mg m3 day might increase by 2 5 20 1 relative to 2016 44 mg m3 day maximum fluctuation of internal on loadings 53 5 81 2 mg m3 day could increase by a percent of 8 3 64 4 in 2050 relative to 2016 50 mg m3 day with lake warming the time when the peak or valley of internal loadings occurred in the year might be shifted to an earlier date in 2016 the valley value for nh4 n loadings occurred in june while in 2050 the corresponding time could be shifted to late april similarly the peak for the internal no3 n loadings occurred in may in 2016 while it could be brought forward to april in 2050 fig 8 4 discussion 4 1 impacts on phytoplankton biomass and community structure potential responses in the biomass of phytoplankton under scenarios with warmer surface waters were predicted in lake chaohu modeling results suggested that with lake warming durations of algal blooms in the year could be prolonged and the time when algae start to bloom would be shifted to an earlier date fig 9 for instance the cyanobacteria are predicted to start to bloom in middle april in 2050 which is brought forward by one month relative to 2016 as a consequence durations of algal blooms defined as the days with chl a above 5 μg l liu et al 2018 in the year would increase from 240 days in 2016 to 252 269 days in 2050 it should be noted that the impacts of warmer temperatures on algae could also depend on the detailed species cyanobacteria are predicted to be dominant among three species under the climate change scenarios for diatoms which prefer the lower water temperatures 20 c their biomasses might decrease largely by a percent of 4 0 21 9 in 2050 relative to 2016 fig 9 4 2 implication for restorations of eutrophic lakes in the future internal nutrient cycling has demonstrated to be a crucial factor in influencing the seasonal patterns of nutrient concentration and limitation in eutrophic lakes globally lurling et al 2016 farrell et al 2020 qin et al 2020 our modeling results indicated that with lake warming seasonal fluctuations of internal nutrient loadings may be strengthened which might impose stronger impacts in regulating the nutrient concentrations and limitations in the waters fig 8 compared with 2016 the seasonal variations of internal nutrient loadings might be intensified largely in 2050 in spring the internal no3 n loadings can be elevated by a percent of 2 8 14 7 in 2050 relative to 2016 while in summer the sediment p releases could be elevated by 27 5 36 5 with stronger internal loadings effects of external nutrient reductions to nutrient concentrations in the lake might be overlapped more easily this indicates that water quality improvement by solely relying on reductions of external nutrient inputs would less likely occur under climate change scenarios resultant seasonal fluctuations in water nutrient concentrations could make the nutrient control targets which are usually fixed throughout the year regardless of seasons impractical in water quality management tong et al 2019a for instance in china nutrient control target e g 1000 μg l for tn 50 μg l for tp is usually set in advance for eutrophic lakes and rivers for a certain period which constitutes an important part of the assessment from the senior government mee 2019 initial objective of this practice is to provide guidance for the reduction of external nutrient inputs into the lake however in reality these effects could be obscured by the strong seasonal variations of internal nutrient loadings as the case of lake chaohu has suggested in summer lake tp concentrations could be easily elevated to be over 100 μg l due to the intensified sediment releases while tn concentrations could be well controlled due to the intensified nitrification we propose that a more effective external nutrient reduction strategy should consider potential impacts from internal loadings to the lake a season specific nutrient reduction strategy which is focused on the n reductions in spring and p reductions in summer could be more effective in reducing lake nutrient concentrations than the strategy without addressing seasonal variations figure s10 the potential engineering measures to achieve the seasonal reductions of riverine nutrient input might include the applications of some effective p sorbents e g fe3o4 la oh 3 nanocomposite ahmed and lo 2020 fe0 fe3o4 2 facilitated by fe2 wan et al 2020 and modified zeolite yin et al 2018 and applications of the constructed wetlands with effective n removals tan et al 2020 however these measures still need to be systematically evaluated before the large scale application with climate changes stronger interactions between water temperatures nutrient concentration and growth of phytoplankton might be expected in the eutrophic lakes paerl and huisman 2008 rigosi et al 2014 deng et al 2020 lake warming could not only influence biomasses of plankton directly due to their adaptions in the physiologists jenny et al 2020 but also regulate the nutrient availability ready for uptakes of plankton chapra et al 2017 it is well acknowledged that the growth of plankton and their community structures in the waters could be largely influenced by nutrient concentrations derolez et al 2020 nutrient stoichiometry tong et al 2020 and relative abundances of different n species andersen et al 2020 li et al 2020b previous studies have attempted to elucidate the impacts of seasonal nutrient patterns on algae growth in lake taihu xu et al 2010 2015 hampel et al 2018 a eutrophic lake nearby lake chaohu by the standard nutrient addition bioassay experiments they found n could be a growth limiting factor for the proliferation and maintenance of toxic microcystis spp blooms in summer while p limitation can be more prevalent during initiations of the spring bloom although seasonal nutrient patterns in the lake could regulate the growth of plankton algal blooms could also create positive feedbacks on sediment biogeochemistry and internal nutrient loading researchers had reported that denitrification process could be altered with changes of water ph and do gao et al 2014 cottingham et al 2015 as shown in fig 7 the nutrient uptakes by algae in lake chaohu might be low compared with other internal processes however it might aggravate nutrient limitations in certain period from april to september water nh4 n consumptions could be aggravated by the intensified nitrification and co occurrence of intensified algae uptake may aggravate the nh4 n limitations for the growth of plankton a more complete understanding about the causations between the internal nutrient loadings and growth of algae is necessary in the future it should be noted that due to the huge computing work and data requirements by the efdc the modeling was primarily based on a two year nutrient monitoring data in this study the coupling relationships between water temperatures and internal nutrient loadings may partly depend on the lake trophic states farrell et al 2020 nutrient conditions in lake chaohu are changing during the past decades duan et al 2017 tong et al 2019a therefore a longer historical monitoring data set may be beneficial to quantify the impacts of internal loading in the lake at different stages of eutrophication secondly in this study internal nutrient loading was estimated for the whole lake however at different specific locations within the lake the internal nutrient loadings e g nitrification denitrification may also vary due to differences in nutrient concentrations and hydrological conditions a full analysis addressing the spatial variations of internal loadings would be necessary thirdly lake warming is one of the most important but not the only impacts that will be induced by climate changes other impacts may include increasing nutrient inputs into lake by extreme rainfalls paerl and paul 2012 kalcic et al 2019 enhanced thermal stratification woolway and merchant 2019 and alteration in water volumes kalcic et al 2019 overall impacts from climate factors to the lakes are worth of being investigated in the future in summary scientific evidence is quite clear that the climate is changing and will continue to change in future kalcic et al 2019 woolway et al 2019 thus these potential changes in the lake chaohu revealed by this study will not be unique but also exist in other eutrophic lakes with lake warming internal nutrient loadings can be intensified and have a stronger impact on seasonal variations of lake nutrients these changes might be beneficial for the growth of cyanobacteria in the future evidence from this study may help water managers to rethink existing mitigation measures and emphasize potential interactions among lake warming eutrophication and internal nutrient loading in the lake restoration an effective nutrient reduction strategy needs a case specific diagnosis in which all aspects of intended mitigation measurements should be a part of system analysis compared with the history more adaptions in mitigation strategies on the restoration of eutrophic lakes are necessary to adapt to a warmer world declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

17461,coastal seawater constitutes an important ecosystem receiving inputs of organic micropollutants omps such as sulfa antibiotics from land based sources or mariculture activities it is necessary to investigate photodegradation of omps in coastal seawaters for assessing their environmental fate and risks however effects of coastal seawater dissolved organic matter s dom on omps photodegradation are largely unknown given that chemical compositions of s dom are different from those of freshwater dom herein photochemical characteristics of s dom extracted from dalian coastal seawaters were investigated by simulating photochemical experiment adopting sulfachloropyridazine as a case results show that s dom accelerates the photodegradation mainly through excited triplet state dom 3dom with an apparent rate constant 4 43 108 m 1 s 1 ten folds of that of freshwater dom which is mainly due to much lower phenol contents detected in the s dom 0 022 mg gallic acid mg c 1 the s dom impacted by mariculture can photogenerate more high energy 3dom than those less impacted by mariculture further contributing to the high 3dom reactivity the study shows that to accurately predict photolytic persistence of omps in field water bodies it is of significance to determine the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps using dom extracted from relevant water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords triplet state photosensitization photodegradation sulfachloropyridazine coastal seawater dissolved organic matter phenolic antioxidants 1 introduction due to riverine transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities coastal seawaters in many regions of the world have become a pivotal sink of organic micropollutants omps thibault et al 2019 the environmental capacity and ecological risks of omps are closely related with their fate in coastal seawaters photodegradation is an important pathway for removing omps in seawaters wang et al 2018 yan and song 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 being rich in biomass and accepting mariculture discharges wang et al 2020b coastal seawaters are abundant in dissolved organic matter dom garcía flor et al 2005 which can generate a variety of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris to induce indirect photodegradation of omps challenged by extraction techniques for dom from seawaters many previous studies mainly employed freshwater dom as surrogates of seawater dom s dom in photochemistry studies liu et al 2018 muller et al 2019 parker and mitch 2016 as a result environmental photochemical properties of s dom and its effects on photodegradation of omps in coastal waters are largely unknown the most important ppri related with indirect photodegradation of omps is excited triplet state of dom 3dom formed from photoexcitation followed by intersystem crossing of chromophores in dom the steady state concentrations of 3dom 3dom ss are 10 14 10 12 m in sunlit waters mcneill and canonica 2016 enabling 3dom to undergo various photochemical processes 3dom is not only a main source of other ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals ho boreen et al 2008 gan et al 2008 latch and mcneill 2006 vione and sozzaro 2019 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b but also directly reacts with omps through photosensitization reactions i e energy transfer or oxidation electron transfer or other related mechanisms coble 2007 mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 accordingly acceleration effects of dom on photodegradation of omps can be evaluated by the ability of 3dom to produce ppris and the reactivity of 3dom towards omps for freshwater dom 3dom generated from autochthonous pony lake fulvic acid plfa effluent organic matter efom or wastewater organic matter wwom usually exhibits higher photochemical reactivity towards omps than that from allochthonous sources ryan et al 2011 zhou et al 2019a guerard et al 2009a guerard et al 2009b this is because that in general the autochthonous dom derived from organisms can photogenerate more high energy 3dom hi 3dom than the allochthonous dom moor et al 2019 zhou et al 2019a except for a special case that the lake rouen autochthonous dom mainly from precipitations of rain and snow photogenerated 3dom with low reactivity de laurentiis et al 2012 as excited triplet state energy e t of hi 3dom is defined as 250 kj mol 1 zepp et al 1985 its photochemical reactivity towards omps is usually higher than that of 3dom with average e t of around 235 kj mol 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 for example hi 3dom photogenerated from autochthonous freshwater dom accounted for 72 of the total photodegradation of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp while only 27 55 in the case of allochthonous freshwater dom zhou et al 2019a as mainly derived from marine organisms and influenced by mariculture activities s dom was regarded as autochthonous dominated wang et al 2019 so far however its ability to produce hi 3dom has not been investigated phenolic moieties in allochthonous dom play important roles in weakening photochemical reactivity of 3dom to omps janssen et al 2014 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2011 the electron rich moieties can participate directly in photochemical reactions by acting as antioxidants reducing 3dom or reactive intermediates back to parent species aeschbacher et al 2012 wang et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2011 substituted phenols in dom are also sources of ho sun et al 2015 tafer et al 2016 related with photooxidation of omps to the best of the authors knowledge content as well as role of phenolic moieties in the photodegradation of omps have not been unveiled for s dom yet wang et al 2018 2019 employed reverse osmosis ro coupled with electroosmosis ed to extract s dom from coastal seawaters making it possible to investigate effects of field s dom on photodegradation of omps previous studies showed that s dom exhibited higher photochemical reactivity to a phenolic ketone sunscreen 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 than allochthonous freshwater dom this was most probably attributed to a low content of phenolic moieties in the s dom herein to test the above hypothesis a sulfa antibiotic sulfachloropyridazine was employed to probe roles of hi 3dom and phenolic moieties of s dom in the photodegradation sulfa antibiotics are ubiquitously used in aquiculture and have been detected in coastal seawaters kim and carlson 2007 patel et al 2019 siedlewicz et al 2018 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the aromatic aniline structures of sulfa antibiotics can react directly with 3dom canonica 2007 rendering the sulfa antibiotics an ideal model for investigating s dom photochemistry the effects of s dom on photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine have not been reported previously in this study two kinds of s dom extracted from seawaters with or without impacts of mariculture were employed to distinguish their differences in photochemical characteristics formation yields of ppris and their reaction rates with sulfachloropyridazine were also determined to identify major indirect photodegradation pathways steady state concentrations of hi 3dom hi 3dom ss and contents of phenolic moieties phenol were quantified based on kinetics parameters determined with s dom photodegradation rate constants as a function of time and water depths and half lives t 1 2 in sea fresh or estuarine water bodies were predicted for sulfachloropyridazine so as to clarify photolytic persistence of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies this study provides deep insights into photochemistry of s dom and is important for assessing environmental fate and ecological risks of omps in coastal seawaters or estuary areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and dom samples sources and purity of chemicals seawater sampling sites table s1 are described in the supplementary material sm the s dom samples were extracted using a reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed system detailed by wang et al 2018 two kinds of s dom sdom 1 and sdom 2 with sdom 1 extracted from coastal seawaters impacted by mariculture activities were used nordic reservoir natural organic matter nrnom was employed to represent freshwater dom 2 2 photochemical experiments an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang technology co nanjing was employed with quartz tubes to contain the investigated solutions a water refrigerated 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 290 nm cutoff filters was used as the light source unless otherwise specified irradiance spectrum was recorded by a trios spectroradiometer equipped with a ramses acc uv sensor germany the light intensity was calculated to be 39 w m 2 from 290 to 400 nm and is close to that of midday solar irradiation in dongying of shandong province figure s1 initial concentration of sulfachloropyridazine in the photolytic experiment was 5 μm the concentration of total non purgable organic carbons npoc for the dom was 10 mg c l 1 falling within the typical range of 2 2 to 17 8 mg c l 1 in natural waters cooper and zika 1983 phosphate buffer solutions 10 mm were used to control ph of the investigated solutions to a common seawater value of 8 to clarify the roles of ppris quenching experiments were performed by adding 2 mm sorbic alcohol sa to quench 3dom zhou et al 2019a 25 mm isopropanol ipa to quench ho guerard et al 2009a or 3 mm sodium azide nan3 to quench both 1o2 and ho dark controls were included under the same conditions by wrapping the tubes with foil papers aliquots were removed at selected intervals for further analysis 2 3 determination of total phenolic moieties contents phenol and inhibition efficiency ie the folin ciocalteu method hinneburg et al 2006 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 was adopted to determine phenol in different dom 10 mg c l 1 briefly 0 5 ml dom samples were mixed with 0 5 ml folin ciocalteu reagents and kept at room temperature 25 ºc for 5 min after addition of 1 5 ml na2co3 solution 20 w v and sufficient mixing the mixture was diluted to 10 ml with ultrapure water the mixture was incubated in a 75 ºc water bath for 10 min to produce a product with absorbance at 760 nm a series of gallic acid gac solutions 0 004 to 0 016 mg ml 1 was used to establish a calibration curve r 2 0 999 phenol was quantified in concentrations of gac mg gac l 1 based on the absorbance at 760 nm and were normalized with npoc mg c l 1 the inhibition effect induced by the phenolic moieties in dom was evaluated with inhibition efficiency ie defined by wenk and canonica 2012 i e 1 ie 1 k phenol k non phenol where k phenol and k non phenol represents pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence and absence of phenol in the dom solutions to determine ie 10 μm phenol was added to the dom solutions as antioxidants wenk and canonica 2012 a 500 w hg lamp was used as the light source to accelerate the photodegradation and 380 nm cutoff filters were used to prevent direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine figure s2 2 4 determination of second order reaction rate constants of 3dom second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and sulfachloropyridazine k scp 3dom were determined based on a hypothesis vione and sozzaro 2019 that dom mainly generated 3dom 1o2 and ho to degrade sulfachloropyridazine this is reasonable as contribution of 3dom was regarded as the most important to the photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine boreen et al 2005 since k scp 3dom may vary with dom concentrations due to varied concentrations of the phenolic moieties k scp 3dom was determined at the same concentration of total organic carbon for different dom so as to compare reactivities of 3dom from s dom and nrnom towards sulfachloropyridazine the observed photolytic degradation rate constant k obs of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence of dom was a sum of that of direct photolysis s λ k d and indirect photodegradation k ind as shown by eq 2 2 k obs s λ k d k ind where s λ represents light screening factor of dom that was detailed in the sm k d is direct photolysis rate constant of sulfachloropyridazine in the absence of dom at ph 8 k ind can be expressed as 3 k ind k 3 dom k 1 o 2 k ho k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss k scp 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k scp ho ho ss where k 3dom k 1o2 and k ho are first order rate constants for sulfachloropyridazine degraded by 3dom 1o2 and ho respectively k scp 3dom k scp 1o2 and k scp ho are the corresponding second order rate constants consequently k 3dom can be obtained as 4 k 3 dom k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss k ind k 1 o 2 k ho k obs s λ k d k 1 o 2 k ho k scp 1o2 was determined by a competition kinetics method and was elaborated in the sm a k scp ho value reported by boreen et al 2005 was employed determination methods for steady state concentrations of ppris ppris ss including 1o2 ss 3dom ss and ho ss formation rates r ppris including r 1o2 r 3dom and r ho quantum yields φppris including φ1o2 φ3dom and φho and 3dom quantum yield coefficients f tmp are elaborated in the sm k scp 3dom was calculated from k 3dom according to the method detailed by wang et al 2019 deactivation of 3dom was assumed to be mainly induced by sulfachloropyridazine or other quenchers under steady state conditions the formation rates of 3dom r 3dom equal the deactivation rates of 3dom 5 r 3 dom k scp 3 dom scp 3 dom ss k s 3 dom ss where scp stands for concentration of sulfachloropyridazine k s is a pseudo first order deactivation rate constant of 3dom through o2 dependent and independent by h2o or container inwall pathways and was adopted as 5 5 105 s 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 as 3dom ss k 3dom k scp 3dom eq 4 k scp 3dom can be obtained as 6 k scp 3 dom k s k 3 dom r 3 dom scp k 3 dom 2 5 determination of hi 3dom ss and reactivity of hi 3dom hi 3dom ss was measured with sa e t 250 kj mol 1 as a probe for the portion of 3dom for which e t is 250 kj mol 1 zhou et al 2019a zhou et al 2017 briefly 100 to 600 μm sa was mixed with 10 mg c l 1 dom and irradiated isomerization rates of sa were monitored to calculate reaction rate of hi 3dom with sa r sa to maximize the sa isomerization induced by hi 3dom a 500 w mercury lamp was used instead of the xenon lamp by allowing higher uv visible absorbance of the s dom figure s2 under steady state conditions the formation rate of hi 3dom r hi 3dom equals the elimination rate that is sum of r sa and o2 h2o quenching rate r s 7 r hi 3 dom r sa r s k sa hi 3 dom hi 3 dom ss sa k s hi 3 dom ss where k sa hi 3dom represents the second order rate constant between hi 3dom and sa and was used to describe the reactivity of hi 3dom details for determining hi 3dom ss k sa hi 3dom and the quantum yield of hi 3dom φhi 3dom are provided in the sm 2 6 photodegradation rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies generally photodegradation rates of omps in natural water are greatly different from that determined in lab due to sunlight attenuations by dom phytoplankton non algal particle matters chlorophyll α etc hargreaves et al 2007 zhou et al 2018 to evaluate apparent photodegradation rate constants k obs and half lives t 1 2 of sulfachloropyridazine in natural waters a generalized photodegradation kinetics model fully considering underwater sunlight attenuations with depths z was employed the calculation procedures were elaborated by zhou et al 2018 the k scp 3dom values determined with the s dom or nrnom in the current study were used to evaluate indirect photodegradation rate constants k ind of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies in the yellow river estuary 2 7 analytical method the samples were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 with a diode array detector and the analytical conditions are listed in table s2 npoc was quantified by a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100s jena optical parameters of dom including specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm spectra slope ratio s r fluorescence index humification index and biological index bix were determined with methods detailed in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 indirect photodegradation kinetics as shown by figure s3 degradation of sulfachloropyridazine through non photochemical processes in the dark was negligible 1 under the experimental conditions the direct photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 and k d was determined to be 9 45 0 60 10 4 min 1 figure s4 the photodegradation was significantly accelerated by s dom but was slightly slowed by nrnom fig 1 as dom can compete light with sulfachloropyridazine figure s2 k d was decreased to s λ k d in the systems with dom due to light screening effects fig 1 the s λ values were calculated to be 0 880 0 876 and 0 649 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively the light screening effects of the two kinds of s dom are similar but much lower than that of nrnom after correcting the light screening effects direct photolytic rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine i e s λ k d were calculated as 8 31 0 25 10 4 8 27 0 22 10 4 and 6 13 0 19 10 4 min 1 in the systems with the presence of sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively as shown in fig 1 the s λ k d values for the systems containing sdom 1 or sdom 2 are similar and k ind for the system with sdom 1 is higher than that with sdom 2 wang et al 2018 also found that three other sulfa antibiotics sulfametoxydiazine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxypridazine photodegraded faster in the presence of s dom impacted by mariculture activities than that less impacted by mariculture activities therefore it can be concluded that the s dom impacted by mariculture activities possessed higher photosensitization ability than that less impacted by mariculture activities to the sulfa antibiotics k ind in the systems with nrnom was the lowest indicating that s dom are more efficient in photosensitizing degradation of sulfachloropyridazine than nrnom wang et al 2019 also found that photodegradation of bp 1 was faster in systems with s dom than in that with suwanee river natural organic matter srnom no loss of sulfachloropyridazine was observed with addition of quenchers in the dark controls figure s3 as can be seen from fig 1 k obs was slightly inhibited with the addition of ipa as a ho quencher to the solutions containing the dom therefore it can be inferred that ho plays a negligible role in the indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence of sdom 2 or nrnom the k obs values were decreased by 22 or 38 with the addition of nan3 as a quencher of both 1o2 and ho while no such effect was observed in the sdom 1 system this observation indicates that sdom 2 or nrnom can photosensitize degradation of sulfachloropyridazine by producing 1o2 while sdom 1 cannot with the addition of sa as a 3dom quencher k obs was decreased by 68 73 in the system containing the s dom and by 63 in the system containing nrnom as sa is a well known 3dom quencher 3dom is inferred to be predominant in inducing indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine no matter in the s dom systems or in the nrnom system boreen et al 2005 also indicated that 3dom from freshwater plays a dominant role in photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine it deserves mentioning that sa quenched not only 3dom but also excited triplet states of sulfachloropyridazine the k obs values after addition of sa were lower than the s λ k d values fig 1 indicating not only 3dom related indirect photodegradation but also direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine was weakened by sa this manifest that direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine occurs mainly via excited triplet states as sa mainly quenches excited triplet species grebel et al 2011 as the decreases in k obs caused by sa are due to reductions in both s λ k d and k ind actual contributions of 3dom to the indirect photodegradation were further assessed in the following studies 3 2 k 3dom and k scp 3dom for the different dom as can be seen from table 1 the ppris ss photogenerated from the s dom was 1 2 2 3 folds lower than that from the nrnom and f tmp or φppris of s dom was 0 5 1 3 times higher than that of the nrnom ppris ss are associated with φppris and the cumulative light absorption rates of dom eq s15 the cumulative light absorption rates of sdom 1 1 41 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 and sdom 2 1 42 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 are lower than that of the nrnom 7 12 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 thus the lower ppris ss in the s dom systems relative to that in the nrnom system can be attributed to the lower cumulative light absorption rates of the s dom 3dom ss values for the two s dom are lower than that for the nrnom with an order of nrnom sdom 2 sdom 1 this observation is opposite to the results in the sa quenching experiment where sa caused 73 decrease to k obs for sdom 1 68 for sdom 2 and 63 for nrnom fig 1 these results imply that excited triplet state of s dom 3s dom possesses higher reactivity to sulfachloropyridazine than excited triplet state of nrnom 3nrnom as illustrated in fig 2 the maximum k 1o2 k 1o2 k scp 1o2 1o2 ss was observed in the nrnom system which accounts for 5 of k obs based on the determined k scp 1o2 value of 5 02 0 15 106 m 1 s 1 figure s5 for the two s dom systems the contributions of k 1o2 to k obs are 1 notably the contribution of 1o2 involved degradation calculated from k scp 1o2 1o2 ss are significantly lower than that evaluated from the nan3 quenching experiment fig 1 chu et al 2016 who investigated photodegradation of cysteine in dom solutions also observed higher contribution of 1o2 involved degradation from the nan3 quenching experiment than that evaluated by second order reaction rate constants and 1o2 ss as nan3 may also quench other ppris e g ho the contribution of 1o2 involved degradation can be overestimated from the nan3 quenching experiment as was also pointed out by minella et al 2018 the k ho k ho k scp ho ho ss value was calculated to be 1 of k obs for the s dom or nrnom employing k scp ho 4 40 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2005 in the calculation the k 3dom values calculated from eq 4 contribute 51 sdom 1 42 sdom 2 or 26 nrnom to the k obs value therefore the current study unveils 3dom plays a more important role in the photodegradation in s dom systems than that in the freshwater dom system based on eq 6 k scp 3dom was calculated to be 6 05 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 81 108 m 1 s 1 for sdom 1 and sdom 2 respectively table 1 indicating 3dom generated from the s dom impacted by mariculture activities exhibits high reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than that less impacted by mariculture activities the average k scp 3dom value for the two s dom is much higher than that for the nrnom 4 94 107 m 1 s 1 indicating that 3s dom has higher reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than 3nrnom wang et al 2019 also reported that 3s dom exhibited higher reactivity towards bp 1 than freshwater allochthonous dom to the best of the authors knowledge the current study firstly reports that 3s dom has higher reactivity towards omps with aromatic aniline moieties 3 3 roles of 3hi dom in the photodegradation hi 3dom ss were determined to be 5 20 1 00 10 13 and 3 78 0 22 10 13 m in the sdom 1 and sdom 2 systems respectively the slightly higher hi 3dom ss value of sdom 1 can be related with the lower s r value 1 74 for sdom 1 than that s r 1 99 for sdom 2 table s3 since the higher s r value of sdom 2 indicates longer photobleaching time helms et al 2008 for sdom 2 as sdom 1 was extracted from seawaters impacted by mariculture activities and may contain mariculture discharges it is conceivable that photobleaching extent of sdom 1 is lower than that of sdom 2 the other optical parameters for the s dom are detailed in the sm to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first that determines hi 3dom ss for s dom hi 3dom ss was determined to be 1 37 0 68 10 12 m for the nrnom system which is much higher than that in the s dom systems zhou et al 2019a found that for freshwater dom hi 3dom ss of autochthonous sources was higher than that of allochthonous sources in the current study hi 3dom ss in the nrnom allochthonous system was found to be much higher than that in the s dom systems that can be considered as autochthonous dominated dom wang et al 2019 some previous studies employed autochthonous freshwater plfa as surrogates of s dom in relevant photochemistry studies liu et al 2018 muller et al 2019 the current study indicated that employing autochthonous freshwater dom to represent s dom may overestimate the contributions of hi 3dom related photochemical processes the φhi 3dom values of sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom were determined to be 1 29 0 25 0 96 0 14 and 0 75 0 37 respectively indicating that the s dom exhibited higher hi 3dom formation efficiency than nrnom under the irradiation of the hg lamp based on the ratio of φhi 3dom determined in the nrnom system under the hg lamp and xenon lamp irradiation quantum yield for formation of hi 3dom under the xenon lamp irradiation φhi 3dom were estimated to be 0 72 0 14 0 54 0 08 and 0 42 0 19 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively detailed in the sm hi 3dom ss formed under the xenon lamp irradiation were calculated to be 5 44 2 46 10 14 m for the nrnom 1 85 0 36 10 14 m for sdom 1 and 1 39 0 21 10 14 m for sdom 2 detailed in the sm although hi 3dom ss of the s dom is lower than that of the nrnom under the xenon lamp irradiation the determined k scp 3dom for the s dom is higher than that for the nrnom these results indicate that under the simulated solar irradiation condition hi 3dom may not be responsible for the high photochemical reactivity of 3s dom k sa hi 3dom is a parameter indicating photochemical reactivity of hi 3dom wang et al 2020a and was determined to be 7 06 0 35 108 9 49 2 92 108 and 8 48 1 09 108 m 1 s 1 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and the nrnom respectively the values are close to that for freshwater dom 5 8 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2019a considering the significantly low hi 3dom ss of s dom the current study indicates that hi 3dom induced photosensitization is not responsible for the high photochemical reactivity observed for the s dom 3 4 contents of phenolic antioxidants and inhibition efficiency of the different dom phenol was determined to be 0 020 0 023 and 0 203 mg gac mg c 1 in sdom 1 sdom 2 and the nrnom respectively phenol for the nrnom is close to that 0 237 mg gac mg c 1 reported by zhang et al 2014 the current study indicated that 3dom plays a major role in the photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine in the s dom or nrnom systems 3dom oxidizes anionic sulfa drugs proportion of anionic sulfachloropyridazine is 99 under the experimental conditions figure s6 via capture of electrons from the anionic sulfachloropyridazine boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 the formed sulfachloropyridazine radicals can either transform into products or be quenched through physical relaxation and reduction by phenolic moieties in dom figure s11 therefore the steady state concentration of sulfachloropyridazine radicals scp ss can be approximately expressed as eq 8 8 scp ss k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss sc p k r phenol k f k p where scp represents concentration of anionic sulfachloropyridazine k r is the second order reaction rate constant between sulfachloropyridazine radical and the phenolic moieties k p is first order physical quenching rate constant k f is first order rate constant for sulfachloropyridazine radical to form products for the nrnom although its 3dom ss or hi 3dom ss are high and potentially able to oxidize anionic sulfachloropyridazine to form sulfachloropyridazine radicals most of the radicals can be quenched by the large amounts of phenolic moieties wenk and canonica 2012 on the contrary as phenol in the s dom is tenth of that in the nrnom scp ss in the s dom systems can be much higher leading to more sulfachloropyridazine radicals to undergo further degradation the ie values were determined to be 0 72 0 65 and 0 24 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively figure s12 a low ie value corresponds to high inhibition effects of phenolic moieties in dom on the reaction between 3dom and the target pollutant wenk and canonica 2012 the ie value of nrnom is comparable to that reported for typical allochthonous dom such as nordic aquatic fulvic acid ie 0 25 with sulfamethoxazole as a target pollutant wenk and canonica 2012 ie of the s dom is about 3 times higher than that of nrnom indicating the inhibition effects induced by the phenolic moieties in the s dom is significantly lower than that in nrnom the determined phenol levels also support the conclusion as phenolic moieties are major electron donating capacity groups that contributes to the inhibition effect of dom since nrnom is rich in the phenolic moieties that can inhibit the reaction between sulfachloropyridazine and 3dom further inhibition effects of the additional phenols were partially neutralized by the intrinsic phenolic groups wenk and canonica 2012 as k scp 3dom is an apparent rate constant calculated based on eq 3 eq 6 the inhibition effects of phenolic moieties are included therefore it is the lower phenol in the s dom relative to that in the nrnom that leads to the higher k scp 3dom for the s dom as sdom 1 and sdom 2 have comparable phenol levels the slightly higher photoreactivity of 3sdom 1 towards sulfachloropyridazine can be due to the higher hi 3dom ss in the sdom 1 system than in the 3sdom 2 system 5 81 1 14 10 13 versus 3 78 0 22 10 13 m the current study highlights importance of determination of the phenolic moieties in dom photochemistry to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first attempt to determine phenol for s dom although phenol for freshwater dom has been determined previously zhang et al 2014 nevertheless it deserves mentioning that the s dom used in the current study was extracted from coastal seawaters in dalian and it may not well represent s dom in seawaters in other regions further studies are necessary to extract s dom or freshwater dom from other water bodies to determine phenol in the dom and to evaluate the effects of phenol levels on photodegradation of omps in the natural water bodies 3 5 predicted photodegradation rates k obs in natural water bodies in previous studies second order reaction rate constants between omps and 3dom determined with dom analogs k omps 3analogs instead of dom were usually used to derive k obs of omps in natural waters chen et al 2019 vione 2020 zhou et al 2018 the current study has shown that k scp 3dom varies from different water bodies thus it is necessary to compare k obs predicted from the different k scp 3dom values with that employing the k scp 3analogs values li et al 2015 reported the k omps 3analogs value for sulfadiazine 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 determined using 4 carboxybenzophenone as a dom model zhou et al 2018 reported the k omps 3analogs value for sulfamethoxazole 2 7 108 m 1 s 1 determined using riboflavin as a dom model as there were no previous studies reporting the k scp 3analogs value for sulfachloropyridazine the k omps 3analogs values of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole which have similar molecular structures to sulfachloropyridazine were adopted for the comparison table s5 lists the estimated day averaged indirect photolytic rate constants k ind avg apparent photolytic rate constants k obs avg and photolytic half lives t 1 2 at surface waters for sulfachloropyridazine in natural freshwater estuarine and seawater in the yellow river estuary it can be seen that k ind avg or k obs avg were largely overestimated when the k omps 3analogs value for sulfadiazine was adopted for the prediction which can be due to that k omps 3analogs of sulfadiazine was determined using 4 carboxybenzophenone and aromatic ketone is a main precursor of hi 3dom zhou et al 2019a for the estuarine water and seawater bodies the rate constants estimated with k scp 3dom or the k omps 3analogs value for sulfamethoxazole were comparable while for the freshwater the corresponding rate constants estimated from k omps 3analogs of sulfamethoxazole is much higher therefore the current study manifests significance of using the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps that is determined for dom of corresponding water bodies in accurate prediction of environmental photolytic persistence of omps 4 conclusions s dom is more efficient in inducing indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine than nordic reservoir natural organic matter nrnom an allochthonous freshwater dom 3dom is the most important ppri and 3dom of s dom exhibits remarkably higher reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than that of the nrnom the less phenolic antioxidants in the s dom relative to that in the nrnom contributes to the remarkbly higher second order reaction rate constant between 3dom of the s dom and sulfachloropyridazine the higher content of hi 3dom in the s dom impacted by mariculture can further increase the 3dom reactivity of the s dom to accurately predict photolytic persistence of omps in field water bodies it is of significance to determine the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps using dom extracted

17461,coastal seawater constitutes an important ecosystem receiving inputs of organic micropollutants omps such as sulfa antibiotics from land based sources or mariculture activities it is necessary to investigate photodegradation of omps in coastal seawaters for assessing their environmental fate and risks however effects of coastal seawater dissolved organic matter s dom on omps photodegradation are largely unknown given that chemical compositions of s dom are different from those of freshwater dom herein photochemical characteristics of s dom extracted from dalian coastal seawaters were investigated by simulating photochemical experiment adopting sulfachloropyridazine as a case results show that s dom accelerates the photodegradation mainly through excited triplet state dom 3dom with an apparent rate constant 4 43 108 m 1 s 1 ten folds of that of freshwater dom which is mainly due to much lower phenol contents detected in the s dom 0 022 mg gallic acid mg c 1 the s dom impacted by mariculture can photogenerate more high energy 3dom than those less impacted by mariculture further contributing to the high 3dom reactivity the study shows that to accurately predict photolytic persistence of omps in field water bodies it is of significance to determine the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps using dom extracted from relevant water bodies graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords triplet state photosensitization photodegradation sulfachloropyridazine coastal seawater dissolved organic matter phenolic antioxidants 1 introduction due to riverine transport discharge from land based sources and mariculture activities coastal seawaters in many regions of the world have become a pivotal sink of organic micropollutants omps thibault et al 2019 the environmental capacity and ecological risks of omps are closely related with their fate in coastal seawaters photodegradation is an important pathway for removing omps in seawaters wang et al 2018 yan and song 2014 zhang et al 2018 zhou et al 2015 being rich in biomass and accepting mariculture discharges wang et al 2020b coastal seawaters are abundant in dissolved organic matter dom garcía flor et al 2005 which can generate a variety of photochemically produced reactive intermediates ppris to induce indirect photodegradation of omps challenged by extraction techniques for dom from seawaters many previous studies mainly employed freshwater dom as surrogates of seawater dom s dom in photochemistry studies liu et al 2018 muller et al 2019 parker and mitch 2016 as a result environmental photochemical properties of s dom and its effects on photodegradation of omps in coastal waters are largely unknown the most important ppri related with indirect photodegradation of omps is excited triplet state of dom 3dom formed from photoexcitation followed by intersystem crossing of chromophores in dom the steady state concentrations of 3dom 3dom ss are 10 14 10 12 m in sunlit waters mcneill and canonica 2016 enabling 3dom to undergo various photochemical processes 3dom is not only a main source of other ppris such as singlet oxygen 1o2 and hydroxyl radicals ho boreen et al 2008 gan et al 2008 latch and mcneill 2006 vione and sozzaro 2019 zhao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019b but also directly reacts with omps through photosensitization reactions i e energy transfer or oxidation electron transfer or other related mechanisms coble 2007 mcneill and canonica 2016 rosario ortiz and canonica 2016 accordingly acceleration effects of dom on photodegradation of omps can be evaluated by the ability of 3dom to produce ppris and the reactivity of 3dom towards omps for freshwater dom 3dom generated from autochthonous pony lake fulvic acid plfa effluent organic matter efom or wastewater organic matter wwom usually exhibits higher photochemical reactivity towards omps than that from allochthonous sources ryan et al 2011 zhou et al 2019a guerard et al 2009a guerard et al 2009b this is because that in general the autochthonous dom derived from organisms can photogenerate more high energy 3dom hi 3dom than the allochthonous dom moor et al 2019 zhou et al 2019a except for a special case that the lake rouen autochthonous dom mainly from precipitations of rain and snow photogenerated 3dom with low reactivity de laurentiis et al 2012 as excited triplet state energy e t of hi 3dom is defined as 250 kj mol 1 zepp et al 1985 its photochemical reactivity towards omps is usually higher than that of 3dom with average e t of around 235 kj mol 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 for example hi 3dom photogenerated from autochthonous freshwater dom accounted for 72 of the total photodegradation of 2 4 6 trimethylphenol tmp while only 27 55 in the case of allochthonous freshwater dom zhou et al 2019a as mainly derived from marine organisms and influenced by mariculture activities s dom was regarded as autochthonous dominated wang et al 2019 so far however its ability to produce hi 3dom has not been investigated phenolic moieties in allochthonous dom play important roles in weakening photochemical reactivity of 3dom to omps janssen et al 2014 vione et al 2018 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2013 wenk et al 2011 the electron rich moieties can participate directly in photochemical reactions by acting as antioxidants reducing 3dom or reactive intermediates back to parent species aeschbacher et al 2012 wang et al 2019 wenk and canonica 2012 wenk et al 2011 substituted phenols in dom are also sources of ho sun et al 2015 tafer et al 2016 related with photooxidation of omps to the best of the authors knowledge content as well as role of phenolic moieties in the photodegradation of omps have not been unveiled for s dom yet wang et al 2018 2019 employed reverse osmosis ro coupled with electroosmosis ed to extract s dom from coastal seawaters making it possible to investigate effects of field s dom on photodegradation of omps previous studies showed that s dom exhibited higher photochemical reactivity to a phenolic ketone sunscreen 2 4 dihydroxybenzophenone bp 1 than allochthonous freshwater dom this was most probably attributed to a low content of phenolic moieties in the s dom herein to test the above hypothesis a sulfa antibiotic sulfachloropyridazine was employed to probe roles of hi 3dom and phenolic moieties of s dom in the photodegradation sulfa antibiotics are ubiquitously used in aquiculture and have been detected in coastal seawaters kim and carlson 2007 patel et al 2019 siedlewicz et al 2018 xie et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 the aromatic aniline structures of sulfa antibiotics can react directly with 3dom canonica 2007 rendering the sulfa antibiotics an ideal model for investigating s dom photochemistry the effects of s dom on photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine have not been reported previously in this study two kinds of s dom extracted from seawaters with or without impacts of mariculture were employed to distinguish their differences in photochemical characteristics formation yields of ppris and their reaction rates with sulfachloropyridazine were also determined to identify major indirect photodegradation pathways steady state concentrations of hi 3dom hi 3dom ss and contents of phenolic moieties phenol were quantified based on kinetics parameters determined with s dom photodegradation rate constants as a function of time and water depths and half lives t 1 2 in sea fresh or estuarine water bodies were predicted for sulfachloropyridazine so as to clarify photolytic persistence of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies this study provides deep insights into photochemistry of s dom and is important for assessing environmental fate and ecological risks of omps in coastal seawaters or estuary areas 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and dom samples sources and purity of chemicals seawater sampling sites table s1 are described in the supplementary material sm the s dom samples were extracted using a reverse osmosis ro electrodialysis ed system detailed by wang et al 2018 two kinds of s dom sdom 1 and sdom 2 with sdom 1 extracted from coastal seawaters impacted by mariculture activities were used nordic reservoir natural organic matter nrnom was employed to represent freshwater dom 2 2 photochemical experiments an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang technology co nanjing was employed with quartz tubes to contain the investigated solutions a water refrigerated 1000 w xenon lamp surrounded by 290 nm cutoff filters was used as the light source unless otherwise specified irradiance spectrum was recorded by a trios spectroradiometer equipped with a ramses acc uv sensor germany the light intensity was calculated to be 39 w m 2 from 290 to 400 nm and is close to that of midday solar irradiation in dongying of shandong province figure s1 initial concentration of sulfachloropyridazine in the photolytic experiment was 5 μm the concentration of total non purgable organic carbons npoc for the dom was 10 mg c l 1 falling within the typical range of 2 2 to 17 8 mg c l 1 in natural waters cooper and zika 1983 phosphate buffer solutions 10 mm were used to control ph of the investigated solutions to a common seawater value of 8 to clarify the roles of ppris quenching experiments were performed by adding 2 mm sorbic alcohol sa to quench 3dom zhou et al 2019a 25 mm isopropanol ipa to quench ho guerard et al 2009a or 3 mm sodium azide nan3 to quench both 1o2 and ho dark controls were included under the same conditions by wrapping the tubes with foil papers aliquots were removed at selected intervals for further analysis 2 3 determination of total phenolic moieties contents phenol and inhibition efficiency ie the folin ciocalteu method hinneburg et al 2006 wang et al 2011 zhang et al 2014 was adopted to determine phenol in different dom 10 mg c l 1 briefly 0 5 ml dom samples were mixed with 0 5 ml folin ciocalteu reagents and kept at room temperature 25 ºc for 5 min after addition of 1 5 ml na2co3 solution 20 w v and sufficient mixing the mixture was diluted to 10 ml with ultrapure water the mixture was incubated in a 75 ºc water bath for 10 min to produce a product with absorbance at 760 nm a series of gallic acid gac solutions 0 004 to 0 016 mg ml 1 was used to establish a calibration curve r 2 0 999 phenol was quantified in concentrations of gac mg gac l 1 based on the absorbance at 760 nm and were normalized with npoc mg c l 1 the inhibition effect induced by the phenolic moieties in dom was evaluated with inhibition efficiency ie defined by wenk and canonica 2012 i e 1 ie 1 k phenol k non phenol where k phenol and k non phenol represents pseudo first order photodegradation rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence and absence of phenol in the dom solutions to determine ie 10 μm phenol was added to the dom solutions as antioxidants wenk and canonica 2012 a 500 w hg lamp was used as the light source to accelerate the photodegradation and 380 nm cutoff filters were used to prevent direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine figure s2 2 4 determination of second order reaction rate constants of 3dom second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and sulfachloropyridazine k scp 3dom were determined based on a hypothesis vione and sozzaro 2019 that dom mainly generated 3dom 1o2 and ho to degrade sulfachloropyridazine this is reasonable as contribution of 3dom was regarded as the most important to the photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine boreen et al 2005 since k scp 3dom may vary with dom concentrations due to varied concentrations of the phenolic moieties k scp 3dom was determined at the same concentration of total organic carbon for different dom so as to compare reactivities of 3dom from s dom and nrnom towards sulfachloropyridazine the observed photolytic degradation rate constant k obs of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence of dom was a sum of that of direct photolysis s λ k d and indirect photodegradation k ind as shown by eq 2 2 k obs s λ k d k ind where s λ represents light screening factor of dom that was detailed in the sm k d is direct photolysis rate constant of sulfachloropyridazine in the absence of dom at ph 8 k ind can be expressed as 3 k ind k 3 dom k 1 o 2 k ho k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss k scp 1 o 2 1 o 2 ss k scp ho ho ss where k 3dom k 1o2 and k ho are first order rate constants for sulfachloropyridazine degraded by 3dom 1o2 and ho respectively k scp 3dom k scp 1o2 and k scp ho are the corresponding second order rate constants consequently k 3dom can be obtained as 4 k 3 dom k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss k ind k 1 o 2 k ho k obs s λ k d k 1 o 2 k ho k scp 1o2 was determined by a competition kinetics method and was elaborated in the sm a k scp ho value reported by boreen et al 2005 was employed determination methods for steady state concentrations of ppris ppris ss including 1o2 ss 3dom ss and ho ss formation rates r ppris including r 1o2 r 3dom and r ho quantum yields φppris including φ1o2 φ3dom and φho and 3dom quantum yield coefficients f tmp are elaborated in the sm k scp 3dom was calculated from k 3dom according to the method detailed by wang et al 2019 deactivation of 3dom was assumed to be mainly induced by sulfachloropyridazine or other quenchers under steady state conditions the formation rates of 3dom r 3dom equal the deactivation rates of 3dom 5 r 3 dom k scp 3 dom scp 3 dom ss k s 3 dom ss where scp stands for concentration of sulfachloropyridazine k s is a pseudo first order deactivation rate constant of 3dom through o2 dependent and independent by h2o or container inwall pathways and was adopted as 5 5 105 s 1 mcneill and canonica 2016 as 3dom ss k 3dom k scp 3dom eq 4 k scp 3dom can be obtained as 6 k scp 3 dom k s k 3 dom r 3 dom scp k 3 dom 2 5 determination of hi 3dom ss and reactivity of hi 3dom hi 3dom ss was measured with sa e t 250 kj mol 1 as a probe for the portion of 3dom for which e t is 250 kj mol 1 zhou et al 2019a zhou et al 2017 briefly 100 to 600 μm sa was mixed with 10 mg c l 1 dom and irradiated isomerization rates of sa were monitored to calculate reaction rate of hi 3dom with sa r sa to maximize the sa isomerization induced by hi 3dom a 500 w mercury lamp was used instead of the xenon lamp by allowing higher uv visible absorbance of the s dom figure s2 under steady state conditions the formation rate of hi 3dom r hi 3dom equals the elimination rate that is sum of r sa and o2 h2o quenching rate r s 7 r hi 3 dom r sa r s k sa hi 3 dom hi 3 dom ss sa k s hi 3 dom ss where k sa hi 3dom represents the second order rate constant between hi 3dom and sa and was used to describe the reactivity of hi 3dom details for determining hi 3dom ss k sa hi 3dom and the quantum yield of hi 3dom φhi 3dom are provided in the sm 2 6 photodegradation rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies generally photodegradation rates of omps in natural water are greatly different from that determined in lab due to sunlight attenuations by dom phytoplankton non algal particle matters chlorophyll α etc hargreaves et al 2007 zhou et al 2018 to evaluate apparent photodegradation rate constants k obs and half lives t 1 2 of sulfachloropyridazine in natural waters a generalized photodegradation kinetics model fully considering underwater sunlight attenuations with depths z was employed the calculation procedures were elaborated by zhou et al 2018 the k scp 3dom values determined with the s dom or nrnom in the current study were used to evaluate indirect photodegradation rate constants k ind of sulfachloropyridazine in different water bodies in the yellow river estuary 2 7 analytical method the samples were analyzed by a high performance liquid chromatography hplc agilent 1260 with a diode array detector and the analytical conditions are listed in table s2 npoc was quantified by a total organic carbon analyzer multi n c 2100s jena optical parameters of dom including specific ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm spectra slope ratio s r fluorescence index humification index and biological index bix were determined with methods detailed in the sm 3 results and discussion 3 1 indirect photodegradation kinetics as shown by figure s3 degradation of sulfachloropyridazine through non photochemical processes in the dark was negligible 1 under the experimental conditions the direct photolysis followed pseudo first order kinetics r 0 98 p 0 05 and k d was determined to be 9 45 0 60 10 4 min 1 figure s4 the photodegradation was significantly accelerated by s dom but was slightly slowed by nrnom fig 1 as dom can compete light with sulfachloropyridazine figure s2 k d was decreased to s λ k d in the systems with dom due to light screening effects fig 1 the s λ values were calculated to be 0 880 0 876 and 0 649 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively the light screening effects of the two kinds of s dom are similar but much lower than that of nrnom after correcting the light screening effects direct photolytic rate constants of sulfachloropyridazine i e s λ k d were calculated as 8 31 0 25 10 4 8 27 0 22 10 4 and 6 13 0 19 10 4 min 1 in the systems with the presence of sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively as shown in fig 1 the s λ k d values for the systems containing sdom 1 or sdom 2 are similar and k ind for the system with sdom 1 is higher than that with sdom 2 wang et al 2018 also found that three other sulfa antibiotics sulfametoxydiazine sulfamonomethoxine and sulfamethoxypridazine photodegraded faster in the presence of s dom impacted by mariculture activities than that less impacted by mariculture activities therefore it can be concluded that the s dom impacted by mariculture activities possessed higher photosensitization ability than that less impacted by mariculture activities to the sulfa antibiotics k ind in the systems with nrnom was the lowest indicating that s dom are more efficient in photosensitizing degradation of sulfachloropyridazine than nrnom wang et al 2019 also found that photodegradation of bp 1 was faster in systems with s dom than in that with suwanee river natural organic matter srnom no loss of sulfachloropyridazine was observed with addition of quenchers in the dark controls figure s3 as can be seen from fig 1 k obs was slightly inhibited with the addition of ipa as a ho quencher to the solutions containing the dom therefore it can be inferred that ho plays a negligible role in the indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine in the presence of sdom 2 or nrnom the k obs values were decreased by 22 or 38 with the addition of nan3 as a quencher of both 1o2 and ho while no such effect was observed in the sdom 1 system this observation indicates that sdom 2 or nrnom can photosensitize degradation of sulfachloropyridazine by producing 1o2 while sdom 1 cannot with the addition of sa as a 3dom quencher k obs was decreased by 68 73 in the system containing the s dom and by 63 in the system containing nrnom as sa is a well known 3dom quencher 3dom is inferred to be predominant in inducing indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine no matter in the s dom systems or in the nrnom system boreen et al 2005 also indicated that 3dom from freshwater plays a dominant role in photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine it deserves mentioning that sa quenched not only 3dom but also excited triplet states of sulfachloropyridazine the k obs values after addition of sa were lower than the s λ k d values fig 1 indicating not only 3dom related indirect photodegradation but also direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine was weakened by sa this manifest that direct photolysis of sulfachloropyridazine occurs mainly via excited triplet states as sa mainly quenches excited triplet species grebel et al 2011 as the decreases in k obs caused by sa are due to reductions in both s λ k d and k ind actual contributions of 3dom to the indirect photodegradation were further assessed in the following studies 3 2 k 3dom and k scp 3dom for the different dom as can be seen from table 1 the ppris ss photogenerated from the s dom was 1 2 2 3 folds lower than that from the nrnom and f tmp or φppris of s dom was 0 5 1 3 times higher than that of the nrnom ppris ss are associated with φppris and the cumulative light absorption rates of dom eq s15 the cumulative light absorption rates of sdom 1 1 41 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 and sdom 2 1 42 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 are lower than that of the nrnom 7 12 10 9 einstein cm 3 s 1 thus the lower ppris ss in the s dom systems relative to that in the nrnom system can be attributed to the lower cumulative light absorption rates of the s dom 3dom ss values for the two s dom are lower than that for the nrnom with an order of nrnom sdom 2 sdom 1 this observation is opposite to the results in the sa quenching experiment where sa caused 73 decrease to k obs for sdom 1 68 for sdom 2 and 63 for nrnom fig 1 these results imply that excited triplet state of s dom 3s dom possesses higher reactivity to sulfachloropyridazine than excited triplet state of nrnom 3nrnom as illustrated in fig 2 the maximum k 1o2 k 1o2 k scp 1o2 1o2 ss was observed in the nrnom system which accounts for 5 of k obs based on the determined k scp 1o2 value of 5 02 0 15 106 m 1 s 1 figure s5 for the two s dom systems the contributions of k 1o2 to k obs are 1 notably the contribution of 1o2 involved degradation calculated from k scp 1o2 1o2 ss are significantly lower than that evaluated from the nan3 quenching experiment fig 1 chu et al 2016 who investigated photodegradation of cysteine in dom solutions also observed higher contribution of 1o2 involved degradation from the nan3 quenching experiment than that evaluated by second order reaction rate constants and 1o2 ss as nan3 may also quench other ppris e g ho the contribution of 1o2 involved degradation can be overestimated from the nan3 quenching experiment as was also pointed out by minella et al 2018 the k ho k ho k scp ho ho ss value was calculated to be 1 of k obs for the s dom or nrnom employing k scp ho 4 40 109 m 1 s 1 boreen et al 2005 in the calculation the k 3dom values calculated from eq 4 contribute 51 sdom 1 42 sdom 2 or 26 nrnom to the k obs value therefore the current study unveils 3dom plays a more important role in the photodegradation in s dom systems than that in the freshwater dom system based on eq 6 k scp 3dom was calculated to be 6 05 108 m 1 s 1 and 2 81 108 m 1 s 1 for sdom 1 and sdom 2 respectively table 1 indicating 3dom generated from the s dom impacted by mariculture activities exhibits high reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than that less impacted by mariculture activities the average k scp 3dom value for the two s dom is much higher than that for the nrnom 4 94 107 m 1 s 1 indicating that 3s dom has higher reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than 3nrnom wang et al 2019 also reported that 3s dom exhibited higher reactivity towards bp 1 than freshwater allochthonous dom to the best of the authors knowledge the current study firstly reports that 3s dom has higher reactivity towards omps with aromatic aniline moieties 3 3 roles of 3hi dom in the photodegradation hi 3dom ss were determined to be 5 20 1 00 10 13 and 3 78 0 22 10 13 m in the sdom 1 and sdom 2 systems respectively the slightly higher hi 3dom ss value of sdom 1 can be related with the lower s r value 1 74 for sdom 1 than that s r 1 99 for sdom 2 table s3 since the higher s r value of sdom 2 indicates longer photobleaching time helms et al 2008 for sdom 2 as sdom 1 was extracted from seawaters impacted by mariculture activities and may contain mariculture discharges it is conceivable that photobleaching extent of sdom 1 is lower than that of sdom 2 the other optical parameters for the s dom are detailed in the sm to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first that determines hi 3dom ss for s dom hi 3dom ss was determined to be 1 37 0 68 10 12 m for the nrnom system which is much higher than that in the s dom systems zhou et al 2019a found that for freshwater dom hi 3dom ss of autochthonous sources was higher than that of allochthonous sources in the current study hi 3dom ss in the nrnom allochthonous system was found to be much higher than that in the s dom systems that can be considered as autochthonous dominated dom wang et al 2019 some previous studies employed autochthonous freshwater plfa as surrogates of s dom in relevant photochemistry studies liu et al 2018 muller et al 2019 the current study indicated that employing autochthonous freshwater dom to represent s dom may overestimate the contributions of hi 3dom related photochemical processes the φhi 3dom values of sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom were determined to be 1 29 0 25 0 96 0 14 and 0 75 0 37 respectively indicating that the s dom exhibited higher hi 3dom formation efficiency than nrnom under the irradiation of the hg lamp based on the ratio of φhi 3dom determined in the nrnom system under the hg lamp and xenon lamp irradiation quantum yield for formation of hi 3dom under the xenon lamp irradiation φhi 3dom were estimated to be 0 72 0 14 0 54 0 08 and 0 42 0 19 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively detailed in the sm hi 3dom ss formed under the xenon lamp irradiation were calculated to be 5 44 2 46 10 14 m for the nrnom 1 85 0 36 10 14 m for sdom 1 and 1 39 0 21 10 14 m for sdom 2 detailed in the sm although hi 3dom ss of the s dom is lower than that of the nrnom under the xenon lamp irradiation the determined k scp 3dom for the s dom is higher than that for the nrnom these results indicate that under the simulated solar irradiation condition hi 3dom may not be responsible for the high photochemical reactivity of 3s dom k sa hi 3dom is a parameter indicating photochemical reactivity of hi 3dom wang et al 2020a and was determined to be 7 06 0 35 108 9 49 2 92 108 and 8 48 1 09 108 m 1 s 1 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and the nrnom respectively the values are close to that for freshwater dom 5 8 108 m 1 s 1 zhou et al 2019a considering the significantly low hi 3dom ss of s dom the current study indicates that hi 3dom induced photosensitization is not responsible for the high photochemical reactivity observed for the s dom 3 4 contents of phenolic antioxidants and inhibition efficiency of the different dom phenol was determined to be 0 020 0 023 and 0 203 mg gac mg c 1 in sdom 1 sdom 2 and the nrnom respectively phenol for the nrnom is close to that 0 237 mg gac mg c 1 reported by zhang et al 2014 the current study indicated that 3dom plays a major role in the photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine in the s dom or nrnom systems 3dom oxidizes anionic sulfa drugs proportion of anionic sulfachloropyridazine is 99 under the experimental conditions figure s6 via capture of electrons from the anionic sulfachloropyridazine boreen et al 2005 li et al 2015 the formed sulfachloropyridazine radicals can either transform into products or be quenched through physical relaxation and reduction by phenolic moieties in dom figure s11 therefore the steady state concentration of sulfachloropyridazine radicals scp ss can be approximately expressed as eq 8 8 scp ss k scp 3 dom 3 dom ss sc p k r phenol k f k p where scp represents concentration of anionic sulfachloropyridazine k r is the second order reaction rate constant between sulfachloropyridazine radical and the phenolic moieties k p is first order physical quenching rate constant k f is first order rate constant for sulfachloropyridazine radical to form products for the nrnom although its 3dom ss or hi 3dom ss are high and potentially able to oxidize anionic sulfachloropyridazine to form sulfachloropyridazine radicals most of the radicals can be quenched by the large amounts of phenolic moieties wenk and canonica 2012 on the contrary as phenol in the s dom is tenth of that in the nrnom scp ss in the s dom systems can be much higher leading to more sulfachloropyridazine radicals to undergo further degradation the ie values were determined to be 0 72 0 65 and 0 24 for sdom 1 sdom 2 and nrnom respectively figure s12 a low ie value corresponds to high inhibition effects of phenolic moieties in dom on the reaction between 3dom and the target pollutant wenk and canonica 2012 the ie value of nrnom is comparable to that reported for typical allochthonous dom such as nordic aquatic fulvic acid ie 0 25 with sulfamethoxazole as a target pollutant wenk and canonica 2012 ie of the s dom is about 3 times higher than that of nrnom indicating the inhibition effects induced by the phenolic moieties in the s dom is significantly lower than that in nrnom the determined phenol levels also support the conclusion as phenolic moieties are major electron donating capacity groups that contributes to the inhibition effect of dom since nrnom is rich in the phenolic moieties that can inhibit the reaction between sulfachloropyridazine and 3dom further inhibition effects of the additional phenols were partially neutralized by the intrinsic phenolic groups wenk and canonica 2012 as k scp 3dom is an apparent rate constant calculated based on eq 3 eq 6 the inhibition effects of phenolic moieties are included therefore it is the lower phenol in the s dom relative to that in the nrnom that leads to the higher k scp 3dom for the s dom as sdom 1 and sdom 2 have comparable phenol levels the slightly higher photoreactivity of 3sdom 1 towards sulfachloropyridazine can be due to the higher hi 3dom ss in the sdom 1 system than in the 3sdom 2 system 5 81 1 14 10 13 versus 3 78 0 22 10 13 m the current study highlights importance of determination of the phenolic moieties in dom photochemistry to the best of the authors knowledge this study is the first attempt to determine phenol for s dom although phenol for freshwater dom has been determined previously zhang et al 2014 nevertheless it deserves mentioning that the s dom used in the current study was extracted from coastal seawaters in dalian and it may not well represent s dom in seawaters in other regions further studies are necessary to extract s dom or freshwater dom from other water bodies to determine phenol in the dom and to evaluate the effects of phenol levels on photodegradation of omps in the natural water bodies 3 5 predicted photodegradation rates k obs in natural water bodies in previous studies second order reaction rate constants between omps and 3dom determined with dom analogs k omps 3analogs instead of dom were usually used to derive k obs of omps in natural waters chen et al 2019 vione 2020 zhou et al 2018 the current study has shown that k scp 3dom varies from different water bodies thus it is necessary to compare k obs predicted from the different k scp 3dom values with that employing the k scp 3analogs values li et al 2015 reported the k omps 3analogs value for sulfadiazine 2 9 109 m 1 s 1 determined using 4 carboxybenzophenone as a dom model zhou et al 2018 reported the k omps 3analogs value for sulfamethoxazole 2 7 108 m 1 s 1 determined using riboflavin as a dom model as there were no previous studies reporting the k scp 3analogs value for sulfachloropyridazine the k omps 3analogs values of sulfadiazine and sulfamethoxazole which have similar molecular structures to sulfachloropyridazine were adopted for the comparison table s5 lists the estimated day averaged indirect photolytic rate constants k ind avg apparent photolytic rate constants k obs avg and photolytic half lives t 1 2 at surface waters for sulfachloropyridazine in natural freshwater estuarine and seawater in the yellow river estuary it can be seen that k ind avg or k obs avg were largely overestimated when the k omps 3analogs value for sulfadiazine was adopted for the prediction which can be due to that k omps 3analogs of sulfadiazine was determined using 4 carboxybenzophenone and aromatic ketone is a main precursor of hi 3dom zhou et al 2019a for the estuarine water and seawater bodies the rate constants estimated with k scp 3dom or the k omps 3analogs value for sulfamethoxazole were comparable while for the freshwater the corresponding rate constants estimated from k omps 3analogs of sulfamethoxazole is much higher therefore the current study manifests significance of using the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps that is determined for dom of corresponding water bodies in accurate prediction of environmental photolytic persistence of omps 4 conclusions s dom is more efficient in inducing indirect photodegradation of sulfachloropyridazine than nordic reservoir natural organic matter nrnom an allochthonous freshwater dom 3dom is the most important ppri and 3dom of s dom exhibits remarkably higher reactivity towards sulfachloropyridazine than that of the nrnom the less phenolic antioxidants in the s dom relative to that in the nrnom contributes to the remarkbly higher second order reaction rate constant between 3dom of the s dom and sulfachloropyridazine the higher content of hi 3dom in the s dom impacted by mariculture can further increase the 3dom reactivity of the s dom to accurately predict photolytic persistence of omps in field water bodies it is of significance to determine the second order reaction rate constants between 3dom and target omps using dom extracted

17462,similar to the worldwide proliferation of urbanization micropollutants have been involved in aquatic and ecological environmental systems these pollutants have the propensity to wreak havoc on human health and the ecological system hence it is important to persistently monitor micropollutants in the environment micropollutants are commonly quantified via target analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry and the stable isotope labeled sil standard however the cost intensiveness of this standard presents a major obstacle in measuring micropollutants this study resolved this problem by developing data driven models including deep learning dl and machine learning ml to estimate the concentration of micropollutants without resorting to the sil standard our study hypothesized that natural organic matter nom could replace internal standards if there was a specific mass spectrum ms subset including nom information which correlated with an sil standard peak therefore we analyzed the ms to find the specific ms subsets for replacing the sil standard peak thirty five alternative ms subsets were determined for applying dl and ml as input data thereafter we trained four different dl models namely resnet101 googlenet vgg16 and inception v3 as well as three different ml models i e random forest rf support vector machine svm and artificial neural network ann a total of 680 ms data were used for the model training to estimate five different micropollutants namely sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole among the dl models resnet 101 exhibited the highest model performance showing that the average validation r2 and mse were 0 84 and 0 26 ng l respectively while rf was the best in the ml models manifesting r2 and mse values of 0 69 and 0 58 ng l the trained models showed accurate training and validation results for the estimation of the five micropollutant concentrations therefore this study demonstrates that the suggested analysis has a potential for alternative micropollutant measurement that has rapid and economic vantages graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant high resolution mass spectrometry deep learning machine learning 1 introduction the occurrence of micropollutants including pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aquatic environments has become a major issue because of industrialization and urbanization oaks et al 2004 worldwide reports claim that approximately 300 million tons of chemical compounds are released annually into the aquatic environment schwarzenbach et al 2006 in india and pakistan pharmaceutical contamination is responsible for the severe population collapse of common vulture species oaks et al 2004 it was reported that the japanese medaka fish suffered from vitellogenin induction due to pharmaceutical pollution hong et al 2007 dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt led to the decline of north american and european species of birds of prey by thinning their eggshells stokstad 2007 this type of contamination can also influence human health by increasing breast cancer potential in humans burkhardt holm 2010 recent studies have shown that pharmaceutical contamination can interfere with hormonal balance in human development grover et al 2011 hence it is important to persistently monitor micropollutants in environments to identify their specific existence which could be critical to bio ecosystems although these contaminants have been recognized to be environmentally risky it is difficult to establish monitoring systems for detecting all of them this is because the prevalence of chemical substances progresses rapidly whereas the existing risk assessment methods are time consuming cost intensive and require significant effort carpenter et al 2019 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been applied to estimate the concentration of micropollutants since it exhibits high mass accuracy 0 5 ppm and high resolving power 50 000 full width at half maximum fwhm park et al 2018b among the hrms techniques the orbitrap mass is a mainstream technique featuring a 2 ppm error and a resolving power of 100 000 fwhm chen and bester 2009 this approach has contributed to a wide range of studies on molecular characterization such as organic pollutant contamination pharmaceutical metabolism and proteomics makarov and scigelova 2010 using hrms the common method for quantifying micropollutants is target analysis that estimates the concentration with the standard substance of the target compound park et al 2018b the stable isotope labeled sil standard has also been used for improving the analytical precision and accuracy of the method chen and bester 2009 however there are some points to consider in obtaining validated data the expensive price of the standard is the major problem in measuring micropollutants one milligram of sil standard is generally sold at a price of 1 000 dollars because it is synthesized by replacing atoms in the molecular structure into stable isotopes such as 17o 13c and 2h compounds medical isotopes inc the sil standard is spiked for every sample for calculating target concentration these reasons increase the analytical cost although few studies have been conducted to find alternative methods legeron et al 2017 punt et al 2017 limitations remain specific compounds are still needed and the issue of low applicability to various compounds exists legeron et al 2017 developed a method to measure only bevacizumab and punt et al 2017 used 604 spiked samples to detect busulfan bu clofarabine clo and fludarabine f ara a therefore our study entailed uncovering alternative substances rather than applying internal standards using natural organic matter nom nom is ubiquitous and heterogeneous matter because it originates from various natural sources van agthoven et al 2019 nom is a broad term for the complex mixture of thousands of organic compounds observed in the water among the nom micropollutants mps can be defined as anthropogenic chemicals involving pharmaceutical pesticides personal care products and industrial chemicals in the aquatic environment so the more micropollutants the more likely it is that nom increases deep learning has been proposed as a promising technique since it is capable of handling big data szegedy et al 2015 among deep learning approaches the convolutional neural network cnn is especially useful to apply multidimensional and large sized image processing by capturing rich features from these data szegedy et al 2015 this method has been applied in various fields e g image recognition speech analysis and biology young et al 2018 until recently merely a few research works in the mass spectrometry field have been conducted using deep learning kantz et al 2019 zohora et al 2019 zohora et al 2019 used a deep learning model to identify peptides using mass spectrometry the trained model was adopted by the cnn as well as the recurrent neural network rnn this model provided higher peptide identification results than existing tools kantz et al 2019 reported the application of deep neural networks for the classification of mass spectral peaks they created image data based on ms information using deep neural networks this method can remove 90 of false peaks from mass data set these previous studies have focused on interpreting ms properties and peaks using deep learning however there are only a few studies regarding the estimation of micropollutants based on deep learning and mass spectra although mass spectrometry could become highly available as input data for deep learning this is because hrms normally produces 0 8 gb of data per sample containing the total ms of the sample nom mass information in the hrms data can be used as input data for machine and deep learning models because nom exists in the data as the background peak the developed model can provide an alternate method that estimates micropollutant concentration without using sil standards therefore the data driven models would reduce the analytical time and cost of mp analysis herein we suggested an economically friendly and rapid analysis method for estimating micropollutant concentration in aquatic environments using cnn we hypothesized that the molecular information of nom could replace the role of internal standards if there are specific peaks that correlate with an sil standard peak hundreds of analysis results from mass spectrometry were investigated to find the specific nom peak for replacing an sil peak then the micropollutant concentration was estimated based on cnn and the ml and dl models were compared the aims of this study were 1 to provide a novel insight into the application of nom 2 to suggest an alternative economically beneficial micropollutant analysis method and 3 to introduce a promising approach of combining analytical chemistry and deep learning techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 target micropollutants and sampling 2 1 1 target micropollutants we selected five target micropollutants that were detected in south korea namely sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole ji et al 2016 kim et al 2012 lee et al 2020a lee et al 2020b park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 these compounds showed generally the highest detection frequency and concentration in south korean water samples nakdong yeongsan hwapo upo hwang and jeon 2018 hyeonjeong yun 2019 kang and jeon 2018 kim et al 2012 park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 sulpiride is an antipsychotic drug prescribed for the treatment of depression taylor et al 2018 while metformin is used to treat people with diabetes maruthur et al 2016 and benzotriazole is a chemical compound that has various applications such as antifreeze and drug precursor sease 1978 niflumic acid and tebuconazole have been used for muscular pain and as a triazole fungicide knauf and mann 1984 muñoz leoz et al 2011 their chemical properties are described in table 1 2 1 2 sampling and sample pretreatment in our study a total of 680 ms data were used to estimate the micropollutants table s1 2 the data were composed of orbitrap analysis results of the target micropollutants from four natural water sampling sites hwapo hp 35 18 43 3 n 128 47 14 2 e nakdong nd 35 35 25 9 n 128 21

studies have reported that these regions have detected the micropollutants cho et al 2014 hwang and jeon 2018 hyeonjeong yun 2019 kang and jeon 2018 kim et al 2012 lee et al 2011 park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 son et al 2012 in addition these regions have the different watershed properties ys had an agricultural area and nd had the largest industrial area micropollutants were detected in hp and up ahn et al 2012 hwang and jeon 2018 kang and jeon 2018 these regions had multiple weirs and wetlands that can influence the formulation of chemical compounds they are vulnerable to enrichment and micropollutant changes therefore we selected nd ys hp and up as study sites monitoring in ys and nd was conducted from 2016 to 2017 and in up and hp from 2017 to 2018 every sample was pretreated to extract and concentrate the target substances by removing the interference according to the method propounded by park et al 2018b the samples were filtered with 0 7 µm glass fiber filters gf f whatman uk and a mixture of the sil standard including sulpride d3 metformin d6 and 1h benzotriazole d4 was injected into the sample table 1 a manually packed multi layer solid phase extraction spe cartridge was used to concentrate the target compounds the spe packing materials were composed of hlb resin 200 mg oasis waters usa env 150 mg international sorbent technology uk strata x aw 100 mg phenomenex uk and strata x cw 100 mg phenomenex uk a quantity of 1 l of the sample was loaded into the cartridge then the adsorbate was eluted with the mixture solution including ethyl acetate methanol ammonia and formic acid the eluent was concentrated with nitrogen gas the final volume of the sample was then adjusted to 1 ml and the concentrated sample was filtered with a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter advantec japan and stored at 4 c until mass analysis 2 2 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 xrs thermo fisher scientific usa coupled with orbitrap mass spectrometry q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the collected samples the reversed phase c18 column xbridge 50 2 1 mm particle size 3 5 µm waters was used for the separation of five targeted micropollutants the injection sample volume was 10 µl two mobile phases a di water and b methanol were used with a flow rate of 2ml min for the gradient elution mode initial 10 methanol within 4 min up to 50 methanol within 17 min up to 90 methanol holding the condition for 8 min and within 2 min column equilibrating time for next sample analysis the mass spectrometer was operated with electrospray ionization by positive and negative modes spray voltage 3800 v 3000 v sheath auxiliary gas flow 45 10 au ion sweep gas 2 au capillary temperature 350 c the full scan ms data were obtained at a mass resolution of 140 000 at a mass range of 100 1 500 m z and the automated gain control agc target value was 1 000 000 while the maximal injection time was 100 ms the standard concentrations of the target compounds were 10 50 100 300 and 500 ng l each sil standard was injected with 100 ng into 1 ml of each calibration solution quantification of the target compounds was conducted by the internal standard method 2 3 preparation of input data to apply ml and dl each ms is 3 dimensional data consisting of the intensity the retention time and mass charge mz every ms can present the intensity as a change in retention time rt and mass charge m z the rt is the time that solute passes through chromatography and the m z is defined by dividing the molecular mass by the ion charge number mills 1993 the ms can provide information about the fragmentation patterns of all organic compounds in the samples van agthoven et al 2019 the 680 raw ms data files from the orbitrap mass fig s2 a were converted into the mzxml data files by the rawconverter software he et al 2015 fig s2 b using the mzxml data files the matlab software can produce two dimensional ms fig s2 c matlab 2020 our study used the mzxmlread m and mzxml2peak m functions to extract mass information from the mzxml files fig 1 shows the preparation process of input data to find alternative subsets which correlate with the sil standard peak these alternative subsets can replace the sil standard peak and are used for the input data there are five steps to generate input data for deep learning 1 slicing the whole ms to the smaller candidate subsets fig 1 a 2 extracting a specific subset that includes the sil standard peak fig 1 b calculating the integration of each candidate subset and a specific subset including is sil peak and estimating the coefficient of determination r2 between the integrated volumes from both candidate subsets and the specific subset that includes the sil standard peak fig 1 c 4 extracting the specific subset that includes the target micropollutant peak fig 1 d and 5 establishing the input data which consisted of the 35 subsets that correlated with sil standard peak and one subset that included the target micropollutant peak fig 1 e in whole ms data the m z and rt had the ranges of 100 1000 and from 1 1020 s respectively after the data preparation step we divided the whole ms data into the candidate subsets fig 1 a the m z and rt widths of each subset were 5 m z and 5 s respectively thus one sample of ms produced 230 010 candidate subsets the specific subset including sil standard peak was also extracted to find the alternative subsets fig 1 b we then integrated these subsets fig 1 c using the information of these subsets the r2 was calculated between the integrated volumes of the candidate subsets and the specific subset to include the sil standard peak this step could identify the relationship between the alternative subsets and the specific subset to include the sil standard fig 1 c based on r2 we established the final alternative subsets that can replace the role of the sil standard peak fig 1 e the final alternative subsets were selected by the highest 35 of r2 correlated with the specific subset to include the sil standard these alternative subsets were then used as input data we then compared the alternative subsets with the ms of the suwannee river nom which was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss numerous research works have used the suwannee river nom as a representative nom gan et al 2015 the specific subset including the target micropollutant was extracted for using the input data fig 2 d these input data were applied to ml and cnn for estimating the micropollutant 2 4 estimation of micropollutants based on ml and dl input data consisted of the 35 alternative subsets rather than the sil standard peak and the one specific subset that contained the target micropollutant peak fig 2 a while the output was the concentration of target micropollutant these subsets needed to undergo a conversion process for applying to ml and dl fig 1 b in the case of ml the format of input should be vectorized as 1 n irick et al 2008 while for dl the format of input can be a 2 d matrix such as m n he et al 2016 therefore we converted these input subsets to 1 61992 and 287 216 for ml and dl respectively these data were then applied to ml and dl fig 2 c our study involved the use of rf svm and ann among other ml models in the case of dl we employed cnn with four different cnn structures namely googlenet szegedy et al 2015 inception v3 szegedy et al 2016 resnet 101 he et al 2016 and vgg16 russakovsky et al 2015 fig 3 model development and training utilized the nvidia gtx 1080 ti intel xeon cpu e 52687w v4 3 00 ghz and 128 gb ram the ml and dl were implemented using the machine and deep learning toolboxes in matlab matlab 2020 the explanation of ml and dl can be found in the supplementary information our study applied random sampling to divide training and validation sets from the observation uniform distribution was adopted for random sampling several studies have also used random sampling to divide the training and validation sets brion et al 2002 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 green et al 2006 sheikh ahmad and twomey 2007 tan and beklioglu 2006 we draw the box plot to compare the distribution between training and validation fig s3 the box plot showed that both the training and validation data sets had a similar distribution this indicates that our training data set was not skewed compared to the validation set 2 5 sensitivity analysis we conducted sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive ms subsets for estimating micropollutants the morris method was used for sensitivity analysis morris 1991 the spaces of each variables xi were discretized into p levels assuming a uniform distribution the elementary effects ees of the i th input are defined by the following equation morris 1991 1 e e i y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x k y x 1 x 2 x k δ where δ p 2 p 1 and y is an objective function the process is repeated for a predefined number of samples n in accordance to literature pianosi et al 2015 the number of samples was set to 300 herein the sensitivity metrics as proposed by morris 1991 were the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of each ee the mean μ indicates the overall influence of the parameter on the output whereas the standard deviation σ assesses the possible interaction effect with other parameters campolongo and braddock 1999 the range of each parameter that was applied during the sensitivity analysis table s3 was obtained from the minimum and maximum values of the input data we used the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox in our study pianosi et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration of micropollutants the concentrations of micropollutants analyzed herein are summarized in table s1 2 the yeongsan and nakdong river are the major rivers in korea the yeongsan river is used for irrigation water in a large agricultural area in southern jeolla province and is received the effluent discharged from the gwangju metropolitan area the nakdong river provides approximately 4 million m3 per day of drinking water for approximately 6 million residents the major industrial cities such as daegu gumi and busan are located in the nakdong river basin in korea 43 wetlands have been designated as wetland protected areas in recognition of their environmental and geological value including hp and up hp wetland is the largest river wetland in korea with an area of about 1 2 km2 from the middle to the downstream a total of 812 species including 422 plants 77 birds 175 insects 26 fish and 15 mammals is inhabiting in hwapo which was recognized as a wetland protected area by the ministry of environment on november 23 2017 up is the largest inland wetland in korea and the wetland behind the nakdong river used as a water source for gyeongsangnam do and busan metropolitan city the upo is habitat of 621 species involving plants birds aquatic insects mammals reptiles amphibians and shellfish and has a collective function of various organisms fig 4 shows the box plot of the micropollutants with the sampling sites the concentration levels varied substantially among the monitoring sites the highest concentrations of sulpiride was detected in the ys sampling site ranging from 554 41 13 418 ng l the nd site showed the second highest concentration range to sulpiride the samples in hp showed a similar range of concentrations with up but the mean value of hp was slightly greater than that of up in the case of metformin the concentration levels order was similar to that of sulpiride i e ys nd hp up the concentration of benzotriazole in nd was the highest among the sampling sites showing a mean value of 1 229 ng l and a concentration range of 240 3 406 ng l overall ys had a higher concentration of sulpiride and metformin while nd showed the highest benzotriazole mean this might be because the ys site is influenced by 31 waste and 11 manure treatment plants which might release these micropollutants cooper et al 2002 jung et al 2013 nd has numerous chemical manufacturing plants that might release benzotriazole into the river nakata and shinohara 2010 the averaged niflumic acid concentration showed 67 34 and 57 50 ng l in up and hp respectively these regions also had a similar standard deviation and median to niflumic acid tebuconazole concentration in up presented a higher mean and standard deviation than hp this is because up was located in an agricultural area kim and kim 2010 3 2 identifying the subsets for replacing the sil standard the ms of each sample was segmented into 230 010 subsets to investigate the optimal inputs for replacing the sil standard here we estimated the correlation between each of the candidate subset of ms and the specific subset of the sil standard as shown in fig 4 each micropollutant resulted in different candidates of subsets and the maximum r2 value of benzotriazole was smaller than the other pollutants herein the top correlated 35 subsets were selected to be the input data for further cnn modeling processes the selected subsets for sulpiride showed a similar pattern with metformin while benzotriazole resulted in totally different subsets which were mostly located from 100 850 m z and from 200 850 rt s the m z values of the subsets for sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole are ranged from 116 306 168 304 and 110 870 respectively and the rt values for those pollutants varied from 115 365 53 559 and 241 837 respectively the m z value of a subset reached up to 839 implying that it is closely related to the nom concentration in the sample kujawinski et al 2002 the sensitivity results are plotted against the types of micropollutant and models fig s4 the detailed sensitivity results are presented in table s5 s9 the sensitivity analysis was conducted using resnet 101 and rf because they showed the highest model accuracy between dl and ml respectively the result of each model was described in section 3 3 however the other models generated poorer simulation results compared to resnet 101 and rf furthermore these models cannot produce suitable sensitivity results due to insufficient model accuracy the larger mean value of ees showed that the subset has a higher overall influence on the output while the larger std value of ees indicated a greater interactions effect with other subsets campolongo and braddock 1999 in the case of sulpiride the m z of the sensitive subsets in resnet 101 ranged from 192 196 while its rt ranged from 169 189 the results of the sensitive subsets regarding the m z and rt in rf showed from 270 274 and from 149 253 respectively fig 5 in the metformin results the sensitive subsets in resnet 101 varied from 186 190 and from 51 55 for m z and rt respectively fig 5 the rf had range from 258 262 and from 223 227 for m z and rt respectively the sensitive subsets in sulpiride and metformin were affiliated with the component of relatively low molecular weight the m z can be equivalent to the molecular weight kujawinski and behn 2006 however the model to estimate benzotriazole exhibited that the sensitivity subsets had high molecular weights compared to the other pollutants the niflumic acid sensitivity subset showed that rt ranged from 41 to 61 sec while that of tebuconazole was from 378 to 489 sec this result demonstrated that the sensitive subsets properties were differed with micropollutant types fig s5 s6 presented the convergence plot with the number of iterations the convergence plot showed the change of sensitivity as increasing the model iterations using this plot we can identify the stability of the sensitivity result indicating the reliability of sensitivity analysis sarrazin et al 2016 the sensitivity of all micropollutants varied greatly until 3 000 model iterations while the sensitivity after 3 000 was stable for all micropollutants this result demonstrated that our sensitivity results were achieved using sufficient model iterations fig 6 shows the ms of the suwannee river nom which has been used as a representative nom standard gan et al 2015 the locations of 35 alternative subsets were marked on the ms of the suwannee river nom to confirm our hypothesis that the molecular information of nom can replace the role of the sil standard the most alternative subsets were mainly located in the area that provoked the ms peak of the suwannee river nom in particular the sensitive subsets were placed from 200 300 m z and from 110 400 rt s previous studies revealed that the m z range of humic acid ha was approximately from 100 600 while the m z of fulvic acid fa varied from 300 800 kujawinski et al 2002 ha and fa are the major components of nom zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 this implies that our subsets partially represented the properties of ha in nom 3 3 estimation of micropollutant concentration figs 7 11 show the training and validation performance to estimate the concentration of sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole these results were produced from four different cnn and three different ml models when validated resnet 101 had the highest r2 value and the lowest mse value showing average r2 and mse values of 0 79 and 0 33 ng l respectively this indicates that this model showed a relatively better model performance compared to the other cnn models cristofori et al 2007 in training resnet 101 also achieved the highest model performance among the cnn models googlenet showed that the simulated concentration was overestimated in the low concentration and underestimated in the high concentration indicating that this model was trained to have a narrow range of concentration compared to the other models inception v3 in metformin also presented the similar trend of googlenet in resnet all simulated the micropollutants had the broad distribution of concentration that showed good agreement with observations the model result of cnn demonstrated that the model performance differed depending on the cnn structure the model accuracy from resnet 101 was superior to inception v3 although previous research showed that these models had a similar model performance canziani et al 2016 chollet 2017 the major difference between these models was whether the model used the skip connection or parallel cnn szegedy et al 2016 this indicates that the skip connection approach was suitable to estimate micropollutant concentration with mass spectrometry in the skip connection the previous layer can connect to skipped layers which avoid the vanishing grading problem he et al 2016 while the inception model adopted the parallel convolutional layer having 1 1 3 3 and 5 5 filter sizes in addition the model performance increased as the number of layers increased which demonstrated that the number of layers were the influential factors to improve model accuracy according to previous research on cnns khan et al 2019 targ et al 2016 the model performance of neural nets was determined by the number of layers however higher number of layers can cause an increase in model complexity which might provoke the overfitting problem the model results correspond too closely to a training data set thereby failing to fit validation data and predict future simulation reliably cortes et al 2017 vgg16 and svm generated the worst results compared to the other models vgg16 was developed with the series of cnn goodfellow et al 2016 and svm was based on a maximum margin hyper plane schölkopf et al 1996 this reveals that the series that connected cnn and the maximum margin hyper plane are improper to train the model with the ms data set the series do not have a technique to prevent the vanishing gradient thereby producing the worst simulation results svm was less suitable to handle larger input features e g ms cheng et al 2007 to check the overfitting phenomenon the learning plot has been used james et al 2013 the learning plot herein is presented in fig s7 the learning plot is the loss of model training iterations iwai et al 2014 our learning curves did not show that the validation loss decreased and began to increase again which was not regarded as overfitting james et al 2013 the vgg model for niflumic acid increased sharply at 190 of epoch and the loss was then reduced the minimum validation loss was greater than that of the training loss table s10 previous results were also similar to ours pradhan et al 2017 zhu and zabaras 2018 among the ml models rf was the best model to estimate micropollutants showing the highest r2 value and the lowest mse value figs 7 11 the validation r2 and mse of rf were 0 68 and 0 52 ng l respectively the ml validation result showed that rf can estimate micropollutants though resnet 101 presented a better result than ml especially the rf model yielded a similar performance to inception v3 while svm cannot estimate micropollutant concentration the rf model was based on the tree ensemble while svm was used by the hyperplane breiman 2001 schölkopf et al 1996 this demonstrated that the appropriate model selection was significant for improving the simulated result cawley and talbot 2010 the performance of the model varied depending on the type of micropollutant as shown in figs 7 11 the model for sulpiride had a higher r2 and lower mse compared to the other models this was because the sulpiride data set showed the largest number of samples and standard deviation indicating that the data distribution was even higher than for the other micropollutants table s1 both the distribution and the amount of data highly influenced the model training procedure in particular the even data distributions can contribute to the reduction of skewed results when the model is applied by unusual data buzsáki and mizuseki 2014 therefore the data feature is important to yield well trained models he et al 2008 we compared the model performance with varying the number of input subsets as shown in fig s8 and s9 the subsets in fig s8 and s9 were selected based on the correlation with is and the sensitivity analysis in the case of the selected subsets by correlation with is resnet 101 showed that the model accuracy decreased with the decreasing number of input subsets in contrast the model accuracy of rf increased slightly until 25 of the input subsets and the accuracy decreased rapidly after 25 of the input subsets in the case of the selected subsets by sensitivity analysis the result of rf was similar to the case of the selected subsets by the correlation with is while the resnet 101 had different results compared to the previous case the optimal subset is presented in table 2 the most optimal method for selecting the subsets was the sensitivity analysis which resulted in a variation of the number of optimal subsets dependent on the type of substance and model resnet 101 estimating sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole exhibited the highest accuracy in 30 25 and 35 of the input subsets respectively while niflumic acid and tebuconazole had the highest accuracy in 15 of the subsets this result demonstrated that the model needed specific subsets with respect to the micropollutants the model performance was compared by reducing the number of observations as shown in fig s10 the model accuracy of both models decreased by reducing the data sets previous studies exhibited a decreased trend by reducing the sample size cho et al 2015 stretch et al 2013 among micropollutants niflumic acid highly depended on the sample size by showing that the model accuracy decreased rapidly with sample size because the concentration range of niflumic acid was smaller than the other micropollutants this might train the model using the skewed observation when reducing the sample size 3 4 comparison of model performance the ball charts are reported for sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole as shown in fig 12 this plot indicates the model validation accuracy training time and model size of the different model types the ball size was the model size corresponding to the model usability wherein the smaller size is easier for model inference than the larger model bianco et al 2018 from the plot resnet 101 had the greatest model accuracy and training time while vgg 16 showed the greatest model size vgg 16 showed not only that the model size was the highest but also that the model accuracy was the lowest vgg 16 used the sequential cnn layers without applying the additional structure which revealed that the model structure was more influenced by the model accuracy than the model size chollet 2017 especially the sequential cnn layers have a limitation in estimating the micropollutant with ms the additional structure e g parallel cnn and skip connection presented the better model performance than the sequential cnn though its model size was less than that of vgg 16 inception v3 and googlenet exhibited model sizes of 76 mb and 21 mb respectively these models adopted the parallel cnn which can reduce the model size if the number of cnn layers is increased szegedy et al 2016 resnet 101 had 156 mb and it was involved in the skip connection that could prevent the vanishing gradient problem with multiple cnn layers he et al 2016 the model accuracy and size were the key factors for the model selection this is because the model accuracy was related to the expected model performance while the model size was related to applicability in the actual situation malhotra and singh 2011 therefore the user should choose the appropriate model based on the limited computation power and cost in the case of ml all of the models involved the smaller model size and the shorter training time compared to the cnn models this is a strength of ml wherein the user can select the ml model without considering the time and computing power kim et al 2019 especially the rf model showed the highest model accuracy among the ml models as well as needed 24 mb as the model size this indicates that it did not need the high end computational power for model training and inference kim et al 2019 the user might be better off to select the rf model unless there is sufficient computational power e g gpu and cpu however resnet 101 had the most superior model accuracy than the other models for all the micropollutants provided that there is sufficient gpu and cpu it is better to select resnet 101 for estimating the concentrations of micropollutants 4 conclusions herein we adopted dl and ml models to estimate the concentration of micropollutants without sil standards a total of 680 ms data were used for the model training to apply dl and ml we identify the alternative subsets rather than the usage of the sil standard next we trained four different dl models and three different ml models finally this study compared the model performance depending on their types the major findings of this study are listed below 1 to apply dl and ml we determined the 35 alternative subsets rather than adopting the sil standard as input these subsets were selected by their correlation with the sil standard 2 among dl models resnet 101 showed the highest model performance by having the highest value of r2 and the lowest value of mse while rf was the best model in ml models showing the highest value of r2 and the lowest value of mse 3 on comparing the result of model performance and size resnet 101 had the more superior model accuracy than the other models in all the micropollutants with a model size of 156 mb while rf was the second best model with regard to model accuracy having a model size of 24 mb this indicated that the user should select model among resnet 101 and rf considering the computing power and model accuracy when the models were applied to estimating micropollutants the applied models showed accurate training and validation results for the estimation of five micropollutants namely sulpiride metformin benzotriazole tebuconazole and niflumic acid especially resnet 101 and rf were recommended for estimating the micropollutants indicating that the skip connection and tree structures were appropriated for measuring concentration of these the user can choice resent 101 and rf dependent on the computational power and measure accuracy the rf model is better unless there is sufficient computational power while resnet 101 is proper if that there is sufficient gpu and cpu these models can reduce the experimental cost of the micropollutant study without using the sil standard however to establish ai based micropollutant monitoring systems these limitations remain 1 expanding extra compounds with our suggested method because it can estimate five micropollutants and 2 training models using observations from various sites to increase model adaptability since a machine and deep learning model is developed using a large amount of data it is difficult to adjust the model in a short time if the characteristics of the data are changed it requires a certain amount of data to improve model accuracy however the composition of nom is stable because it is derived from decaying plant and animal matter in the regional ecosystem leenheer and croué 2003 park et al 2018a thus the machine learning model can be improved through continuous data acquisition further research will require additional monitoring with various compounds and sites which may increase the applicability and accuracy of the machine learning models hence the suggested models could be useful in establishing micropollutant monitoring systems for aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17462,similar to the worldwide proliferation of urbanization micropollutants have been involved in aquatic and ecological environmental systems these pollutants have the propensity to wreak havoc on human health and the ecological system hence it is important to persistently monitor micropollutants in the environment micropollutants are commonly quantified via target analysis using high resolution mass spectrometry and the stable isotope labeled sil standard however the cost intensiveness of this standard presents a major obstacle in measuring micropollutants this study resolved this problem by developing data driven models including deep learning dl and machine learning ml to estimate the concentration of micropollutants without resorting to the sil standard our study hypothesized that natural organic matter nom could replace internal standards if there was a specific mass spectrum ms subset including nom information which correlated with an sil standard peak therefore we analyzed the ms to find the specific ms subsets for replacing the sil standard peak thirty five alternative ms subsets were determined for applying dl and ml as input data thereafter we trained four different dl models namely resnet101 googlenet vgg16 and inception v3 as well as three different ml models i e random forest rf support vector machine svm and artificial neural network ann a total of 680 ms data were used for the model training to estimate five different micropollutants namely sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole among the dl models resnet 101 exhibited the highest model performance showing that the average validation r2 and mse were 0 84 and 0 26 ng l respectively while rf was the best in the ml models manifesting r2 and mse values of 0 69 and 0 58 ng l the trained models showed accurate training and validation results for the estimation of the five micropollutant concentrations therefore this study demonstrates that the suggested analysis has a potential for alternative micropollutant measurement that has rapid and economic vantages graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords micropollutant high resolution mass spectrometry deep learning machine learning 1 introduction the occurrence of micropollutants including pharmaceuticals and pesticides in aquatic environments has become a major issue because of industrialization and urbanization oaks et al 2004 worldwide reports claim that approximately 300 million tons of chemical compounds are released annually into the aquatic environment schwarzenbach et al 2006 in india and pakistan pharmaceutical contamination is responsible for the severe population collapse of common vulture species oaks et al 2004 it was reported that the japanese medaka fish suffered from vitellogenin induction due to pharmaceutical pollution hong et al 2007 dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane ddt led to the decline of north american and european species of birds of prey by thinning their eggshells stokstad 2007 this type of contamination can also influence human health by increasing breast cancer potential in humans burkhardt holm 2010 recent studies have shown that pharmaceutical contamination can interfere with hormonal balance in human development grover et al 2011 hence it is important to persistently monitor micropollutants in environments to identify their specific existence which could be critical to bio ecosystems although these contaminants have been recognized to be environmentally risky it is difficult to establish monitoring systems for detecting all of them this is because the prevalence of chemical substances progresses rapidly whereas the existing risk assessment methods are time consuming cost intensive and require significant effort carpenter et al 2019 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms has been applied to estimate the concentration of micropollutants since it exhibits high mass accuracy 0 5 ppm and high resolving power 50 000 full width at half maximum fwhm park et al 2018b among the hrms techniques the orbitrap mass is a mainstream technique featuring a 2 ppm error and a resolving power of 100 000 fwhm chen and bester 2009 this approach has contributed to a wide range of studies on molecular characterization such as organic pollutant contamination pharmaceutical metabolism and proteomics makarov and scigelova 2010 using hrms the common method for quantifying micropollutants is target analysis that estimates the concentration with the standard substance of the target compound park et al 2018b the stable isotope labeled sil standard has also been used for improving the analytical precision and accuracy of the method chen and bester 2009 however there are some points to consider in obtaining validated data the expensive price of the standard is the major problem in measuring micropollutants one milligram of sil standard is generally sold at a price of 1 000 dollars because it is synthesized by replacing atoms in the molecular structure into stable isotopes such as 17o 13c and 2h compounds medical isotopes inc the sil standard is spiked for every sample for calculating target concentration these reasons increase the analytical cost although few studies have been conducted to find alternative methods legeron et al 2017 punt et al 2017 limitations remain specific compounds are still needed and the issue of low applicability to various compounds exists legeron et al 2017 developed a method to measure only bevacizumab and punt et al 2017 used 604 spiked samples to detect busulfan bu clofarabine clo and fludarabine f ara a therefore our study entailed uncovering alternative substances rather than applying internal standards using natural organic matter nom nom is ubiquitous and heterogeneous matter because it originates from various natural sources van agthoven et al 2019 nom is a broad term for the complex mixture of thousands of organic compounds observed in the water among the nom micropollutants mps can be defined as anthropogenic chemicals involving pharmaceutical pesticides personal care products and industrial chemicals in the aquatic environment so the more micropollutants the more likely it is that nom increases deep learning has been proposed as a promising technique since it is capable of handling big data szegedy et al 2015 among deep learning approaches the convolutional neural network cnn is especially useful to apply multidimensional and large sized image processing by capturing rich features from these data szegedy et al 2015 this method has been applied in various fields e g image recognition speech analysis and biology young et al 2018 until recently merely a few research works in the mass spectrometry field have been conducted using deep learning kantz et al 2019 zohora et al 2019 zohora et al 2019 used a deep learning model to identify peptides using mass spectrometry the trained model was adopted by the cnn as well as the recurrent neural network rnn this model provided higher peptide identification results than existing tools kantz et al 2019 reported the application of deep neural networks for the classification of mass spectral peaks they created image data based on ms information using deep neural networks this method can remove 90 of false peaks from mass data set these previous studies have focused on interpreting ms properties and peaks using deep learning however there are only a few studies regarding the estimation of micropollutants based on deep learning and mass spectra although mass spectrometry could become highly available as input data for deep learning this is because hrms normally produces 0 8 gb of data per sample containing the total ms of the sample nom mass information in the hrms data can be used as input data for machine and deep learning models because nom exists in the data as the background peak the developed model can provide an alternate method that estimates micropollutant concentration without using sil standards therefore the data driven models would reduce the analytical time and cost of mp analysis herein we suggested an economically friendly and rapid analysis method for estimating micropollutant concentration in aquatic environments using cnn we hypothesized that the molecular information of nom could replace the role of internal standards if there are specific peaks that correlate with an sil standard peak hundreds of analysis results from mass spectrometry were investigated to find the specific nom peak for replacing an sil peak then the micropollutant concentration was estimated based on cnn and the ml and dl models were compared the aims of this study were 1 to provide a novel insight into the application of nom 2 to suggest an alternative economically beneficial micropollutant analysis method and 3 to introduce a promising approach of combining analytical chemistry and deep learning techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 target micropollutants and sampling 2 1 1 target micropollutants we selected five target micropollutants that were detected in south korea namely sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole ji et al 2016 kim et al 2012 lee et al 2020a lee et al 2020b park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 these compounds showed generally the highest detection frequency and concentration in south korean water samples nakdong yeongsan hwapo upo hwang and jeon 2018 hyeonjeong yun 2019 kang and jeon 2018 kim et al 2012 park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 sulpiride is an antipsychotic drug prescribed for the treatment of depression taylor et al 2018 while metformin is used to treat people with diabetes maruthur et al 2016 and benzotriazole is a chemical compound that has various applications such as antifreeze and drug precursor sease 1978 niflumic acid and tebuconazole have been used for muscular pain and as a triazole fungicide knauf and mann 1984 muñoz leoz et al 2011 their chemical properties are described in table 1 2 1 2 sampling and sample pretreatment in our study a total of 680 ms data were used to estimate the micropollutants table s1 2 the data were composed of orbitrap analysis results of the target micropollutants from four natural water sampling sites hwapo hp 35 18 43 3 n 128 47 14 2 e nakdong nd 35 35 25 9 n 128 21

studies have reported that these regions have detected the micropollutants cho et al 2014 hwang and jeon 2018 hyeonjeong yun 2019 kang and jeon 2018 kim et al 2012 lee et al 2011 park et al 2018b ryu et al 2014 son et al 2012 in addition these regions have the different watershed properties ys had an agricultural area and nd had the largest industrial area micropollutants were detected in hp and up ahn et al 2012 hwang and jeon 2018 kang and jeon 2018 these regions had multiple weirs and wetlands that can influence the formulation of chemical compounds they are vulnerable to enrichment and micropollutant changes therefore we selected nd ys hp and up as study sites monitoring in ys and nd was conducted from 2016 to 2017 and in up and hp from 2017 to 2018 every sample was pretreated to extract and concentrate the target substances by removing the interference according to the method propounded by park et al 2018b the samples were filtered with 0 7 µm glass fiber filters gf f whatman uk and a mixture of the sil standard including sulpride d3 metformin d6 and 1h benzotriazole d4 was injected into the sample table 1 a manually packed multi layer solid phase extraction spe cartridge was used to concentrate the target compounds the spe packing materials were composed of hlb resin 200 mg oasis waters usa env 150 mg international sorbent technology uk strata x aw 100 mg phenomenex uk and strata x cw 100 mg phenomenex uk a quantity of 1 l of the sample was loaded into the cartridge then the adsorbate was eluted with the mixture solution including ethyl acetate methanol ammonia and formic acid the eluent was concentrated with nitrogen gas the final volume of the sample was then adjusted to 1 ml and the concentrated sample was filtered with a 0 45 µm cellulose acetate filter advantec japan and stored at 4 c until mass analysis 2 2 high resolution mass spectrometry hrms liquid chromatography dionex ultimate 3000 xrs thermo fisher scientific usa coupled with orbitrap mass spectrometry q exactive plus thermo fisher scientific usa was used to analyze the collected samples the reversed phase c18 column xbridge 50 2 1 mm particle size 3 5 µm waters was used for the separation of five targeted micropollutants the injection sample volume was 10 µl two mobile phases a di water and b methanol were used with a flow rate of 2ml min for the gradient elution mode initial 10 methanol within 4 min up to 50 methanol within 17 min up to 90 methanol holding the condition for 8 min and within 2 min column equilibrating time for next sample analysis the mass spectrometer was operated with electrospray ionization by positive and negative modes spray voltage 3800 v 3000 v sheath auxiliary gas flow 45 10 au ion sweep gas 2 au capillary temperature 350 c the full scan ms data were obtained at a mass resolution of 140 000 at a mass range of 100 1 500 m z and the automated gain control agc target value was 1 000 000 while the maximal injection time was 100 ms the standard concentrations of the target compounds were 10 50 100 300 and 500 ng l each sil standard was injected with 100 ng into 1 ml of each calibration solution quantification of the target compounds was conducted by the internal standard method 2 3 preparation of input data to apply ml and dl each ms is 3 dimensional data consisting of the intensity the retention time and mass charge mz every ms can present the intensity as a change in retention time rt and mass charge m z the rt is the time that solute passes through chromatography and the m z is defined by dividing the molecular mass by the ion charge number mills 1993 the ms can provide information about the fragmentation patterns of all organic compounds in the samples van agthoven et al 2019 the 680 raw ms data files from the orbitrap mass fig s2 a were converted into the mzxml data files by the rawconverter software he et al 2015 fig s2 b using the mzxml data files the matlab software can produce two dimensional ms fig s2 c matlab 2020 our study used the mzxmlread m and mzxml2peak m functions to extract mass information from the mzxml files fig 1 shows the preparation process of input data to find alternative subsets which correlate with the sil standard peak these alternative subsets can replace the sil standard peak and are used for the input data there are five steps to generate input data for deep learning 1 slicing the whole ms to the smaller candidate subsets fig 1 a 2 extracting a specific subset that includes the sil standard peak fig 1 b calculating the integration of each candidate subset and a specific subset including is sil peak and estimating the coefficient of determination r2 between the integrated volumes from both candidate subsets and the specific subset that includes the sil standard peak fig 1 c 4 extracting the specific subset that includes the target micropollutant peak fig 1 d and 5 establishing the input data which consisted of the 35 subsets that correlated with sil standard peak and one subset that included the target micropollutant peak fig 1 e in whole ms data the m z and rt had the ranges of 100 1000 and from 1 1020 s respectively after the data preparation step we divided the whole ms data into the candidate subsets fig 1 a the m z and rt widths of each subset were 5 m z and 5 s respectively thus one sample of ms produced 230 010 candidate subsets the specific subset including sil standard peak was also extracted to find the alternative subsets fig 1 b we then integrated these subsets fig 1 c using the information of these subsets the r2 was calculated between the integrated volumes of the candidate subsets and the specific subset to include the sil standard peak this step could identify the relationship between the alternative subsets and the specific subset to include the sil standard fig 1 c based on r2 we established the final alternative subsets that can replace the role of the sil standard peak fig 1 e the final alternative subsets were selected by the highest 35 of r2 correlated with the specific subset to include the sil standard these alternative subsets were then used as input data we then compared the alternative subsets with the ms of the suwannee river nom which was purchased from the international humic substances society ihss numerous research works have used the suwannee river nom as a representative nom gan et al 2015 the specific subset including the target micropollutant was extracted for using the input data fig 2 d these input data were applied to ml and cnn for estimating the micropollutant 2 4 estimation of micropollutants based on ml and dl input data consisted of the 35 alternative subsets rather than the sil standard peak and the one specific subset that contained the target micropollutant peak fig 2 a while the output was the concentration of target micropollutant these subsets needed to undergo a conversion process for applying to ml and dl fig 1 b in the case of ml the format of input should be vectorized as 1 n irick et al 2008 while for dl the format of input can be a 2 d matrix such as m n he et al 2016 therefore we converted these input subsets to 1 61992 and 287 216 for ml and dl respectively these data were then applied to ml and dl fig 2 c our study involved the use of rf svm and ann among other ml models in the case of dl we employed cnn with four different cnn structures namely googlenet szegedy et al 2015 inception v3 szegedy et al 2016 resnet 101 he et al 2016 and vgg16 russakovsky et al 2015 fig 3 model development and training utilized the nvidia gtx 1080 ti intel xeon cpu e 52687w v4 3 00 ghz and 128 gb ram the ml and dl were implemented using the machine and deep learning toolboxes in matlab matlab 2020 the explanation of ml and dl can be found in the supplementary information our study applied random sampling to divide training and validation sets from the observation uniform distribution was adopted for random sampling several studies have also used random sampling to divide the training and validation sets brion et al 2002 caruana and niculescu mizil 2006 green et al 2006 sheikh ahmad and twomey 2007 tan and beklioglu 2006 we draw the box plot to compare the distribution between training and validation fig s3 the box plot showed that both the training and validation data sets had a similar distribution this indicates that our training data set was not skewed compared to the validation set 2 5 sensitivity analysis we conducted sensitivity analysis to identify sensitive ms subsets for estimating micropollutants the morris method was used for sensitivity analysis morris 1991 the spaces of each variables xi were discretized into p levels assuming a uniform distribution the elementary effects ees of the i th input are defined by the following equation morris 1991 1 e e i y x 1 x 2 x i 1 x i δ x k y x 1 x 2 x k δ where δ p 2 p 1 and y is an objective function the process is repeated for a predefined number of samples n in accordance to literature pianosi et al 2015 the number of samples was set to 300 herein the sensitivity metrics as proposed by morris 1991 were the mean μ and the standard deviation σ of each ee the mean μ indicates the overall influence of the parameter on the output whereas the standard deviation σ assesses the possible interaction effect with other parameters campolongo and braddock 1999 the range of each parameter that was applied during the sensitivity analysis table s3 was obtained from the minimum and maximum values of the input data we used the sensitivity analysis for everybody safe toolbox in our study pianosi et al 2015 3 results and discussion 3 1 concentration of micropollutants the concentrations of micropollutants analyzed herein are summarized in table s1 2 the yeongsan and nakdong river are the major rivers in korea the yeongsan river is used for irrigation water in a large agricultural area in southern jeolla province and is received the effluent discharged from the gwangju metropolitan area the nakdong river provides approximately 4 million m3 per day of drinking water for approximately 6 million residents the major industrial cities such as daegu gumi and busan are located in the nakdong river basin in korea 43 wetlands have been designated as wetland protected areas in recognition of their environmental and geological value including hp and up hp wetland is the largest river wetland in korea with an area of about 1 2 km2 from the middle to the downstream a total of 812 species including 422 plants 77 birds 175 insects 26 fish and 15 mammals is inhabiting in hwapo which was recognized as a wetland protected area by the ministry of environment on november 23 2017 up is the largest inland wetland in korea and the wetland behind the nakdong river used as a water source for gyeongsangnam do and busan metropolitan city the upo is habitat of 621 species involving plants birds aquatic insects mammals reptiles amphibians and shellfish and has a collective function of various organisms fig 4 shows the box plot of the micropollutants with the sampling sites the concentration levels varied substantially among the monitoring sites the highest concentrations of sulpiride was detected in the ys sampling site ranging from 554 41 13 418 ng l the nd site showed the second highest concentration range to sulpiride the samples in hp showed a similar range of concentrations with up but the mean value of hp was slightly greater than that of up in the case of metformin the concentration levels order was similar to that of sulpiride i e ys nd hp up the concentration of benzotriazole in nd was the highest among the sampling sites showing a mean value of 1 229 ng l and a concentration range of 240 3 406 ng l overall ys had a higher concentration of sulpiride and metformin while nd showed the highest benzotriazole mean this might be because the ys site is influenced by 31 waste and 11 manure treatment plants which might release these micropollutants cooper et al 2002 jung et al 2013 nd has numerous chemical manufacturing plants that might release benzotriazole into the river nakata and shinohara 2010 the averaged niflumic acid concentration showed 67 34 and 57 50 ng l in up and hp respectively these regions also had a similar standard deviation and median to niflumic acid tebuconazole concentration in up presented a higher mean and standard deviation than hp this is because up was located in an agricultural area kim and kim 2010 3 2 identifying the subsets for replacing the sil standard the ms of each sample was segmented into 230 010 subsets to investigate the optimal inputs for replacing the sil standard here we estimated the correlation between each of the candidate subset of ms and the specific subset of the sil standard as shown in fig 4 each micropollutant resulted in different candidates of subsets and the maximum r2 value of benzotriazole was smaller than the other pollutants herein the top correlated 35 subsets were selected to be the input data for further cnn modeling processes the selected subsets for sulpiride showed a similar pattern with metformin while benzotriazole resulted in totally different subsets which were mostly located from 100 850 m z and from 200 850 rt s the m z values of the subsets for sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole are ranged from 116 306 168 304 and 110 870 respectively and the rt values for those pollutants varied from 115 365 53 559 and 241 837 respectively the m z value of a subset reached up to 839 implying that it is closely related to the nom concentration in the sample kujawinski et al 2002 the sensitivity results are plotted against the types of micropollutant and models fig s4 the detailed sensitivity results are presented in table s5 s9 the sensitivity analysis was conducted using resnet 101 and rf because they showed the highest model accuracy between dl and ml respectively the result of each model was described in section 3 3 however the other models generated poorer simulation results compared to resnet 101 and rf furthermore these models cannot produce suitable sensitivity results due to insufficient model accuracy the larger mean value of ees showed that the subset has a higher overall influence on the output while the larger std value of ees indicated a greater interactions effect with other subsets campolongo and braddock 1999 in the case of sulpiride the m z of the sensitive subsets in resnet 101 ranged from 192 196 while its rt ranged from 169 189 the results of the sensitive subsets regarding the m z and rt in rf showed from 270 274 and from 149 253 respectively fig 5 in the metformin results the sensitive subsets in resnet 101 varied from 186 190 and from 51 55 for m z and rt respectively fig 5 the rf had range from 258 262 and from 223 227 for m z and rt respectively the sensitive subsets in sulpiride and metformin were affiliated with the component of relatively low molecular weight the m z can be equivalent to the molecular weight kujawinski and behn 2006 however the model to estimate benzotriazole exhibited that the sensitivity subsets had high molecular weights compared to the other pollutants the niflumic acid sensitivity subset showed that rt ranged from 41 to 61 sec while that of tebuconazole was from 378 to 489 sec this result demonstrated that the sensitive subsets properties were differed with micropollutant types fig s5 s6 presented the convergence plot with the number of iterations the convergence plot showed the change of sensitivity as increasing the model iterations using this plot we can identify the stability of the sensitivity result indicating the reliability of sensitivity analysis sarrazin et al 2016 the sensitivity of all micropollutants varied greatly until 3 000 model iterations while the sensitivity after 3 000 was stable for all micropollutants this result demonstrated that our sensitivity results were achieved using sufficient model iterations fig 6 shows the ms of the suwannee river nom which has been used as a representative nom standard gan et al 2015 the locations of 35 alternative subsets were marked on the ms of the suwannee river nom to confirm our hypothesis that the molecular information of nom can replace the role of the sil standard the most alternative subsets were mainly located in the area that provoked the ms peak of the suwannee river nom in particular the sensitive subsets were placed from 200 300 m z and from 110 400 rt s previous studies revealed that the m z range of humic acid ha was approximately from 100 600 while the m z of fulvic acid fa varied from 300 800 kujawinski et al 2002 ha and fa are the major components of nom zbytniewski and buszewski 2005 this implies that our subsets partially represented the properties of ha in nom 3 3 estimation of micropollutant concentration figs 7 11 show the training and validation performance to estimate the concentration of sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole these results were produced from four different cnn and three different ml models when validated resnet 101 had the highest r2 value and the lowest mse value showing average r2 and mse values of 0 79 and 0 33 ng l respectively this indicates that this model showed a relatively better model performance compared to the other cnn models cristofori et al 2007 in training resnet 101 also achieved the highest model performance among the cnn models googlenet showed that the simulated concentration was overestimated in the low concentration and underestimated in the high concentration indicating that this model was trained to have a narrow range of concentration compared to the other models inception v3 in metformin also presented the similar trend of googlenet in resnet all simulated the micropollutants had the broad distribution of concentration that showed good agreement with observations the model result of cnn demonstrated that the model performance differed depending on the cnn structure the model accuracy from resnet 101 was superior to inception v3 although previous research showed that these models had a similar model performance canziani et al 2016 chollet 2017 the major difference between these models was whether the model used the skip connection or parallel cnn szegedy et al 2016 this indicates that the skip connection approach was suitable to estimate micropollutant concentration with mass spectrometry in the skip connection the previous layer can connect to skipped layers which avoid the vanishing grading problem he et al 2016 while the inception model adopted the parallel convolutional layer having 1 1 3 3 and 5 5 filter sizes in addition the model performance increased as the number of layers increased which demonstrated that the number of layers were the influential factors to improve model accuracy according to previous research on cnns khan et al 2019 targ et al 2016 the model performance of neural nets was determined by the number of layers however higher number of layers can cause an increase in model complexity which might provoke the overfitting problem the model results correspond too closely to a training data set thereby failing to fit validation data and predict future simulation reliably cortes et al 2017 vgg16 and svm generated the worst results compared to the other models vgg16 was developed with the series of cnn goodfellow et al 2016 and svm was based on a maximum margin hyper plane schölkopf et al 1996 this reveals that the series that connected cnn and the maximum margin hyper plane are improper to train the model with the ms data set the series do not have a technique to prevent the vanishing gradient thereby producing the worst simulation results svm was less suitable to handle larger input features e g ms cheng et al 2007 to check the overfitting phenomenon the learning plot has been used james et al 2013 the learning plot herein is presented in fig s7 the learning plot is the loss of model training iterations iwai et al 2014 our learning curves did not show that the validation loss decreased and began to increase again which was not regarded as overfitting james et al 2013 the vgg model for niflumic acid increased sharply at 190 of epoch and the loss was then reduced the minimum validation loss was greater than that of the training loss table s10 previous results were also similar to ours pradhan et al 2017 zhu and zabaras 2018 among the ml models rf was the best model to estimate micropollutants showing the highest r2 value and the lowest mse value figs 7 11 the validation r2 and mse of rf were 0 68 and 0 52 ng l respectively the ml validation result showed that rf can estimate micropollutants though resnet 101 presented a better result than ml especially the rf model yielded a similar performance to inception v3 while svm cannot estimate micropollutant concentration the rf model was based on the tree ensemble while svm was used by the hyperplane breiman 2001 schölkopf et al 1996 this demonstrated that the appropriate model selection was significant for improving the simulated result cawley and talbot 2010 the performance of the model varied depending on the type of micropollutant as shown in figs 7 11 the model for sulpiride had a higher r2 and lower mse compared to the other models this was because the sulpiride data set showed the largest number of samples and standard deviation indicating that the data distribution was even higher than for the other micropollutants table s1 both the distribution and the amount of data highly influenced the model training procedure in particular the even data distributions can contribute to the reduction of skewed results when the model is applied by unusual data buzsáki and mizuseki 2014 therefore the data feature is important to yield well trained models he et al 2008 we compared the model performance with varying the number of input subsets as shown in fig s8 and s9 the subsets in fig s8 and s9 were selected based on the correlation with is and the sensitivity analysis in the case of the selected subsets by correlation with is resnet 101 showed that the model accuracy decreased with the decreasing number of input subsets in contrast the model accuracy of rf increased slightly until 25 of the input subsets and the accuracy decreased rapidly after 25 of the input subsets in the case of the selected subsets by sensitivity analysis the result of rf was similar to the case of the selected subsets by the correlation with is while the resnet 101 had different results compared to the previous case the optimal subset is presented in table 2 the most optimal method for selecting the subsets was the sensitivity analysis which resulted in a variation of the number of optimal subsets dependent on the type of substance and model resnet 101 estimating sulpiride metformin and benzotriazole exhibited the highest accuracy in 30 25 and 35 of the input subsets respectively while niflumic acid and tebuconazole had the highest accuracy in 15 of the subsets this result demonstrated that the model needed specific subsets with respect to the micropollutants the model performance was compared by reducing the number of observations as shown in fig s10 the model accuracy of both models decreased by reducing the data sets previous studies exhibited a decreased trend by reducing the sample size cho et al 2015 stretch et al 2013 among micropollutants niflumic acid highly depended on the sample size by showing that the model accuracy decreased rapidly with sample size because the concentration range of niflumic acid was smaller than the other micropollutants this might train the model using the skewed observation when reducing the sample size 3 4 comparison of model performance the ball charts are reported for sulpiride metformin benzotriazole niflumic acid and tebuconazole as shown in fig 12 this plot indicates the model validation accuracy training time and model size of the different model types the ball size was the model size corresponding to the model usability wherein the smaller size is easier for model inference than the larger model bianco et al 2018 from the plot resnet 101 had the greatest model accuracy and training time while vgg 16 showed the greatest model size vgg 16 showed not only that the model size was the highest but also that the model accuracy was the lowest vgg 16 used the sequential cnn layers without applying the additional structure which revealed that the model structure was more influenced by the model accuracy than the model size chollet 2017 especially the sequential cnn layers have a limitation in estimating the micropollutant with ms the additional structure e g parallel cnn and skip connection presented the better model performance than the sequential cnn though its model size was less than that of vgg 16 inception v3 and googlenet exhibited model sizes of 76 mb and 21 mb respectively these models adopted the parallel cnn which can reduce the model size if the number of cnn layers is increased szegedy et al 2016 resnet 101 had 156 mb and it was involved in the skip connection that could prevent the vanishing gradient problem with multiple cnn layers he et al 2016 the model accuracy and size were the key factors for the model selection this is because the model accuracy was related to the expected model performance while the model size was related to applicability in the actual situation malhotra and singh 2011 therefore the user should choose the appropriate model based on the limited computation power and cost in the case of ml all of the models involved the smaller model size and the shorter training time compared to the cnn models this is a strength of ml wherein the user can select the ml model without considering the time and computing power kim et al 2019 especially the rf model showed the highest model accuracy among the ml models as well as needed 24 mb as the model size this indicates that it did not need the high end computational power for model training and inference kim et al 2019 the user might be better off to select the rf model unless there is sufficient computational power e g gpu and cpu however resnet 101 had the most superior model accuracy than the other models for all the micropollutants provided that there is sufficient gpu and cpu it is better to select resnet 101 for estimating the concentrations of micropollutants 4 conclusions herein we adopted dl and ml models to estimate the concentration of micropollutants without sil standards a total of 680 ms data were used for the model training to apply dl and ml we identify the alternative subsets rather than the usage of the sil standard next we trained four different dl models and three different ml models finally this study compared the model performance depending on their types the major findings of this study are listed below 1 to apply dl and ml we determined the 35 alternative subsets rather than adopting the sil standard as input these subsets were selected by their correlation with the sil standard 2 among dl models resnet 101 showed the highest model performance by having the highest value of r2 and the lowest value of mse while rf was the best model in ml models showing the highest value of r2 and the lowest value of mse 3 on comparing the result of model performance and size resnet 101 had the more superior model accuracy than the other models in all the micropollutants with a model size of 156 mb while rf was the second best model with regard to model accuracy having a model size of 24 mb this indicated that the user should select model among resnet 101 and rf considering the computing power and model accuracy when the models were applied to estimating micropollutants the applied models showed accurate training and validation results for the estimation of five micropollutants namely sulpiride metformin benzotriazole tebuconazole and niflumic acid especially resnet 101 and rf were recommended for estimating the micropollutants indicating that the skip connection and tree structures were appropriated for measuring concentration of these the user can choice resent 101 and rf dependent on the computational power and measure accuracy the rf model is better unless there is sufficient computational power while resnet 101 is proper if that there is sufficient gpu and cpu these models can reduce the experimental cost of the micropollutant study without using the sil standard however to establish ai based micropollutant monitoring systems these limitations remain 1 expanding extra compounds with our suggested method because it can estimate five micropollutants and 2 training models using observations from various sites to increase model adaptability since a machine and deep learning model is developed using a large amount of data it is difficult to adjust the model in a short time if the characteristics of the data are changed it requires a certain amount of data to improve model accuracy however the composition of nom is stable because it is derived from decaying plant and animal matter in the regional ecosystem leenheer and croué 2003 park et al 2018a thus the machine learning model can be improved through continuous data acquisition further research will require additional monitoring with various compounds and sites which may increase the applicability and accuracy of the machine learning models hence the suggested models could be useful in establishing micropollutant monitoring systems for aquatic environments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

17463,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb combining photocatalysis with microbial degradation is an attractive wastewater treatment technology however when prepared in conventional ways the supported photocatalysts aggregate frequently detach easily from carriers and prohibit the colonization of microorganisms inside the carriers to overcome these challenges silane coupling agent sca enhanced tio2 coating method is developed in this study the coupling agent γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane kh560 greatly enhanced the adhesion between photocatalysts and the carrier through ether and ti o si linkages the dense tio2 layer was firmly adhered to the carrier outer surface and the loading amount reached 351 8 8 2 mg g over ten times higher than using the powder sintering method 31 5 2 4 mg g in the icpb system constructed with the kh560 enhanced tio2 supported polyurethane sponge kh560 tio2 pu carriers removal efficiencies of two model odor substances 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin gsm reached 88 9 0 3 and 85 0 1 0 in 12 h at an initial concentration of 500 ng l respectively which were 17 7 0 6 and 19 4 0 4 greater than those of the icpb system prepared with the powder sintering method after 5 operating cycles the novel icpb system remained stable with high 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies reaching 89 9 0 8 and 86 1 0 2 respectively after 12h while tio2 peeling ratio was as low as 5 0 2 8 biofilms attached onto the carrier inner surface were resilient over the operating cycles with the increase of both richness and diversity of microbial communities analysis of biofilm microbial community and pollutant degradation pathways revealed the enhanced removal of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system might be attributed to multiple factors first the alleviated aggregation and increased adhesion of photocatalysts onto carriers improved the overall photocatalysis efficiency second biofilm inside of the carrier was protected and the microbial activity was well remained third photocatalytic intermediate products were efficiently biodegraded by the enriched functional microbial populations such as thauera and flavobacterium with little concern of excessive oxidation collectively this research provides a new technological solution that synergizes photocatalysis and biodegradation for effective removal of odorous

geosmin gsm 1 introduction algae bloom triggered by eutrophication is attracting growing attention it does not only cause the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems but also produces odor substances during the growth and metabolism of algae suffet et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 threatening water supply quality and public health wu et al 2019 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin gsm are two most frequently detected algal odorants in natural water asquith et al 2018 and they can be detected easily at low levels by human olfactory sense concentrations davies et al 2004 and have bio accumulation and toxicity gagne et al 1999 nakajima et al 1996 moreover 2 mib and gsm are both saturated cyclic tertiary alcohols which are persistent and difficult to be removed by traditional water treatment processes removing odor substances in polluted natural water bodies has become a difficult problem although 2 mib and gsm can be removed by microbial degradation the degradation rates are quite slow izaguirre et al 1988 yuan et al 2012 indiscriminately rapid chemical reactions of advanced oxidation processes aops usually lead to accumulation of toxic by products and excessive residual of oxidation products collivignarelli et al 2004 wang et al 2015 yoon et al 2007 kim et al 2016 park et al 2017 which cannot achieve complete mineralization of odorous substances intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb may have the potential to repair the odorous substances polluted natural water icpb system has been applied for the removal of a variety of refractory organic substances in which photocatalysis and microbial degradation occur simultaneously li et al 2011 li et al 2012a yan et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 xiong et al 2017 yu et al 2020 ultraviolet uv light is commonly used to excite photocatalysis marsolek et al 2008 li et al 2011 li et al 2012a and refractory contaminants are decomposed by photocatalyst such as tio2 and photocatalytic intermediate products can rapidly permeate into the carrier and be completely mineralized by the biodegradation of the biofilm attached to the carrier inner surface xiong et al 2017 in ideal icpb systems photocatalysts are coated on the macroporous carrier eg polyurethane sponge outer surface while microorganisms colonize on the inner surface li et al 2012b however it remains challenging to achieve a tight and long lasting adhesion of metal based photocatalysts onto the hydrophobic outer surface of macromolecule carriers li et al 2019 while photocatalysts were coated by conventional procedures such as powder sintering and sol gel methods the photocatalysts has low load ratio and tend to aggregate reducing their catalytic efficiencies detachment of photocatalysts from the carrier is also frequent due to low adhesion strength moreover the photocatalysts are often coated on the carrier inner surface which prohibits the colonization of microorganisms li et al 2012b li et al 2019 ma et al 2015 silane coupling agents scas could improve the catalyst coating method because they have a strong bridging effect in combining organic and inorganic materials sang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 the molecular chemical structure of scas can be represented as y r six3 the x represents an alkoxy acetoxy halogen etc which can undergo a hydrolysis reaction to generate silanol hydroxyl groups si oh then si oh can chemically bond with the surface of inorganic materials the y represents a vinyl amino epoxy mercapto etc which can react with the polymer so that the silane can adhere to the surface of organic materials arkles 1977 in this study a modified sca enhanced tio2 coating method is developed which greatly improves the adhesion strength between photocatalysts and carriers the icpb system is used to remove 2 mib and gsm for the first time to explore the feasibility of icpb system for removing odor substances in polluted natural water firstly the selection of scas and preparation conditions are optimized on the basis of the loading amount and adhesion strength of tio2 the feasibility of this novel method is further evident by evaluating the accumulation of biofilm the 2 mib and gsm degradation efficiency and the stability of the novel icpb system in addition the removal mechanism of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system is proposed based on the analysis of intermediate

process at 150 c five 150 c and four step process at 150 c four 150 c the hydrolysis conditions were adjusted due to the differences in the optimal hydrolysis conditions of scas table s1 carriers

minutes precipitation for 10 minutes and drainage for 10 minutes at a volume exchange ratio of 50 after the sludge was acclimated and stabilized the tio2 supported sponges placed in a mesh bag were fixed in the activated sludge reactor for 12 d for microbial colonization then the carriers were cultured in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask on a shaker for 2 d 2 4 reactor setup and experimental methods

measure the infrared spectra of sponge carrier samples zhao et al 2012 colonized microbial morphology on the carrier surface was characterized by sem hitachi su 8010 japan according to our previous study zhang et al 2018a the biomass of living cells was characterized by atp from microorganisms on the carrier inner surface using the beyotime enhanced atp assay kit the live deadtm baclighttm bacterial viability kit was used to stain the dead and living cells then clsm lsm 710 was used to obtain the proportion of dead and live cells on the inner carrier surface the bacterial communities of attached biofilm were analyzed by the illumina miseq sequencing technology details of the sample collection in section s5 dna extraction 16s rrna gene pcr amplification and illumina miseq sequencing were consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018b all measurements were performed in triplicate the optimal tio2 coating procedure was obtained through orthogonal experiment and tio2 loading amount and adhesion strength were used as visual analysis indexs 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the sca enhanced tio2 coating method 3 1 1 optimization of scas and preparation steps of tio2 supported carriers the four step process and the coupling agent kh560 showed advantages in the tio2 loading amounts fig 1 a the amount of tio2 loaded on the carrier surface by four step process was significantly higher than that of the five step process 2 3 times it might be because the y moieties of scas were destroyed by the direct heating during the first heat curing step of the five step process abdolmaleki et al 2011 which subsequently reduced the coupling reaction between sca and pu sponge in the four step preparation high and stable tio2 loading was achieved 196 5 16 1 mg g 65 c 359 7 86 8 mg g 150 c when kh560 was used as the coupling agent as for kh550 or kh570 the tio2 loading amounts were more sensitive to temperature than kh560 this is in part because the epoxy group of kh560 is more efficient to react with amino and carboxyl groups of the polymer chains on sponge surface and form a stable chemical cross linkage the reaction could occur over a broad range of catalysis temperatures and the formed cross linked structure was of high thermal stability li et al 2014 functional groups on the carrier surface at different conditions were characterized by ati ft ir fig 1b c d the unloaded pu carrier has tensile vibration peak and deformation vibration peak of n h at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetrical tensile vibration peaks of c h at 2971 cm 1 and 2869 cm 1 and tensile vibration peaks of c o at 1103 cm 1 these peaks were detected in other tio2 supported carrier surfaces indicating that the polyurethane sponge carrier structure was not destroyed using three kinds of scas the peak intensity at 2971 cm 1 and 2869 cm 1 increased indicating the vibrational absorption peaks of the three scas molecular groups ch2 increase of the peak intensity at 1103 cm 1 was presumed to be the result of the superposition of ti o si stretching vibration and c o stretching vibration indicating that the hydroxyl group produced by the hydrolysis of the scas x groups and the hydroxyl group of tio2 surface formed ti o si by dehydration reaction zhao et al 2012 this observation demonstrated that three scas successfully adhered to tio2 as for the connection to the surface of the pu carrier the peaks at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 increased while using kh550 indicating that the y group nh2 of kh550 bonded with the sponge surface by forming n h while using kh560 as the coupling agent the absorption peak intensity at 3295 cm 1 increased indicating that the surface of the carrier had an o h stretching vibration absorption peak the peak strength of c o tensile vibration peak at 1225 cm 1 increased speculating that the epoxy functional group at the end of kh560 y group och2ch o ch2 generated hydroxyl groups by the ring opening reaction and bonded with the sponge surface by generating unsaturated ether bonds kh570 increased the peak strength of the stretching vibration peaks at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 indicating that the c o or c c at the end of the kh570 y group ch2 c ch3 coo was still retained with no or little portion of chemical bonding with the functional groups of the carrier surface anatase has the highest photocatalytic activity among all crystalline forms of tio2 and is most widely used in photocatalysis bavykin et al 2006 kobayashi et al 2008 according to the xrd spectrum fig s2 the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 and the corresponding crystal planes were 101 004 200 211 and 204 respectively indicating that the nano tio2 used in this study was anatase tio2 pu sponge had a characteristic peak only at 2θ 19 88 for the tio2 supported carriers using different coating procedures in addition to the characteristic peaks of the pu carrier at 2θ 19 88 the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase also appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 identical to the nano tio2 powders these results indicated that the anatase tio2 crystal form was not affected by the adhesion with pu sponge carriers through the observation of supported tio2 on the sponge surface fig s3 the aggregation of tio2 was found to be significantly alleviated when the four step preparation was employed especially when kh560 was used as the coupling agent the carrier outer surface was coated with a layer of uniform and dense tio2 the reason might be that sca diminished the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the nanoparticles which stabilized the nanoparticles and prevented the aggregation in organic solutions zhao et al 2012 matinlinna et al 2018 little tio2 was observed on the carrier inner surface creating tio2 coated pu sponges ideal for supported photocatalysis overall our results confirmed the feasibility of a four step method with kh560 as the sca to produce tio2 coated pu sponges since this approach obtained the better photocatalyst coating effect and provided a tio2 free non toxic inner surface for biofilm growth and acclimation on the contrary low tio2 surface bonding and agglomeration still occurred in the five step preparation and the powder sintering method 3 1 2 optimization of preparation conditions kh560 and the four step method were selected according to the above selection with variables of the alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution hydrolysis time concentration of kh560 and heat curing temperature each variable was tested at three levels to design orthogonal experiments table 2 visual analysis used tio2 loading amount and adhesion strength as indexes table s3 results of orthogonal experiments showed that all tio2 loading amounts under different conditions were about 200 mg g 400 mg g adhesion strength of all nine sets was strong the tio2 peeling ratios were lower than 5 except for the three sets 6 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 15 of c kh560 85 c 8 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 25 of c kh560 65 c 10 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 5 of c kh560 105 c after 12 hour stirring the order of effects of various factors on the index of tio2 loading amount was kh560 concentration heat curing temperature hydrolysis time alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution the optimal conditions were determined as alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 15 heat curing temperature of 85 c the order of effects of various factors on the index of tio2 adhesion strength was hydrolysis time heat curing temperature kh560 concentration alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution the optimal conditions were determined as alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 25 heat curing temperature of 85 c as the kh560 concentration had less effect on tio2 adhesion strength which was sufficiently high as 95 3 when the kh560 concentration was 15 therefore the optimal kh560 concentration of 15 was selected collectively kh560 tio2 pu carriers was prepared by kh560 and the four step preparation method with alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 15 heat curing temperature of 85 c this tio2 coated carrier was designated as kh560 tio2 pu carrier compared with previous works li et al 2012b coated tio2 onto the pu sponge by the low temperature sintering method diluted method diluted and no additive method respectively and the loading amount was 0 3 0 264 0 24 g g carrier calculated as ti respectively li et al 2019 used powder spraying method and sol gel method respectively to coat biocl bi2wo6 bi to pu carrier the weight loss rates after 60h were 73 and 96 respectively the trimesic acid in the diluted method and the polyurethane waterproof coating in the powder spraying method was also used as a binder but kh560 enhanced coating method had advantages in simultaneously achieving high tio2 loading amount 0 352 g g thin and uniform catalytic layer and high loading strength 3 2 removal of 2 mib and gsm by the icpb system with kh560 tio2 pu carriers 3 2 1 removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm for the 2 mib removal at an initial concentration of 501 1 14 4 ng l for 12 h the icpb sca system showed higher 2 mib removal efficiency fig 2 a in the first 0 5 h 2 mib removal in the ad system was close to those in other systems indicating that the initial removal of 2 mib was primarily due to adsorption the 2 mib concentration in ad system decreased to the plateau of 210 ng l in 1 h suggesting an equilibrium of adsorption and desorption the final removal efficiency of the ad system was 60 2 1 6 within 12 h with 2 mib concentration leveled at 199 2 8 0 ng l the 2 mib removal efficiency of the b system was 69 9 0 8 slightly higher than the ad system these results indicated that the most of 2 mib loss was due to adsorption and only a small portion of 2 mib was directly biodegraded in the b system this concurs with previous studies revealing 2 mib is recalcitrant for the biodegradation in the natural environment 2 mib removal efficiency of the p system reached 78 7 1 0 within 12 h with 2 mib residual concentration of 106 8 4 9 ng l indicating the highly effective photocatalytic degradation of 2 mib by nano tio2 in the icpb sca system the lowest 2 mib concentration among all treatments 162 12 3 ng l was observed after 4 h probably because the detaching of the biofilm on the carrier outer surface resulted in a larger uv illuminating area for tio2 which accelerated the photocatalytic reaction li et al 2011 dong et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 in 12 h 88 9 0 3 of the 2 mib removal was achieved lingering 2 mib concentration as low as 55 9 1 5 ng l the 2 mib removal in the icpb sca system was superior to the p system that might be due to the biodegradation of the intermediates reduced the competition for photocatalytically generated free radicals which made these free radicals more readily available to attack 2 mib xiong et al 2017 gsm removal with an initial concentration of 504 0 24 3 ng l was observed in a similar fashion to 2 mib in all tested systems fig 2b the removal efficiency of 39 3 1 5 in the ad system was similar to those in other systems in the first 0 5 h indicating that adsorption dominated the early gsm removal later it became stable around 49 0 0 7 in 12 h the gsm concentration in the icpb sca system was the lowest 224 5 3 2 ng l after 1 h among all treatments after 12 h of reaction the icmb sca system had the highest gsm removal efficiency of 85 0 1 0 with the final concentration reduced to 75 7 5 0 ng l higher than those in the p system 72 7 1 7 and the b system 56 1 2 9 the 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies of the icpb system with the powder sintering method were 71 2 2 7 and 65 6 2 5 respectively comparing with the icpb system the 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies of the icpb sca system increased by 17 7 0 6 and 19 4 0 4 respectively indicating that the kh560 tio2 pu carriers significantly improved removal efficiency of odor substances the novel icpb system showed advantages compared with other processes for removing odor substances yuan et al 2012 isolated four kinds of bacteria from biological activated carbon the removal efficiencies of 2 mib 515 ng l were in the range from 92 8 to 98 4 but it needed 9 12 d the biodegradation of 1 6 7 mg l 2 mib in mixed cultures took 5 14 d izaguirre et al 1988 the uv o3 system removed 90 of 2 mib and gsm with an initial concentration of 200 500 ng l within 2 3 minutes only but caused incomplete mineralization and aldehydes accumulation collivignarelli et al 2004 for the photocatalysis tio2 p25 as the photocatalyst could remove 99 of gsm and 2 mib 10 nm within 60 minutes lawton et al 2003 and fe n co doped tio2 as the visible light photocatalyst could reduce the initial concentration of 1μg l of gsm and 2 mib to below 10 ng l within 5h yuan et al 2018 however the directionless degradation of the photocatalysis also easily leads to incomplete mineralization of intermediates accumulation yoon et al 2007 kim et al 2016 park et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 3 2 2 stability of the icpb system with kh560 tio2 pu carriers removal of both 2 mib and gsm in the icpb sca system maintained high stability over 5 operating cycles fig 3 a and b the removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm were 89 9 0 8 and 86 1 0 2 during the fifth 12 h cycle respectively 2 mib concentration decreased to 8 9 2 8 ng l with the degradation efficiency of 98 2 0 6 after 18 h in the fifth cycle gsm concentration decreased to 9 2 1 0 ng l achieving a degradation efficiency of 98 16 0 2 after 24h after five cycles of operation both of 2 mib and gsm can be degraded to concentrations lower than 10 ng l meeting stringent standards indicated in the sanitary standards for drinking water gb 5749 2006 china the tio2 loading amount on carriers decreased slightly after 5 operating cycles fig 3c showing endured adhesion strength when kh560 was used as the adhesive agent after the total of 5 running cycles of continuous operation the loading amount was slightly reduced from the initial 351 8 8 2 mg g to 334 2 10 0 mg g resulting in a peeling ratio as low as 5 0 2 8 in contrast when the powder sintering method was employed for tio2 adhesion the peeling ratio of 16 5 was observed after operating for 12 h with an initial loading amount of 31 5 2 4 mg g these results further confirmed kh560 enhanced and elongated tio2 coating which significantly increased the photocatalyst loading amount and adhesion strength between tio2 and pu sponge carrier fig 4 a shows the photocatalysis and biofilm distribution on the carrier surface during 5 cycles in the icpb sca system before the operation both inner and outer surfaces of the kh560 tio2 pu carrier were successfully enriched with a large amount of cocci and bacillus wrapped in extracellular polymeric substances during the circle experiment the photocatalyst layer on the carrier outer surface was still firmly coated on the pu carrier and the amount of biofilm colonized on the inner surface was constantly well maintained at a high level it is worth noting that the biofilm on the outer surface gradually detached due to the influence of uv light and active oxygen radicals which as a result exposed more photocatalysts to light illumination rittmann 2018 this could partially explain the degradation efficiency of 2 mib and gsm in the icpb sca system exceeded control systems in the late stage of reaction li et al 2011 li et al 2012b dong et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 the fig 4b shows that the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase still appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 indicating that the anatase crystal form with high photocatalytic activity was not changed after 5 operating cycles therefore the stability of the icpb sca system was confirmed over multiple cycles of operation kh560 enhanced tio2 coating method made the tio2 photocatalyst firmly coated on the pu carrier outer surface with strong adhesion strength and active microorganisms colonized inside the carrier protected by the photocatalysts 3 3 proposed removal mechanisms of 2 mib and gsm in the sca enhanced icpb system 3 3 1 intermediates of 2 mib and gsm degradation 16 intermediate products in the icpb sca system after 5 cycle degradation experiment were detected by gc ms full scan analysis table s5 containing dehydrated products 4 species terpenes 3 species alcohols 5 species esters 2 species and organic acids 2 species fig 5 shows the possible degradation pathways of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system based on the analysis of intermediate products 2 mib and gsm were first converted by dehydration and then converted into terpenes alcohols esters organic acids and other biodegradable intermediate products through free radical attack a variety of reactive oxygen species were produced in the tio2 photocatalytic degradation including h e oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 hashimoto et al 2005 and hydroxyl radicals deoxidized most of the organic matters in water which was proposed to play a decisive role in the photocatalytic oxidation marsolek et al 2008 fotou et al 1996 the 2 mib dehydration products 2 methyl 2 bornene and 2 methylenebornane and the gsm dehydration product 1 4 dimethyl admantane were all detected in both icpb sca and p systems these dehydration products and alcohol ethers aldehydes and other subsequent products were also reported in previous uv photolysis experiments kim et al 2016 cyclopentene type intermediate products exist in our systems which were also detected in the previous study of photocatalytic degradation of 2 mib yoon et al 2007 however park et al 2017 found that no gsm dehydration products were detected in the photo fenton removal process of 2 mib and gsm while 2 mib dehydration products 2 methyl 2 bornene and 2 methylenebornane ring opening products butyl butyrate 2 ethyl 1 hexanol and nonanal were obtained compared to the p system four over oxidized intermediate aldehydes products were missing in the icpb sca system table s5 suggesting that immediate biodegradation avoided undesirable oxidation and aldehyde accumulation in photocatalysis yu et al 2020 the indiscriminate and fast acting radicals of photocatalysis could produce a range of toxic too oxidized or unavailable for biodegradation products and much of radicals would be spent reacting with already biodegradable organics marsolek et al 2008 the aldehyde accumulation and incomplete mineralization of 2 mib and gsm was also reported in a uv o3 photocatalysis system collivignarelli et al 2004 our results indicated that the icpb sca system could effectively avoid the excessive oxidation and accumulation of the intermediate products that frequently occur in photocatalysis treatment systems in the icpb sca system microorganisms might timely removed a portion of the biodegradable intermediate products to achieve final mineralization and the chemical oxidant could more focus on the recalcitrant compounds on the contrary in the p systems intermediates are likely to be excessively oxidized forming and accumulating toxic aldehyde products in order to analyze the roles of microorganisms in the biotransformation of odor substances and their intermediate products microbial analysis was performed below 3 3 2 microbial activity and community of inner biofilm atp stores and transports energy for the vital activities and can be used to characterize the biomass of living cells fig 6 a shows that the atp amount of biofilm in the icpb sca system and the b system increased after 5 operating cycles from 74 1 0 9 ng g to 117 2 5 7 ng g and 99 1 0 7 ng g respectively it suggested that the biofilm colonization in the interior of carriers was stable and the microbial activity remained well although the biofilm on the sponge outer surface was detached in the icpb sca system two reasons might lead to the increase of the atp amount of biofilm in the icpb sca system one was that the microbial community structure succession inside the carrier maintained biomass and activity through self regulation xiong et al 2017 the second was that the various intermediates produced by photocatalysis provided a rich variety of carbon sources and improve the activity of biofilm yoon et al 2007 yuan et al 2018 the clsm images of biofilm in the carrier interior are shown in fig 6b it was calculated that the ratio of microbial live dead cells of the icpb sca system and the b system carrier decreased from 1 17 0 05 to 1 02 0 05 and 0 99 0 05 respectively it also proved that the biofilm of the icpb sca system was not significantly deactivated by the toxic effects of uv light and reactive oxygen free radicals li et al 2012a microbial community analysis revealed the increase of diversity and richness of microorganisms in the attached biofilm shannon index and simpson index represent biodiversity observed species index chao1 index and ace index represent species richness the statistical results of the alpha diversity of the biofilm attached on carriers table s4 showed that the observed species index shannon index simpson index chao1 index and ace index of the biofilm of novel icpb system were 482 6 36 0 97 490 37 and 491 18 respectively all greater than those observed in the original biofilm before the operation which were 465 5 88 0 96 472 07 and 475 45 respetively this suggests that the icpb operation can improve the richness and diversity of the microbial communities in biofilms on the carrier surface however the microbial community in the b system only have shannon and simpson indexes 6 35 and 0 97 respectively higher than those of the original biofilm observed species chao1 and ace indexes were 449 450 67 and 452 40 respectively all lower than those of the original biofilm it showed that the microbial diversity on the sponge surface increased and the richness decreased in the b system the differences between the icpb sca system and the b system were probably due to that the microorganisms inside of the carrier were protected from the exposure to odorous substances and provided more bioavailable intermediate products according to the 2 mib and gsm degradation pathway the microbial community analysis of biofilms at the genus level is present in fig 6c and fig s5 community structure at phylum level in fig s4 the dominant genera on the carriers included zoogloea thauera acinetobacter comamonas brevundimonas and flavobacterium zoogloea accounted for the highest proportion reaching 22 2 19 9 and 24 6 in original biofilm b system biofilm and icpb sca system biofilm respectively previous studies reported that zoogloea spp could secrete extracellular polymeric substances and grow in large quantities to form bacterial micelles which not only had a bridging effect but also improved the resistance of biofilms liu et al 2010 thus dominance of zoogloea spp on the carrier surface promoted the microbial colonization and biofilm formation and increased the tolerance of the biofilm to handle influents of varying compositions thauera spp were confirmed to play an important role in the conversion of terpenes and other refractory compounds hylemon et al 1998 accounting for 14 8 12 0 and 15 0 in the biofilms of original b system and icpb sca system respectively the enrichment of thauera spp in the icpb sca system biofilm was probably caused by the production of terpenoids from photocatalysis flavobacterium spp was found with the ability of degrading 2 mib egashira et al 1992 accounting for 0 54 3 6 and 2 4 of the biofilms of original b system and icpb sca system respectively in addition stenotrophomonas spp and sphingopyxis spp which were previously reported with the ability to degrade odor substances hoefel et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 were also enriched on carriers in b and icpb sca systems accounting for 0 24 and 0 15 0 15 and 0 16 respectively it indicated that a little odor substance could be directly utilized by the functional microorganisms in addition to the photocatalytic degradation in the icpb sca system 3 3 3 the synergy of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the sca enhanced icpb system combining the analysis of 2 mib and gsm degradation intermidiates with the changes of microbial activity and community structures the synergy of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the novel icpb system is shown in fig 7 the odorous substances are first adsorbed rapidly on the surface of the sponge and then produce the dehydration intermediate products which are further ring opened to generate biodegradable intermediates such as terpenes alcohols esters and organic acids with lower molecular weights through tio2 photocatalysis some of biodegradable intermediates are converted by photocatalysis but most of them are decomposed and utilized by active functional microorganisms enriched on the inner surface of carriers such as thauera spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas spp and sphinopyxis spp a little of 2 mib and gsm is also directly degraded and utilized by microorganisms our novel icpb system also exhibits multiple properties for the improvement of 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies firstly the enhancement of the photocatalyst s adhesive strength and the reduction of the aggregation improved photocatalysis efficiency and promised long term stability the removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm by the photocatalytic system using the new loading method were higher than those of the icpb system using the powder sintering method secondly the photocatalyst is only coated on the external surface of carriers leaving the colonization space inside the carrier for biofilm acclimation 2 mib and gsm were toxic to aquatic organisms nakajima et al 1996 gagne et al 1999 and uv light zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 cai et al 2019 and free radicals li et al 2012b ma et al 2015 rittmann 2018 have also been reported to destroy microorganisms and worsen the shedding of biofilms however biofilm inside of the carrier was protected and the microbial activity was well remained in the sca enhanced icpb system thirdly due to the tight combination of biodegradation and photocatalyst intermediate products can be exchanged rapidly enriching more functional microorganisms such as zoogloea spp thauera spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas spp and sphinopyxis spp which can degrade intermediate products such as terpenes alcohols esters and organic acids to avoid excessive oxidization 4 conclusions in summary the preparation method of kh560 enhanced tio2 supported pu sponge kh560 tio2 pu carriers for the icpb system was developed which formed a uniform and dense tio2 layer firmly coated on the carrier outer surface and the colonization of microorganisms on the inner surface was well protected the icpb system was first applied to degrade 2 mib and gsm the novel icpb system constructed with kh560 tio2 pu carriers significantly improved removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm and the system maintained an exceptional removal efficiency and stability even after several operating cycles besides the diversity and abundance of microorganisms were increased enabling multiple pathways for 2 mib and gsm removal and reducing the accumulation of photocatalytic intermediate products this study proved the feasibility of the supported photocatalyst preparation method providing a new treatment technology

17463,intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb combining photocatalysis with microbial degradation is an attractive wastewater treatment technology however when prepared in conventional ways the supported photocatalysts aggregate frequently detach easily from carriers and prohibit the colonization of microorganisms inside the carriers to overcome these challenges silane coupling agent sca enhanced tio2 coating method is developed in this study the coupling agent γ glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane kh560 greatly enhanced the adhesion between photocatalysts and the carrier through ether and ti o si linkages the dense tio2 layer was firmly adhered to the carrier outer surface and the loading amount reached 351 8 8 2 mg g over ten times higher than using the powder sintering method 31 5 2 4 mg g in the icpb system constructed with the kh560 enhanced tio2 supported polyurethane sponge kh560 tio2 pu carriers removal efficiencies of two model odor substances 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin gsm reached 88 9 0 3 and 85 0 1 0 in 12 h at an initial concentration of 500 ng l respectively which were 17 7 0 6 and 19 4 0 4 greater than those of the icpb system prepared with the powder sintering method after 5 operating cycles the novel icpb system remained stable with high 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies reaching 89 9 0 8 and 86 1 0 2 respectively after 12h while tio2 peeling ratio was as low as 5 0 2 8 biofilms attached onto the carrier inner surface were resilient over the operating cycles with the increase of both richness and diversity of microbial communities analysis of biofilm microbial community and pollutant degradation pathways revealed the enhanced removal of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system might be attributed to multiple factors first the alleviated aggregation and increased adhesion of photocatalysts onto carriers improved the overall photocatalysis efficiency second biofilm inside of the carrier was protected and the microbial activity was well remained third photocatalytic intermediate products were efficiently biodegraded by the enriched functional microbial populations such as thauera and flavobacterium with little concern of excessive oxidation collectively this research provides a new technological solution that synergizes photocatalysis and biodegradation for effective removal of odorous substances in polluted natural water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb silane coupling agent tio2 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib geosmin gsm 1 introduction algae bloom triggered by eutrophication is attracting growing attention it does not only cause the deterioration of aquatic ecosystems but also produces odor substances during the growth and metabolism of algae suffet et al 1996 zhang et al 2009 threatening water supply quality and public health wu et al 2019 2 methylisoborneol 2 mib and geosmin gsm are two most frequently detected algal odorants in natural water asquith et al 2018 and they can be detected easily at low levels by human olfactory sense concentrations davies et al 2004 and have bio accumulation and toxicity gagne et al 1999 nakajima et al 1996 moreover 2 mib and gsm are both saturated cyclic tertiary alcohols which are persistent and difficult to be removed by traditional water treatment processes removing odor substances in polluted natural water bodies has become a difficult problem although 2 mib and gsm can be removed by microbial degradation the degradation rates are quite slow izaguirre et al 1988 yuan et al 2012 indiscriminately rapid chemical reactions of advanced oxidation processes aops usually lead to accumulation of toxic by products and excessive residual of oxidation products collivignarelli et al 2004 wang et al 2015 yoon et al 2007 kim et al 2016 park et al 2017 which cannot achieve complete mineralization of odorous substances intimately coupled photocatalysis and biodegradation icpb may have the potential to repair the odorous substances polluted natural water icpb system has been applied for the removal of a variety of refractory organic

commonly used to excite photocatalysis marsolek et al 2008 li et al 2011 li et al 2012a and refractory contaminants are decomposed by photocatalyst such as tio2 and photocatalytic intermediate products can rapidly permeate into the carrier and be completely mineralized by the biodegradation of the biofilm attached to the carrier inner surface xiong et al 2017 in ideal icpb systems photocatalysts are coated on the macroporous carrier eg polyurethane sponge outer surface while microorganisms colonize on the inner surface li et al 2012b however it remains challenging to achieve a tight and long lasting adhesion of metal based photocatalysts onto the hydrophobic outer surface of macromolecule carriers li et al 2019 while photocatalysts were coated by conventional procedures such as powder sintering and sol gel methods the photocatalysts has low load ratio and tend to aggregate reducing their catalytic efficiencies detachment of photocatalysts from the carrier is also frequent due to low adhesion strength moreover the photocatalysts are often coated on the carrier inner surface which prohibits the colonization of microorganisms li et al 2012b li et al 2019 ma et al 2015 silane coupling agents scas could improve the catalyst coating method because they have a strong bridging effect in combining organic and inorganic materials sang et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 the molecular chemical structure of scas can be represented as y r six3 the x represents an alkoxy acetoxy halogen etc which can undergo a hydrolysis reaction to generate silanol hydroxyl groups si oh then si oh can chemically bond with the surface of inorganic materials the y represents a vinyl amino epoxy mercapto etc which can react with the polymer so that the silane can adhere to the surface of organic materials arkles 1977 in this study a modified sca enhanced tio2 coating method is developed which greatly improves the adhesion strength between photocatalysts and carriers the icpb system is used to remove 2 mib and gsm for the first time to explore the feasibility of icpb system for removing odor substances in polluted natural water firstly the selection of scas and preparation conditions are optimized on the basis of the loading amount and adhesion strength of tio2 the feasibility of this novel method is further evident by evaluating the accumulation of biofilm the 2 mib and gsm degradation efficiency and the stability of the novel icpb system in addition the removal mechanism of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system is proposed based on the analysis of intermediate products microbial activity and dominant bacteria 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and reagents 2 mib cas 2371 42 8 and gsm cas 16423 19 1 were purchased from sigma aldrich co usa all other chemicals were analytically pure without requirement for further purification ultra pure water was used throughout the experiment 2 2 carrier and tio2 coating procedure optimization polyurethane pu

formulation of influent nutrient is shown in table s2 the aerobic activated sludge reactor ran for 6 cycles per day each cycle 4 h was divided into 4 stages inflow for 5 minutes aeration for 215 minutes precipitation for 10 minutes and drainage for 10 minutes at a volume exchange ratio of 50 after the sludge was acclimated and stabilized the tio2 supported sponges placed in a mesh bag were fixed in the activated sludge reactor for 12 d for microbial colonization then the carriers were cultured in a 250 ml erlenmeyer flask on a shaker for 2 d 2 4 reactor setup and experimental methods the icpb reaction device with a working volume of 600 ml is shown in fig s1 and the configuration details are described in section s2 the experiment was conducted at 25 c each of the eight uv light source sankyo denki japan had a power of 4 w and a characteristic peak of 254 nm the intensity of the uv light received by the outer wall of the reactor was 2 5 mw cm2 mimicking the exposure of sunlight 2 0 3 0 mw cm2 as measured by an irradiator ultraviolet light measurement mode 01080336 beijing normal university illumination electronic instrument factory china the einstein constant was 1

and gsm concentrations of the degradation test were both 500 ng l to simulate their occurrence in natural water to compare with the performance of the novel icpb system icpb sca four control systems with different operating conditions were designed including the icpb system with powder sintering method icpb photocatalysis p system biodegradation b system and adsorption ad system table 1 all the above systems were carried out in separate reactors of an identical device design fig s1 at 25 c 2 5 analytical methods concentrations of 2 mib and gsm and their intermediates were analyzed using

integration time 1000 ms sample pretreatment steps in section s4 x ray diffraction spectroscopy xrd dmax 2550pc japan was used to characterize the tio2 crystal form kobayashi et al 2008 after spray gold treatment scanning electron microscope sem hitachi su 8010 japan was used to observe the tio2 loading form on the carrier surface the ratio of tio2 loading amount after and before the 12 hour mechanical stirring represented the adhesion strength of tio2 when optimizing the coating method attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared spectrometer ati ft ir ava tar370 was used to measure the infrared spectra of sponge carrier samples zhao et al 2012 colonized microbial morphology on the carrier surface was characterized by sem hitachi su 8010 japan according to our previous study zhang et al 2018a the biomass of living cells was characterized by atp from microorganisms on the carrier inner surface using the beyotime enhanced atp assay kit the live deadtm baclighttm bacterial viability kit was used to stain the dead and living cells then clsm lsm 710 was used to obtain the proportion of dead and live cells on the inner carrier surface the bacterial communities of attached biofilm were analyzed by the illumina miseq sequencing technology details of the sample collection in section s5 dna extraction 16s rrna gene pcr amplification and illumina miseq sequencing were consistent with the previous study zhang et al 2018b all measurements were performed in triplicate the optimal tio2 coating procedure was obtained through orthogonal experiment and tio2 loading amount and adhesion strength were used as visual analysis indexs 3 results and discussion 3 1 optimization of the sca enhanced tio2 coating method 3 1 1 optimization of scas and preparation steps of tio2 supported carriers the four step process and the coupling agent kh560 showed advantages in the tio2 loading amounts fig 1 a the amount of tio2 loaded on the carrier surface by four step process was significantly higher than that of the five step process 2 3 times it might be because the y moieties of scas were destroyed by the direct heating during the first heat curing step of the five step process abdolmaleki et al 2011 which subsequently reduced the coupling reaction between sca and pu sponge in the four step preparation high and stable tio2 loading was achieved 196 5 16 1 mg g 65 c 359 7 86 8 mg g 150 c when kh560 was used as the coupling agent as for kh550 or kh570 the tio2 loading amounts were more sensitive to temperature than kh560 this is in part because the epoxy group of kh560 is more efficient to react with amino and carboxyl groups of the polymer chains on sponge surface and form a stable chemical cross linkage the reaction could occur over a broad range of catalysis temperatures and the formed cross linked structure was of high thermal stability li et al 2014 functional groups on the carrier surface at different conditions were characterized by ati ft ir fig 1b c d the unloaded pu carrier has tensile vibration peak and deformation vibration peak of n h at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 asymmetric and symmetrical tensile vibration peaks of c h at 2971 cm 1 and 2869 cm 1 and tensile vibration peaks of c o at 1103 cm 1 these peaks were detected in other tio2 supported carrier surfaces indicating that the polyurethane sponge carrier structure was not destroyed using three kinds of scas the peak intensity at 2971 cm 1 and 2869 cm 1 increased indicating the vibrational absorption peaks of the three scas molecular groups ch2 increase of the peak intensity at 1103 cm 1 was presumed to be the result of the superposition of ti o si stretching vibration and c o stretching vibration indicating that the hydroxyl group produced by the hydrolysis of the scas x groups and the hydroxyl group of tio2 surface formed ti o si by dehydration reaction zhao et al 2012 this observation demonstrated that three scas successfully adhered to tio2 as for the connection to the surface of the pu carrier the peaks at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 increased while using kh550 indicating that the y group nh2 of kh550 bonded with the sponge surface by forming n h while using kh560 as the coupling agent the absorption peak intensity at 3295 cm 1 increased indicating that the surface of the carrier had an o h stretching vibration absorption peak the peak strength of c o tensile vibration peak at 1225 cm 1 increased speculating that the epoxy functional group at the end of kh560 y group och2ch o ch2 generated hydroxyl groups by the ring opening reaction and bonded with the sponge surface by generating unsaturated ether bonds kh570 increased the peak strength of the stretching vibration peaks at 3295 cm 1 and 1641 cm 1 indicating that the c o or c c at the end of the kh570 y group ch2 c ch3 coo was still retained with no or little portion of chemical bonding with the functional groups of the carrier surface anatase has the highest photocatalytic activity among all crystalline forms of tio2 and is most widely used in photocatalysis bavykin et al 2006 kobayashi et al 2008 according to the xrd spectrum fig s2 the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 and the corresponding crystal planes were 101 004 200 211 and 204 respectively indicating that the nano tio2 used in this study was anatase tio2 pu sponge had a characteristic peak only at 2θ 19 88 for the tio2 supported carriers using different coating procedures in addition to the characteristic peaks of the pu carrier at 2θ 19 88 the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase also appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 identical to the nano tio2 powders these results indicated that the anatase tio2 crystal form was not affected by the adhesion with pu sponge carriers through the observation of supported tio2 on the sponge surface fig s3 the aggregation of tio2 was found to be significantly alleviated when the four step preparation was employed especially when kh560 was used as the coupling agent the carrier outer surface was coated with a layer of uniform and dense tio2 the reason might be that sca diminished the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the nanoparticles which stabilized the nanoparticles and prevented the aggregation in organic solutions zhao et al 2012 matinlinna et al 2018 little tio2 was observed on the carrier inner surface creating tio2 coated pu sponges ideal for supported photocatalysis overall our results confirmed the feasibility of a four step method with kh560 as the sca to produce tio2 coated pu sponges since this approach obtained the better photocatalyst coating effect and provided a tio2 free non toxic inner surface for biofilm growth and acclimation on the contrary low tio2 surface bonding and agglomeration still occurred in the five step preparation and the powder sintering method 3 1 2 optimization of preparation conditions kh560 and the four step method were selected according to the above selection with variables of the alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution hydrolysis time concentration of kh560 and heat curing temperature each variable was tested at three levels to design orthogonal experiments table 2 visual analysis used tio2 loading amount and adhesion strength as indexes table s3 results of orthogonal experiments showed that all tio2 loading amounts under different conditions were about 200 mg g 400 mg g adhesion strength of all nine sets was strong the tio2 peeling ratios were lower than 5 except for the three sets 6 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 15 of c kh560 85 c 8 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 25 of c kh560 65 c 10 1 of alcohol water ratio 24 h of hydrolysis time 5 of c kh560 105 c after 12 hour stirring the order of effects of various factors on the index of tio2 loading amount was kh560 concentration heat curing temperature hydrolysis time alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution the optimal conditions were determined as alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 15 heat curing temperature of 85 c the order of effects of various factors on the index of tio2 adhesion strength was hydrolysis time heat curing temperature kh560 concentration alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution the optimal conditions were determined as alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 25 heat curing temperature of 85 c as the kh560 concentration had less effect on tio2 adhesion strength which was sufficiently high as 95 3 when the kh560 concentration was 15 therefore the optimal kh560 concentration of 15 was selected collectively kh560 tio2 pu carriers was prepared by kh560 and the four step preparation method with alcohol water ratio of hydrolysis solution of 8 1 hydrolysis time of 36 h kh560 concentration of 15 heat curing temperature of 85 c this tio2 coated carrier was designated as kh560 tio2 pu carrier compared with previous works li et al 2012b coated tio2 onto the pu sponge by the low temperature sintering method diluted method diluted and no additive method respectively and the loading amount was 0 3 0 264 0 24 g g carrier calculated as ti respectively li et al 2019 used powder spraying method and sol gel method respectively to coat biocl bi2wo6 bi to pu carrier the weight loss rates after 60h were 73 and 96 respectively the trimesic acid in the diluted method and the polyurethane waterproof coating in the powder spraying method was also used as a binder but kh560 enhanced coating method had advantages in simultaneously achieving high tio2 loading amount 0 352 g g thin and uniform catalytic layer and high loading strength 3 2 removal of 2 mib and gsm by the icpb system with kh560 tio2 pu carriers 3 2 1 removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm for the 2 mib removal at an initial concentration of 501 1 14 4 ng l for 12 h the icpb sca system showed higher 2 mib removal efficiency fig 2 a in the first 0 5 h 2 mib removal in the ad system was close to those in other systems indicating that the initial removal of 2 mib was primarily due to adsorption the 2 mib concentration in ad system decreased to the plateau of 210 ng l in 1 h suggesting an equilibrium of adsorption and desorption the final removal efficiency of the ad system was 60 2 1 6 within 12 h with 2 mib concentration leveled at 199 2 8 0 ng l the 2 mib removal efficiency of the b system was 69 9 0 8 slightly higher than the ad system these results indicated that the most of 2 mib loss was due to adsorption and only a small portion of 2 mib was directly biodegraded in the b system this concurs with previous studies revealing 2 mib is recalcitrant for the biodegradation in the natural environment 2 mib removal efficiency of the p system reached 78 7 1 0 within 12 h with 2 mib residual concentration of 106 8 4 9 ng l indicating the highly effective photocatalytic degradation of 2 mib by nano tio2 in the icpb sca system the lowest 2 mib concentration among all treatments 162 12 3 ng l was observed after 4 h probably because the detaching of the biofilm on the carrier outer surface resulted in a larger uv illuminating area for tio2 which accelerated the photocatalytic reaction li et al 2011 dong et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 in 12 h 88 9 0 3 of the 2 mib removal was achieved lingering 2 mib concentration as low as 55 9 1 5 ng l the 2 mib removal in the icpb sca system was superior to the p system that might be due to the biodegradation of the intermediates reduced the competition for photocatalytically generated free radicals which made these free radicals more readily available to attack 2 mib xiong et al 2017 gsm removal with an initial concentration of 504 0 24 3 ng l was observed in a similar fashion to 2 mib in all tested systems fig 2b the removal efficiency of 39 3 1 5 in the ad system was similar to those in other systems in the first 0 5 h indicating that adsorption dominated the early gsm removal later it became stable around 49 0 0 7 in 12 h the gsm concentration in the icpb sca system was the lowest 224 5 3 2 ng l after 1 h among all treatments after 12 h of reaction the icmb sca system had the highest gsm removal efficiency of 85 0 1 0 with the final concentration reduced to 75 7 5 0 ng l higher than those in the p system 72 7 1 7 and the b system 56 1 2 9 the 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies of the icpb system with the powder sintering method were 71 2 2 7 and 65 6 2 5 respectively comparing with the icpb system the 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies of the icpb sca system increased by 17 7 0 6 and 19 4 0 4 respectively indicating that the kh560 tio2 pu carriers significantly improved removal efficiency of odor substances the novel icpb system showed advantages compared with other processes for removing odor substances yuan et al 2012 isolated four kinds of bacteria from biological activated carbon the removal efficiencies of 2 mib 515 ng l were in the range from 92 8 to 98 4 but it needed 9 12 d the biodegradation of 1 6 7 mg l 2 mib in mixed cultures took 5 14 d izaguirre et al 1988 the uv o3 system removed 90 of 2 mib and gsm with an initial concentration of 200 500 ng l within 2 3 minutes only but caused incomplete mineralization and aldehydes accumulation collivignarelli et al 2004 for the photocatalysis tio2 p25 as the photocatalyst could remove 99 of gsm and 2 mib 10 nm within 60 minutes lawton et al 2003 and fe n co doped tio2 as the visible light photocatalyst could reduce the initial concentration of 1μg l of gsm and 2 mib to below 10 ng l within 5h yuan et al 2018 however the directionless degradation of the photocatalysis also easily leads to incomplete mineralization of intermediates accumulation yoon et al 2007 kim et al 2016 park et al 2017 yuan et al 2018 3 2 2 stability of the icpb system with kh560 tio2 pu carriers removal of both 2 mib and gsm in the icpb sca system maintained high stability over 5 operating cycles fig 3 a and b the removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm were 89 9 0 8 and 86 1 0 2 during the fifth 12 h cycle respectively 2 mib concentration decreased to 8 9 2 8 ng l with the degradation efficiency of 98 2 0 6 after 18 h in the fifth cycle gsm concentration decreased to 9 2 1 0 ng l achieving a degradation efficiency of 98 16 0 2 after 24h after five cycles of operation both of 2 mib and gsm can be degraded to concentrations lower than 10 ng l meeting stringent standards indicated in the sanitary standards for drinking water gb 5749 2006 china the tio2 loading amount on carriers decreased slightly after 5 operating cycles fig 3c showing endured adhesion strength when kh560 was used as the adhesive agent after the total of 5 running cycles of continuous operation the loading amount was slightly reduced from the initial 351 8 8 2 mg g to 334 2 10 0 mg g resulting in a peeling ratio as low as 5 0 2 8 in contrast when the powder sintering method was employed for tio2 adhesion the peeling ratio of 16 5 was observed after operating for 12 h with an initial loading amount of 31 5 2 4 mg g these results further confirmed kh560 enhanced and elongated tio2 coating which significantly increased the photocatalyst loading amount and adhesion strength between tio2 and pu sponge carrier fig 4 a shows the photocatalysis and biofilm distribution on the carrier surface during 5 cycles in the icpb sca system before the operation both inner and outer surfaces of the kh560 tio2 pu carrier were successfully enriched with a large amount of cocci and bacillus wrapped in extracellular polymeric substances during the circle experiment the photocatalyst layer on the carrier outer surface was still firmly coated on the pu carrier and the amount of biofilm colonized on the inner surface was constantly well maintained at a high level it is worth noting that the biofilm on the outer surface gradually detached due to the influence of uv light and active oxygen radicals which as a result exposed more photocatalysts to light illumination rittmann 2018 this could partially explain the degradation efficiency of 2 mib and gsm in the icpb sca system exceeded control systems in the late stage of reaction li et al 2011 li et al 2012b dong et al 2016 xiong et al 2017 the fig 4b shows that the characteristic peaks of the anatase phase still appeared at 2θ 25 46 37 82 48 08 55 18 and 62 74 indicating that the anatase crystal form with high photocatalytic activity was not changed after 5 operating cycles therefore the stability of the icpb sca system was confirmed over multiple cycles of operation kh560 enhanced tio2 coating method made the tio2 photocatalyst firmly coated on the pu carrier outer surface with strong adhesion strength and active microorganisms colonized inside the carrier protected by the photocatalysts 3 3 proposed removal mechanisms of 2 mib and gsm in the sca enhanced icpb system 3 3 1 intermediates of 2 mib and gsm degradation 16 intermediate products in the icpb sca system after 5 cycle degradation experiment were detected by gc ms full scan analysis table s5 containing dehydrated products 4 species terpenes 3 species alcohols 5 species esters 2 species and organic acids 2 species fig 5 shows the possible degradation pathways of 2 mib and gsm in the novel icpb system based on the analysis of intermediate products 2 mib and gsm were first converted by dehydration and then converted into terpenes alcohols esters organic acids and other biodegradable intermediate products through free radical attack a variety of reactive oxygen species were produced in the tio2 photocatalytic degradation including h e oh o2 ho2 and h2o2 hashimoto et al 2005 and hydroxyl radicals deoxidized most of the organic matters in water which was proposed to play a decisive role in the photocatalytic oxidation marsolek et al 2008 fotou et al 1996 the 2 mib dehydration products 2 methyl 2 bornene and 2 methylenebornane and the gsm dehydration product 1 4 dimethyl admantane were all detected in both icpb sca and p systems these dehydration products and alcohol ethers aldehydes and other subsequent products were also reported in previous uv photolysis experiments kim et al 2016 cyclopentene type intermediate products exist in our systems which were also detected in the previous study of photocatalytic degradation of 2 mib yoon et al 2007 however park et al 2017 found that no gsm dehydration products were detected in the photo fenton removal process of 2 mib and gsm while 2 mib dehydration products 2 methyl 2 bornene and 2 methylenebornane ring opening products butyl butyrate 2 ethyl 1 hexanol and nonanal were obtained compared to the p system four over oxidized intermediate aldehydes products were missing in the icpb sca system table s5 suggesting that immediate biodegradation avoided undesirable oxidation and aldehyde accumulation in photocatalysis yu et al 2020 the indiscriminate and fast acting radicals of photocatalysis could produce a range of toxic too oxidized or unavailable for biodegradation products and much of radicals would be spent reacting with already biodegradable organics marsolek et al 2008 the aldehyde accumulation and incomplete mineralization of 2 mib and gsm was also reported in a uv o3 photocatalysis system collivignarelli et al 2004 our results indicated that the icpb sca system could effectively avoid the excessive oxidation and accumulation of the intermediate products that frequently occur in photocatalysis treatment systems in the icpb sca system microorganisms might timely removed a portion of the biodegradable intermediate products to achieve final mineralization and the chemical oxidant could more focus on the recalcitrant compounds on the contrary in the p systems intermediates are likely to be excessively oxidized forming and accumulating toxic aldehyde products in order to analyze the roles of microorganisms in the biotransformation of odor substances and their intermediate products microbial analysis was performed below 3 3 2 microbial activity and community of inner biofilm atp stores and transports energy for the vital activities and can be used to characterize the biomass of living cells fig 6 a shows that the atp amount of biofilm in the icpb sca system and the b system increased after 5 operating cycles from 74 1 0 9 ng g to 117 2 5 7 ng g and 99 1 0 7 ng g respectively it suggested that the biofilm colonization in the interior of carriers was stable and the microbial activity remained well although the biofilm on the sponge outer surface was detached in the icpb sca system two reasons might lead to the increase of the atp amount of biofilm in the icpb sca system one was that the microbial community structure succession inside the carrier maintained biomass and activity through self regulation xiong et al 2017 the second was that the various intermediates produced by photocatalysis provided a rich variety of carbon sources and improve the activity of biofilm yoon et al 2007 yuan et al 2018 the clsm images of biofilm in the carrier interior are shown in fig 6b it was calculated that the ratio of microbial live dead cells of the icpb sca system and the b system carrier decreased from 1 17 0 05 to 1 02 0 05 and 0 99 0 05 respectively it also proved that the biofilm of the icpb sca system was not significantly deactivated by the toxic effects of uv light and reactive oxygen free radicals li et al 2012a microbial community analysis revealed the increase of diversity and richness of microorganisms in the attached biofilm shannon index and simpson index represent biodiversity observed species index chao1 index and ace index represent species richness the statistical results of the alpha diversity of the biofilm attached on carriers table s4 showed that the observed species index shannon index simpson index chao1 index and ace index of the biofilm of novel icpb system were 482 6 36 0 97 490 37 and 491 18 respectively all greater than those observed in the original biofilm before the operation which were 465 5 88 0 96 472 07 and 475 45 respetively this suggests that the icpb operation can improve the richness and diversity of the microbial communities in biofilms on the carrier surface however the microbial community in the b system only have shannon and simpson indexes 6 35 and 0 97 respectively higher than those of the original biofilm observed species chao1 and ace indexes were 449 450 67 and 452 40 respectively all lower than those of the original biofilm it showed that the microbial diversity on the sponge surface increased and the richness decreased in the b system the differences between the icpb sca system and the b system were probably due to that the microorganisms inside of the carrier were protected from the exposure to odorous substances and provided more bioavailable intermediate products according to the 2 mib and gsm degradation pathway the microbial community analysis of biofilms at the genus level is present in fig 6c and fig s5 community structure at phylum level in fig s4 the dominant genera on the carriers included zoogloea thauera acinetobacter comamonas brevundimonas and flavobacterium zoogloea accounted for the highest proportion reaching 22 2 19 9 and 24 6 in original biofilm b system biofilm and icpb sca system biofilm respectively previous studies reported that zoogloea spp could secrete extracellular polymeric substances and grow in large quantities to form bacterial micelles which not only had a bridging effect but also improved the resistance of biofilms liu et al 2010 thus dominance of zoogloea spp on the carrier surface promoted the microbial colonization and biofilm formation and increased the tolerance of the biofilm to handle influents of varying compositions thauera spp were confirmed to play an important role in the conversion of terpenes and other refractory compounds hylemon et al 1998 accounting for 14 8 12 0 and 15 0 in the biofilms of original b system and icpb sca system respectively the enrichment of thauera spp in the icpb sca system biofilm was probably caused by the production of terpenoids from photocatalysis flavobacterium spp was found with the ability of degrading 2 mib egashira et al 1992 accounting for 0 54 3 6 and 2 4 of the biofilms of original b system and icpb sca system respectively in addition stenotrophomonas spp and sphingopyxis spp which were previously reported with the ability to degrade odor substances hoefel et al 2009 zhou et al 2011 were also enriched on carriers in b and icpb sca systems accounting for 0 24 and 0 15 0 15 and 0 16 respectively it indicated that a little odor substance could be directly utilized by the functional microorganisms in addition to the photocatalytic degradation in the icpb sca system 3 3 3 the synergy of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the sca enhanced icpb system combining the analysis of 2 mib and gsm degradation intermidiates with the changes of microbial activity and community structures the synergy of adsorption photocatalysis and biodegradation in the novel icpb system is shown in fig 7 the odorous substances are first adsorbed rapidly on the surface of the sponge and then produce the dehydration intermediate products which are further ring opened to generate biodegradable intermediates such as terpenes alcohols esters and organic acids with lower molecular weights through tio2 photocatalysis some of biodegradable intermediates are converted by photocatalysis but most of them are decomposed and utilized by active functional microorganisms enriched on the inner surface of carriers such as thauera spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas spp and sphinopyxis spp a little of 2 mib and gsm is also directly degraded and utilized by microorganisms our novel icpb system also exhibits multiple properties for the improvement of 2 mib and gsm removal efficiencies firstly the enhancement of the photocatalyst s adhesive strength and the reduction of the aggregation improved photocatalysis efficiency and promised long term stability the removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm by the photocatalytic system using the new loading method were higher than those of the icpb system using the powder sintering method secondly the photocatalyst is only coated on the external surface of carriers leaving the colonization space inside the carrier for biofilm acclimation 2 mib and gsm were toxic to aquatic organisms nakajima et al 1996 gagne et al 1999 and uv light zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 cai et al 2019 and free radicals li et al 2012b ma et al 2015 rittmann 2018 have also been reported to destroy microorganisms and worsen the shedding of biofilms however biofilm inside of the carrier was protected and the microbial activity was well remained in the sca enhanced icpb system thirdly due to the tight combination of biodegradation and photocatalyst intermediate products can be exchanged rapidly enriching more functional microorganisms such as zoogloea spp thauera spp flavobacterium spp stenotrophomonas spp and sphinopyxis spp which can degrade intermediate products such as terpenes alcohols esters and organic acids to avoid excessive oxidization 4 conclusions in summary the preparation method of kh560 enhanced tio2 supported pu sponge kh560 tio2 pu carriers for the icpb system was developed which formed a uniform and dense tio2 layer firmly coated on the carrier outer surface and the colonization of microorganisms on the inner surface was well protected the icpb system was first applied to degrade 2 mib and gsm the novel icpb system constructed with kh560 tio2 pu carriers significantly improved removal efficiencies of 2 mib and gsm and the system maintained an exceptional removal efficiency and stability even after several operating cycles besides the diversity and abundance of microorganisms were increased enabling multiple pathways for 2 mib and gsm removal and reducing the accumulation of photocatalytic intermediate products this study proved the feasibility of the supported photocatalyst preparation method providing a new treatment technology

17464,anaerobic digestion ad is an effective approach to recovering chemical organic energy from excess sludge but the conversion efficiency for energy is usually not very high one of the obstacles comes from the severe inhibition of humic acid ha on both hydrolytic and methanogenic process on the ad therefore it is necessary to ascertain some effective approaches to relieving the inhibition of ha for obtaining a high methane ch4 yield with the clean sludge cultured by synthetic wastewater containing almost no ha and metal ions the inhibition of ha on the ad process was designed by dosing ha at 15 vss and relieving the inhibition by metal ions was also designed by dosing the different amounts of ca2 and al3 based on the batch ad experiments solo ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l added realized the highest relieved efficiency of 65 respectively interestingly dual metal ions added at the low concentrations ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l could reach up to 80 of the relieved efficiency which was attributed to the synergistic effect of 1 1 2 the mechanisms behind the phenomena could be that metal ions might interact with ha via electrostatic force cation exchange and sweep flocculation thus some key hydrolytic and methanogenic enzymes could indirectly be reactivated and degradation of organic substances could be enhanced in the ad process in wastewater treatment plants metal ions contained in excess sludge would inherently relieve the inhibition of ha to an extent which depends on the effective and or optimal concentration of metal ions at a free unabsorbed and or unwrapped state graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ad humic acid ha hydrolysis methanogenesis inhibition metal ions relieved efficiency 1 introduction along with the signing of the paris climate agreement energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants has been given a renewed sense of urgency organic substances in wastewater represent a significant amount of chemical

combinations have been extensively studied and applied to improve the biodegradability of sludge biomass for increasing the biogas yield hendriks and zeeman 2009 hao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 indeed pretreatment technologies can positively increase the biogas yield in most cases however inhibitory compounds originally from excess sludge usually remain in bioreactors and moreover some additional inhibitors could be produced after pretreatment which could cause further inhibition klinke et al 2004 negro et al 2003 liu et al 2019 for the reason some studies have conducted to analyze and relieve the effect of inhibitory compounds on ad systems for achieving a more efficient methane ch4 production among others humic substances hss like humic acid ha which accounts for 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss in excess sludge thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 are identified as a key inhibitory compound inhibiting both hydrolytic and methanogenic processes liu et al 2015 azman et al 2017 li et al 2019a and 2019b it has been concluded that the highest inhibited efficiency of energy conversion in the batch tests was at 35 2 with ha 15 vss in the ad system li et al 2019a and 2019b thus removing hss from sludge might be an option to overcome the negative effect on ad removing ha during drinking water treatment by membrane filtration can be applied ren and graham 2015 and extraction absorption ion exchange and coagulation plus flocculation have been already proposed to remove ha from some materials li et al 2014 song et al 2013 however these approaches seem to be unsuitable for ad system due to a high biomass content of sludge clearly other approaches are expected to relieve the inhibitory effects of ha two different approaches either adding hydrolytic enzyme or adding polyvalent metal ions have been proposed to relieve the inhibition of ha on ad azman et al 2015 brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 moreover hydrolytic enzymes could only improve the hydrolytic efficiency rather than mitigate the inhibition of ha fernandes et al 2015 adding ca2 into ad relieved the inhibitory effect of humate on potato protein hydrolysis brons et al 1985 furthermore adding cacl2 is a solution to improve the methane production kumar et al 2016 also adding magnesium calcium and iron salts can mitigate the ha inhibition and increase the hydrolytic efficiencies azman et al 2015 azman et al 2015 found that in the ad system with ha the hydrolytic efficiency of lignocellulose with addition of ca2 mg2 and fe3 increased by 47 37 and 44 respectively and methane yield increased by 146 128 and 145 respectively azman et al 2015 on the other hand the effect of na and k is not obvious and the complexation degree of ha interacting with metal ions was k na mg2 fe3 fe2 ca2 azman et al 2015 some other studies have also shown that the addition of ca2 can effectively alleviate the hydrolysis of potato protein by humus brons et al 1985 these studies demonstrate that metal ions can relieve the inhibition of ha on the hydrolytic process and increase the methane yield but the associated mechanisms remain to be further explored the binding ability of heavy metal ions such as hg cu cd cr etc with ha is much stronger than that of ca mg al fe and so on rovira et al 2002 however addition of heavy metal ions into ad systems would increase the environmental risk of the ecosystem therefore ca mg al and fe could be an effective approach to relieving the inhibition of ha on ad in general the concentration of ca2 or mg2 is higher in ground water than that in surface water for examples northern cities of china usually utilize ground water and so the concentration of ca2 is relatively high in excess sludge 320 450 mg l in beijing krüger et al 2014 hao et al 2020 on the other hand southern cities of china mainly use surface water which has a low concentration of ca2 80 120 mg l marti et al 2008 as for al3 its concentration depends on coagulants use in water or wastewater treatment for examples the concentration of al3 in excess sludge is about 30 120 mg l using non aluminum coagulants while adding aluminum chemicals would result in up to 1 000 mg l novak and park 2010 krüger et al 2014 for this purpose it is necessary to ascertain the optimal concentration of metal ions and its relieved efficiency on inhibition of ha as well as involved mechanisms clearly with this study the attempt on the purpose was conducted based on our previous studies li et al 2019a and 2019b the idea for experiments used clean sludge containing almost no ha and metal ions which was cultured by synthetic wastewater in laboratory and then the designed levels of ha were added into the cultured sludge ca2 and al3 also their combination were selected as metal ions for relieving the ha inhibition 2 materials and methods 2 1 clean sludge and inoculum sludge synthetic wastewater was used to culture clean sludge almost without either ha or metal ions in a sequencing batch reactor sbr v 60 l which operated with hrt 3 d and srt 12 d aeration 22 h d settlement 2 h d as described in our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b the clean sludge was collected and sieved concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was taken from a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l with srt 32 d which was also fed with the clean sludge for half a year to wash originally fed municipal sludge out the characteristics of both concentrated clean and inoculum sludge are listed in table 1 2 2 humic acid ha practical hss contained in excess sludge consist of complex organic compound of different molecules and ambiguous content 6 20 thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 however humic acid ha is a major form of hss chen et al 2008 liu et al 2019 thus a merchant ha was used to replace hss as demonstrated in our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b a quantitative comparison analysis by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer identification software reveals that the used ha has the similar degree to hss up to 87 3 2 3 experimental set up 2 3 1 anaerobic digestion experiments batch anaerobic digestion ad experiments were conducted in 600 ml serum bottles working volume 400 ml headspace volume 200 ml each bottle was fed with concentrated clean sludge and inoculum sludge at a vss ratio of 3 1 up to the 400 ml as listed in table 2 all the fed bottles were divided into three tests including i blanks for control no ha and metal ions were added ii tests inhibited by ha ha was added at 15 of vss and no metal ions were added iii tests with added metal ions both ha at 15 of vss and metal ions cacl2 and or alcl3 solo ca2 50 500 mg l solo al3 10 100 mg l and dual ca2 50 300 mg l plus al3 10 100 mg l were added as described in fig 1 all the fed bottles were adjusted by ph to 7 0 0 2 with naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m purged with n2 for 3 min then sealed with rubber stoppers and finally moved into an air bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c all those experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 2 complexes of metal humic acid and their analysis metal ions might relieve the inhibition of ha by chemical interactions some studies cruz zavala et al 2016 have ambiguously identified the interactions based on different binding sites i internal boundary complexes the functional groups of ha strongly occupy the coordination water molecules and tightly combine with metal ions ii external boundary complexes the weak binding interactions such as electrostatic force and sweep flocculation for the reason additional tube tests were simultaneously conducted to quantitatively validate the interactions between metal ions and ha in the tube 50 ml the dosage of 0 05 g ha were added into deionized water at the total volume of 50 ml and ha 1 0 g l after stirred and dissolved metal ions ca2 or al3 were also added into the tubes at the concentrations range from 0 to 100 mg l all the tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and moved into a water bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c which had the same working conditions as described in the ad experiments in section 2 3 1 for 24 h in the shaker all the tubes were divided into two tests for analysis 1 first tests were analyzed to obtain the total amount of metal ions combined with ha including both internal and external boundary complexes based on the settlement for 12 h settled particles were discarded and supernatants were detected for the concentration of metal ions the concentration difference between initial and final metal ions should be the total complexes 2 second tests focused on figuring out the internal boundary complexes following the steps the tube samples were dialyzed overnight against demineralized water in dialysis bags with a molecular weight cut off of 500 da under this condition the unstable combination of metal ions with ha were disintegrated and released out of the dialysis bags then the remanent metal ions were the internal boundary complexes 2 4 analytical methods the centrifuged supernatant samples from the serum bottles were filtered via 0 45 μm membrane filters to analyze i vfas using ion chromatographer 883 basic ic plus metrohm ag ii soluble polysaccharide and protein by phenol sulfuric acid and the lorry method using uv spectrophotometer cary 5000 german agilent technologies company respectively apha 1998 li et al 2019a biogas production was measured by a gas liquid device and the biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatographer gc126 shanghai inesa other liquid samples were washed with 100 mm phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 4 mlss samples were sonicated at 4 c for 30 min and then separated by centrifuging at 11 000 rpm and 4 c for 30 min treated supernatants were placed on ice bags in order to analyze the activities of their enzymes different enzymes were analyzed by different methods including amylase dns method protease l lysine method in the hydrolytic phase based on the methods used by liu et al 2015 and f420 reducing hydrogenase used by trevors 1984 in the methanogenic phase respectively total solid ts volatile solids vs mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss oxidation reduction potential orp and ph were all detected according to the standard methods apha 1998 li et al 2019a the concentration of metal ions was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher scientific icap7200 germany after digested by concentrated hno3 h2o2 under 150 c for 2 h hao et al 2017 the statistical analysis was performed with the spss 22 0 statistical software a one way anova was used to detect the significant effect of metal ions relieving the inhibition of ha on the methane production and the significant differences at the level of 95 based on data obtained from the duplicated experiments 2 5 evaluated methods based on our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b ha indeed inhibits the ad process and decreases the energy conversion efficiency in this study the metal ions would play a positive or negative role in the ad system which was evaluated by the parameter emi the relieved efficiency as calculated by eq 1 1 e mi m mi m ha m 0 m ha where emi the relieved efficiency by metal ions ei 0 means a positive effect whereas ei 0 reveals a negative effect m0 mha and mmi are the methane production in the blanks for control the tests inhibited by ha and the tests with added metal ions respectively as shown in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 solo ca2 the methane yield with different ca2 concentration added is shown in fig 2 a which was about 104 ml g vss in the blank tests and 80 ml g vss in the inhibited tests clearly ha indeed inhibited the ad process and thus decreased the methane yield which was also confirmed in the previous studies liu et al 2015 li et al 2019a and 2019b along with increasing concentration of ca2 from 0 to 100 mg l however the methane yield was obviously increased from 80 to 96 ml g vss further increasing ca2 from 200 to 500 mg l the methane yield did not increase and reversely decrease to 80 ml g vss with the highest addition of ca2 500 mg l the relieved efficiency on the right vertical axis of fig 2a corresponds to an identical trend obviously a moderate concentration of ca2 50 300 mg l could effectively relieve the ha inhibition and improve the methane yield to an extent a higher concentration than 500 mg l of ca2 would not act with a positive effect among others the highest relieved efficiency of the methane yield was 65 4 at ca2 100 mg l conversely the higher concentration of metal salts would lead to further inhibition on the methane yield it may be due to the high salt concentration could affect the mechanisms of osmotic regulation of microorganisms resulting in the imbalance of internal and external osmotic pressure of microorganisms in addition it is easy to form precipitates with the high concentration of salts in ad systems and to wrap the microorganisms in sediments therefore the activities of key microorganisms would be hindered cruz zavala et al 2016 3 2 solo al3 the methane yield and its relieved efficiency with al3 added are shown in fig 2b it was occurred a similar trend to tests with adding ca2 the relieved efficiency increased from 0 to 65 7 along with al3 added from 0 to 70 mg l and dropped down to 15 1 at 100 mg l although the relieved efficiency of both ca2 and al3 was almost same 65 al3 reached to the peak relieved efficiency with a lower concentration 70 mg l than ca2 100 mg l which means that a higher valent of metal ions had a superiority over relieving the inhibition of ha 3 3 dual ca2 and al3 solely adding either ca2 or al3 did not achieve the full recovery of the methane yield relieved efficiency at 100 for this reason the dual addition of ca2 and al3 was tested for analyzing their effect on relieving inhibition which is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the combination of ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l reached up to the highest relieved efficiency of 80 which is higher than the results 65 obtained in the solo tests clearly the dual addition of metal ions had a synergistic effect on relieving the ha inhibition at the fixed ca2 50 mg l interestingly increasing al3 from 10 to 100 mg l decreased the relieved efficiency from 80 0 al3 10 mg l to 38 7 al3 100 mg l at the fixed ca2 100 mg l similarly increasing al3 from 10 to 70 mg l had no effect on the relieved efficiency either with the lower al3 10 mg l furthermore increasing ca2 up to 300 mg l did not change the relieved efficiency either at the fixed al3 70 mg l finally the relieved efficiency was kept at the same level at about 55 whatever added ca2 was thus a similar conclusion can be drawn that the high concentration of metal ions or their combination did not achieve an even higher relieved efficiency and conversely a further inhibition would occur 4 analysis of involved mechanisms 4 1 binding of metal ions by humic acid ha fig 4 a illustrates the internal boundary complexes of metal ions ha from the additional tests the saturation concentration of ca2 and al3 bonded by ha 1 0 g l was at about 85 mg l and 40 mg l respectively interestingly the molar electron equivalents of ca2 and al3 are almost at the identical level at 4 3 mmol e l ca2 and 4 4 mmol e l al3 which means that the internal boundary complexes only depend on the charge density not on the type of metal ions thus the possible bonded principles of metal ions are shown in fig 5 the negative charges of dissociated hydroxyl cooh or carboxyl groups oh and other functional groups on the surface of ha could be combined with the positive charges of metal ions the interactions of electrostatic force and cation exchange should be stronger than the combined interactions between ha and enzymes or organic molecules as a result ha would fail to compete with organics in the ad system and release enzymes and organic molecules into its supernatant fig 4b indicates the total boundary complexes of metal ions bonded by ha both ca2 and al3 were combined with a large amount of ha the highest combined efficiencies of ca2 and al3 were at 250 25 mg ca2 mg ha and 400 40 mg al3 mg ha respectively clearly there were also some external boundary complexes besides the internal boundary complexes and these interactions might also help to relieve the inhibition of ha on the ad process as can be seen in fig 4 the bonded degree of al3 was much stronger than that of ca2 which might be attributed to two potential functions 1 electrostatic force between ions or colloids with positive or negative charges electrostatic force should depend on the distance of cations and their valence plimpton et al 1936 the charge number of trivalent ion al3 is higher than that of divalent ion ca2 and moreover the radius of al3 is smaller than that of ca2 for this reason the electrostatic force between al3 and ha is stronger than that of ca2 2 different interactions with ha the internal boundary complexes between metal ions and ha were formed mainly by electrostatic force and cation exchange besides al3 could also interact with ha via the sweep flocculation and co precipitations interactions due to the formation of hydroxy compound al oh nm therefore al3 had a stronger capacity than ca2 for relieving the inhibition of ha as discussed above 4 2 key enzymes release 4 2 1 hydrolytic enzymes both polysaccharide and protein are two simple parameters evaluating the hydrolytic efficiency of organics and so their variations with metal ions added are shown in fig 6 both polysaccharide and protein decreased steadily from 150 mg l and 970 mg l ca2 0 mg l down to about around 50 mg l and 500 mg l ca2 200 mg l respectively no further decrease occurred with above 200 mg ca2 l fig 6a adding al3 had a similar trend fig 6b polysaccharide and protein decreased from 150 mg l and 780 mg l al3 0 mg l down to about 50 mg l and 500 mg l al3 100 mg l respectively probably metal ions could affect the accumulation of polysaccharide and protein lower accumulation of polysaccharide and protein should not be caused by the inhibiting disintegration of bacterial cells as the final methane production was importantly improved li et al 2019a and 2019b instead this could be attributed to releasing key enzymes and improving the hydrolytic efficiency interaction of metal ions with ha would result in key enzymes released and thus the key enzymes could accelerate the hydrolysis of polysaccharide and protein which could reduce the accumulation of them as an evidence the activities of α amylase and proteinase in the hydrolytic process were detected and the results of them are also shown in fig 6 on the right vertical axis along with adding ca2 and al3 the activities of both α amylase and proteinase were enhanced to over 100 fig 6 definitely metal ions could indeed release the hydrolytic enzymes indirectly the inhibition of ha on the ad process was mainly attributed to the interaction of ha with key enzymes and thus their relative activities were decreased li et al 2019a and 2019b when metal ions were added they were easily bonded by ha and thus could untie the combination of ha and enzymes as a result more activated sites of enzymes were released to improve the hydrolytic efficiency as depicted in fig 7 4 2 2 methanogenic enzymes the activity of a key enzyme in the methanogenic process co enzyme f420 reducing hydrogenase was also measured fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the activity of co enzyme f420 was significantly enhanced with the increased dosage of metal ions the activity reached up to the highest level 175 ca2 300 mg l over this point further dosage contributed a little bit of decrease to the activity 160 at ca2 500 mg l interestingly the behavior of al3 seemed stronger than ca2 as dosing 10 mg l of al3 had enhanced the activity up to 155 the highest activity reached up to 183 at al3 30 mg l overdosing al3 had no effect on improving the activity clearly metal ions could also stimulate the activity of methanogenic enzymes which was positive in improving the methane production it is similar to metal ions interacting with the hydrolytic enzymes that metal ions could bond with ha and thus release the f420 enzymes into supernatant as shown in fig 7 however a high concentration dosage of metal ions would inhibit the methanogenic microorganisms and thus decrease the secretion of enzymes affecting the enzyme activity 4 3 improving the removal of volatile suspended solids vss the removal ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to total suspended solids tss is usually an index for evaluating the performance of the ad system and the result is shown in fig 9 a the removal ratio of vss decreased from around 36 in the control tests to 23 in the inhibited tests however it climbed to 32 at ca2 100 mg l and to 30 at al3 70 mg l respectively any further increased dosage of ca2 and al3 would reduce the removal ratio of vss therefore adding metal ions could promote the degradation of vss which might be attributed to the disintegration of ha from organics by metal ions as described in fig 7 due to the increase of key enzymes activities hydrolytic enzymes and f420 moreover the dissolving and hydrolytic efficiency of excess sludge were enhanced to an extent which have positive effects on cell disintegration and lignocellulosic destruction and finally improve the degradation of vss the methane production along with the vss degradation in the ad system during solo ca2 or al3 added is shown in fig 9b their slopes of two lines represent the energy conversion efficiency methane yield per gram vss at 0 136 0 013 and 0 113 0 012 l ch4 g vss respectively with ca2 or al3 addition those results mean that either ca2 or al3 produced the same methane yield per gram vss at about 120 10 ml g vss it can be concluded that adding metal ions to relieve the inhibition of ha was due to the enhancement on the hydrolytic and methanogenic processes and thus improving indeed the removal ratio of vss rather than changing the energy conversion efficiency of organics the methane production per unit of organic matter 4 4 synergistic effect adding dual metal ions had the higher relieved efficiency than solo ca2 or al3 as shown figs 2 and 3 which can be also shown together in fig 10 the lower dually added concentration ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l could have relieved the inhibition of ha up to 80 which was higher than the sum 58 of solely added ca2 42 and al3 16 which demonstrates that there was a synergistic effect of ca2 and al3 the synergistic effect would realize a practical effect of 1 1 2 the reason behind the phenomena might be caused by the fact that with the lower al3 concentration added the hydroxy compound al oh n m could be preferentially interacted with a small proportion of ha functional groups under the circumstance ca2 could acquire more opportunities to further combine with the residual functional groups of ha via cation exchange interactions as a result the actions of electrostatic force and cation exchange as well as co precipitations by two metal ions would play a positive role in improving the ability of electric neutralization in the ad system and then enhance the relieved efficiency compared to the results in the solo metal ions added tests the higher concentrations of ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l for reaching the state of strong mutual repulsion were needed therefore the combined addition of metal ions would have the better mitigation on ha inhibition than solo metals added with the higher added concentrations of ca2 and al3 however the phenomena of 1 1 2 did not appear and conversely the relieved efficiency from the synergistic effect decreased rapidly the reason might be incurred by the strong mutual repulsion between excessive positive charges of metal ions and thus the weak interactions between metal ions and ha besides the high concentrations of metal ions could even decrease the activity of methane producing bacteria mpb as described above 5 inherent capacity of sludge for relieving the ha inhibition the non linear fitting of the relationship between added metal ions and their relieved efficiency is illustrated in fig s1 indeed there should be an optimal dosed concentration of metal ions against the ha inhibition this means that the practical inhibition of ha on the ad system should depend on the amount of metal ions contained in excess sludge clearly different metal ions have totally different optimal concentrations for relieving the ha inhibition moreover dual or multiple metal ions could have the synergistic effect which could lower the concentration of metal ions in relieving the ha inhibition as discussed above for this reason the ha inhibition on a practical ad system might be inherently reduced to a large extent if appropriate like the optimal levels shown in fig s1 metal ions exist in excess sludge as described above the concentrations of metal ions are floated ca2 80 500 mg l and al3 30 1000 mg l in different areas or with different treatment techniques novak and park 2010 krüger et al 2014 hao et al 2020 marti et al 2008 however these metal ions are not all effective ones on relieving the ha inhibition as a large part could be absorbed or wrapped by polymers and thus resulting in no use in relieving the ha inhibition under the circumstance excess sludge with high concentration of metal ions should have a stronger inherent capacity of relieving the ha inhibition however it is not true that a much higher concentration of metal ions would function on relieving the ha inhibition as shown in fig s1 thus the inherent capacity of relieving the ha inhibition by metal ions still needs to be ascertained 6 conclusions with the clean sludge containing almost no humic acid ha and metal ions the inhibition of ha on the ad process was designed by dosing ha and relieving the inhibition of ha by metal ions was also designed by dosing the different amounts of ca2 and al3 based on the results and discussion some major points can be concluded metal ions could effectively relieve the inhibition of ha on ad in which the highest relieved efficiency was around 65 solo ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l dual metal ions added could achieve the synergistic effect of 1 1 2 and the highest relieved efficiency reached up to 80 at the low combined concentration of ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l metal ions should interact with ha via electrostatic force cation exchange and sweep flocculation and then relieve the inhibition of ha on the ad process the mechanisms of metal ions relieving the inhibition of ha are due to releasing key enzymes and thus the enzymes activity was improved which resulted in enhancing degradation of organic substances the inhibition of ha on a practical ad system might inherently be reduced to an extent as there are some metal ions in excess sludge due to different water sources and or dosing coagulants during water and wastewater treatment

17464,anaerobic digestion ad is an effective approach to recovering chemical organic energy from excess sludge but the conversion efficiency for energy is usually not very high one of the obstacles comes from the severe inhibition of humic acid ha on both hydrolytic and methanogenic process on the ad therefore it is necessary to ascertain some effective approaches to relieving the inhibition of ha for obtaining a high methane ch4 yield with the clean sludge cultured by synthetic wastewater containing almost no ha and metal ions the inhibition of ha on the ad process was designed by dosing ha at 15 vss and relieving the inhibition by metal ions was also designed by dosing the different amounts of ca2 and al3 based on the batch ad experiments solo ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l added realized the highest relieved efficiency of 65 respectively interestingly dual metal ions added at the low concentrations ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l could reach up to 80 of the relieved efficiency which was attributed to the synergistic effect of 1 1 2 the mechanisms behind the phenomena could be that metal ions might interact with ha via electrostatic force cation exchange and sweep flocculation thus some key hydrolytic and methanogenic enzymes could indirectly be reactivated and degradation of organic substances could be enhanced in the ad process in wastewater treatment plants metal ions contained in excess sludge would inherently relieve the inhibition of ha to an extent which depends on the effective and or optimal concentration of metal ions at a free unabsorbed and or unwrapped state graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords anaerobic digestion ad humic acid ha hydrolysis methanogenesis inhibition metal ions relieved efficiency 1 introduction along with the signing of the paris climate agreement energy recovery from wastewater treatment plants has been given a renewed sense of urgency organic substances in wastewater represent a significant amount of chemical energy and recovering this energy contained in excess sludge via anaerobic digestion ad is considered as a more sustainable action than destroying it during treating disposing sludge hao et al 2019 frijns et al 2013 however it is difficult for ad to convert organic substances contained in sludge over 50 mccarty et al 2011 raposo et al 2012 which is attributed to stubborn bacterial cells and refractory organics as well as some inhibitors contained in sludge azman et al 2015 chen et al 2008 li et al 2019a and 2019b as a result some physical chemical and biological pretreatment or their combinations have been extensively studied and applied to improve the biodegradability of sludge biomass for increasing the biogas yield hendriks and zeeman 2009 hao et al 2017 wang et al 2019 indeed pretreatment technologies can positively increase the biogas yield in most cases however inhibitory compounds originally from excess sludge usually remain in bioreactors and moreover some additional inhibitors could be produced after pretreatment which could cause further inhibition klinke et al 2004 negro et al 2003 liu et al 2019 for the reason some studies have conducted to analyze and relieve the effect of inhibitory compounds on ad systems for achieving a more efficient methane ch4 production among others humic substances hss like humic acid ha which accounts for 6 20 of volatile suspended solids vss in excess sludge thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 are identified as a key inhibitory compound inhibiting both hydrolytic and methanogenic processes liu et al 2015 azman et al 2017 li et al 2019a and 2019b it has been concluded that the highest inhibited efficiency of energy conversion in the batch tests was at 35 2 with ha 15 vss in the ad system li et al 2019a and 2019b thus removing hss from sludge might be an option to overcome the negative effect on ad removing ha during drinking water treatment by membrane filtration can be applied ren and graham 2015 and extraction absorption ion exchange and coagulation plus flocculation have been already proposed to remove ha from some materials li et al 2014 song et al 2013 however these approaches seem to be unsuitable for ad system due to a high biomass content of sludge clearly other approaches are expected to relieve the inhibitory effects of ha two different approaches either adding hydrolytic enzyme or adding polyvalent metal ions have been proposed to relieve the inhibition of ha on ad azman et al 2015 brons et al 1985 fernandes et al 2015 moreover hydrolytic enzymes could only improve the hydrolytic efficiency rather than mitigate the inhibition of ha fernandes et al 2015 adding ca2 into ad relieved the inhibitory effect of humate on potato protein hydrolysis brons et al 1985 furthermore adding cacl2 is a solution to improve the methane production kumar et al 2016 also adding magnesium calcium and iron salts can mitigate the ha inhibition and increase the hydrolytic efficiencies azman et al 2015 azman et al 2015 found that in the ad system with ha the hydrolytic efficiency of lignocellulose with addition of ca2 mg2 and fe3 increased by 47 37 and 44 respectively and methane yield increased by 146 128 and 145 respectively azman et al 2015 on the other hand the effect of na and k is not obvious and the complexation degree of ha interacting with metal ions was k na mg2 fe3 fe2 ca2 azman et al 2015 some other studies have also shown that the addition of ca2 can effectively alleviate the hydrolysis of potato protein by humus brons et al 1985 these studies demonstrate that metal ions can relieve the inhibition of ha on the hydrolytic process and increase the methane yield but the associated mechanisms remain to be further explored the binding ability of heavy metal ions such as hg cu cd cr etc with ha is much stronger than that of ca mg al fe and so on rovira et al 2002 however addition of heavy metal ions into ad systems would increase the environmental risk of the ecosystem therefore ca mg al and fe could be an effective approach to relieving the inhibition of ha on ad in general the concentration of ca2 or mg2 is higher in ground water than that in surface water for examples northern cities of china usually utilize ground water and so the concentration of ca2 is relatively high in excess sludge 320 450 mg l in beijing krüger et al 2014 hao et al 2020 on the other hand southern cities of china mainly use surface water which has a low concentration of ca2 80 120 mg l marti et al 2008 as for al3 its concentration depends on coagulants use in water or wastewater treatment for examples the concentration of al3 in excess sludge is about 30 120 mg l using non aluminum coagulants while adding aluminum chemicals would result in up to 1 000 mg l novak and park 2010 krüger et al 2014 for this purpose it is necessary to ascertain the optimal concentration of metal ions and its relieved efficiency on inhibition of ha as well as involved mechanisms clearly with this study the attempt on the purpose was conducted based on our previous studies li et al 2019a and 2019b the idea for experiments used clean sludge containing almost no ha and metal ions which was cultured by synthetic wastewater in laboratory and then the designed levels of ha were added into the cultured sludge ca2 and al3 also their combination were selected as metal ions for relieving the ha inhibition 2 materials and methods 2 1 clean sludge and inoculum sludge synthetic wastewater was used to culture clean sludge almost without either ha or metal ions in a sequencing batch reactor sbr v 60 l which operated with hrt 3 d and srt 12 d aeration 22 h d settlement 2 h d as described in our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b the clean sludge was collected and sieved concentrated by a 0 15 mm filter and then stored in a refrigerator 4 c for use the inoculum sludge was taken from a 6 l fermenter biostat b plus german working volume 4 0 l headspace volume 2 0 l with srt 32 d which was also fed with the clean sludge for half a year to wash originally fed municipal sludge out the characteristics of both concentrated clean and inoculum sludge are listed in table 1 2 2 humic acid ha practical hss contained in excess sludge consist of complex organic compound of different molecules and ambiguous content 6 20 thurman 1985 imai et al 2002 however humic acid ha is a major form of hss chen et al 2008 liu et al 2019 thus a merchant ha was used to replace hss as demonstrated in our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b a quantitative comparison analysis by fourier transform infrared ftir spectrometer identification software reveals that the used ha has the similar degree to hss up to 87 3 2 3 experimental set up 2 3 1 anaerobic digestion experiments batch anaerobic digestion ad experiments were conducted in 600 ml serum bottles working volume 400 ml headspace volume 200 ml each bottle was fed with concentrated clean sludge and inoculum sludge at a vss ratio of 3 1 up to the 400 ml as listed in table 2 all the fed bottles were divided into three tests including i blanks for control no ha and metal ions were added ii tests inhibited by ha ha was added at 15 of vss and no metal ions were added iii tests with added metal ions both ha at 15 of vss and metal ions cacl2 and or alcl3 solo ca2 50 500 mg l solo al3 10 100 mg l and dual ca2 50 300 mg l plus al3 10 100 mg l were added as described in fig 1 all the fed bottles were adjusted by ph to 7 0 0 2 with naoh 3 m and or hcl 3 m purged with n2 for 3 min then sealed with rubber stoppers and finally moved into an air bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c all those experiments were conducted in duplicate 2 3 2 complexes of metal humic acid and their analysis metal ions might relieve the inhibition of ha by chemical interactions some studies cruz zavala et al 2016 have ambiguously identified the interactions based on different binding sites i internal boundary complexes the functional groups of ha strongly occupy the coordination water molecules and tightly combine with metal ions ii external boundary complexes the weak binding interactions such as electrostatic force and sweep flocculation for the reason additional tube tests were simultaneously conducted to quantitatively validate the interactions between metal ions and ha in the tube 50 ml the dosage of 0 05 g ha were added into deionized water at the total volume of 50 ml and ha 1 0 g l after stirred and dissolved metal ions ca2 or al3 were also added into the tubes at the concentrations range from 0 to 100 mg l all the tubes were sealed with rubber stoppers and moved into a water bath shaker 160 rpm and 35 2 c which had the same working conditions as described in the ad experiments in section 2 3 1 for 24 h in the shaker all the tubes were divided into two tests for analysis 1 first tests were analyzed to obtain the total amount of metal ions combined with ha including both internal and external boundary complexes based on the settlement for 12 h settled particles were discarded and supernatants were detected for the concentration of metal ions the concentration difference between initial and final metal ions should be the total complexes 2 second tests focused on figuring out the internal boundary complexes following the steps the tube samples were dialyzed overnight against demineralized water in dialysis bags with a molecular weight cut off of 500 da under this condition the unstable combination of metal ions with ha were disintegrated and released out of the dialysis bags then the remanent metal ions were the internal boundary complexes 2 4 analytical methods the centrifuged supernatant samples from the serum bottles were filtered via 0 45 μm membrane filters to analyze i vfas using ion chromatographer 883 basic ic plus metrohm ag ii soluble polysaccharide and protein by phenol sulfuric acid and the lorry method using uv spectrophotometer cary 5000 german agilent technologies company respectively apha 1998 li et al 2019a biogas production was measured by a gas liquid device and the biogas composition was analyzed by a gas chromatographer gc126 shanghai inesa other liquid samples were washed with 100 mm phosphate buffer pbs ph 7 4 mlss samples were sonicated at 4 c for 30 min and then separated by centrifuging at 11 000 rpm and 4 c for 30 min treated supernatants were placed on ice bags in order to analyze the activities of their enzymes different enzymes were analyzed by different methods including amylase dns method protease l lysine method in the hydrolytic phase based on the methods used by liu et al 2015 and f420 reducing hydrogenase used by trevors 1984 in the methanogenic phase respectively total solid ts volatile solids vs mixed liquor suspended solids mlss mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss oxidation reduction potential orp and ph were all detected according to the standard methods apha 1998 li et al 2019a the concentration of metal ions was measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes thermo fisher scientific icap7200 germany after digested by concentrated hno3 h2o2 under 150 c for 2 h hao et al 2017 the statistical analysis was performed with the spss 22 0 statistical software a one way anova was used to detect the significant effect of metal ions relieving the inhibition of ha on the methane production and the significant differences at the level of 95 based on data obtained from the duplicated experiments 2 5 evaluated methods based on our previous study li et al 2019a and 2019b ha indeed inhibits the ad process and decreases the energy conversion efficiency in this study the metal ions would play a positive or negative role in the ad system which was evaluated by the parameter emi the relieved efficiency as calculated by eq 1 1 e mi m mi m ha m 0 m ha where emi the relieved efficiency by metal ions ei 0 means a positive effect whereas ei 0 reveals a negative effect m0 mha and mmi are the methane production in the blanks for control the tests inhibited by ha and the tests with added metal ions respectively as shown in table 2 3 results and discussion 3 1 solo ca2 the methane yield with different ca2 concentration added is shown in fig 2 a which was about 104 ml g vss in the blank tests and 80 ml g vss in the inhibited tests clearly ha indeed inhibited the ad process and thus decreased the methane yield which was also confirmed in the previous studies liu et al 2015 li et al 2019a and 2019b along with increasing concentration of ca2 from 0 to 100 mg l however the methane yield was obviously increased from 80 to 96 ml g vss further increasing ca2 from 200 to 500 mg l the methane yield did not increase and reversely decrease to 80 ml g vss with the highest addition of ca2 500 mg l the relieved efficiency on the right vertical axis of fig 2a corresponds to an identical trend obviously a moderate concentration of ca2 50 300 mg l could effectively relieve the ha inhibition and improve the methane yield to an extent a higher concentration than 500 mg l of ca2 would not act with a positive effect among others the highest relieved efficiency of the methane yield was 65 4 at ca2 100 mg l conversely the higher concentration of metal salts would lead to further inhibition on the methane yield it may be due to the high salt concentration could affect the mechanisms of osmotic regulation of microorganisms resulting in the imbalance of internal and external osmotic pressure of microorganisms in addition it is easy to form precipitates with the high concentration of salts in ad systems and to wrap the microorganisms in sediments therefore the activities of key microorganisms would be hindered cruz zavala et al 2016 3 2 solo al3 the methane yield and its relieved efficiency with al3 added are shown in fig 2b it was occurred a similar trend to tests with adding ca2 the relieved efficiency increased from 0 to 65 7 along with al3 added from 0 to 70 mg l and dropped down to 15 1 at 100 mg l although the relieved efficiency of both ca2 and al3 was almost same 65 al3 reached to the peak relieved efficiency with a lower concentration 70 mg l than ca2 100 mg l which means that a higher valent of metal ions had a superiority over relieving the inhibition of ha 3 3 dual ca2 and al3 solely adding either ca2 or al3 did not achieve the full recovery of the methane yield relieved efficiency at 100 for this reason the dual addition of ca2 and al3 was tested for analyzing their effect on relieving inhibition which is shown in fig 3 as shown in fig 3 the combination of ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l reached up to the highest relieved efficiency of 80 which is higher than the results 65 obtained in the solo tests clearly the dual addition of metal ions had a synergistic effect on relieving the ha inhibition at the fixed ca2 50 mg l interestingly increasing al3 from 10 to 100 mg l decreased the relieved efficiency from 80 0 al3 10 mg l to 38 7 al3 100 mg l at the fixed ca2 100 mg l similarly increasing al3 from 10 to 70 mg l had no effect on the relieved efficiency either with the lower al3 10 mg l furthermore increasing ca2 up to 300 mg l did not change the relieved efficiency either at the fixed al3 70 mg l finally the relieved efficiency was kept at the same level at about 55 whatever added ca2 was thus a similar conclusion can be drawn that the high concentration of metal ions or their combination did not achieve an even higher relieved efficiency and conversely a further inhibition would occur 4 analysis of involved mechanisms 4 1 binding of metal ions by humic acid ha fig 4 a illustrates the internal boundary complexes of metal ions ha from the additional tests the saturation concentration of ca2 and al3 bonded by ha 1 0 g l was at about 85 mg l and 40 mg l respectively interestingly the molar electron equivalents of ca2 and al3 are almost at the identical level at 4 3 mmol e l ca2 and 4 4 mmol e l al3 which means that the internal boundary complexes only depend on the charge density not on the type of metal ions thus the possible bonded principles of metal ions are shown in fig 5 the negative charges of dissociated hydroxyl cooh or carboxyl groups oh and other functional groups on the surface of ha could be combined with the positive charges of metal ions the interactions of electrostatic force and cation exchange should be stronger than the combined interactions between ha and enzymes or organic molecules as a result ha would fail to compete with organics in the ad system and release enzymes and organic molecules into its supernatant fig 4b indicates the total boundary complexes of metal ions bonded by ha both ca2 and al3 were combined with a large amount of ha the highest combined efficiencies of ca2 and al3 were at 250 25 mg ca2 mg ha and 400 40 mg al3 mg ha respectively clearly there were also some external boundary complexes besides the internal boundary complexes and these interactions might also help to relieve the inhibition of ha on the ad process as can be seen in fig 4 the bonded degree of al3 was much stronger than that of ca2 which might be attributed to two potential functions 1 electrostatic force between ions or colloids with positive or negative charges electrostatic force should depend on the distance of cations and their valence plimpton et al 1936 the charge number of trivalent ion al3 is higher than that of divalent ion ca2 and moreover the radius of al3 is smaller than that of ca2 for this reason the electrostatic force between al3 and ha is stronger than that of ca2 2 different interactions with ha the internal boundary complexes between metal ions and ha were formed mainly by electrostatic force and cation exchange besides al3 could also interact with ha via the sweep flocculation and co precipitations interactions due to the formation of hydroxy compound al oh nm therefore al3 had a stronger capacity than ca2 for relieving the inhibition of ha as discussed above 4 2 key enzymes release 4 2 1 hydrolytic enzymes both polysaccharide and protein are two simple parameters evaluating the hydrolytic efficiency of organics and so their variations with metal ions added are shown in fig 6 both polysaccharide and protein decreased steadily from 150 mg l and 970 mg l ca2 0 mg l down to about around 50 mg l and 500 mg l ca2 200 mg l respectively no further decrease occurred with above 200 mg ca2 l fig 6a adding al3 had a similar trend fig 6b polysaccharide and protein decreased from 150 mg l and 780 mg l al3 0 mg l down to about 50 mg l and 500 mg l al3 100 mg l respectively probably metal ions could affect the accumulation of polysaccharide and protein lower accumulation of polysaccharide and protein should not be caused by the inhibiting disintegration of bacterial cells as the final methane production was importantly improved li et al 2019a and 2019b instead this could be attributed to releasing key enzymes and improving the hydrolytic efficiency interaction of metal ions with ha would result in key enzymes released and thus the key enzymes could accelerate the hydrolysis of polysaccharide and protein which could reduce the accumulation of them as an evidence the activities of α amylase and proteinase in the hydrolytic process were detected and the results of them are also shown in fig 6 on the right vertical axis along with adding ca2 and al3 the activities of both α amylase and proteinase were enhanced to over 100 fig 6 definitely metal ions could indeed release the hydrolytic enzymes indirectly the inhibition of ha on the ad process was mainly attributed to the interaction of ha with key enzymes and thus their relative activities were decreased li et al 2019a and 2019b when metal ions were added they were easily bonded by ha and thus could untie the combination of ha and enzymes as a result more activated sites of enzymes were released to improve the hydrolytic efficiency as depicted in fig 7 4 2 2 methanogenic enzymes the activity of a key enzyme in the methanogenic process co enzyme f420 reducing hydrogenase was also measured fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the activity of co enzyme f420 was significantly enhanced with the increased dosage of metal ions the activity reached up to the highest level 175 ca2 300 mg l over this point further dosage contributed a little bit of decrease to the activity 160 at ca2 500 mg l interestingly the behavior of al3 seemed stronger than ca2 as dosing 10 mg l of al3 had enhanced the activity up to 155 the highest activity reached up to 183 at al3 30 mg l overdosing al3 had no effect on improving the activity clearly metal ions could also stimulate the activity of methanogenic enzymes which was positive in improving the methane production it is similar to metal ions interacting with the hydrolytic enzymes that metal ions could bond with ha and thus release the f420 enzymes into supernatant as shown in fig 7 however a high concentration dosage of metal ions would inhibit the methanogenic microorganisms and thus decrease the secretion of enzymes affecting the enzyme activity 4 3 improving the removal of volatile suspended solids vss the removal ratio of volatile suspended solids vss to total suspended solids tss is usually an index for evaluating the performance of the ad system and the result is shown in fig 9 a the removal ratio of vss decreased from around 36 in the control tests to 23 in the inhibited tests however it climbed to 32 at ca2 100 mg l and to 30 at al3 70 mg l respectively any further increased dosage of ca2 and al3 would reduce the removal ratio of vss therefore adding metal ions could promote the degradation of vss which might be attributed to the disintegration of ha from organics by metal ions as described in fig 7 due to the increase of key enzymes activities hydrolytic enzymes and f420 moreover the dissolving and hydrolytic efficiency of excess sludge were enhanced to an extent which have positive effects on cell disintegration and lignocellulosic destruction and finally improve the degradation of vss the methane production along with the vss degradation in the ad system during solo ca2 or al3 added is shown in fig 9b their slopes of two lines represent the energy conversion efficiency methane yield per gram vss at 0 136 0 013 and 0 113 0 012 l ch4 g vss respectively with ca2 or al3 addition those results mean that either ca2 or al3 produced the same methane yield per gram vss at about 120 10 ml g vss it can be concluded that adding metal ions to relieve the inhibition of ha was due to the enhancement on the hydrolytic and methanogenic processes and thus improving indeed the removal ratio of vss rather than changing the energy conversion efficiency of organics the methane production per unit of organic matter 4 4 synergistic effect adding dual metal ions had the higher relieved efficiency than solo ca2 or al3 as shown figs 2 and 3 which can be also shown together in fig 10 the lower dually added concentration ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l could have relieved the inhibition of ha up to 80 which was higher than the sum 58 of solely added ca2 42 and al3 16 which demonstrates that there was a synergistic effect of ca2 and al3 the synergistic effect would realize a practical effect of 1 1 2 the reason behind the phenomena might be caused by the fact that with the lower al3 concentration added the hydroxy compound al oh n m could be preferentially interacted with a small proportion of ha functional groups under the circumstance ca2 could acquire more opportunities to further combine with the residual functional groups of ha via cation exchange interactions as a result the actions of electrostatic force and cation exchange as well as co precipitations by two metal ions would play a positive role in improving the ability of electric neutralization in the ad system and then enhance the relieved efficiency compared to the results in the solo metal ions added tests the higher concentrations of ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l for reaching the state of strong mutual repulsion were needed therefore the combined addition of metal ions would have the better mitigation on ha inhibition than solo metals added with the higher added concentrations of ca2 and al3 however the phenomena of 1 1 2 did not appear and conversely the relieved efficiency from the synergistic effect decreased rapidly the reason might be incurred by the strong mutual repulsion between excessive positive charges of metal ions and thus the weak interactions between metal ions and ha besides the high concentrations of metal ions could even decrease the activity of methane producing bacteria mpb as described above 5 inherent capacity of sludge for relieving the ha inhibition the non linear fitting of the relationship between added metal ions and their relieved efficiency is illustrated in fig s1 indeed there should be an optimal dosed concentration of metal ions against the ha inhibition this means that the practical inhibition of ha on the ad system should depend on the amount of metal ions contained in excess sludge clearly different metal ions have totally different optimal concentrations for relieving the ha inhibition moreover dual or multiple metal ions could have the synergistic effect which could lower the concentration of metal ions in relieving the ha inhibition as discussed above for this reason the ha inhibition on a practical ad system might be inherently reduced to a large extent if appropriate like the optimal levels shown in fig s1 metal ions exist in excess sludge as described above the concentrations of metal ions are floated ca2 80 500 mg l and al3 30 1000 mg l in different areas or with different treatment techniques novak and park 2010 krüger et al 2014 hao et al 2020 marti et al 2008 however these metal ions are not all effective ones on relieving the ha inhibition as a large part could be absorbed or wrapped by polymers and thus resulting in no use in relieving the ha inhibition under the circumstance excess sludge with high concentration of metal ions should have a stronger inherent capacity of relieving the ha inhibition however it is not true that a much higher concentration of metal ions would function on relieving the ha inhibition as shown in fig s1 thus the inherent capacity of relieving the ha inhibition by metal ions still needs to be ascertained 6 conclusions with the clean sludge containing almost no humic acid ha and metal ions the inhibition of ha on the ad process was designed by dosing ha and relieving the inhibition of ha by metal ions was also designed by dosing the different amounts of ca2 and al3 based on the results and discussion some major points can be concluded metal ions could effectively relieve the inhibition of ha on ad in which the highest relieved efficiency was around 65 solo ca2 100 mg l or al3 70 mg l dual metal ions added could achieve the synergistic effect of 1 1 2 and the highest relieved efficiency reached up to 80 at the low combined concentration of ca2 50 mg l and al3 10 mg l metal ions should interact with ha via electrostatic force cation exchange and sweep flocculation and then relieve the inhibition of ha on the ad process the mechanisms of metal ions relieving the inhibition of ha are due to releasing key enzymes and thus the enzymes activity was improved which resulted in enhancing degradation of organic substances the inhibition of ha on a practical ad system might inherently be reduced to an extent as there are some metal ions in excess sludge due to different water sources and or dosing coagulants during water and wastewater treatment
