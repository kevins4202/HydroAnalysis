1240,excess salt loading from watershed landscapes into river systems acts as a chemical stressor in water bodies and can have significant impacts on downstream water quality high salinity threatens sustainable crop production globally and is especially prevalent in semi arid and arid regions however relatively little research has been conducted to evaluate salt movement and loadings in natural high desert catchments in the face of climate change and extreme climate events in this study we use the watershed model swat and a newly developed salinity module to simulate the mass transport of 8 major salt ions so4 2 cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 na mg2 and k in the soil aquifer stream system of the purgatoire river watershed prw colorado usa 8935 km2 via major hydrologic pathways surface runoff percolation recharge soil lateral flow groundwater upflux groundwater discharge and quantify changes in predicted salt loads with possible future increasing storm intensity the prw is susceptible to high salt transport due to high topographic slopes dry climatic conditions and sparse vegetation and loads to the arkansas river a major source of irrigation water in the arkansas river basin from study results we conclude that 99 of salt in the purgatoire river originates from subsurface water pathways soil lateral flow groundwater flow composed primarily of so4 2 ca2 and hco3 if intensity of large storms increases by 5 and 35 the total salt mass exported from the watershed increases by 12 and 73 respectively indicating large influxes of legacy salt from the soil aquifer system for baseline and storm intensity scenarios the prw contributes significant salt loads to agricultural regions via the arkansas river highlighting the need for basin wide salt management strategies to include upland desert regions we expect these results and associated consequences for salt management to be similar for other upland desert catchments worldwide keywords salinity river basin management groundwater irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinization is a global concern for the degradation of soil and water resources excess salt minerals can decrease water quality cause biodiversity loss decrease crop yield increase risk of soil erosion contaminate drinking water and lower soil biological activity vengosh 2014 zamann et al 2018 soluble salt ions such as sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 potassium k chloride cl carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 can be deposited in soil and water supplies both naturally and anthropogenically natural salt deposits can accumulate from parent rock or soil material with salt minerals dissolving to mobile ions e g gypsum caso4 dissolving to ca2 and so4 2 these mobile ions are then transported via hydrologic pathways to surface water streams and reservoirs soil water and groundwater supplies burkhalter et al 2006 this is particularly a concern in regions with shallow water tables low soil permeability high evapotranspiration and sparse precipitation hassani et al 2020 hosseini and bailey 2022 anthropogenic actions that can increase salinization include vegetation clearing mining activities application of road salts dugan et al 2017 and effluent from wastewater treatment plants but the most prominent human act that leads to increased salinization is irrigation specifically in semi arid regions sharp declines in crop production have occurred in 27 28 of irrigated land in the western united states due to high soil salinity which prevents root water uptake and inhibiting transpiration and photosynthetic processes bailey et al 2019 tanji 2004 with high soil salinity occurring due to salt mineral dissolution inadequate drainage and evapo concentration in the soil profile worldwide agricultural productivity losses of salt inflicted soils have been estimated at 10 billion per year ghassemi et al 1995 the overall problem of salt accumulation and impacts on soil and crops well as continually increasing global population growth has driven the intensive study of salt transport in irrigated regions duncan et al 2008 foster et al 2018 schoups et al 2005 however comparatively little research has been conducted on salt fate and transport in dominantly non irrigated desert catchments that are often upstream of productive agricultural catchments naturally occurring salt afflicted regions are less regulated than irrigated catchments due to the apparent distance from human activity and associated human intervention however headwater upland catchments have been recognized as sources of high sediment generation with steep gradients high runoff volumes thin vegetation cover and active geomorphic processes stenson et al 2011 zimmer and bailey 2021 consequently these upland catchments are also susceptible to high volumes of salt transport and therefore understanding and regulation of upstream non irrigated catchments could be a key factor in reducing the impact of salinity globally for example biggs et al 2013 found that small upland catchments have a greater export import ratio of salt as compared to major downstream catchments using a mass balance approach from 55 gauging stations stenson et al 2011 noted the importance of salinity exports in unregulated upland catchments to the increasing salinization of australia s murray darling basin using the lumped parameter 2csalt salinity model zimmer and bailey 2021 used field measurements and mass balance approaches in a high desert watershed in southeastern colorado usa and found that salt loadings to the receiving arkansas river are significant however of these studies none have systematically explored and quantified the impact of high intensity storms on salt mobilization movement and in stream loading within high desert watersheds the results of zimmer and bailey 2021 suggest that high intensity storms in semi arid regions can have a large impact on salt transport in upland catchments however the findings were limited to years with stream data and did not explore the mobilization and hydrologic pathways of salt loading to the stream network with climate extremes predicted to increase in the future coumou and rahmstorf 2012 francis et al 1998 understanding the role of high intensity storms in high desert watersheds can be important in estimating salt loading to downstream irrigated regions numerical computer models have been extensively used to simulate salt processes on a variety of spatial scales and could be used to investigate the impact of high intensity storms on salt movement for example swat salt is the combination of the widely known soil and water assessment tool swat and a coupled salinity module bailey et al 2019 swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based conceptual watershed scale hydrologic model that was developed by the usda agricultural research service to evaluate best management practices for water supply and nonpoint source pollution in large river basins swat has been popularized globally because the minimum requirements to run a simulation i e a digital elevation model dem land use land cover map and soil map are often readily available through public government organizations the swat website http swatmodel tamu edu provides extensive model documentation including theoretical documentation with equations a user s manual defining model inputs and outputs a developer s manual and tutorial videos for the project setup in the arcswat interface of an example watershed swat salt the salinity module coupled to swat was one of the first process based models to consider salt transport within all major hydrologic pathways and salt chemical reactions precipitation dissolution complexation and cation exchange within the soil layers and the alluvial aquifer for individual ions at the watershed scale bailey et al 2019 swat salt focuses on the transport and effects of major salt ions since the swat hydrologic model is well researched and the salinity module is well detailed i e division into the eight ions for all major hydrologic pathways the swat salt model was chosen in this study to quantify a gap in research knowledge of salt transport and mobilization from largely undeveloped upland catchments swat salt has been used to simulate salt ion transport in irrigated watersheds bailey et al 2019 hosseini and bailey 2022 jiang et al 2022 but has not yet been applied to high desert watersheds the objective of this study is to quantify the impact of climate change and increasing storm intensity on the mobilization movement and loading of salt in an upland watershed in a semi arid region this is achieved by applying swat salt to the undeveloped purgatoire river watershed 8922 km2 in southeastern colorado we use a modeling approach so that loads can be estimated for years and conditions that do not have field data and so that salt sources and transport pathways can be quantified the model is calibrated and tested against stream discharge and in stream salt ion loads for several gage sites within the watershed and then used to quantify the impact of increasing future storm intensity results also provide insights into hydrologic pathways that govern in stream salt loading and general spatial patterns of salt mobilization and transport to the purgatoire river and its tributaries as the purgatoire river discharges to the arkansas river which services many irrigated areas in southeastern colorado and western kansas this study also provides a sense of the salinity impact of high desert watersheds on rivers that carry water downstream for irrigation use 2 methods 2 1 study region purgatoire river watershed the purgatoire river watershed with a drainage area of 8935 km2 is one of the largest contributing watersheds to the arkansas river within the upper arkansas river basin fig 1 a subbasin of the arkansas red white basin the headwaters of the purgatoire river originate in the sangre de cristo mountain range near weston co the purgatoire flows 194 mi from the mountains through high desert natural steep terrain to the arkansas river outlet near las animas co in bent county river flow in the downstream region of the watershed is controlled principally by the dam at trinidad reservoir fig 2 with discharge occurring mainly between april and october tributaries of the purgatoire are mainly ephemeral and have carved a complex network of canyons and mesas throughout the basin dominant land uses are herbaceous rangeland and mixed shrubland covering 53 and 23 of the basin respectively fig 1b the dominant vegetation in the shrubland is piñon juniper woodlands less than 1 3 of the entire basin is designated as developed evergreen and mixed forests are found sparsely scattered throughout the rangeland a defining characteristic of this watershed is the steep slope gradients with an average slope of 12 and maximum slope of 249 fig 1c many riparian areas of the purgatoire river are lined with steep sloped plateaus fig 1c most rainfall in the prw occurs between april and october with high intensity storm events often occurring between july and september these intense summer storms produce more runoff and streamflow than winter and spring precipitation purgatoire watershed partnership 2014 weather stations are sparse throughout the basin there are several stations monitored by the colorado agriculture meteorological network coagmet http www coagmet colostate edu that lie within or adjacent to the basin fig 2 the hoehne station hne01 is located within 10 miles of the trinidad airport and has historical climate data since the year 2000 the la junta station ljt01 las animas station lms02 and rocky ford experimental station rfd01 are all outside the boundaries of the watershed but close to the outlet these three stations have reported climate data since 1972 2020 and 1992 respectively climate data from the trinidad airport la junta station and rocky ford station were evaluated for this study and will be further discussed in the hydrologic modeling section for trinidad annual average maximum and minimum temperatures are 86 8 f in july and 18 9 f in january and average annual precipitation is 396 mm the hoehne station in northeast trinidad recorded an average annual precipitation of 254 mm between 2001 and 2020 the rocky ford and la junta stations have recorded average annual precipitation values of 259 mm and 256 mm respectively since 1993 and 2006 2 2 quantifying salt loading in the purgatoire river watershed using swat salt in this study we use the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 watershed modeling code and a newly developed salinity module bailey et al 2019 to simulate hydrologic and salt transport processes in the purgatoire river watershed prw in this section we present the construction calibration and testing of the base swat hydrologic model for the prw followed by the inclusion of the salinity module and its application in doing so we establish a method for simulating mass transport of salt ions in high desert natural landscapes that can be applied to other watersheds worldwide 2 2 1 simulating hydrologic processes in the purgatoire river watershed using swat 2 2 1 1 swat theory swat is a process based semi distributed river basin model that simulates the movement of water nutrients and sediment in a watershed system within a swat hydrologic model watersheds are divided into smaller subbasins that are spatially homogenous to reference different areas of the basin subbasins are comprised of hydrologic response units hrus which represent a unique combination of land use soil type and slope the hru is the smallest computational unit used in swat to calculate a soil water balance an aquifer water balance and associated hydrologic fluxes such as surface runoff infiltration and percolation soil lateral flow groundwater recharge and upflux and groundwater flow and associated nutrient and sediment mass loads fluxes and loads from each hru are summed within each subbasin and routed to the subbasin channel and then routed through the watershed channel network to the watershed outlet streamflow is composed of the summation of daily surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge precipitation and irrigation drive the hydrologic processes in swat with water balance nutrient mass balance and sediment mass balance performed for four main systems the land surface system the soil system the aquifer system and the stream network system 2 2 1 2 swat model for the purgatoire river watershed the swat model for the prw is applied to the period 1990 2020 due to availability of salt ion data in the river system since this study is focused on salt transport in semi arid regions the mountainous region of the prw was excluded from the model watershed delineation resulting in a model domain of 7081km2 with the inlet of the model represented by the outflow point from trinidad reservoir see fig 2 required datasets for delineation and creation of subbasin boundaries the stream network and hydrologic response units hrus include a digital elevation model dem 30 m and land cover distribution raster 30 m from the national resources conservation service nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov gdgorder aspx the dem is a product of the national elevation dataset ned and the land cover distribution is a product of the national land cover database soil unit boundaries and attributes are obtained from ssurgo minimum subbasin delineation area was set to 2500 ha to adequately depict the tributary network resulting in 169 subbasins using thresholds of 1 land use 5 soil and 0 slope resulted in 5643 hrus daily flow at the trinidad reservoir outlet usgs gage site 07124410 see fig 2 was specified as inflow to the model domain canal and ditch diversions along the purgatoire river see fig 2 table s1 in supplementary material were included in the swat model as point sinks we used downscaled prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model accessed at https www prism oregonstate edu explorer february 2022 data for daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature data for the 1988 2021 period using the centroid for each of the 169 subbasins the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from prism corresponded well with the gage data in the region and were entered directly into the swat model however prism estimates of daily precipitation over estimated values as compared to weather stations in the area but followed similar temporal patterns fig 3a therefore prism data was corrected based on daily data from the hoehne weather station using a linear relationship fig 3b r2 0 88 2 2 1 3 model calibration and testing hydrology the model was calibrated 1995 2005 and tested 2010 2021 using monthly streamflow at the prw outlet usgs gage site 07128500 and annual estimates of water balance components reitz et al 2017 additional model testing was performed by comparing simulated monthly streamflow to measured monthly streamflow at the purgatoire river at thatcher the purgatoire river at ninemile dam and van bremer arroyo see fig 2 van bremer arroyo is a smaller drainage area of 450 km2 intermittent tributary that releases just upstream of the thatcher gage the thatcher and ninemile gages are 105 km and 45 km upstream of the outlet respectively mixed automatic and manual calibration practices were utilized to estimate parameter values automatic calibration was conducted using swat cup abbaspour 2012 and the goodness of fit between the modeled and measured streamflow was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse table 1 lists the parameters included in swat cup the lower and upper bound of each parameter value and the final calibrate value parameters were specified for both riparian and rangeland subbasins due to key land cover differences and assumed differences in parameter function parameter types include snow snowfall temperature sftmp c snow melt base temperature smtmp c melt factor for snow on june 21 smfmx mm h2o c day melt factor for snow on december 21 smfmn mm h2o c day and the snowpack temperature lag factor timp land surface groundwater and channel parameters related to evaporation groundwater exchange and lateral flow shallow groundwater flow had the greatest impact on the model as these forces drive the hydrologic cycle in the region specifically the curve number cn effective hydraulic conductivity in main channel alluvium ch k 2 mm h slope length for lateral subsurface flow slsoil m and average slope steepness hru slp m m had strong influences on lateral flow and surface runoff other parameters that demonstrated influence were the baseflow alpha factor alpha bf 1 days threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer for revap or percolation to the deep aquifer to occur revapmn mm h2o and threshold depth of water in the shallow aquifer required for return flow to occur gwqmn mm h2o manual calibration was conducted by modifying key model parameters curve number channel alluvium hydraulic conductivity to closely match simulated hydrologic fluxes evaporation percolation surface runoff groundwater return flow soil lateral flow to published regional estimates of base flow index bfi values and annual ratios of et to precipitation wolock 2003 estimated an average bfi value of 36 with maximum and minimum values of 57 and 10 respectively in the modeled watershed area although bfi values often are underestimated in regions with high et rates such as the prw reitz et al 2017 estimated an average et precipitation ratio of 0 99 2 2 2 simulating salt transport in the purgatoire river watershed using swat salt 2 2 2 1 swat salt theory the salinity module for swat was developed by bailey et al 2019 and includes the mass fate and transport of 8 major salt ions so4 2 cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 na mg2 and k in the major hydrologic pathways surface runoff percolation soil lateral flow groundwater discharge of a watershed system subject to precipitation dissolution of major salt minerals caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl present in the soil and aquifer systems the module is available as open source code at https github com rtbailey8 swat salinity presentation of salt ion equilibrium chemistry equations are provided in bailey et al 2019 similar to the nutrient mass transport algorithms of swat salt mass transport is simulated using mass balance in the land surface soil aquifer and channel systems for example the mass balance of so4 mass m kg ha in a soil layer of a single hru using a daily time step is calculated as 1 dm so 4 soil dt m irrig sw m irrig gw m diss m precip m ro m lat m perc m revap where irrig sw represents salt ion mass in surface water irrigation irrig gw represents salt ion mass in groundwater irrigation diss represents dissolution of salt minerals into salt ion mass e g gypsum caso4 ca so4 precip represents precipitation of salt minerals from dissolved salt ion mass ro represents salt ion mass removed via surface runoff lat represents salt ion mass removed via soil lateral flow perc represents salt ion mass removed via percolation from the bottom of the soil layer and revap represents salt ion mass added to the soil layer via upflux from the shallow aquifer the mass balance equation for the aquifer system is 2 dm so 4 gw dt m perc m revap m diss m precip m gwflow where gwflow represents the salt ion mass removed from the aquifer via groundwater discharge to the subbasin stream the salinity module code is imbedded directly into the swat fortran code called as subroutines for hru subbasin and channel calculations 2 2 2 2 swat salt modifications for erosional runoff in this study we have amended the salinity module to include salt mobilization and transport in erosional runoff during storm events due to the combination of storm events and high topographic slopes we use the following polygon relationship kim et al 2022 experimentally derived from hundreds of field samples taken from rainfall runoff field experiments colorado river basin report blm 2015 cadaret et al 2016 in the desert shrublands of the upper colorado river basin a similar semi arid landscape to the prw the polynomial simulates the concentration mg l of total dissolved solids tds in erosion runoff water 3 tds 160256 1 246 x 1 0 0901 x 2 2 0 00031 x 2 3 1 296 x 3 17 44 x 4 0 1557 x 4 2 1 287 x 5 60865 x 6 7659 x 6 2 319 x 6 3 171 x 7 14 03 x 7 2 where tds is in mg l x 1 runoff during a rain event mm x 2 sediment concentration g l x 3 rock fraction of the soil x 4 sodium adsorption ratio sar x 5 cation exchange capacity cec mg l x 6 ph of the soil water and x 7 electrical conductivity ec of the soil water swat simulates runoff mm and sediment concentration g l during a rainfall event sar and cec equations are calculated based on the simulated ion concentrations in the top soil layer of each hru 4 sar na 0 5 mg 2 ca 2 5 cec c ca c mg c k c na once the tds is calculated for each rainfall runoff event the concentration of the 8 salt ions is calculated based on the ratio of salt ion concentration to tds in the soil water the salt ion loading in erosional runoff m eros is computed by multiplying the salt ion concentration by the runoff volume therefore the total mass of each salt ion loaded to a subbasin stream on a given day of the simulation is the summation of runoff soil lateral flow groundwater flow and erosional runoff salt loads 6 m total m ro m lat m gwflow m eros 2 2 2 3 swat salt model for the purgatoire river watershed the salinity module requires initial salt ion concentrations in hru soil layers and aquifers and initial salt mineral content in soil layers and aquifers we used nrcs ssurgo soil data to obtain salt mineral content for gypsum caso4 and calcium carbonate caco3 the weighted average of caso4 fig 1d and caco3 fig 1e for each subbasin was calculated based on the area of each soil map unit polygon the mineral percent by weight in each polygon and the total subbasin area each hru within the same subbasin received the same initial mineral content due to a lack of aquifer salt data we assumed that the initial aquifer mineral content was equivalent to the initial soil mineral content initial concentrations mg l of each of the 8 salt ions in the soil and groundwater were estimated using samples from usgs groundwater monitoring wells there are 24 wells that have reported concentrations for the 8 salt ions modeled and only 2 of the wells reported ion concentrations on two different dates the earliest sample was taken in 1964 and the latest sample was taken in 1988 table 2 shows the number of samples taken for each ion the average concentrations from the samples and the standard deviation of the concentrations the full list of sample concentrations of each of the salt ions and usgs site numbers is provided in table s2 in supplementary material daily salt ion mass loading kg at the trinidad reservoir outlet i e the upstream end of the model domain was estimated using linear relationships between salt ion concentrations of water samples and measured daily specific conductance μs cm in the river water due to lack of salt ion concentration data at the outlet site sample results from the purgatoire river at madrid co usgs gage site 07124200 just upstream of trinidad reservoir were used this site has 11 reported samples of so4 ca na mg k and cl 9 samples of hco3 and 6 samples of co3 2 between 1978 and 1981 plots of linear relationships between salt ion concentration and specific conductance are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material all 6 of the co3 samples reported a concentration of 0 mg l with varying specific conductance values so the co3 in the inflow was set to 0 mg l gaps in daily values of specific conductance were estimated using linear interpolation see fig s2 in supplementary material and then the linear relationships were used to estimate daily salt ion concentration mg l in river flow at the reservoir outlet multiplied by daily flow m3 day to estimate daily salt ion loads kg day in the purgatoire river 2 2 2 4 model calibration and testing salinity using the hydrologic parameters estimated in the base swat model swat salt results are compared against measured monthly salt loads as estimated by the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 using stream discharge specific conductance and available salt ion concentration data for the outlet gage near las animas there were 58 samples of hco3 68 samples of ca2 and mg2 74 samples of cl and na 42 samples of k and 89 samples of so4 2 between 1961 and 2019 three different statistical estimation methods are considered in loadest of which the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation amle is usually preferred amle was used in this study and the residuals of each ion load were determined to be normally distributed table s3 in supplementary material presents the amle regression statistics the load bias in percent bp and the nse for loadest results compared to measured values positive bp values indicate over estimation and negative bp values indicate underestimation the regression equation used to calculate the monthly load of each salt ion are provided in table s4 in supplementary material there were 20 months within the calibration period and 10 months within the validation period that loadest could not produce results due to lack of available water quality inputs model calibration and testing for salt loading was conducted for the periods 1990 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively the spatially heterogenous initial ion concentrations in both the groundwater and soil profile were manually calibrated for hco3 na and mg2 by multiplying each salt ion concentration by the same factor i e either decreasing or increasing each value by the same percentage thereby maintaining spatial patterns from the observation data additionally since no ssurgo data was available for the salt minerals mgco3 nacl and mgso4 all subbasins were given very small values of soil and aquifer mineral content these values were manually adjusted during calibration to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of salt mineral content across the watershed the assigned values of mgco3 mgso4 and nacl soil and aquifer content basis were related to the ssurgo derived caco3 content subbasins with caco3 content greater than 15 received 0 1 of both mgco3 and mgso4 greater than 10 of caco3 received 0 05 of mgco3 and mgso4 greater than 5 caco3 received 0 02 of mgco3 and mgso4 and the remaining subbasins received 0 001 of mgco3 and mgso4 subbasins with caco3 content greater than 15 received 0 005 nacl greater than 10 of caco3 received 0 001 of nacl greater than 4 5 caco3 received 0 0005 nacl and the remaining subbasins received 0 0001 nacl the fractions of nacl were lower than the mineral content of mgco3 and mgso4 because nacl is more soluble the mineral content differed for each subbasin but was assumed to be the same in the soil and the aquifer swat salt results were compared to loadest results at the basin outlet the purgatoire river at las animas usgs gage the statistical indices nse and r2 were calculated for monthly loads of each salt ion initial model results showed an under estimation of in river salt loadings compared to the loadest results therefore initial concentrations of several ions hco3 na and mg2 were increased by 30 in both the groundwater and soil profiles uniformly for each hru 2 2 3 quantifying the impact of precipitation extremes on salt loading in addition to using the swat salt model to investigate the mobilization transport and loading of salt ion mass from the landscape to streams under historical conditions we use the swat salt model to investigate and quantify the impact of high intensity storms on salt loadings we also use model results to determine the mechanisms by which changes in salt loading occur this analysis is undertaken due to the potential for storm events to mobilize salt in high desert watersheds and the possibility of increasing storm intensity in future decades due to climate change zimmer and bailey 2021 in a field study of the prw concluded that most of the salt loading to the purgatoire river can be attributed to large storm events recent studies using climate model output colorado water conservation board 2019 have predicted that extreme rainfall events in colorado will increase in intensity for the 100 year daily rainfall event the smallest median percent increase was 5 from the 1 c warming threshold scenario and the largest median percent increase was 20 from the 3 c warming threshold scenario the latter scenario also demonstrated a maximum percent increase of 35 with these predictions in mind we evaluate 3 thresholds for increasing precipitation intensity in the purgatoire river basin 0 baseline 5 and 35 increases in daily precipitation of extreme events the 3 scenarios are respectively referred to as scenarios 0 2 throughout the rest of this paper scenario 0 acts as a baseline scenario 1 represents the median predicted intensity increase and scenario 2 represents the maximum predicted intensity increase all scenarios were run during the same historical period as the swat salt model 1990 2010 to simplify swat salt precipitation inputs for the 169 subbasins the weather data for 17 subbasins 10 of the total subbasins was used for the three scenarios the 17 subbasins were chosen to represent the spatial heterogeneity of storms in the watershed see fig s3 in supplementary material since there were no 100 year storms during the model period extreme events were defined as the top 5 of storms in the 17 subbasins this equated to 4 mm of precipitation in one day the impact of increasing storm intensity was evaluated by increasing any daily precipitation event greater than or equal to 4 mm by the 3 thresholds through the entire model period although the climate models evaluated colorado water conservation board 2019 predict the intensity of storms to increase in this region the average annual precipitation is not expected to increase therefore the precipitation input data was normalized to maintain the same average annual precipitation as the baseline scenario this normalization was achieved by subtracting depths of water for daily precipitation events less than 4 mm for each of the 17 subbasins 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological processes the final parameter results from the swat cup hydrologic calibration for the period 1995 2005 at the outlet of the purgatoire river basin usgs gage 07128500 are shown in table 1 parameters that are different for each hru i e the curve number cn2 report the percent change from initial hru values table 1 column 3 parameters that are the same for each hru i e lateral flow travel time lat ttime report only the final value used the outlet hydrograph fig 4 accurately depicts the temporal changes in measured streamflow such as the periods of drought that occurred in 2002 2003 and 2011 2012 and the wet years of 1999 and 2017 the outflow typically mimics the temporal variation in the basin wide average daily precipitation mm day based on the performance metrics of moriasi et al 2015 the model performs satisfactory for monthly flow with nse 0 62 and r2 0 64 in the calibration period and 0 52 and 0 60 in the validation period table 3 the total measured and simulated water yield from the prw is 93 1 mm and 92 7 mm respectively for the calibration period and 61 3 mm and 51 7 mm for the validation period demonstrating good agreement for the overall water balance of the total water yield in the purgatoire river 88 is from soil lateral flow 7 is from groundwater discharge and 5 is surface runoff fig 5a the preponderance of lateral flow is due to the lack of vegetation and relatively dry conditions of soil profiles throughout the prw leading to minimal recharge and consequent lateral movement of soil water in riparian areas that discharge rapidly to streams during and just after rainfall events temporal patterns of these fluxes mm day are shown in fig 5c the ratio of et to precipitation is 0 96 similar to the average annual value of 0 99 estimated by reitz et al 2017 the baseflow fraction soil lateral flow groundwater discharge of streamflow is 0 95 much higher than the bfi value 0 36 derived from the national dataset of wolock 2003 however with an estimated high ratio 0 99 of et to precipitation we reason that much of the water in the purgatoire river must be derived from subsurface flow and the high value of 0 95 is expected the model is also tested for streamflow at three other gage sites van bremer arroyo purgatoire river at ninemile dam near higbee purgatoire river at thatcher fig 6 the model underestimates baseflow at the thatcher gage site especially during the first 12 simulation years attempts were made to provide better streamflow estimates at this site but resulted in poor results at the outlet particularly for baseflow the arroyo discharge comparison is included to provide model corroboration for small tributary intermittent streams in general performance statistics during the calibration period are poor or adequate table 3 but are satisfactory during the testing period with nse 0 70 0 41 and 0 77 for thatcher van bremer arroyo and ninemile dam in general inadequate spatial representation of rainfall is a reoccurring problem for large natural watersheds with localized storm events resulting in mismatches between model rainfall input and the timing and magnitude of measured streamflow 3 2 salt mobilization transport and loading under historical conditions 3 2 1 1 annual and monthly loads in the purgatoire river the measured i e estimated using loadest and simulated yearly salt load from the purgatoire river watershed through the watershed outlet has a correlation of r2 0 67 fig 7 yearly average simulated salt export during 1990 2010 at the outlet was 64 million kg year with one year 1999 of extremely high loading 6 6 million kg day due to high rainfall 340 mm yr and several years 2002 2003 of extremely low loading 0 2 0 4 million kg day due to drought conditions 221 mm yr and 179 mm yr respectively we will say more about the relationships between annual rainfall and annual salt loads later in this section of the salt loaded from the prw so4 2 ca2 and hco3 accounted for 56 20 and 14 making up 90 of the exported salt mg2 and na both account for 5 of the total salt exports with negligible loads of k and co3 2 simulated monthly in river loadings at the outlet for these three ions fig 8 show an overall comparable trend with loadest results and often within the standard error of prediction of the loadest values although nse and r2 values generally are low and poor table 4 however as simulated annual loads have a high correlation with the annual loadest loads see fig 7 and often the monthly values match the monthly loadest values we believe the model to be an adequate predictor of salt movement transport and loading in the prw and therefore can be used for scenario analysis the model correctly represents the conveyance of salt mineral mass see fig 1d e from the landscape to the stream system in the right location and in the correct relative portions of salt ions with so4 2 and ca2 being the dominant ions in the purgatoire river water 3 2 1 2 origin of salt loading to the purgatoire river of the salt loading to the purgatoire river and leaving the watershed through the outlet 76 is from groundwater discharge to streams 24 is from soil lateral flow to streams and less than 1 is from erosion runoff and surface runoff fig 5b salt loading via groundwater discharge is high for tributary subbasins fig 9c and relatively low for channel reaches along the main stem of the purgatoire river whereas salt loading via soil lateral flow occurs mainly in the lower reaches of the purgatoire river fig 9d where high conductivity alluvial material is present within the riparian areas comparing the maps to the spatial salt mineral presence presented in fig 1 there is spatial correlation between the amount of gypsum caso4 fig 1d in the soil profile and the resulting salt loading via groundwater fig 9c although baseflow fraction of streamflow 0 95 and baseflow fraction of in river salt loading 0 99 are similar in magnitude the pathways of loading to the purgatoire river stream system are different as soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge are the major contributors to streamflow and in river loading respectively this is due to the higher concentration of salt ions in groundwater than in soil water and the longer discharge time of groundwater to streams due to longer travel times in the aquifer groundwater salt fluxes are more constant throughout the model period than the quick lateral flow pulses of salt that occur during larger precipitation events for example see the large lateral flow salt pulse for the storm in 1999 fig 5d and the resulting months long loading of salt to streams via groundwater discharge erosional runoff occurs for several storm events fig 5d but not consistently due to the removal of salt from the top layers of the soil profile via leaching and soil lateral flow in a similar study in the price river watershed utah usa bailey et al 2019 using the apex modflow salt surface subsurface modeling system authors concluded that like this current study in the purgatoire river watershed 89 of salt in the price river is loaded by groundwater and erosion runoff accounts for only 1 5 of total salt yield these companion results point to the importance of subsurface systems in conveying salt from watershed landscapes to downstream river systems 3 2 1 3 relationship between rainfall and salt loading due to the dominance of groundwater loadings of salt to the purgatoire river which are temporally constant there is no correlation r2 0 09 between annual precipitation mm yr and simulated salt mass exported from the prw fig 10a 1999 was an especially wet year for southeastern colorado while 2002 2003 was a period of drought the salt mass exported from the purgatoire river during 1999 was approximately 34 times larger than the salt mass exported in 2002 see fig 7 however the annual precipitation in 2006 was 28 mm greater than the precipitation in 1995 but the salt mass exported in 1995 was more than 3 times the salt mass exported in 2006 therefore we conclude that for the prw long term rainfall patterns do not control salt movement rather precipitation events drive percolation leaching and subsequent groundwater flow which moves slowly towards the streams for discharge and salt loading this can be seen in fig 5d where pulses of soil lateral flow indicative of water percolation in the soil profile and associated recharge to the aquifer are followed by long periods of groundwater salt loading furthermore there is no relationship between daily rainfall mm and daily groundwater salt loadings to streams kg day fig 10b with high salt loadings 2 0 kg day often occurring on days of little or no rainfall 3 2 1 4 salt contribution to the arkansas river within the broader context of the arkansas river basin we conclude that the purgatoire river watershed yields significant salt mass to the arkansas river see fig 1a and downstream agricultural areas through comparison of simulated annual export loads from the prw and estimated in river salt loads in the arkansas river fig 11 just upstream of the inflow from the purgatoire river usgs site 07124000 daily in river loads kg day of salt at the arkansas river during 1990 2010 were estimated by multiplying daily flow m3 day by salt concentration kg m3 with daily salt concentration estimated using a linear relationship r2 0 98 see fig s4 in supplementary material between specific conductance μs cm measured daily at the site and salt ion concentration results from 12 water samples taken between 2006 and 2010 during the 1990 2009 period the purgatoire river contributed to on average 20 of the salt in the arkansas river downstream of the confluence of the purgatoire river with values ranging from 4 1990 to 45 2005 the prw therefore plays a key role in basin salinity loading and transport and should be a focus of salt mitigation efforts for improving water quality in downstream irrigated regions 3 3 salt mobilization transport and loading under precipitation extremes key findings from the precipitation extremes scenarios are presented in table 5 if the top 5 of 24 h rain events increase by the maximum predicted scenario 35 scenario 2 then the salt mass exported from the basin increases by 73 in contrast if there is only a 5 increase in 24 h storm events scenario 1 the salt mass export increases by 12 we examined the four flux pathways that provide salt to streams groundwater flow soil lateral flow surface runoff and erosional runoff to determine the impact of increasing precipitation intensity on relative contribution to in river loadings as with the baseline simulation scenario 0 groundwater salt fluxes still dominate each scenario table 5 with contribution of 79 5 and 82 8 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively with increases from the baseline in several years e g 2004 2010 fig 12 scenario 1 increased the groundwater salt mass transported by 17 and scenario 2 increased the groundwater mass transported by over two orders of magnitude compared to the baseline scenario as salt loading via groundwater discharge increases with precipitation intensity erosion runoff slightly increases 0 4 contribution to 1 3 contribution due to higher runoff rates see eq 3 but loading via soil lateral flow decreases 21 to 16 demonstrating that an increase in precipitation intensity increases recharge to the water table thereby driving groundwater flow and associated salt loading rather than an increase in soil lateral flow when analyzing results from a short term wet period may june 1995 fig 13 scenario 1 results in a 3 5 increase in the maximum daily pulse of salt mass kg day from soil lateral flow on may 30th 1995 whereas scenario 2 results in a decrease in the maximum daily pulse of salt mass on the same day the groundwater pulse has a greater delay time before reaching the stream and continues through the proceeding months we conclude that increasing precipitation intensity does not change the pathways which govern salt transport in the prw soil lateral flow controls salt transport from independent storm events which is important over shorter periods i e days whereas groundwater fluxes govern salt transport over longer time periods i e months and years the salt flux from rainfall runoff erosion events becomes more significant in scenario 2 contributing 16 4 of the total salt flux during the storm event on may 20th 1995 fig 13 this increase in salt mass leaving the landscape through erosion contributes to the decrease in the peak salt mass load from soil lateral flow 3 4 study limitations while we believe that the swat salt model performs well in representing overall hydrology and salt transport mechanisms in the purgatoire river watershed we acknowledge the following limitations that could be overcome to some extent in future studies with more field data data availability of initial salt concentrations in both the groundwater and soil profile however the mass of salt in the aquifer and soil profile appears to reach an equilibrium after 5 years uncertainty in precipitation data and reservoir inflow salt loads daily precipitation values were downscaled using regression equations from prism data due to the lack of reliable gage data in the watershed and reservoir inflow salt loads were estimated through linear interpolation of daily specific conductance values and linear equations of specific conductance and ion concentration from a site upstream assumption that land cover and land use remain constant throughout the model period of 1990 2010 using the input data from the national land cover database from 2011 although the land cover and land use do not appear to change dramatically during this period this assumption does not account for yearly differences in variables such as vegetation cover amount of irrigated area and cattle abundance which could affect salt transport this constant input parameter limits the results of the future scenarios of increasing precipitation intensity and could be better evaluated by manually inputting yearly changes in land use and land cover simplification of groundwater hydrologic modeling by swat since groundwater fluxes are important to both the hydrology and the salt mass transport in this watershed future research could incorporate groundwater modeling techniques with more spatial detail and physically based mechanisms such as modflow for example the swat modflow code of bailey et al 2016 however the code would need to be updated to include the salinity module 4 summary and conclusions this study applied a swat salt model for the purgatoire river watershed prw to estimate the origin and magnitude of salt loadings in the purgatoire river and quantify the effect of increase in storm intensity on these loadings methods and results are intended to represent salt movement in natural undeveloped river basins model simulations were run for the 1990 2010 period model results were tested against stream discharge in stream salt loadings and region wide water balance estimates key findings are although prw water yield is composed principally of soil lateral flow 88 compared to 7 groundwater discharge and 5 surface runoff prw salt loadings are composed primarily of groundwater salt loadings 76 compared to 24 soil lateral flow this is due to the higher concentration of salt ions in groundwater than in soil water and the longer discharge time of groundwater to streams due to longer travel times in the aquifer of the salt loaded from the prw so4 2 ca2 and hco3 accounted for 56 20 and 14 making up 90 of the exported salt mg2 and na both account for 5 of the total salt exports with negligible loads of k and co3 2 yearly average simulated salt export during 1990 2010 at the outlet was 64 million kg year with one year 1999 of extremely high loading 6 6 million kg day due to high rainfall 340 mm yr and several years 2002 2003 of extremely low loading 0 2 0 4 million kg day due to drought conditions 221 mm yr and 179 mm yr respectively although the wettest year 1999 and the driest year 2002 resulted in high and low salt exports form the prw there is no systematic relationship between rainfall either annual mm yr or daily mm day and salt export from the watershed either annual kg yr or daily kg day this is due to the long travel time of salt in groundwater from origin salt leaching to aquifer via soil profile to the stream network the prw loads a significant quantity of salt to the arkansas river within the arkansas river basin during the 1990 2009 period the purgatoire river contributed to on average 20 of the salt in the arkansas river downstream of the confluence of the purgatoire river with values ranging from 4 1990 to 45 2005 loads from high desert natural landscapes therefore can be a large contributor to salinity pollution in downstream areas that rely on river water for irrigation leading to decreased crop yields and overall soil health the maximum predicted storm intensity for future decades in colorado results in an increase in salt export from the prw by approximately 70 from the baseline scenario even as storm intensity increases groundwater transport remains the principal pathway of salt loadings to streams the swat salt model for the prw can be used as a tool to further explore relationships between weather patterns land use and salt loading and export besides providing estimates for the prw the modeling code can be used in other watersheds

1240,excess salt loading from watershed landscapes into river systems acts as a chemical stressor in water bodies and can have significant impacts on downstream water quality high salinity threatens sustainable crop production globally and is especially prevalent in semi arid and arid regions however relatively little research has been conducted to evaluate salt movement and loadings in natural high desert catchments in the face of climate change and extreme climate events in this study we use the watershed model swat and a newly developed salinity module to simulate the mass transport of 8 major salt ions so4 2 cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 na mg2 and k in the soil aquifer stream system of the purgatoire river watershed prw colorado usa 8935 km2 via major hydrologic pathways surface runoff percolation recharge soil lateral flow groundwater upflux groundwater discharge and quantify changes in predicted salt loads with possible future increasing storm intensity the prw is susceptible to high salt transport due to high topographic slopes dry climatic conditions and sparse vegetation and loads to the arkansas river a major source of irrigation water in the arkansas river basin from study results we conclude that 99 of salt in the purgatoire river originates from subsurface water pathways soil lateral flow groundwater flow composed primarily of so4 2 ca2 and hco3 if intensity of large storms increases by 5 and 35 the total salt mass exported from the watershed increases by 12 and 73 respectively indicating large influxes of legacy salt from the soil aquifer system for baseline and storm intensity scenarios the prw contributes significant salt loads to agricultural regions via the arkansas river highlighting the need for basin wide salt management strategies to include upland desert regions we expect these results and associated consequences for salt management to be similar for other upland desert catchments worldwide keywords salinity river basin management groundwater irrigation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction salinization is a global concern for the degradation of soil and water resources excess salt minerals can decrease water quality cause biodiversity loss decrease crop yield increase risk of soil erosion contaminate drinking water and lower soil biological activity vengosh 2014 zamann et al 2018 soluble salt ions such as sodium na calcium ca2 magnesium mg2 sulfate so4 2 potassium k chloride cl carbonate co3 2 and bicarbonate hco3 can be deposited in soil and water supplies both naturally and anthropogenically natural salt deposits can accumulate from parent rock or soil material with salt minerals dissolving to mobile ions e g gypsum caso4 dissolving to ca2 and so4 2 these mobile ions are then transported via hydrologic pathways to surface water streams and reservoirs soil water and groundwater supplies burkhalter et al 2006 this is particularly a concern in regions with shallow water tables low soil permeability high evapotranspiration and sparse precipitation hassani et al 2020 hosseini and bailey 2022 anthropogenic actions that can increase salinization include vegetation clearing mining activities application of road salts dugan et al 2017 and effluent from wastewater treatment plants but the most prominent human act that leads to increased salinization is irrigation specifically in semi arid regions sharp declines in crop production have occurred in 27 28 of irrigated land in the western united states due to high soil salinity which prevents root water uptake and inhibiting transpiration and photosynthetic processes bailey et al 2019 tanji 2004 with high soil salinity occurring due to salt mineral dissolution inadequate drainage and evapo concentration in the soil profile worldwide agricultural productivity losses of salt inflicted soils have been estimated at 10 billion per year ghassemi et al 1995 the overall problem of salt accumulation and impacts on soil and crops well as continually increasing global population growth has driven the intensive study of salt transport in irrigated regions duncan et al 2008 foster et al 2018 schoups et al 2005 however comparatively little research has been conducted on salt fate and transport in dominantly non irrigated desert catchments that are often upstream of productive agricultural catchments naturally occurring salt afflicted regions are less regulated than irrigated catchments due to the apparent distance from human activity and associated human intervention however headwater upland catchments have been recognized as sources of high sediment generation with steep gradients high runoff volumes thin vegetation cover and active geomorphic processes stenson et al 2011 zimmer and bailey 2021 consequently these upland catchments are also susceptible to high volumes of salt transport and therefore understanding and regulation of upstream non irrigated catchments could be a key factor in reducing the impact of salinity globally for example biggs et al 2013 found that small upland catchments have a greater export import ratio of salt as compared to major downstream catchments using a mass balance approach from 55 gauging stations stenson et al 2011 noted the importance of salinity exports in unregulated upland catchments to the increasing salinization of australia s murray darling basin using the lumped parameter 2csalt salinity model zimmer and bailey 2021 used field measurements and mass balance approaches in a high desert watershed in southeastern colorado usa and found that salt loadings to the receiving arkansas river are significant however of these studies none have systematically explored and quantified the impact of high intensity storms on salt mobilization movement and in stream loading within high desert watersheds the results of zimmer and bailey 2021 suggest that high intensity storms in semi arid regions can have a large impact on salt transport in upland catchments however the findings were limited to years with stream data and did not explore the mobilization and hydrologic pathways of salt loading to the stream network with climate extremes predicted to increase in the future coumou and rahmstorf 2012 francis et al 1998 understanding the role of high intensity storms in high desert watersheds can be important in estimating salt loading to downstream irrigated regions numerical computer models have been extensively used to simulate salt processes on a variety of spatial scales and could be used to investigate the impact of high intensity storms on salt movement for example swat salt is the combination of the widely known soil and water assessment tool swat and a coupled salinity module bailey et al 2019 swat arnold et al 1998 is a process based conceptual watershed scale hydrologic model that was developed by the usda agricultural research service to evaluate best management practices for water supply and nonpoint source pollution in large river basins swat has been popularized globally because the minimum requirements to run a simulation i e a digital elevation model dem land use land cover map and soil map are often readily available through public government organizations the swat website http swatmodel tamu edu provides extensive model documentation including theoretical documentation with equations a user s manual defining model inputs and outputs a developer s manual and tutorial videos for the project setup in the arcswat interface of an example watershed swat salt the salinity module coupled to swat was one of the first process based models to consider salt transport within all major hydrologic pathways and salt chemical reactions precipitation dissolution complexation and cation exchange within the soil layers and the alluvial aquifer for individual ions at the watershed scale bailey et al 2019 swat salt focuses on the transport and effects of major salt ions since the swat hydrologic model is well researched and the salinity module is well detailed i e division into the eight ions for all major hydrologic pathways the swat salt model was chosen in this study to quantify a gap in research knowledge of salt transport and mobilization from largely undeveloped upland catchments swat salt has been used to simulate salt ion transport in irrigated watersheds bailey et al 2019 hosseini and bailey 2022 jiang et al 2022 but has not yet been applied to high desert watersheds the objective of this study is to quantify the impact of climate change and increasing storm intensity on the mobilization movement and loading of salt in an upland watershed in a semi arid region this is achieved by applying swat salt to the undeveloped purgatoire river watershed 8922 km2 in southeastern colorado we use a modeling approach so that loads can be estimated for years and conditions that do not have field data and so that salt sources and transport pathways can be quantified the model is calibrated and tested against stream discharge and in stream salt ion loads for several gage sites within the watershed and then used to quantify the impact of increasing future storm intensity results also provide insights into hydrologic pathways that govern in stream salt loading and general spatial patterns of salt mobilization and transport to the purgatoire river and its tributaries as the purgatoire river discharges to the arkansas river which services many irrigated areas in southeastern colorado and western kansas this study also provides a sense of the salinity impact of high desert watersheds on rivers that carry water downstream for irrigation use 2 methods 2 1 study region purgatoire river watershed the purgatoire river watershed with a drainage area of 8935 km2 is one of the largest contributing watersheds to the arkansas river within the upper arkansas river basin fig 1 a subbasin of the arkansas red white basin the headwaters of the purgatoire river originate in the sangre de cristo mountain range near weston co the purgatoire flows 194 mi from the mountains through high desert natural steep terrain to the arkansas river outlet near las animas co in bent county river flow in the downstream region of the watershed is controlled principally by the dam at trinidad reservoir fig 2 with discharge occurring mainly between april and october tributaries of the purgatoire are mainly ephemeral and have carved a complex network of canyons and mesas throughout the basin dominant land uses are herbaceous rangeland and mixed shrubland covering 53 and 23 of the basin respectively fig 1b the dominant vegetation in the shrubland is piñon juniper woodlands less than 1 3 of the entire basin is designated as developed evergreen and mixed forests are found sparsely scattered throughout the rangeland a defining characteristic of this watershed is the steep slope gradients with an average slope of 12 and maximum slope of 249 fig 1c many riparian areas of the purgatoire river are lined with steep sloped plateaus fig 1c most rainfall in the prw occurs between april and october with high intensity storm events often occurring between july and september these intense summer storms produce more runoff and streamflow than winter and spring precipitation purgatoire watershed partnership 2014 weather stations are sparse throughout the basin there are several stations monitored by the colorado agriculture meteorological network coagmet http www coagmet colostate edu that lie within or adjacent to the basin fig 2 the hoehne station hne01 is located within 10 miles of the trinidad airport and has historical climate data since the year 2000 the la junta station ljt01 las animas station lms02 and rocky ford experimental station rfd01 are all outside the boundaries of the watershed but close to the outlet these three stations have reported climate data since 1972 2020 and 1992 respectively climate data from the trinidad airport la junta station and rocky ford station were evaluated for this study and will be further discussed in the hydrologic modeling section for trinidad annual average maximum and minimum temperatures are 86 8 f in july and 18 9 f in january and average annual precipitation is 396 mm the hoehne station in northeast trinidad recorded an average annual precipitation of 254 mm between 2001 and 2020 the rocky ford and la junta stations have recorded average annual precipitation values of 259 mm and 256 mm respectively since 1993 and 2006 2 2 quantifying salt loading in the purgatoire river watershed using swat salt in this study we use the soil and water assessment tool swat arnold et al 1998 watershed modeling code and a newly developed salinity module bailey et al 2019 to simulate hydrologic and salt transport processes in the purgatoire river watershed prw in this section we present the construction calibration and testing of the base swat hydrologic model for the prw followed by the inclusion of the salinity module and its application in doing so we establish a method for simulating mass transport of salt ions in high desert natural landscapes that can be applied to other watersheds worldwide 2 2 1 simulating hydrologic processes in the purgatoire river watershed using swat 2 2 1 1 swat theory swat is a process based semi distributed river basin model that simulates the movement of water nutrients and sediment in a watershed system within a swat hydrologic model watersheds are divided into smaller subbasins that are spatially homogenous to reference different areas of the basin subbasins are comprised of hydrologic response units hrus which represent a unique combination of land use soil type and slope the hru is the smallest computational unit used in swat to calculate a soil water balance an aquifer water balance and associated hydrologic fluxes such as surface runoff infiltration and percolation soil lateral flow groundwater recharge and upflux and groundwater flow and associated nutrient and sediment mass loads fluxes and loads from each hru are summed within each subbasin and routed to the subbasin channel and then routed through the watershed channel network to the watershed outlet streamflow is composed of the summation of daily surface runoff soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge precipitation and irrigation drive the hydrologic processes in swat with water balance nutrient mass balance and sediment mass balance performed for four main systems the land surface system the soil system the aquifer system and the stream network system 2 2 1 2 swat model for the purgatoire river watershed the swat model for the prw is applied to the period 1990 2020 due to availability of salt ion data in the river system since this study is focused on salt transport in semi arid regions the mountainous region of the prw was excluded from the model watershed delineation resulting in a model domain of 7081km2 with the inlet of the model represented by the outflow point from trinidad reservoir see fig 2 required datasets for delineation and creation of subbasin boundaries the stream network and hydrologic response units hrus include a digital elevation model dem 30 m and land cover distribution raster 30 m from the national resources conservation service nrcs geospatial data gateway https datagateway nrcs usda gov gdgorder aspx the dem is a product of the national elevation dataset ned and the land cover distribution is a product of the national land cover database soil unit boundaries and attributes are obtained from ssurgo minimum subbasin delineation area was set to 2500 ha to adequately depict the tributary network resulting in 169 subbasins using thresholds of 1 land use 5 soil and 0 slope resulted in 5643 hrus daily flow at the trinidad reservoir outlet usgs gage site 07124410 see fig 2 was specified as inflow to the model domain canal and ditch diversions along the purgatoire river see fig 2 table s1 in supplementary material were included in the swat model as point sinks we used downscaled prism parameter elevation relationships on independent slopes model accessed at https www prism oregonstate edu explorer february 2022 data for daily precipitation and maximum minimum temperature data for the 1988 2021 period using the centroid for each of the 169 subbasins the daily maximum and minimum temperatures from prism corresponded well with the gage data in the region and were entered directly into the swat model however prism estimates of daily precipitation over estimated values as compared to weather stations in the area but followed similar temporal patterns fig 3a therefore prism data was corrected based on daily data from the hoehne weather station using a linear relationship fig 3b r2 0 88 2 2 1 3 model calibration and testing hydrology the model was calibrated 1995 2005 and tested 2010 2021 using monthly streamflow at the prw outlet usgs gage site 07128500 and annual estimates of water balance components reitz et al 2017 additional model testing was performed by comparing simulated monthly streamflow to measured monthly streamflow at the purgatoire river at thatcher the purgatoire river at ninemile dam and van bremer arroyo see fig 2 van bremer arroyo is a smaller drainage area of 450 km2 intermittent tributary that releases just upstream of the thatcher gage the thatcher and ninemile gages are 105 km and 45 km upstream of the outlet respectively mixed automatic and manual calibration practices were utilized to estimate parameter values automatic calibration was conducted using swat cup abbaspour 2012 and the goodness of fit between the modeled and measured streamflow was evaluated using the coefficient of determination r2 and the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse table 1 lists the parameters included in swat cup the lower and upper bound of each parameter value and the final calibrate value parameters were specified for both riparian and rangeland

salt transport in the purgatoire river watershed using swat salt 2 2 2 1 swat salt theory the salinity module for swat was developed by bailey et al 2019 and includes the mass fate and transport of 8 major salt ions so4 2 cl co3 2 hco3 ca2 na mg2 and k in the major hydrologic pathways surface runoff percolation soil lateral flow groundwater discharge of a watershed system subject to precipitation dissolution of major salt minerals caco3 mgco3 caso4 mgso4 nacl present in the soil and aquifer systems the module is available as open source code at https github com rtbailey8 swat salinity presentation of salt ion equilibrium chemistry equations are provided in bailey et al 2019 similar to the nutrient mass transport algorithms of swat salt mass transport is simulated using mass balance in the land surface soil aquifer and channel systems for example the mass balance of so4 mass m kg ha in a soil layer of a single hru using a daily time step is calculated as 1 dm so 4 soil dt m irrig sw m irrig gw m diss m precip m ro m lat m perc m revap where irrig sw represents salt ion mass in surface water irrigation irrig gw represents salt ion mass in groundwater irrigation diss represents dissolution of salt minerals into salt ion mass e g gypsum caso4 ca so4 precip represents precipitation of salt minerals from dissolved salt ion mass ro represents salt ion mass removed via surface runoff lat represents salt ion mass removed via soil lateral flow perc represents salt ion mass removed via percolation from the bottom of the soil layer and revap represents salt ion mass added to the soil layer via upflux from the shallow aquifer the mass balance equation for the aquifer system is 2 dm so 4 gw dt m perc m revap m diss m precip m gwflow where gwflow represents the salt ion mass removed from the aquifer via groundwater discharge to the subbasin stream the salinity module code is imbedded directly into the swat fortran code called as subroutines for hru subbasin and channel calculations 2 2 2 2 swat salt modifications for erosional runoff in this study we have amended the salinity module to include salt mobilization and transport in erosional runoff during storm events due to the combination of storm events and high topographic slopes we use the following polygon relationship kim et al 2022 experimentally derived from hundreds of field samples taken from rainfall runoff field experiments colorado river basin report blm 2015 cadaret et al 2016 in the desert shrublands of the upper colorado river basin a similar semi arid landscape to the prw the polynomial

are calculated based on the simulated ion concentrations in the top soil layer of each hru 4 sar na 0 5 mg 2 ca 2 5 cec c ca c mg c k c na once the tds is calculated for each rainfall runoff event the concentration of the 8 salt ions is calculated based on the ratio of salt ion concentration to tds in the soil water the salt ion loading in erosional runoff m eros is computed by multiplying the salt ion concentration by the runoff volume therefore the total mass of each salt ion loaded to a subbasin stream on a given day of the simulation is the summation of runoff soil lateral flow groundwater flow and erosional runoff salt loads 6 m total m ro m lat m gwflow m eros 2 2 2 3 swat salt model for the purgatoire river watershed the salinity module requires initial salt ion concentrations in hru soil layers and aquifers and initial salt mineral content in soil layers and aquifers we used nrcs ssurgo soil data to obtain salt mineral content for gypsum caso4 and calcium carbonate caco3 the weighted average of caso4 fig 1d and caco3 fig 1e for each subbasin was calculated based on the area of each soil map unit polygon the mineral percent by weight in each polygon and the total subbasin area each hru within the same subbasin received the same initial mineral content due to a lack of aquifer salt data we assumed that the initial aquifer mineral content was equivalent to the initial soil mineral content initial concentrations mg l of each of the 8 salt ions in the soil and groundwater were estimated using samples from usgs groundwater monitoring wells there are 24 wells that have reported concentrations for the 8 salt ions modeled and only 2 of the wells reported ion concentrations on two different dates the earliest sample was taken in 1964 and the latest sample was taken in 1988 table 2 shows the number of samples taken for each ion the average concentrations from the samples and the standard deviation of the concentrations the full list of sample concentrations of each of the salt ions and usgs site numbers is provided in table s2 in supplementary material daily salt ion mass loading kg at the trinidad reservoir outlet i e the upstream end of the model domain was estimated using linear relationships between salt ion concentrations of water samples and measured daily specific conductance μs cm in the river water due to lack of salt ion concentration data at the outlet site sample results from the purgatoire river at madrid co usgs gage site 07124200 just upstream of trinidad reservoir were used this site has 11 reported samples of so4 ca na mg k and cl 9 samples of hco3 and 6 samples of co3 2 between 1978 and 1981 plots of linear relationships between salt ion concentration and specific conductance are shown in fig s1 in supplementary material all 6 of the co3 samples reported a concentration of 0 mg l with varying specific conductance values so the co3 in the inflow was set to 0 mg l gaps in daily values of specific conductance were estimated using linear interpolation see fig s2 in supplementary material and then the linear relationships were used to estimate daily salt ion concentration mg l in river flow at the reservoir outlet multiplied by daily flow m3 day to estimate daily salt ion loads kg day in the purgatoire river 2 2 2 4 model calibration and testing salinity using the hydrologic parameters estimated in the base swat model swat salt results are compared against measured monthly salt loads as estimated by the load estimator loadest tool runkel et al 2004 using stream discharge specific conductance and available salt ion concentration data for the outlet gage near las animas there were 58 samples of hco3 68 samples of ca2 and mg2 74 samples of cl and na 42 samples of k and 89 samples of so4 2 between 1961 and 2019 three different statistical estimation methods are considered in loadest of which the adjusted maximum likelihood estimation amle is usually preferred amle was used in this study and the residuals of each ion load were determined to be normally distributed table s3 in supplementary material presents the amle regression statistics the load bias in percent bp and the nse for loadest results compared to measured values positive bp values indicate over estimation and negative bp values indicate underestimation the regression equation used to calculate the monthly load of each salt ion are provided in table s4 in supplementary material there were 20 months within the calibration period and 10 months within the validation period that loadest could not produce results due to lack of available water quality inputs model calibration and testing for salt loading was conducted for the periods 1990 2000 and 2001 2010 respectively the spatially heterogenous initial ion concentrations in both the groundwater and soil profile were manually calibrated for hco3 na and mg2 by multiplying each salt ion concentration by the same factor i e either decreasing or increasing each value by the same percentage thereby maintaining spatial patterns from the observation data additionally since no ssurgo data was available for the salt minerals mgco3 nacl and mgso4 all subbasins were given very small values of soil and aquifer mineral content these values were manually adjusted during calibration to preserve the spatial heterogeneity of salt mineral content across the watershed the assigned values of mgco3 mgso4 and nacl soil and aquifer content basis were related to the ssurgo derived caco3 content subbasins with caco3 content greater than 15 received 0 1 of both mgco3 and mgso4 greater than 10 of caco3 received 0 05 of mgco3 and mgso4 greater than 5 caco3 received 0 02 of mgco3 and mgso4 and the remaining subbasins received 0 001 of mgco3 and mgso4 subbasins with caco3 content greater than 15 received 0 005 nacl greater than 10 of caco3 received 0 001 of nacl greater than 4 5 caco3 received 0 0005 nacl and the remaining subbasins received 0 0001 nacl the fractions of nacl were lower than the mineral content of mgco3 and mgso4 because nacl is more soluble the mineral content differed for each subbasin but was assumed to be the same in the soil and the aquifer swat salt results were compared to loadest results at the basin outlet the purgatoire river at las animas usgs gage the statistical indices nse and r2 were calculated for monthly loads of each salt ion initial model results showed an under estimation of in river salt loadings compared to the loadest results therefore initial concentrations of several ions hco3 na and mg2 were increased by 30 in both the groundwater and soil profiles uniformly for each hru 2 2 3 quantifying the impact of precipitation extremes on salt loading in addition to using the swat salt model to investigate the mobilization transport and loading of salt ion mass from the landscape to streams under historical conditions we use the swat salt model to investigate and quantify the impact of high intensity storms on salt loadings we also use model results to determine the mechanisms by which changes in salt loading occur this analysis is undertaken due to the potential for storm events to mobilize salt in high desert watersheds and the possibility of increasing storm intensity in future decades due to climate change zimmer and bailey 2021 in a field study of the prw concluded that most of the salt loading to the purgatoire river can be attributed to large storm events recent studies using climate model output colorado water conservation board 2019 have predicted that extreme rainfall events in colorado will increase in intensity for the 100 year daily rainfall event the smallest median percent increase was 5 from the 1 c warming threshold scenario and the largest median percent increase was 20 from the 3 c warming threshold scenario the latter scenario also demonstrated a maximum percent increase of 35 with these predictions in mind we evaluate 3 thresholds for increasing precipitation intensity in the purgatoire river basin 0 baseline 5 and 35 increases in daily precipitation of extreme events the 3 scenarios are respectively referred to as scenarios 0 2 throughout the rest of this paper scenario 0 acts as a baseline scenario 1 represents the median predicted intensity increase and scenario 2 represents the maximum predicted intensity increase all scenarios were run during the same historical period as the swat salt model 1990 2010 to simplify swat salt precipitation inputs for the 169 subbasins the weather data for 17 subbasins 10 of the total subbasins was used for the three scenarios the 17 subbasins were chosen to represent the spatial heterogeneity of storms in the watershed see fig s3 in supplementary material since there were no 100 year storms during the model period extreme events were defined as the top 5 of storms in the 17 subbasins this equated to 4 mm of precipitation in one day the impact of increasing storm intensity was evaluated by increasing any daily precipitation event greater than or equal to 4 mm by the 3 thresholds through the entire model period although the climate models evaluated colorado water conservation board 2019 predict the intensity of storms to increase in this region the average annual precipitation is not expected to increase therefore the precipitation input data was normalized to maintain the same average annual precipitation as the baseline scenario this normalization was achieved by subtracting depths of water for daily precipitation events less than 4 mm for each of the 17 subbasins 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrological processes the final parameter results from the swat cup hydrologic calibration for the period 1995 2005 at the outlet of the purgatoire river basin usgs gage 07128500 are shown in table 1 parameters that are different for each hru i e the curve number cn2 report the percent change from initial hru values table 1 column 3 parameters that are the same for each hru i e lateral flow travel time lat ttime report only the final value used the outlet hydrograph fig 4 accurately depicts the temporal changes in measured streamflow such as the periods of drought that occurred in 2002 2003 and 2011 2012 and the wet years of 1999 and 2017 the outflow typically mimics the temporal variation in the basin wide average daily precipitation mm day based on the performance metrics of moriasi et al 2015 the model performs satisfactory for monthly flow with nse 0 62 and r2 0 64 in the calibration period and 0 52 and 0 60 in the validation period table 3 the total measured and simulated water yield from the prw is 93 1 mm and 92 7 mm respectively for the calibration period and 61 3 mm and 51 7 mm for the validation period demonstrating good agreement for the overall water balance of the total water yield in the purgatoire river 88 is from soil lateral flow 7 is from groundwater discharge and 5 is surface runoff fig 5a the preponderance of lateral flow is due to the lack of vegetation and relatively dry conditions of soil profiles throughout the prw leading to minimal recharge and consequent lateral movement of soil water in riparian areas that discharge rapidly to streams during and just after rainfall events temporal patterns of these fluxes mm day are shown in fig 5c the ratio of et to precipitation is 0 96 similar to the average annual value of 0 99 estimated by reitz et al 2017 the baseflow fraction soil lateral flow groundwater discharge of streamflow is 0 95 much higher than the bfi value 0 36 derived from the national dataset of wolock 2003 however with an estimated high ratio 0 99 of et to precipitation we reason that much of the water in the purgatoire river must be derived from subsurface flow and the high value of 0 95 is expected the model is also tested for streamflow at three other gage sites van bremer arroyo purgatoire river at ninemile dam near higbee purgatoire river at thatcher fig 6 the model underestimates baseflow at the thatcher gage site especially during the first 12 simulation years attempts were made to provide better streamflow estimates at this site but resulted in poor results at the outlet particularly for baseflow the arroyo discharge comparison is included to provide model corroboration for small tributary intermittent streams in general performance statistics during the calibration period are poor or adequate table 3 but are satisfactory during the testing period with nse 0 70 0 41 and 0 77 for thatcher van bremer arroyo and ninemile dam in general inadequate spatial representation of rainfall is a reoccurring problem for large natural watersheds with localized storm events resulting in mismatches between model rainfall input and the timing and magnitude of measured streamflow 3 2 salt mobilization transport and loading under historical conditions 3 2 1 1 annual and monthly loads in the purgatoire river the measured i e estimated using loadest and simulated yearly salt load from the purgatoire river watershed through the watershed outlet has a correlation of r2 0 67 fig 7 yearly average simulated salt export during 1990 2010 at the outlet was 64 million kg year with one year 1999 of extremely high loading 6 6 million kg day due to high rainfall 340 mm yr and several years 2002 2003 of extremely low loading 0 2 0 4 million kg day due to drought conditions 221 mm yr and 179 mm yr respectively we will say more about the relationships between annual rainfall and annual salt loads later in this section of the salt loaded from the prw so4 2 ca2 and hco3 accounted for 56 20 and 14 making up 90 of the exported salt mg2 and na both account for 5 of the total salt exports with negligible loads of k and co3 2 simulated monthly in river loadings at the outlet for these three ions fig 8 show an overall comparable trend with loadest results and often within the standard error of prediction of the loadest values although nse and r2 values generally are low and poor table 4 however as simulated annual loads have a high correlation with the annual loadest loads see fig 7 and often the monthly values match the monthly loadest values we believe the model to be an adequate predictor of salt movement transport and loading in the prw and therefore can be used for scenario analysis the model correctly represents the conveyance of salt mineral mass see fig 1d e from the landscape to the stream system in the right location and in the correct relative portions of salt ions with so4 2 and ca2 being the dominant ions in the purgatoire river water 3 2 1 2 origin of salt loading to the purgatoire river of the salt loading to the purgatoire river and leaving the watershed through the outlet 76 is from groundwater discharge to streams 24 is from soil lateral flow to streams and less than 1 is from erosion runoff and surface runoff fig 5b salt loading via groundwater discharge is high for tributary subbasins fig 9c and relatively low for channel reaches along the main stem of the purgatoire river whereas salt loading via soil lateral flow occurs mainly in the lower reaches of the purgatoire river fig 9d where high conductivity alluvial material is present within the riparian areas comparing the maps to the spatial salt mineral presence presented in fig 1 there is spatial correlation between the amount of gypsum caso4 fig 1d in the soil profile and the resulting salt loading via groundwater fig 9c although baseflow fraction of streamflow 0 95 and baseflow fraction of in river salt loading 0 99 are similar in magnitude the pathways of loading to the purgatoire river stream system are different as soil lateral flow and groundwater discharge are the major contributors to streamflow and in river loading respectively this is due to the higher concentration of salt ions in groundwater than in soil water and the longer discharge time of groundwater to streams due to longer travel times in the aquifer groundwater salt fluxes are more constant throughout the model period than the quick lateral flow pulses of salt that occur during larger precipitation events for example see the large lateral flow salt pulse for the storm in 1999 fig 5d and the resulting months long loading of salt to streams via groundwater discharge erosional runoff occurs for several storm events fig 5d but not consistently due to the removal of salt from the top layers of the soil profile via leaching and soil lateral flow in a similar study in the price river watershed utah usa bailey et al 2019 using the apex modflow salt surface subsurface modeling system authors concluded that like this current study in the purgatoire river watershed 89 of salt in the price river is loaded by groundwater and erosion runoff accounts for only 1 5 of total salt yield these companion results point to the importance of subsurface systems in conveying salt from watershed landscapes to downstream river systems 3 2 1 3 relationship between rainfall and salt loading due to the dominance of groundwater loadings of salt to the purgatoire river which are temporally constant there is no correlation r2 0 09 between annual precipitation mm yr and simulated salt mass exported from the prw fig 10a 1999 was an especially wet year for southeastern colorado while 2002 2003 was a period of drought the salt mass exported from the purgatoire river during 1999 was approximately 34 times larger than the salt mass exported in 2002 see fig 7 however the annual precipitation in 2006 was 28 mm greater than the precipitation in 1995 but the salt mass exported in 1995 was more than 3 times the salt mass exported in 2006 therefore we conclude that for the prw long term rainfall patterns do not control salt movement rather precipitation events drive percolation leaching and subsequent groundwater flow which moves slowly towards the streams for discharge and salt loading this can be seen in fig 5d where pulses of soil lateral flow indicative of water percolation in the soil profile and associated recharge to the aquifer are followed by long periods of groundwater salt loading furthermore there is no relationship between daily rainfall mm and daily groundwater salt loadings to streams kg day fig 10b with high salt loadings 2 0 kg day often occurring on days of little or no rainfall 3 2 1 4 salt contribution to the arkansas river within the broader context of the arkansas river basin we conclude that the purgatoire river watershed yields significant salt mass to the arkansas river see fig 1a and downstream agricultural areas through comparison of simulated annual export loads from the prw and estimated in river salt loads in the arkansas river fig 11 just upstream of the inflow from the purgatoire river usgs site 07124000 daily in river loads kg day of salt at the arkansas river during 1990 2010 were estimated by multiplying daily flow m3 day by salt concentration kg m3 with daily salt concentration estimated using a linear relationship r2 0 98 see fig s4 in supplementary material between specific conductance μs cm measured daily at the site and salt ion concentration results from 12 water samples taken between 2006 and 2010 during the 1990 2009 period the purgatoire river contributed to on average 20 of the salt in the arkansas river downstream of the confluence of the purgatoire river with values ranging from 4 1990 to 45 2005 the prw therefore plays a key role in basin salinity loading and transport and should be a focus of salt mitigation efforts for improving water quality in downstream irrigated regions 3 3 salt mobilization transport and loading under precipitation extremes key findings from the precipitation extremes scenarios are presented in table 5 if the top 5 of 24 h rain events increase by the maximum predicted scenario 35 scenario 2 then the salt mass exported from the basin increases by 73 in contrast if there is only a 5 increase in 24 h storm events scenario 1 the salt mass export increases by 12 we examined the four flux pathways that provide salt to streams groundwater flow soil lateral flow surface runoff and erosional runoff to determine the impact of increasing precipitation intensity on relative contribution to in river loadings as with the baseline simulation scenario 0 groundwater salt fluxes still dominate each scenario table 5 with contribution of 79 5 and 82 8 for scenarios 1 and 2 respectively with increases from the baseline in several years e g 2004 2010 fig 12 scenario 1 increased the groundwater salt mass transported by 17 and scenario 2 increased the groundwater mass transported by over two orders of magnitude compared to the baseline scenario as salt loading via groundwater discharge increases with precipitation intensity erosion runoff slightly increases 0 4 contribution to 1 3 contribution due to higher runoff rates see eq 3 but loading via soil lateral flow decreases 21 to 16 demonstrating that an increase in precipitation intensity increases recharge to the water table thereby driving groundwater flow and associated salt loading rather than an increase in soil lateral flow when analyzing results from a short term wet period may june 1995 fig 13 scenario 1 results in a 3 5 increase in the maximum daily pulse of salt mass kg day from soil lateral flow on may 30th 1995 whereas scenario 2 results in a decrease in the maximum daily pulse of salt mass on the same day the groundwater pulse has a greater delay time before reaching the stream and continues through the proceeding months we conclude that increasing precipitation intensity does not change the pathways which govern salt transport in the prw soil lateral flow controls salt transport from independent storm events which is important over shorter periods i e days whereas groundwater fluxes govern salt transport over longer time periods i e months and years the salt flux from rainfall runoff erosion events becomes more significant in scenario 2 contributing 16 4 of the total salt flux during the storm event on may 20th 1995 fig 13 this increase in salt mass leaving the landscape through erosion contributes to the decrease in the peak salt mass load from soil lateral flow 3 4 study limitations while we believe that the swat salt model performs well in representing overall hydrology and salt transport mechanisms in the purgatoire river watershed we acknowledge the following limitations that could be overcome to some extent in future studies with more field data data availability of initial salt concentrations in both the groundwater and soil profile however the mass of salt in the aquifer and soil profile appears to reach an equilibrium after 5 years uncertainty in precipitation data and reservoir inflow salt loads daily precipitation values were downscaled using regression equations from prism data due to the lack of reliable gage data in the watershed and reservoir inflow salt loads were estimated through linear interpolation of daily specific conductance values and linear equations of specific conductance and ion concentration from a site upstream assumption that land cover and land use remain constant throughout the model period of 1990 2010 using the input data from the national land cover database from 2011 although the land cover and land use do not appear to change dramatically during this period this assumption does not account for yearly differences in variables such as vegetation cover amount of irrigated area and cattle abundance which could affect salt transport this constant input parameter limits the results of the future scenarios of increasing precipitation intensity and could be better evaluated by manually inputting yearly changes in land use and land cover simplification of groundwater hydrologic modeling by swat since groundwater fluxes are important to both the hydrology and the salt mass transport in this watershed future research could incorporate groundwater modeling techniques with more spatial detail and physically based mechanisms such as modflow for example the swat modflow code of bailey et al 2016 however the code would need to be updated to include the salinity module 4 summary and conclusions this study applied a swat salt model for the purgatoire river watershed prw to estimate the origin and magnitude of salt loadings in the purgatoire river and quantify the effect of increase in storm intensity on these loadings methods and results are intended to represent salt movement in natural undeveloped river basins model simulations were run for the 1990 2010 period model results were tested against stream discharge in stream salt loadings and region wide water balance estimates key findings are although prw water yield is composed principally of soil lateral flow 88 compared to 7 groundwater discharge and 5 surface runoff prw salt loadings are composed primarily of groundwater salt loadings 76 compared to 24 soil lateral flow this is due to the higher concentration of salt ions in groundwater than in soil water and the longer discharge time of groundwater to streams due to longer travel times in the aquifer of the salt loaded from the prw so4 2 ca2 and hco3 accounted for 56 20 and 14 making up 90 of the exported salt mg2 and na both account for 5 of the total salt exports with negligible loads of k and co3 2 yearly average simulated salt export during 1990 2010 at the outlet was 64 million kg year with one year 1999 of extremely high loading 6 6 million kg day due to high rainfall 340 mm yr and several years 2002 2003 of extremely low loading 0 2 0 4 million kg day due to drought conditions 221 mm yr and 179 mm yr respectively although the wettest year 1999 and the driest year 2002 resulted in high and low salt exports form the prw there is no systematic relationship between rainfall either annual mm yr or daily mm day and salt export from the watershed either annual kg yr or daily kg day this is due to the long travel time of salt in groundwater from origin salt leaching to aquifer via soil profile to the stream network the prw loads a significant quantity of salt to the arkansas river within the arkansas river basin during the 1990 2009 period the purgatoire river contributed to on average 20 of the salt in the arkansas river downstream of the confluence of the purgatoire river with values ranging from 4 1990 to 45 2005 loads from high desert natural landscapes therefore can be a large contributor to salinity pollution in downstream areas that rely on river water for irrigation leading to decreased crop yields and overall soil health the maximum predicted storm intensity for future decades in colorado results in an increase in salt export from the prw by approximately 70 from the baseline scenario even as storm intensity increases groundwater transport remains the principal pathway of salt loadings to streams the swat salt model for the prw can be used as a tool to further explore relationships between weather patterns land use and salt loading and export besides providing estimates for the prw the modeling code can be used in other watersheds and river basins to explore the movement of salt ions and general salinity mitigation under management scenarios author statement eleanor henson conceptualization methodology model validation formal

1241,biosurfactants surface active agents produced by microorganisms are increasingly studied for their potential use in soil remediation processes because they are more environmentally friendly than their chemically produced homologues in this work we report on the use of a crude biosurfactant produced by a bacterial consortium isolated from a pahs contaminated soil compared with other bio surfactants tween80 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds rhamnolipids mix to wash pahs from a contaminated porous media assays were done using columns filled with sand or sand clay mixtures 95 5 spiked with four model pahs the crude biosurfactant showed less adsorption to the sand and the sand clay columns compared to tween 80 sds and the rhamnolipid mix the biosurfactant showed the second best capacity to remove pahs from the columns as dissolved and particulate phases both from sand and sand clay after sds when applied at lower concentrations than the other sufactants the effluent concentrations of phenanthrene phe pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap increased in the presence of the crude biosurfactant compared to the control experiment using only water the global pahs washed mass amount of pahs removed from the columns increased between 9 and 1000 times for phe and bap in the sand column and between 55 and 6000 times respectively for phe and bap in the sand clay columns moreover in the sand clay columns leaching of a part of the clays was observed in the sds and the biosurfactant injections assays this clay leaching resulted in higher pahs removal due not to desorption but rather to particulate transport in the context of washing pah contaminated soils in biopiles or subsurface remediation our results could help in sizing the remediation approach using an environmental friendly biosurfactant before a pump and treat process keywords biosurfactant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cmc pahs removal solubility particulate transport soil washing 1 introduction the main sources of contamination by pahs in the environment are anthropogenic baek et al 1991 in highly contaminated soils pahs originate primarily from accidental spills or leaks and from petrochemical and steel making industries this is especially the case during oil refining or coke production which produce oil or coal tars mainly composed of pahs wilson and jones 1993 sixteen pahs listed as priority pollutants by us epa are often chosen for environmental studies the toxicity of these sixteen products has been widely studied as they are probable and confirmed carcinogens doornaert 2005 due to their toxicity and persistence in the environment and to their high ubiquity research on the remediation of pah contaminated soils is still required as the number of aromatic rings increases their water solubility and volatility decrease in addition due to their hydrophobicity pahs are often strongly adsorbed to solid matrices and especially to soil organic matter schwarzenbach and westall 1981 murphy et al 1990 mader et al 1997 johnsen and karlson 2007 due to this pahs have low natural bioaccessibility and bioavailability riding et al 2013 and are therefore poorly biodegradable in soils especially for high molecular weight hmw pahs haritash and kaushik 2009 bioavailability is defined as the degree of and rate at which a compound is transferred from a medium to biological system either through absorption into an organism or other physiological interaction in the absence of bioavailability hydrophobic compounds may still be bioaccessible meaning that they could become bioavailable if desorbed semple et al 2004 several processes physical chemical and biological have been developed to remediate or remove pahs from soils soil washing using surfactants is one of them injection of surfactant solutions into the soil increases the desorption and apparent solubility of pahs followed by a pump and treat process trellu et al 2016 befkadu and chen 2018 injection of chemical surfactants is mainly used in the remediation of contaminant plumes and residual soil contamination however while it greatly increases the solubility of pahs and their extraction rate it has certain disadvantages increasing solubility increases bioaccessibility but not necessarily bioavailability shao et al 2017 this is due to the difficulty for bacteria to assimilate pahs associated with surfactant molecules and or to the possible absence of bacteria resistant to and able to metabolize pahs in soils moreover the toxicity of the surfactant itself may affect the subsequent biodegradation in washed soil by decreasing the population of autochthonous bacteria in soil during the washing the injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in high concentrations 100 to 500 mg kg 1 may increase the solubility of pahs but its toxicity prevents the development of microorganisms capable of degrading pahs consequently the biodegradation of residual pahs after remobilization pump and treat will be less effective deschênes et al 1995 lima et al 2011 the persistence of surfactants and their toxicity towards the soil microbial community may also pose problems for the restoration of the soil and its ecosystem post treatment another risk is the dispersion of the solubilised pahs in the environment if the flow during the washing process is not precisely controlled in order to minimise these impacts biosurfactants which are specific surfactants produced by microorganisms can be implemented like chemical surfactants they are capable of reducing the surface tension between two phases whether liquid solid or gaseous therefore they can be used to increase the solubilisation of hydrophobic compounds such as pahs in water soberón chávez et al 2005 the use of biosurfactants in soil washing process has been increasingly studied over the last 30 years koch et al 1991 whang et al 2008 souza et al 2014 vijayakuma and saravanan 2015 bezza and chirwa 2017 biosurfactants offer advantages compared to chemical surfactants they have no proven toxicity to humans and are more biodegradable mulligan 2005 rufino et al 2014 their biodegradation occurs after the consumption of other carbon sources which solves the issue of post remediation management lima et al 2011 varjani and upasani 2017 in addition biosurfactants increase the bioavailability of the trapped molecule at least for biosurfactant producing bacteria whang et al 2008 youssef et al 2013 pi et al 2017 this capacity paves the way for the combination of two complementary processes soil washing and biodegradation gabet 2004 portet koltalo et al 2013 hassanshahian 2014 li et al 2015 ali khan et al 2017 chebbi et al 2017 lamichhane et al 2017 in our previous work we produced a biosurfactant using a bacterial consortium isolated from pahs contaminated soil the biosurfactant once purified had the ability to increase the solubilisation of some model pahs in aqueous solution in batch experiments cazals et al 2020 this interesting effect leads us to go further in the study of the biosurfactant capacity to remove pahs from artificially contaminated media in the dual perspective of increasing the experimental scale and the complexity of the media sand and sand clay dynamic columns were used the purpose of this work is to select the best product and operating conditions for a later use of the process in an actual in situ demonstration the aim of the present work was thus to study the potential of the produced biosurfactant in dynamic column experiments following different steps i investigation of biosurfactant sorption onto the matrix sand or sand clay to evaluate the effective critical micellar concentration in order to adapt the biosurfactant concentration and ultimately increase the pollutant removal efficiency and ii investigation of pah removal in dissolved or particulate phases from sand or sand clay columns in a porous media spiked with pahs during these experiments the effect of crude biosurfactant solution

was purchased from sigma aldrich and is certified by the european community bureau of reference bcr 2 2 biosurfactant production the biosurfactant used characterized as an anionic biosurfactant was produced by a natural groundwater bacterial community firstly isolated from a pah contaminated industrial soil the initial consortium was cultivated in different conditions to optimize biosurfactant production cazals et al 2020 the consortium was mainly composed of five highly dominant bacterial species the identified bacteria were found to be closely related to microbacterium maritypicum luteibacter anthropi klebsiella grimontii pseudomonas veronii and pseudomonas antarctica cazals et al 2020 the biosurfactant producing culture was grown in 5 l bioreactors with a culture medium composed of 20 g l 1 of glucose 2 g l 1 of nh4no3 and 14 2 g l 1 of na2hpo4 at 20 c ph 7 in tap water and with continuous injection of air to achieve a dissolved oxygen concentration of 9 mg l 1 close to saturation in water at 20 c tap water was used to make the process conceivable at a real scale on site the tap water was composed of 54 8 mg l 1 ca2 4 7 mg l 1 mg2 0 2 mg l 1 fe2 3 7 mg l 1 k 13 mg

for biosurfactant recovery the foam produced at the top of the bioreactors was manually collected liquefied and stored at 4 c this method was used to make the process conceivable on site at a higher scale process similar to flotation this solution was the crude biosurfactant solution used in the following experiments its concentration was equivalent to 68 mg l 1 i e 1 6 times its critical micellar concentration cmc as determined by cazals et al 2020 2 3 pah spiking two solid matrices were used sand and sand with clay the sand used was fontainebleau sand sieved at 400 μm 98 6 passing 125 μm washed dried in an oven at 80 c for 72 h then sterilized in an autoclave at 120 c for 1 h the sand clay matrix consisted of 95 by mass of the above sterilized fontainebleau sand and 5 of boom clay mainly composed of illite and smectite four pahs naphthalene napht phenanthrene phe pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap were selected for this study with emphasis on the representation of different solubilities and numbers of aromatic rings for spiking the sand and sand clay matrices napht phe pyr bap were first solubilised in acetone in sufficient concentration for a final concentrations in solid media of 98 144 120 and 1 mg kg 1 respectively these concentrations were chosen in order to obtain a higher concentration for each model pah than that which can be solubilised by water alone during the washing process the spiking protocol was as follows 10 of the matrix mass was placed in a large sterilized glass container the acetone in which the pahs were solubilised was poured into the container and the mixture was mechanically homogenized by hand the container was then left for 24 h under an extraction fan to volatilise the acetone the matrix was re homogenized after acetone volatilisation the 90 uncontaminated matrix was then added and the total mass was again homogenized pahs concentrations in soil after the volatilisation of acetone and homogenization were measured and are considered as initial concentrations in the following tests then the containers were closed and stored in the dark at room temperature prior to further experiments 2 4 pah extraction and analysis 2 4 1 pah extraction from solid samples with microwave assisted extraction mae the extraction procedure by microwave assisted extraction mae was adapted from a previously described protocol olivares et al 2010 for the analysis of pah concentration in the solid matrix microwave assisted extraction microwave ethos 1 advanced microwave digestion labstation milestone was used prior to analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu qp 2020 marne la vallée france then 5 g of the matrix were placed with 30 ml of dichloromethane in each of the microwave vessels before being heated at 140 c for 35 min the containers were cooled to 35 c within 2 h before being opened the dichloromethane phase was then extracted and filtered through 0 45 μm ptfe filters the filtrate was then analysed by gc ms for pah identification and quantification 2 4 2 pahs extraction from water samples with solid phase extraction spe tube for the extraction of pahs in water samples before analysis spe columns from supelclean envichrom envi chrom p spe tube were used the extraction protocol was adapted to this specific use the columns were conditioned with 2 ml of dichloromethane followed by 2 ml of deionized milliq water 18 mω the water samples were percolated and the cartridges were then washed with 3 ml of milliq water the cartridges were finally dried by vacuum aspiration for 2 h and the samples eluted with 5 ml of dichloromethane prior to analyses for effluent samples containing suspended matter clays no filtration was performed as the aim was to analyse the total pah removal from column as dissolved and particulate phases the dichloromethane phase was then analysed by gc ms 2 4 3 pah analysis for pah analyses a gc ms equipped with a restek rxi 5sil ms column length 30 m film thickness 0 25 μm and diameter 0 25 mm was used the oven temperature was initially set at 80 c then increased to 300 c in 25 min rate 8 8 c min 1 and maintained at 300 c for 10 min helium was used as the carrier gas at a flowrate of 1 30 ml min 1 for the mass spectrometer the temperature of the ion source was set at 240 c and the detector voltage at 1 20 kv adapted from crampon et al 2014 2 5 columns filling protocol to compare the effectiveness of the biosurfactant for pah removal with commercially available surfactants dynamic experiments in columns were carried out omnifit glass columns thermo fischer scientific illkirch france with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe end pieces were used the columns were filled with the matrix in three stages with manual packing in between total volume of matrix added per column of around 100 cm3 a co2 gas flow was passed through the columns to remove air to increase the wettability of the matrix tap water was injected into the columns at a flowrate of 0 4 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump pump 205s watson marlow la queue lez yvelines france with ptfe tubing internal diameter 1 60 mm a fraction collector omnicoll lambda laboratory instruments gmbh switzerland was placed at the column outlet to recover the effluent fractions prior to further analyses to measure the column porosity two methods were used meiri 1989 masipan et al 2016 first a tracer test was performed in four parallel sand columns using a 100 mg l 1 solution of nabr made with ultrapure water this solution was injected into the columns at a flowrate of 1 5 ml min 1 from the beginning of the injection and every 5 s conductivity measurements were carried out in the water at the outlet of the columns to estimate the pore volume using the conductivity front of the nabr tracer after the injection of 70 ml of the nabr solution tap water was injected into the columns at the same flowrate and the bromide desorption curve was plotted to verify the estimation of the pore volume the other method consisted of weighing the columns before and after the pure water injection during the filling protocol then the weight difference was used to estimate the pore volume corresponding to the volume of water injected 2 6 surfactant sorption in dynamic columns for pah removal experiments the concentration of the injected surfactant must be above the cmc at any point in the column to allow micelle formation and subsequent pah washing a part of the surfactant will be sorbed onto the solid matrix during injection which will decrease the actual concentration of surfactant in water it is then mandatory to estimate this loss and to determine an effective cmc corresponding to the inlet concentration necessary to obtain a concentration at least equal to the cmc at the column outlet to ensure that micelles will form within the porous media in the columns surfactant sorption experiments in the column were performed with the two different matrices sand and sand clay the following surfactants sds cmc 2307 mg l 1 tween 80 cmc 14 mg l 1 and rhamnolipid mix cmc 80 mg l 1 were injected at concentrations corresponding to ½ cmc 1 cmc 5 cmc and 10 cmc table 1 only for the sand clay columns the concentration corresponding to 50 cmc was tested for the crude biosurfactant a single concentration was tested in each column corresponding to the concentration of samples collected in foam from bioreactors concentration of around 1 6 cmc to measure surfactant concentrations photometric kits for the analysis of anionic and non ionic surfactants were used ref a ten 02552 0 05 2 0 mg l 1 mbas for anionic and 0 10 7 50 mg l 1 triton for non ionic spectroquant supelco merck millipore for the crude biosurfactant the concentration was determined indirectly by surface tension measurements using kruss dsa 100 goniometer and the method of the pending drop using young laplace fit directly from the advance software combined to the kruss dsa 100 one pore volume of each surfactant solution was injected into a column at a flowrate of 0 8 ml min 1 two pore volumes of tap water were then injected and surfactant concentrations were measured in each pore volume of the effluent after the determination of the effective cmcs new experiments were performed for the sds and the rhamnolipids mixture in triplicate using these concentrations and following the same protocol of experiments and analyses 2 7 pah removal by surfactant washing in dynamic columns the pah removal experiments were performed for the two matrices using the effective cmc of each surfactant as the inlet concentration each experiment was run in triplicate with a control column where only tap water was injected sds the rhamnolipid mix and the crude biosurfactant were tested tween 80 was discarded as explained later the injection protocol was as follows first a flushing with water without chemical or biological enhancement was carried out in order to reproduce the water flows before the implementation of a remediation process thereafter a washing with surfactants or biosurfactants was implemented in order to quantify the efficiency of the remediation process finally a water injection was applied in order to check whether the residual pollution in the porous medium can still be mobilized the succession of injections was therefore as follows injection of a pore volume of tap water t1 followed by two pore volumes of surfactant solutions t2 and finally two pore volumes of tap water t3 fig 1 all injections were carried out at a flowrate of 0 8 ml min 1 which corresponds to a flow velocity of 0 6 m day 1 to approximate that of the groundwater in the studied site the initial and final pah concentrations in the solid matrices were determined by gc ms analysis after mae extraction for pah concentrations in water samples were analysed for each pore volumes injected all experiments for each condition were performed in triplicate for one of the three columns of each test the two pore volumes of the t2 step effluent bio surfactant injection were split into four subsamples t2a t2b t2c and t2d each representing a quarter of the injection time of the two pore volumes to assess the removal kinetics during injection 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of pore volumes the nabr tracing test was performed in four sand columns average mass of dry sand 159 3 g to ascertain the porosity of the matrix and to confirm that the determination of the volume of pores by difference of weight between dry and saturated columns was consistent the conductivity curve at the column outlets showed the point of nabr breakthrough the pore volume calculated from this breakthrough curve was 39 17 ml for the first step injection and 40 08 ml for the second step end of injection fig 2 the measurement of the weight difference between the dry and the saturated column gave a mean weight of 40 4 g which means a pore volume equal to 40 4 ml if the density of water is assumed to be 1 g ml 1 at 20 c as a first approximation the relative margin between the values obtained by the two types of measurement is equal to 1 9 this low difference validates the use of the weight difference method to estimate the pore volumes of the columns in the next experiments 3 2 loss of surfactants due to sorption the use of crude biosurfactant prevents the selection of an optimal concentration to be injected into the columns for pah removal to ensure that the biosurfactant concentration in the crude solution is sufficient so that it is not fully adsorbed to the matrix it is mandatory to evaluate the loss of surfactant in the column prior to the pah removal experiments surfactant sorption experiments in sand columns were carried out with the four surfactants used in this study for the three commercially available surfactants the curves of surfactant loss versus inlet concentrations c c0 were plotted fig 3 an exponential decrease in surfactant loss with increasing inlet concentration was observed for all three surfactants this decrease is due to the limited number of sorption sites in the sand for surfactants with increasing concentration these adsorption sites are partially saturated and adsorb relatively fewer surfactants molecules detailed data of experimental results are presented in supplementary material the effective cmcs of the surfactant in the sand were calculated from these curves table 2 for the produced biosurfactant the loss by adsorption was 6 in these experiments the same experiments were conducted for the sand clay columns an additional experiment at a concentration equal to 50 cmc was performed for each surfactant due to the high adsorption observed an exponential decrease of the surfactant adsorption can be observed in these experiments too fig 4 tween 80 was totally adsorbed regardless of the initial concentration injected this strong adsorption was assigned to the non ionic nature of tween 80 clay particles have a negative surface charge which causes electrostatic repulsion with anionic surfactants such as sds the rhamnolipid mix or the crude biosurfactant produced thus reducing their adsorption rates this phenomenon is well known for non ionic surfactants amirianshoja et al 2013 especially for tween 80 kang and jeong 2014 concerning anionic surfactants it must be noted that cationic bridges involving divalent cations may form between anionic charges of clays on one side and anionic charges of surfactants on the other boom clay is composed especially of smectites and contains high specific surface area and negative charges the tap water contained 54 8 mg l 1 calcium and 4 7 mg l 1 magnesium these divalent cations in solution could explain the sorption of anionic bio surfactants observed in our experiments for the other two surfactants the effective cmcs for sand clay columns were experimentally estimated table 2 tween 80 was discarded for the next experiments as its strong adsorption to clay particles would inhibit its capacity to form micelles and potentially remove pahs from the contaminated porous media for the crude biosurfactant a 75 decrease in concentration was observed in the sand clay columns between columns inlet and outlet c c0 100 this leads to an outlet concentration equal to 0 4 cmc for an inlet concentration equal to 1 6 cmc this adsorption rate was lower than that of the other surfactants used at higher inlet concentration 100 90 and 70 of decrease in concentration for tween 80 the rhamnolipid mix and sds respectively for an inlet concentration equal to 5 cmc the crude biosurfactant appeared to be less sensitive to sorption to the solid matrix than its commercialized homologues once these effective cmcs were estimated further experiments were conducted to confirm that using these cmc values as an inlet concentration would lead to an outlet concentration at least equal to the cmc table 2 these new experiments were carried out in triplicate for the two matrices using the effective cmcs as inlet concentrations mean values for adsorption loss were added to the previous adsorption curves fig 5 for the sds experiments the new values corresponded to what was expected confirming the good match of the adsorption curves for rhamnolipids the experiment in sand column showed a fitted value with the curves for the experiment in sand clay columns the adsorption rate was lower than expected associated with a higher uncertainty than the other experiments the measured effective cmc were the concentrations used for pah removal experiments in dynamic columns sorption of biosurfactants in soils during washing tests is a well known phenomenon singh and cameotra measured in their study a 50 adsorption loss of a lipopeptide with characteristics close to the biosurfactant studied here singh and cameotra 2013 this sorption on one hand could limit the efficiency of the surfactant to remove sorbed contaminants due to the loss of concentration in aqueous phase on the other hand the sorption of surfactants at the soil water interphase could be an essential factor for the desorption of soil pollutants since it would allow the contact of the surfactant with the pollutants strongly sorbed onto the soil particles clays om clay humic complexes considering also that the surfactant is at a concentration higher than the cmc mulligan 2005 urum et al 2006 finally the sorption of surfactants to the surface of soil particles especially clays could allow the clays washing from the soil in a washing process 3 3 pah removal in dynamic columns 3 3 1 pah removal in sand dynamic columns the washing experiments studied the capacity of each bio surfactant to remove pahs from the porous media simulating a contaminated soil before washing in biopile or in situ before pump and treat under dissolved and or particulate adsorbed onto suspended matter form pah concentrations in effluent were analysed at three different times and all data are presented in terms of percentage of pah removed removed values correspond to total pah concentrations in effluent i e desorbed sorbed phase or sorbed onto suspended matter particulate phase at the end of the experiment fig 6 first at t1 when only water was injected in the columns the different columns showed similar concentrations of the different pahs in the effluent with a high concentration of napht a low concentration of phe and pyr and no detection of bap this result is logical and depends on specific solubility in water of the 4 studied pahs at t2 after the injection of 2pvs of surfactant solutions all three surfactants injected in the columns increased the pah concentrations in the effluent napht concentration was less affected by the surfactant injections than the other pahs as its solubility in water is sufficient for a good soil washing sds showed the greatest increase in removed pah masses among the three surfactants with a removal rate of 100 for napht 25 for phe 8 for pyr and 9 for bap on the other hand the rhamnolipids mix had a lower effect on pah removal from the columns the washing rates were 100 3 0 1 and 0 1 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively despite its lower surfactant inlet concentration the crude biosurfactant solution injection increased pah removal more strongly than the rhamnolipids mix with removal rates of 100 9 3 and 3 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively at t3 final injection of 2pvs tap water water was re injected into all columns leading to a decrease in pah concentrations in the effluent the concentrations remained higher than at t1 for sds and the crude biosurfactant demonstrating that these bio surfactants remained in the columns and were still able to remobilize pahs after their re solubilisation in water surfactant molecules as shown in the surfactant adsorption experiments were able to sorb onto the porous media of the columns the final injection of water indeed probably led to a re solubilisation of the sorbed surfactants and to the subsequent formation of micelles and subsequent pah removal from porous media to effluent this result highlights the reversibility of bio surfactant sorption this phenomenon corresponds to a delaying effect of sds and crude biosurfactant rhamnolipids appeared to have a lower effect on pah removal when sds and the biosurfactant increased the pah concentrations in the effluent calculations of the total percentage of pahs extracted from the sand columns in the different experiments are summarised in fig 6 as removal rates for napht were always found to be 100 in both conditions napht is not represented in fig 6 sds showed the highest capacity of pah removal in total crude biosurfactant presented the second best removal results with an increase of 315 461 and 7 26 compared to the control with only tap water for phe pyr and bap respectively an increase in pah concentrations could be observed throughout the injection of the biosurfactant especially up to t2c and seemed to stabilize at t2d fig 7 especially for napht the concentration was stable at the beginning t2a to t2c and decreased during t2d this decrease was assigned to the depletion of the napht adsorbed in the columns since all the napht was extracted from the column during the experiment for phe and pyr an increase of respectively 254 and 141 of their concentrations in effluent between t2a and t2d was observed bap concentration increased 59 and 39 between t2a and t2b and t2b and t2c respectively however during t2d the concentration decreased slightly by 10 this value was assigned to analysis uncertainty during t3 the outlet concentrations dropped with the injection of water into the columns but remained higher than those that occurred during the initial water injection t1 confirming the existence of a delaying effect the delaying effect of the biosurfactant could allow an accumulation in the column and a local increase in concentration leading to an increase in the removal of pah from the porous media therefore increasing the amount of biosurfactant injected will result in an increase in the quantity of removed pahs compared to sds the biosurfactant had lower removal yields however they remain in the same order of magnitude for much lower surfactant concentrations batch tests showed that sds was more efficient than biosurfactants amphisine and viscosine for the desorption of pahs from clayey sand and in particular heavy pahs more than 3 rings amphisine was effective at a twenty fold lower concentration than sds suggesting that biosurfactants have the advantage of desorbing pahs at low concentrations portet koltalo et al 2013 the use of biosurfactant was also studied to associate pah desorption and increase of biodegradation especially for the heaviest pahs the use of lipopeptide in a soil contaminated by creosote has been shown to increase the biodegradation of high molecular weight pahs after their desorption from an old contaminated soil bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2015 it was shown that the main factor responsible for the increase in pah biodegradation was the increase in their bioaccessibility in the presence of biosurfactants bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2015 3 3 2 pah washing in sand clay columns the same experiments were performed in sand clay columns as in the sand columns pah concentrations in the effluent during t1 were low and in the same range of values for all columns during t2 sds and the crude biosurfactants had significant effect on pah removal fig 8 on the other hand injection of rhamnolipid mix did not increase pah solubilisation see supplementary material 3 the percentage of pahs desorbed was close to the control with washing rates of about 100 0 1 0 1 and 0 2 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively no other effect was observed on the contrary for the other surfactants used a larger increase in pah concentrations in effluent was recorded and at the same time removal of clay particles from the columns it must be noted consequently that these pah concentrations correspond both to solubilised pahs thanks to bio surfactant micelles and to pahs still potentially sorbed onto clay particles washed from the columns the idea being to wash the soil to recover a maximum of the contaminants and subsequently treat the effluent the removal of clay particles which are possible pah sorption sites hwang and cutright 2002 is also useful consequently the results presented in fig 8 concern dissolved pahs and pahs transported sorbed onto clay particles for sds pah washing rates were 100 for napht 17 for phe 14 for pyr and 18 for bap for the crude biosurfactant these concentrations increased approximately 100 for napht 11 for phe 5 for pyr and 12 for bap sds experiment showed a higher increase in pah removal desorption transport onto suspended clays than in the sand experiment the rhamnolipids experiment exhibited desorbed pah in the same range of values as in the sand experiment despite the stronger adsorption of the biosurfactant in the sand clay columns during t3 for the rhamnolipids mix assay pah concentrations increased slightly indicating that a weak delaying effect exists for this surfactant too the concentrations were still much lower than those observed in the other two surfactants experiments and in particular the sds which presents the highest concentrations during t3 clay removal was also recorded with sds and the crude biosurfactant experiments but different behaviours in pahs removal were observed for sds pah concentrations decreased during t3 but remained on average 47 times higher than those during t1 because of the delaying effect which means on average a five fold reduction compared to t2 concentrations conversely for the crude biosurfactant pah concentrations in water increased by a factor of two between t2 and t3 the majority of pah extraction occurs during t3 because of the resolubilisation of sorbed surfactants delaying effect and to the removal of clay analysis of the delaying effect was performed in the sds and biosurfactant experiments this effect was amplified in comparison with the sand column experiments the increase was about 490 for naphthalene 1855 for phenanthrene 3109 for pyrene and 12 459 for benzo a pyrene between t2a and t2d in the sds experiment fig 9 and about 50 402 332 and 126 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively between t2a and t2d in the crude biosurfactant experiment fig 9 removal of bap is higher than pyr this is probably due to the fact that the media were spiked and did not correspond to a real contaminated soil where ageing could have led to strong sorption of pahs especially heavier ones which have lower solubility and higher kow in this case bap would logically have been less extracted compared to pyr but in a spiked soil context results may be different moreover as clay removal was observed bap concentrations could rather be linked to solid phase concentrations bap sorbed onto clay phase this higher delaying effect could be due to the clay removal phenomenon which brings out some of the pah molecules in the particulate phase the delaying effect was weak in the rhamnolipid mix experiment and no clay removal was observed which reinforces the hypothesis the concentrations obtained at the outlet of the rhamnolipid washed columns were within a similar range of values as those obtained in the control columns which were washed with water however other studies had highlighted the ability of rhamnolipids to desorb pahs an et al 2011 posada baquero et al 2019 but at concentrations well above their cmcs the use of more concentrated solutions of rhamnolipids should lead to better washing rates but compromise the advantage of the low cmc of the rhamnolipids moreover in a soil washing process the clay removal we observed is interesting indeed pah removal is then not limited to their desorption but includes washing through particulate phase with subsequent effluent treatments the negative effect of the sorption of biosurfactants such as rhamnolipids by clay particles for pah desorption is well known and extensively studied the composition of the clayey fraction is one of the main factors influencing the adsorption clays with a si al 2 1 ratio such as montmorillonite have shown greater surfactant sorption than clays with a si al 1 1 ratio zhu et al 2003 ochoa loza et al 2007 the clays used in this study are composed primarily of smectite a si al 2 1 ratio clay which is consistent with the high surfactant adsorption in our tests and may explain also the clays removal highlighted in our experiments according to some studies the presence of clays can also contribute to pah desorption by creating a hydrophobic environment allowing contact between the surfactant and the pahs zhu et al 2007 these hydrophobic zones could be the cause of clay transport out of the columns during washing in our studies the sorption of the hydrophobic part of the surfactants to clays could increase their removal through the hydrophilic part of the surfactants to create and maintain this hydrophobic environment it s crucial that the surfactant concentration is always well above the cmc mulligan 2005 and most of the studies tend to show that the presence of clays generally remains a hindrance to the use of surfactant washing techniques for soils wang and keller 2008 wei et al 2015 this clay removal was then investigated and compared to the global pah removal in all the samples the leached clays were recovered dried and weighed a positive correlation was observed between the leached clay mass and pah mass released during t2 fig 10 this suggests that a portion of the pahs was indeed carried by the clay increasing the total mass of pahs extracted from the porous media via particulate phase jointly with desorption and subsequent solubilised phase transport of pahs the transport of pahs especially of hmw pahs by colloidal particles had been highlighted with organic matter and could also exist with clay particles benhabib et al 2017 clay removal could be due to high interactions with clays in the column pushing the clays and their sorbed pahs out of the columns with water flow in 2016 ishiguro and koopal studied the adsorption of surfactant on different soil particles anionic surfactants such as sds the crude biosurfactant or the rhamnolipid mix can be adsorbed to the clays in two different ways i at the edge of the clay sheet cations are present and can bound to and sorb the anionic surfactant ii in the presence of divalent cations ionic bridges can be formed between the negatively charged clay sheet and the anionic surfactants in this case the surfactants will precipitate ishiguro and koopal 2016 the composition of the tap water used could be coherent with this divalent ions bridges hypothesis as divalent cations were found at significant concentrations this result would have probably not been observed with ultrapure water this sorption of surfactants onto clay surfaces could explain this removal of clays the high effective cmc of sds could enhance this effect compared to the crude biosurfactant on the contrary the low effective cmc of the rhamnolipid mix could justify that this experiment was not affected as not enough biosurfactant was present in solution for the crude biosurfactant the presence of bacteria may enhance clay transport despite the low concentration injected indeed bacteria retention in porous media depends on the grain size distribution and increases with the reduction in grain size bai et al 2016 the presence of clay may have enhanced bacteria retention due to the increase in specific surface area in the columns interactions between bacteria and clays could also explain the removal of clays agglomerates between bacteria and clays producing aggregates potentially more prone to go with the water flow fig 10 the phenomenon of clay removal observed in the sds and biosurfactant experiments increased pah removal from columns by increasing the particulate phase transport of pahs via removal of clays consequently it is hard to conclude the real desorption capacity by the crude biosurfactant and the sds which allowed a higher removal of pahs from the contaminated porous media both via desorption solubilised phase and via particulate phase transport through clay removal however the objective being to wash pahs from the soil and subsequently recover the effluent for further treatments the main objective was to remove a maximum of pahs from the porous media or soil interactions between sds or the crude biosurfactant and clays considering that clays are pahs sorption sites allowed this removal and so better washing results 4 conclusion the use of a crude biosurfactant produced by a bacterial consortium isolated from a pah contaminated soil for the pah removal in sand and sand clay columns was investigated the efficacy of the biosurfactant was compared to that of three commercially available surfactants tween 80 sds and a rhamnolipid mix tween 80 was not suitable for use in column containing clay due to its high sorption onto this type of matrix the crude biosurfactant was less sorbed than the other surfactants tested on the two solid matrices with 75 of decrease in its concentration in the sand clay columns at an inlet concentration equal to 1 6 cmc the rhamnolipid mix was not capable of effectively remove pahs from the solid matrices sds and the crude biosurfactants showed good ability to remove pahs from the two matrices with a greater effect of sds compared with the biosurfactant nevertheless it must be taken into account that the crude biosurfactant was used at a lower concentration than sds the presence of clay in the columns did not result in a decrease in the extracted pah masses even though the soluble biosurfactant concentration was affected on the contrary a clay removal observed in sds and biosurfactant experiments increased the final pah masses removed in the presence of clays particulate pah transport was more important compared to sand only pahs were consequently efficiently removed by sds and the crude biosurfactant via dissolved phase and particulate phase this clay removal was attributed to ionic bridges formed via divalent cations in solution ca2 mg2 fe2 between anionic surfaces of i clays and ii sds crude biosurfactants which are anionic surfactants finally the experiments with the crude biosurfactant have demonstrated its ability to remove pahs from columns in the same range of values as chemical surfactants even at a lower cmc the produced biosurfactant also has the advantage of having a low cmc and low sorption onto the clay thus reducing the concentrations needed to remove pahs these results open up the possibility of using crude biosurfactant in soil washing processes with effluent recovery as an alternative to synthetic surfactants future studies are needed to determine the ability to produce biosurfactant on an industrial scale to practice the use of biosurfactant in more complex environments and then to test this remediation option on an actual pah contaminated

1241,biosurfactants surface active agents produced by microorganisms are increasingly studied for their potential use in soil remediation processes because they are more environmentally friendly than their chemically produced homologues in this work we report on the use of a crude biosurfactant produced by a bacterial consortium isolated from a pahs contaminated soil compared with other bio surfactants tween80 sodium dodecyl sulfate sds rhamnolipids mix to wash pahs from a contaminated porous media assays were done using columns filled with sand or sand clay mixtures 95 5 spiked with four model pahs the crude biosurfactant showed less adsorption to the sand and the sand clay columns compared to tween 80 sds and the rhamnolipid mix the biosurfactant showed the second best capacity to remove pahs from the columns as dissolved and particulate phases both from sand and sand clay after sds when applied at lower concentrations than the other sufactants the effluent concentrations of phenanthrene phe pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap increased in the presence of the crude biosurfactant compared to the control experiment using only water the global pahs washed mass amount of pahs removed from the columns increased between 9 and 1000 times for phe and bap in the sand column and between 55 and 6000 times respectively for phe and bap in the sand clay columns moreover in the sand clay columns leaching of a part of the clays was observed in the sds and the biosurfactant injections assays this clay leaching resulted in higher pahs removal due not to desorption but rather to particulate transport in the context of washing pah contaminated soils in biopiles or subsurface remediation our results could help in sizing the remediation approach using an environmental friendly biosurfactant before a pump and treat process keywords biosurfactant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons cmc pahs removal solubility particulate transport soil washing 1 introduction the main sources of contamination by pahs in the environment are anthropogenic baek et al 1991 in highly contaminated soils pahs originate primarily from accidental spills or leaks and from petrochemical and steel making industries this is especially the case during oil refining or coke production which produce oil or coal tars mainly composed of pahs wilson and jones 1993 sixteen pahs listed as priority pollutants by us epa are often chosen for environmental studies the toxicity of these sixteen products has been widely studied as they are probable and confirmed carcinogens doornaert 2005 due to their toxicity and persistence in the environment and to their high ubiquity research on the remediation of pah contaminated soils is still required as the number of aromatic rings increases their water solubility and volatility decrease in addition due to their hydrophobicity pahs are often strongly adsorbed to solid matrices and especially to soil organic matter schwarzenbach and westall 1981 murphy et al 1990 mader et al 1997 johnsen and karlson 2007 due to this pahs have low natural bioaccessibility and bioavailability riding et al 2013 and are therefore poorly biodegradable in soils especially for high molecular weight hmw pahs haritash and kaushik 2009 bioavailability is defined as the degree of and rate at which a compound is transferred from a medium to biological system either through absorption into an organism or other physiological interaction in the absence of bioavailability hydrophobic compounds may still be bioaccessible meaning that they could become bioavailable if desorbed semple et al 2004 several processes physical chemical and biological have been developed to remediate or remove pahs from soils soil washing using surfactants is one of them injection of surfactant solutions into the soil increases the desorption and apparent solubility of pahs followed by a pump and treat process trellu et al 2016 befkadu and chen 2018 injection of chemical surfactants is mainly used in the remediation of contaminant plumes and residual soil contamination however while it greatly increases the solubility of pahs and their extraction rate it has certain disadvantages increasing solubility increases bioaccessibility but not necessarily bioavailability shao et al 2017 this is due to the difficulty for bacteria to assimilate pahs associated with surfactant molecules and or to the possible absence of bacteria resistant to and able to metabolize pahs in soils moreover the toxicity of the surfactant itself may affect the subsequent biodegradation in washed soil by decreasing the population of autochthonous bacteria in soil during the washing the injection of sodium dodecyl sulfate sds in high concentrations 100 to 500 mg kg 1 may increase the solubility of pahs but its toxicity prevents the development of microorganisms capable of degrading pahs consequently the biodegradation of residual pahs after remobilization pump and treat will be less effective deschênes et al 1995 lima et al 2011 the persistence of surfactants and their toxicity towards the soil microbial community may also pose problems for the restoration of the soil and its ecosystem post treatment another risk is the dispersion of the solubilised pahs in the environment if the flow during the washing process is not precisely controlled in order to minimise these impacts biosurfactants which are specific surfactants produced by microorganisms can be implemented like chemical surfactants they are capable of reducing the surface tension between two phases whether liquid solid or gaseous therefore they can be used to increase the solubilisation of hydrophobic compounds such as pahs in water soberón chávez et al 2005 the use of biosurfactants in soil washing process has been increasingly studied over the last 30 years koch et al 1991 whang et al 2008 souza et al 2014 vijayakuma and saravanan 2015 bezza and chirwa 2017 biosurfactants offer advantages compared to chemical surfactants they have no proven toxicity to humans and are more biodegradable mulligan 2005 rufino et al 2014 their biodegradation occurs after the consumption of other carbon sources which solves the issue of post remediation management lima et al 2011 varjani and upasani 2017 in addition biosurfactants increase the bioavailability of the trapped molecule at least for biosurfactant producing bacteria whang et al 2008 youssef et al 2013 pi et al 2017 this capacity paves the way for the combination of two complementary processes soil washing and biodegradation gabet 2004 portet koltalo et al 2013 hassanshahian 2014 li et al 2015 ali khan et al 2017 chebbi et al 2017 lamichhane et al 2017 in our previous work we produced a biosurfactant using a bacterial consortium isolated from pahs contaminated soil the biosurfactant once purified had the ability to increase the solubilisation of some model pahs in aqueous solution in batch experiments cazals et al 2020 this interesting effect leads us to go further in the study of the biosurfactant capacity to remove pahs from artificially contaminated media in the dual perspective of increasing the experimental scale and the complexity of the media sand and sand clay dynamic columns were used the purpose of this work is to select the best product and operating conditions for a later use of the process in an actual in situ demonstration the aim of the present work was thus to study the potential of the produced biosurfactant in dynamic column experiments following different steps i investigation of biosurfactant sorption onto the matrix sand or sand clay to evaluate the effective critical micellar concentration in order to adapt the biosurfactant concentration and ultimately increase the pollutant removal efficiency and ii investigation of pah removal in dissolved or particulate phases from sand or sand clay columns in a porous media spiked with pahs during these experiments the effect of crude biosurfactant solution was compared to three commercially available surfactants tween 80 sds chemical surfactants and a mono and di rhamnolipid mix commercial biosurfactant 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals methanol 99

was purchased from sigma aldrich and is certified by the european community bureau of reference bcr 2 2 biosurfactant production the biosurfactant used characterized as an anionic biosurfactant was produced by a natural groundwater bacterial community firstly isolated from a pah contaminated industrial soil the initial consortium was cultivated in different conditions to optimize biosurfactant production cazals et al 2020 the consortium was mainly composed of five highly dominant bacterial species the identified bacteria were found to be closely related to microbacterium maritypicum luteibacter anthropi klebsiella grimontii pseudomonas veronii and pseudomonas antarctica cazals et al 2020 the biosurfactant producing culture was grown in 5 l bioreactors with a culture medium composed of 20 g l 1 of glucose 2 g l 1 of nh4no3 and 14 2 g l 1 of na2hpo4 at 20 c ph 7 in tap water and with continuous injection of air to achieve a dissolved oxygen concentration of 9 mg l 1 close to saturation in water at 20 c tap water was used to make the process conceivable at a real scale on site the tap water was composed of 54 8 mg l 1 ca2 4 7 mg l 1 mg2 0 2 mg l 1 fe2 3 7 mg l 1 k 13 mg l 1 na 180 3 mg l 1 hco3 4 9 mg l 1 no3 0 11 mg l 1 f and 21 1 mg l 1 cl this production medium was studied and optimised for the production of biosurfactant as described previously cazals et al 2020 for biosurfactant recovery the foam produced at the top of the bioreactors was manually collected liquefied and stored at 4 c this method was used to make the process conceivable on site at a higher scale process similar to flotation this solution was the crude biosurfactant solution used in the following experiments its concentration was equivalent to 68 mg l 1 i e 1 6 times its critical micellar concentration cmc as determined by cazals et al 2020 2 3 pah spiking two solid matrices were used sand and sand with clay the sand used was fontainebleau sand sieved at 400 μm 98 6 passing 125 μm washed dried in an oven at 80 c for 72 h then sterilized in an autoclave at 120 c for 1 h the sand clay matrix consisted of 95 by mass of the above sterilized fontainebleau sand and 5 of boom clay mainly composed of illite and smectite four pahs naphthalene napht phenanthrene phe pyrene pyr and benzo a pyrene bap were selected for this study with emphasis on the representation of different solubilities and numbers of aromatic rings for spiking the sand and sand clay matrices napht phe pyr bap were first solubilised in acetone in sufficient concentration for a final concentrations in solid media of 98 144 120 and 1 mg kg 1 respectively these concentrations were chosen in order to obtain a higher concentration for each model pah than that which can be solubilised by water alone during the washing process the spiking protocol was as follows 10 of the matrix mass was placed in a large sterilized glass container the acetone in which the pahs were solubilised was poured into the container and the mixture was mechanically homogenized by hand the container was then left for 24 h under an extraction fan to volatilise the acetone the matrix was re homogenized after acetone volatilisation the 90 uncontaminated matrix was then added and the total mass was again homogenized pahs concentrations in soil after the volatilisation of acetone and homogenization were measured and are considered as initial concentrations in the following tests then the containers were closed and stored in the dark at room temperature prior to further experiments 2 4 pah extraction and analysis 2 4 1 pah extraction from solid samples with microwave assisted extraction mae the extraction procedure by microwave assisted extraction mae was adapted from a previously described protocol olivares et al 2010 for the analysis of pah concentration in the solid matrix microwave assisted extraction microwave ethos 1 advanced microwave digestion labstation milestone was used prior to analysis by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry gc ms shimadzu qp 2020 marne la vallée france then 5 g of the matrix were placed with 30 ml of dichloromethane in each of the microwave vessels before being heated at 140 c for 35 min the containers were cooled to 35 c within 2 h before being opened the dichloromethane phase was then extracted and filtered through 0 45 μm ptfe filters the filtrate was then analysed by gc ms for pah identification and quantification 2 4 2 pahs extraction from water samples with solid phase extraction spe tube for the extraction of pahs in water samples before analysis spe columns from supelclean envichrom envi chrom p spe tube were used the extraction protocol was adapted to this specific use the columns were conditioned with 2 ml of dichloromethane followed by 2 ml of deionized milliq water 18 mω the water samples were percolated and the cartridges were then washed with 3 ml of milliq water the cartridges were finally dried by vacuum aspiration for 2 h and the samples eluted with 5 ml of dichloromethane prior to analyses for effluent samples containing suspended matter clays no filtration was performed as the aim was to analyse the total pah removal from column as dissolved and particulate phases the dichloromethane phase was then analysed by gc ms 2 4 3 pah analysis for pah analyses a gc ms equipped with a restek rxi 5sil ms column length 30 m film thickness 0 25 μm and diameter 0 25 mm was used the oven temperature was initially set at 80 c then increased to 300 c in 25 min rate 8 8 c min 1 and maintained at 300 c for 10 min helium was used as the carrier gas at a flowrate of 1 30 ml min 1 for the mass spectrometer the temperature of the ion source was set at 240 c and the detector voltage at 1 20 kv adapted from crampon et al 2014 2 5 columns filling protocol to compare the effectiveness of the biosurfactant for pah removal with commercially available surfactants dynamic experiments in columns were carried out omnifit glass columns thermo fischer scientific illkirch france with a length of 20 cm and an inner diameter of 2 5 cm with polytetrafluoroethylene ptfe end pieces were used the columns were filled with the matrix in three stages with manual packing in between total volume of matrix added per column of around 100 cm3 a co2 gas flow was passed through the columns to remove air to increase the wettability of the matrix tap water was injected into the columns at a flowrate of 0 4 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump pump 205s watson marlow la queue lez yvelines france with ptfe tubing internal diameter 1 60 mm a fraction collector omnicoll lambda laboratory instruments gmbh switzerland was placed at the column outlet to recover the effluent fractions prior to further analyses to measure the column porosity two methods were used meiri 1989 masipan et al 2016 first a tracer test was performed in four parallel sand columns using a 100 mg l 1 solution of nabr made with ultrapure water this solution was injected into the columns at a flowrate of 1 5 ml min 1 from the beginning of the injection and every 5 s conductivity measurements were carried out in the water at the outlet of the columns to estimate the pore volume using the conductivity front of the nabr tracer after the injection of 70 ml of the nabr solution tap water was injected into the columns at the same flowrate and the bromide desorption curve was plotted to verify the estimation of the pore volume the other method consisted of weighing the columns before and after the pure water injection during the filling protocol then the weight difference was used to estimate the pore volume corresponding to the volume of water injected 2 6 surfactant sorption in dynamic columns for pah removal experiments the concentration of the injected surfactant must be above the cmc at any point in the column to allow micelle formation and subsequent pah washing a part of the surfactant will be sorbed onto the solid matrix during injection which will decrease the actual concentration of surfactant in water it is then mandatory to estimate this loss and to determine an effective cmc corresponding to the inlet concentration necessary to obtain a concentration at least equal to the cmc at the column outlet to ensure that micelles will form within the porous media in the columns surfactant sorption experiments in the column were performed with the two different matrices sand and sand clay the following surfactants sds cmc 2307 mg l 1 tween 80 cmc 14 mg l 1 and rhamnolipid mix cmc 80 mg l 1 were injected at concentrations corresponding to ½ cmc 1 cmc 5 cmc and 10 cmc table 1 only for the sand clay columns the concentration corresponding to 50 cmc was tested for the crude biosurfactant a single concentration was tested in each column corresponding to the concentration of samples collected in foam from bioreactors concentration of around 1 6 cmc to measure surfactant concentrations photometric kits for the analysis of anionic and non ionic surfactants were used ref a ten 02552 0 05 2 0 mg l 1 mbas for anionic and 0 10 7 50 mg l 1 triton for non ionic spectroquant supelco merck millipore for the crude biosurfactant the concentration was determined indirectly by surface tension measurements using kruss dsa 100 goniometer and the method of the pending drop using young laplace fit directly from the advance software combined to the kruss dsa 100 one pore volume of each surfactant solution was injected into a column at a flowrate of 0 8 ml min 1 two pore volumes of tap water were then injected and surfactant concentrations were measured in each pore volume of the effluent after the determination of the effective cmcs new experiments were performed for the sds and the rhamnolipids mixture in triplicate using these concentrations and following the same protocol of experiments and analyses 2 7 pah removal by surfactant washing in dynamic columns the pah removal experiments were performed for the two matrices using the effective cmc of each surfactant as the inlet concentration each experiment was run in triplicate with a control column where only tap water was injected sds the rhamnolipid mix and the crude biosurfactant were tested tween 80 was discarded as explained later the injection protocol was as follows first a flushing with water without chemical or biological enhancement was carried out in order to reproduce the water flows before the implementation of a remediation process thereafter a washing with surfactants or biosurfactants was implemented in order to quantify the efficiency of the remediation process finally a water injection was applied in order to check whether the residual pollution in the porous medium can still be mobilized the succession of injections was therefore as follows injection of a pore volume of tap water t1 followed by two pore volumes of surfactant solutions t2 and finally two pore volumes of tap water t3 fig 1 all injections were carried out at a flowrate of 0 8 ml min 1 which corresponds to a flow velocity of 0 6 m day 1 to approximate that of the groundwater in the studied site the initial and final pah concentrations in the solid matrices were determined by gc ms analysis after mae extraction for pah concentrations in water samples were analysed for each pore volumes injected all experiments for each condition were performed in triplicate for one of the three columns of each test the two pore volumes of the t2 step effluent bio surfactant injection were split into four subsamples t2a t2b t2c and t2d each representing a quarter of the injection time of the two pore volumes to assess the removal kinetics during injection 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of pore volumes the nabr tracing test was performed in four sand columns average mass of dry sand 159 3 g to ascertain the porosity of the matrix and to confirm that the determination of the volume of pores by difference of weight between dry and saturated columns was consistent the conductivity curve at the column outlets showed the point of nabr breakthrough the pore volume calculated from this breakthrough curve was 39 17 ml for the first step injection and 40 08 ml for the second step end of injection fig 2 the measurement of the weight difference between the dry and the saturated column gave a mean weight of 40 4 g which means a pore volume equal to 40 4 ml if the density of water is assumed to be 1 g ml 1 at 20 c as a first approximation the relative margin between the values obtained by the two types of measurement is equal to 1 9 this low difference validates the use of the weight difference method to estimate the pore volumes of the columns in the next experiments 3 2 loss of surfactants due to sorption the use of crude biosurfactant prevents the selection of an optimal concentration to be injected into the columns for pah removal to ensure that the biosurfactant concentration in the crude solution is sufficient so that it is not fully adsorbed to the matrix it is mandatory to evaluate the loss of surfactant in the column prior to the pah removal experiments surfactant sorption experiments in sand columns were carried out with the four surfactants used in this study for the three commercially available surfactants the curves of surfactant loss versus inlet concentrations c c0 were plotted fig 3 an exponential decrease in surfactant loss with increasing inlet concentration was observed for all three surfactants this decrease is due to the limited number of sorption sites in the sand for surfactants with increasing concentration these adsorption sites are partially saturated and adsorb relatively fewer surfactants molecules detailed data of experimental results are presented in supplementary material the effective cmcs of the surfactant in the sand were calculated from these curves table 2 for the produced biosurfactant the loss by adsorption was 6 in these experiments the same experiments were conducted for the sand clay columns an additional experiment at a concentration equal to 50 cmc was performed for each surfactant due to the high adsorption observed an exponential decrease of the surfactant adsorption can be observed in these experiments too fig 4 tween 80 was totally adsorbed regardless of the initial concentration injected this strong adsorption was assigned to the non ionic nature of tween 80 clay particles have a negative surface charge which causes electrostatic repulsion with anionic surfactants such as sds the rhamnolipid mix or the crude biosurfactant produced thus reducing their adsorption rates this phenomenon is well known for non ionic surfactants amirianshoja et al 2013 especially for tween 80 kang and jeong 2014 concerning anionic surfactants it must be noted that cationic bridges involving divalent cations may form between anionic charges of clays on one side and anionic charges of surfactants on the other boom clay is composed especially of smectites and contains high specific surface area and negative charges the tap water contained 54 8 mg l 1 calcium and 4 7 mg l 1 magnesium these divalent cations in solution could explain the sorption of anionic bio surfactants observed in our experiments for the other two surfactants the effective cmcs for sand clay columns were experimentally estimated table 2 tween 80 was discarded for the next experiments as its strong adsorption to clay particles would inhibit its capacity to form micelles and potentially remove pahs from the contaminated porous media for the crude biosurfactant a 75 decrease in concentration was observed in the sand clay columns between columns inlet and outlet c c0 100 this leads to an outlet concentration equal to 0 4 cmc for an inlet concentration equal to 1 6 cmc this adsorption rate was lower than that of the other surfactants used at higher inlet concentration 100 90 and 70 of decrease in concentration for tween 80 the rhamnolipid mix and sds respectively for an inlet concentration equal to 5 cmc the crude biosurfactant appeared to be less sensitive to sorption to the solid matrix than its commercialized homologues once these effective cmcs were estimated further experiments were conducted to confirm that using these cmc values as an inlet concentration would lead to an outlet concentration at least equal to the cmc table 2 these new experiments were carried out in triplicate for the two matrices using the effective cmcs as inlet concentrations mean values for adsorption loss were added to the previous adsorption curves fig 5 for the sds experiments the new values corresponded to what was expected confirming the good match of the adsorption curves for rhamnolipids the experiment in sand column showed a fitted value with the curves for the experiment in sand clay columns the adsorption rate was lower than expected associated with a higher uncertainty than the other experiments the measured effective cmc were the concentrations used for pah removal experiments in dynamic columns sorption of biosurfactants in soils during washing tests is a well known phenomenon singh and cameotra measured in their study a 50 adsorption loss of a lipopeptide with characteristics close to the biosurfactant studied here singh and cameotra 2013 this sorption on one hand could limit the efficiency of the surfactant to remove sorbed contaminants due to the loss of concentration in aqueous phase on the other hand the sorption of surfactants at the soil water interphase could be an essential factor for the desorption of soil pollutants since it would allow the contact of the surfactant with the pollutants strongly sorbed onto the soil particles clays om clay humic complexes considering also that the surfactant is at a concentration higher than the cmc mulligan 2005 urum et al 2006 finally the sorption of surfactants to the surface of soil particles especially clays could allow the clays washing from the soil in a washing process 3 3 pah removal in dynamic columns 3 3 1 pah removal in sand dynamic columns the washing experiments studied the capacity of each bio surfactant to remove pahs from the porous media simulating a contaminated soil before washing in biopile or in situ before pump and treat under dissolved and or particulate adsorbed onto suspended matter form pah concentrations in effluent were analysed at three different times and all data are presented in terms of percentage of pah removed removed values correspond to total pah concentrations in effluent i e desorbed sorbed phase or sorbed onto suspended matter particulate phase at the end of the experiment fig 6 first at t1 when only water was injected in the columns the different columns showed similar concentrations of the different pahs in the effluent with a high concentration of napht a low concentration of phe and pyr and no detection of bap this result is logical and depends on specific solubility in water of the 4 studied pahs at t2 after the injection of 2pvs of surfactant solutions all three surfactants injected in the columns increased the pah concentrations in the effluent napht concentration was less affected by the surfactant injections than the other pahs as its solubility in water is sufficient for a good soil washing sds showed the greatest increase in removed pah masses among the three surfactants with a removal rate of 100 for napht 25 for phe 8 for pyr and 9 for bap on the other hand the rhamnolipids mix had a lower effect on pah removal from the columns the washing rates were 100 3 0 1 and 0 1 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively despite its lower surfactant inlet concentration the crude biosurfactant solution injection increased pah removal more strongly than the rhamnolipids mix with removal rates of 100 9 3 and 3 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively at t3 final injection of 2pvs tap water water was re injected into all columns leading to a decrease in pah concentrations in the effluent the concentrations remained higher than at t1 for sds and the crude biosurfactant demonstrating that these bio surfactants remained in the columns and were still able to remobilize pahs after their re solubilisation in water surfactant molecules as shown in the surfactant adsorption experiments were able to sorb onto the porous media of the columns the final injection of water indeed probably led to a re solubilisation of the sorbed surfactants and to the subsequent formation of micelles and subsequent pah removal from porous media to effluent this result highlights the reversibility of bio surfactant sorption this phenomenon corresponds to a delaying effect of sds and crude biosurfactant rhamnolipids appeared to have a lower effect on pah removal when sds and the biosurfactant increased the pah concentrations in the effluent calculations of the total percentage of pahs extracted from the sand columns in the different experiments are summarised in fig 6 as removal rates for napht were always found to be 100 in both conditions napht is not represented in fig 6 sds showed the highest capacity of pah removal in total crude biosurfactant presented the second best removal results with an increase of 315 461 and 7 26 compared to the control with only tap water for phe pyr and bap respectively an increase in pah concentrations could be observed throughout the injection of the biosurfactant especially up to t2c and seemed to stabilize at t2d fig 7 especially for napht the concentration was stable at the beginning t2a to t2c and decreased during t2d this decrease was assigned to the depletion of the napht adsorbed in the columns since all the napht was extracted from the column during the experiment for phe and pyr an increase of respectively 254 and 141 of their concentrations in effluent between t2a and t2d was observed bap concentration increased 59 and 39 between t2a and t2b and t2b and t2c respectively however during t2d the concentration decreased slightly by 10 this value was assigned to analysis uncertainty during t3 the outlet concentrations dropped with the injection of water into the columns but remained higher than those that occurred during the initial water injection t1 confirming the existence of a delaying effect the delaying effect of the biosurfactant could allow an accumulation in the column and a local increase in concentration leading to an increase in the removal of pah from the porous media therefore increasing the amount of biosurfactant injected will result in an increase in the quantity of removed pahs compared to sds the biosurfactant had lower removal yields however they remain in the same order of magnitude for much lower surfactant concentrations batch tests showed that sds was more efficient than biosurfactants amphisine and viscosine for the desorption of pahs from clayey sand and in particular heavy pahs more than 3 rings amphisine was effective at a twenty fold lower concentration than sds suggesting that biosurfactants have the advantage of desorbing pahs at low concentrations portet koltalo et al 2013 the use of biosurfactant was also studied to associate pah desorption and increase of biodegradation especially for the heaviest pahs the use of lipopeptide in a soil contaminated by creosote has been shown to increase the biodegradation of high molecular weight pahs after their desorption from an old contaminated soil bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2015 it was shown that the main factor responsible for the increase in pah biodegradation was the increase in their bioaccessibility in the presence of biosurfactants bezza and nkhalambayausi chirwa 2015 3 3 2 pah washing in sand clay columns the same experiments were performed in sand clay columns as in the sand columns pah concentrations in the effluent during t1 were low and in the same range of values for all columns during t2 sds and the crude biosurfactants had significant effect on pah removal fig 8 on the other hand injection of rhamnolipid mix did not increase pah solubilisation see supplementary material 3 the percentage of pahs desorbed was close to the control with washing rates of about 100 0 1 0 1 and 0 2 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively no other effect was observed on the contrary for the other surfactants used a larger increase in pah concentrations in effluent was recorded and at the same time removal of clay particles from the columns it must be noted consequently that these pah concentrations correspond both to solubilised pahs thanks to bio surfactant micelles and to pahs still potentially sorbed onto clay particles washed from the columns the idea being to wash the soil to recover a maximum of the contaminants and subsequently treat the effluent the removal of clay particles which are possible pah sorption sites hwang and cutright 2002 is also useful consequently the results presented in fig 8 concern dissolved pahs and pahs transported sorbed onto clay particles for sds pah washing rates were 100 for napht 17 for phe 14 for pyr and 18 for bap for the crude biosurfactant these concentrations increased approximately 100 for napht 11 for phe 5 for pyr and 12 for bap sds experiment showed a higher increase in pah removal desorption transport onto suspended clays than in the sand experiment the rhamnolipids experiment exhibited desorbed pah in the same range of values as in the sand experiment despite the stronger adsorption of the biosurfactant in the sand clay columns during t3 for the rhamnolipids mix assay pah concentrations increased slightly indicating that a weak delaying effect exists for this surfactant too the concentrations were still much lower than those observed in the other two surfactants experiments and in particular the sds which presents the highest concentrations during t3 clay removal was also recorded with sds and the crude biosurfactant experiments but different behaviours in pahs removal were observed for sds pah concentrations decreased during t3 but remained on average 47 times higher than those during t1 because of the delaying effect which means on average a five fold reduction compared to t2 concentrations conversely for the crude biosurfactant pah concentrations in water increased by a factor of two between t2 and t3 the majority of pah extraction occurs during t3 because of the resolubilisation of sorbed surfactants delaying effect and to the removal of clay analysis of the delaying effect was performed in the sds and biosurfactant experiments this effect was amplified in comparison with the sand column experiments the increase was about 490 for naphthalene 1855 for phenanthrene 3109 for pyrene and 12 459 for benzo a pyrene between t2a and t2d in the sds experiment fig 9 and about 50 402 332 and 126 for napht phe pyr and bap respectively between t2a and t2d in the crude biosurfactant experiment fig 9 removal of bap is higher than pyr this is probably due to the fact that the media were spiked and did not correspond to a real contaminated soil where ageing could have led to strong sorption of pahs especially heavier ones which have lower solubility and higher kow in this case bap would logically have been less extracted compared to pyr but in a spiked soil context results may be different moreover as clay removal was observed bap concentrations could rather be linked to solid phase concentrations bap sorbed onto clay phase this higher delaying effect could be due to the clay removal phenomenon which brings out some of the pah molecules in the particulate phase the delaying effect was weak in the rhamnolipid mix experiment and no clay removal was observed which reinforces the hypothesis the concentrations obtained at the outlet of the rhamnolipid washed columns were within a similar range of values as those obtained in the control columns which were washed with water however other studies had highlighted the ability of rhamnolipids to desorb pahs an et al 2011 posada baquero et al 2019 but at concentrations well above their cmcs the use of more concentrated solutions of rhamnolipids should lead to better washing rates but compromise the advantage of the low cmc of the rhamnolipids moreover in a soil washing process the clay removal we observed is interesting indeed pah removal is then not limited to their desorption but includes washing through particulate phase with subsequent effluent treatments the negative effect of the sorption of biosurfactants such as rhamnolipids by clay particles for pah desorption is well known and extensively studied the composition of the clayey fraction is one of the main factors influencing the adsorption clays with a si al 2 1 ratio such as montmorillonite have shown greater surfactant sorption than clays with a si al 1 1 ratio zhu et al 2003 ochoa loza et al 2007 the clays used in this study are composed primarily of smectite a si al 2 1 ratio clay which is consistent with the high surfactant adsorption in our tests and may explain also the clays removal highlighted in our experiments according to some studies the presence of clays can also contribute to pah desorption by creating a hydrophobic environment allowing contact between the surfactant and the pahs zhu et al 2007 these hydrophobic zones could be the cause of clay transport out of the columns during washing in our studies the sorption of the hydrophobic part of the surfactants to clays could increase their removal through the hydrophilic part of the surfactants to create and maintain this hydrophobic environment it s crucial that the surfactant concentration is always well above the cmc mulligan 2005 and most of the studies tend to show that the presence of clays generally remains a hindrance to the use of surfactant washing techniques for soils wang and keller 2008 wei et al 2015 this clay removal was then investigated and compared to the global pah removal in all the samples the leached clays were recovered dried and weighed a positive correlation was observed between the leached clay mass and pah mass released during t2 fig 10 this suggests that a portion of the pahs was indeed carried by the clay increasing the total mass of pahs extracted from the porous media via particulate phase jointly with desorption and subsequent solubilised phase transport of pahs the transport of pahs especially of hmw pahs by colloidal particles had been highlighted with organic matter and could also exist with clay particles benhabib et al 2017 clay removal could be due to high interactions with clays in the column pushing the clays and their sorbed pahs out of the columns with water flow in 2016 ishiguro and koopal studied the adsorption of surfactant on different soil particles anionic surfactants such as sds the crude biosurfactant or the rhamnolipid mix can be adsorbed to the clays in two different ways i at the edge of the clay sheet cations are present and can bound to and sorb the anionic surfactant ii in the presence of divalent cations ionic bridges can be formed between the negatively charged clay sheet and the anionic surfactants in this case the surfactants will precipitate ishiguro and koopal 2016 the composition of the tap water used could be coherent with this divalent ions bridges hypothesis as divalent cations were found at significant concentrations this result would have probably not been observed with ultrapure water this sorption of surfactants onto clay surfaces could explain this removal of clays the high effective cmc of sds could enhance this effect compared to the crude biosurfactant on the contrary the low effective cmc of the rhamnolipid mix could justify that this experiment was not affected as not enough biosurfactant was present in solution for the crude biosurfactant the presence of bacteria may enhance clay transport despite the low concentration injected indeed bacteria retention in porous media depends on the grain size distribution and increases with the reduction in grain size bai et al 2016 the presence of clay may have enhanced bacteria retention due to the increase in specific surface area in the columns interactions between bacteria and clays could also explain the removal of clays agglomerates between bacteria and clays producing aggregates potentially more prone to go with the water flow fig 10 the phenomenon of clay removal observed in the sds and biosurfactant experiments increased pah removal from columns by increasing the particulate phase transport of pahs via removal of clays consequently it is hard to conclude the real desorption capacity by the crude biosurfactant and the sds which allowed a higher removal of pahs from the contaminated porous media both via desorption solubilised phase and via particulate phase transport through clay removal however the objective being to wash pahs from the soil and subsequently recover the effluent for further treatments the main objective was to remove a maximum of pahs from the porous media or soil interactions between sds or the crude biosurfactant and clays considering that clays are pahs sorption sites allowed this removal and so better washing results 4 conclusion the use of a crude biosurfactant produced by a bacterial consortium isolated from a pah contaminated soil for the pah removal in sand and sand clay columns was investigated the efficacy of the biosurfactant was compared to that of three commercially available surfactants tween 80 sds and a rhamnolipid mix tween 80 was not suitable for use in column containing clay due to its high sorption onto this type of matrix the crude biosurfactant was less sorbed than the other surfactants tested on the two solid matrices with 75 of decrease in its concentration in the sand clay columns at an inlet concentration equal to 1 6 cmc the rhamnolipid mix was not capable of effectively remove pahs from the solid matrices sds and the crude biosurfactants showed good ability to remove pahs from the two matrices with a greater effect of sds compared with the biosurfactant nevertheless it must be taken into account that the crude biosurfactant was used at a lower concentration than sds the presence of clay in the columns did not result in a decrease in the extracted pah masses even though the soluble biosurfactant concentration was affected on the contrary a clay removal observed in sds and biosurfactant experiments increased the final pah masses removed in the presence of clays particulate pah transport was more important compared to sand only pahs were consequently efficiently removed by sds and the crude biosurfactant via dissolved phase and particulate phase this clay removal was attributed to ionic bridges formed via divalent cations in solution ca2 mg2 fe2 between anionic surfaces of i clays and ii sds crude biosurfactants which are anionic surfactants finally the experiments with the crude biosurfactant have demonstrated its ability to remove pahs from columns in the same range of values as chemical surfactants even at a lower cmc the produced biosurfactant also has the advantage of having a low cmc and low sorption onto the clay thus reducing the concentrations needed to remove pahs these results open up the possibility of using crude biosurfactant in soil washing processes with effluent recovery as an alternative to synthetic surfactants future studies are needed to determine the ability to produce biosurfactant on an industrial scale to practice the use of biosurfactant in more complex environments and then to test this remediation option on an actual pah contaminated

1242,mixing dependent reactions occur where groundwater and surface water mix in shallow sediments hyporheic zone and can attenuate contaminants along upwelling flowpaths thus reducing transport to surface water here we used modflow seam3d to numerically simulate prior laboratory observations of a mixing dependent reaction between sodium sulfite na2so3 and dissolved oxygen do to produce sodium sulfate na2so4 this reaction is not common in nature but is used as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance we evaluated how location and thickness of mixing zones and reaction product production zones dynamically respond to variations in hydraulic and chemical boundary conditions and reaction kinetic rate sensitivity analysis showed that location and thickness of mixing zones and reactant production zones were most sensitive to changes in the balance of hydrologic inflow from groundwater and surface water inflow ratio mixing zone thickness for reactive do calibrated to experimental data was thinner than that for the do tracer identical source location and concentration as do but conservative tracer indicating that as do is consumed its mixing zone narrows the so4 production zone was consistently thicker than the do mixing zone small changes in mixing production zone thicknesses were linked to large changes in mass consumed and produced indicating the potential for simpler field metrics like thickness to act as surrogates for more challenging measurements such as contaminant flux or consumption in monitoring natural attenuation this study improves understanding of the evolution of hyporheic mixing dependent reaction zones that occur even under steady state hydraulics emphasizing their complex controls keywords surface water groundwater interaction mixing zone thickness production zone thickness dispersion dissolved oxygen 1 introduction the hyporheic zone occurs where surface water and groundwater interact below or adjacent to stream and riverbeds it is a key interface within the river corridor where important chemical reactions occur in the presence of unique biological communities mixing along subsurface flowpaths is an important process that influences contaminant attenuation in the hyporheic zone bandopadhyay et al 2018 hester et al 2014 2017 li et al 2017 mixing of source waters is particularly important for upwelling groundwater contaminant plumes which may undergo natural attenuation via mixing dependent mixing controlled reactions in the hyporheic zone and thus protect surface water boano et al 2018 conant et al 2004 ellis and rivett 2007 freitas et al 2015 hester et al 2014 2019 krause et al 2013 weatherill et al 2019 controls on natural attenuation of upwelling pollutants in the hyporheic zone have been of growing interest including how such attenuation may be enhanced for example weatherill et al 2019 observed that areas where nitrate plumes had already denitrified were more favorable to reductive dechlorination of upwelling chlorinated ethenes due to lowered redox potential similarly burke et al 2014 studied temperature dependent attenuation of micropollutants and showed that the presence of colder surface water allowed for deeper penetration of oxygen rich water into the subsurface this in turn aided oxic dependent attenuation as the mixing of the oxic water and micropollutants enhanced reactions and mass consumption finally krause et al 2013 showed the greatest denitrification in upwelling groundwater occurred where low hydraulic conductivity led to higher residence times which allowed for longer mixing times and hence do depletion these studies demonstrate that attenuation may be dependent on mixing of solutes that provide ideal location for reactions to occur given the importance of mixing dependent reactions for natural attenuation of upwelling contaminants in the hyporheic zone analysis of variables that influence hyporheic mixing processes is an important area of study previous studies have shown that key parameters that enhance mixing and therefore mixing dependent reactions include heterogeneity transiency and residence times bandopadhyay et al 2018 hester et al 2013 2014 2019 for example hester et al 2014 employed a numerical model to study mixing dependent denitrification in the hyporheic zone and observed that mixing zone thickness was relatively small with values of approximately 1 cm a follow up study showed that surface water fluctuations increased mixing dependent reaction of denitrification by roughly 80 hester et al 2019 su et al 2020 used a stochastic approach to determine that surface water velocity and groundwater flux were more influential than heterogeneity at inducing hyporheic mixing while these studies show the relative importance of physical parameters on mixing dependent reactions in the hyporheic zone the influence of transport variables such as reactant concentrations and kinetic rates have received less attention herzog et al 2016 herzog et al 2018 herzog et al 2016 in particular evaluated the effects of kinetic rate and residence time yet did not quantitatively evaluate mixing and mass transformation in spatially detailed ways further many prior studies have focused on the overall influence of controlling parameters but have not carefully evaluated the dynamic evolution of reactive hyporheic mixing zones over time including how that informs knowledge of process finally the relationship between mixing and attenuation in the hyporheic zone has not been fully explored chiogna et al 2011 2012 rolle et al 2013 the dilution index quantifies irreversible mixing by determining how the volume of water that a given parcel of solute occupies increases over time kitanidis 1994 chiogna et al 2012 introduced the flux related dilution index which applied to the particular case where a plume emanates from a constant ongoing source they concluded that the flux related dilution index varied based on the progression of the reactive plume without having to know the location of concentration distributions however the flux related dilution index may be hard to obtain from field and laboratory experiments as it relies on detailed knowledge of location and magnitude of mass fluxes in comparison mixing zone thicknesses and locations are practical measurements of mixing that can be more readily taken in field laboratory and modeling experiments using these measurements to relate field or lab observations of mixing to dilution index mass flux or consumption can clarify what processes are occurring and therefore what may enhance attenuation in this study we aimed to expand on our understanding of the influence of kinetic and hydraulic parameters on mixing and mixing dependent reactions in a model simulated hyporheic zone based on laboratory observations from santizo et al 2020 described further in section 2 below our specific objectives were to 1 simulate mixing dependent abiotic reaction observed in laboratory data from santizo et al 2020 2 quantify variation in the location and thickness of both reactant mixing zones and resulting production zones of mixing dependent reaction products in response to variations in controlling factors 3 determine the relative influence of such controlling factors through sensitivity coefficients and 4 analyze the relationship between mixing and production zone thicknesses and mass consumed produced 2 methods we used modflow to simulate hyporheic flow and seam3d to simulate hyporheic solute transport and reaction as described in more detail in the subsequent sections the model was calibrated to the laboratory experiments of santizo et al 2020 a sensitivity analysis was then performed to determine relative effects of controlling factors 2 1 model domain and governing equations we designed the model domain to simulate the laboratory experimental set up from santizo et al 2020 where a mixing dependent reaction occurred in shallow submerged sediments between a hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater the experimental reaction eq 1 was of sodium sulfite na2so3 with dissolved oxygen do to form sodium sulfate na2so4 1 na 2 so 3 1 2 o 2 na 2 so 4 this reaction is not expected to be common in nature but rather was intended as a simple abiotic reaction representing do consumption in shallow sediments with reaction products that could easily be measured in a laboratory setting the experiments represented conditions where curved transverse mixing zones occur in shallow aquatic or marine sediments between advected surface water and upwelling groundwater as induced by bedforms or structures azinheira et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 lautz and siegel 2006 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 the purpose of the experiments was to understand how such mixing zones evolve in unprecedented spatial detail using dissolved oxygen planar optodes and evaluate the effects of controlling factors such as hydraulic boundary conditions the flow cell in the laboratory experiments was driven by two different head drops in the surface water boundary condition δh fig 1a which represented the variation in pressure along the sediment water interface induced by such bedforms and structures the values of δh in the experiments spanned the range that was physically possible in the experimental setup and were within the range of values observed in prior lab and field studies elliott and brooks 1997 endreny et al 2011 hester and doyle 2008 the model domain for the current study encompassed the experimental sand box and a vertical in stream partition from santizo et al 2020 red dashed box in fig 1a the model domain was 80 cm by 43 cm by 10 cm with the partition placed 20 cm from the left boundary and to 6 cm depth in the sand modflow hughes et al 2017 was used to simulate groundwater flow occurring in the laboratory experimental setup modflow solves the 3d groundwater equation eq 2 2 x i k ii h x i w s s h t using a finite difference method where k ii is hydraulic conductivity l t in the direction of respective cartesian coordinate axes x i l h is the piezometric head l w is a source sink term t 1 s s is specific storage l 1 and t is time t we used the 3d sequential electron acceptor model seam3d widdowson et al 2002 to numerically model solute transport and reaction in groundwater the reaction in santizo et al 2020 was the abiotic mixing dependent reaction of sodium sulfite na2so3 from gw with dissolved oxygen do from sw to produce sodium sulfate na2so4 in the mixing zone this reaction was chosen by santizo et al 2020 for its use of oxygen as its electron acceptor like many hyporheic reactions as well as its simple kinetics this reaction is not common in nature but is used as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance seam3d simulated the three reactive chemical species plus a do tracer i e conservative tracer entering the model at the same location and concentration as the reactive do to compare mixing dependent reaction to non reactive mixing seam3d incorporates the modflow cell by cell flow output to solve the advection dispersion and reaction equation in groundwater eq 3 3 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k w c s k r 4 d ij d m v i α ij where θ is the porosity dimensionless c k is concentration of dissolved component k ml 3 t is time t x i j is distance along respective cartesian coordinate axes l d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor eq 4 l2t 1 where dm is the molecular diffusion l2t 1 and αij is the dispersivity l v i is linear pore water velocity lt 1 c s k is the source sink flux concentration for constituent k ml 3 and r is the chemical reaction term ml 3 t 1 in this case the chemical reaction term is the abiotic first order reaction of na2so3 and do to na2so4 which takes the form of eq 5 5 r λ c do where λ is the reaction kinetic rate constant t 1 and cdo is concentration of do ml 3 the cell grid size for both modflow and seam3d was 0 0025 m by 0 0025 m by 0 10 m several grid sizes were tested for accuracy in matching observed values and minimizing numerical dispersion the chosen grid size balanced these concerns against run times larger grid sizes had too much numerical dispersion and run times for smaller grid sizes were too long given minimal improvement in matching observed values eqs 2 and 3 are the general 3d case but in this study we simulated the laboratory set up in 2d fig 1 the model simulated a 3 h period that matched the experiments in the experiments the first two hours entailed observations of dynamic evolution of transport and reaction zones which are simulated and evaluated in the present study and the third hour was used for reaction imaging and sampling of steady state transport conditions which were used for calibration purposes in the present study in this study modflow was run in steady state mode and seam3d simulated dynamic transient transport with a timestep of 5 9 10 6 days 0 51 s 2 2 model inputs calibration and outputs input parameters for modflow and seam3d were initially determined from the laboratory experimental data of santizo et al 2020 and then certain parameters were varied slightly during calibration until the mixing thickness and front location for the two different experimental δh conditions matched the laboratory observations fig 1a table 1 the calibration process was manual because the parameter values were heavily constrained by observation data from the experiments note that while measurements of so4 and do were taken at slightly different depths in the experiments of santizo et al 2020 fig 1 for the purposes of modeling in this study we assumed for convenience that both occurred at a single depth 3 5 cm do mixing zone thickness fig 1b was calculated using linear interpolation to estimate locations of the 0 16 and 0 84 normalized divided by maximum concentrations hester et al 2021 marzadri et al 2016 santizo et al 2020 at 3 5 cm depth in the sand model row 14 and then calculating their spatial separation normalized values of 0 16 and 0 84 are frequently used to delineate plumes and can be derived from gaussian dispersion theory domenico and schwartz 1998 this method was also used to determine so3 and do tracer mixing zone thicknesses so4 production zone thicknesses were calculated as the spatial separation between the two 0 16 normalized concentrations on each side of the plume the mixing front location for all chemical species was taken as the position of the 0 84 normalized concentration including the location of so4 production which used the descending front right side in fig 1b again at 3 5 cm depth we used the 0 84 normalized concentration for mixing front location rather than 0 16 or 0 5 because it better represents the right hand side of the mixing zone and hence where mixing dependent reaction is initiated than do the other two values peak location and concentration for so4 were also estimated the left and right modflow boundaries of the model domain were no flow the top and bottom boundaries were constant head boundaries that produced the two different sw head drops δh fig 1a of 4 5 cm and 6 0 cm from the experiments the top and bottom boundary heads in modflow were not measured in the experiments but were set to match the observed mixing zone front location for t 3 h after transport conditions reached steady state the transverse dispersivity and the longitudinal to transverse dispersivity ratio in seam3d were also not measured in the experiments and were set to match the observed mixing zone thickness at t 3 h kinetic rate and boundary do concentrations were varied in seam3d until normalized simulated concentrations to the right of the partition matched the laboratory observations of do mixing zone thickness and do concentration profile at 3 5 cm depth model row 14 for both δh 4 5 cm and 6 0 cm again at t 3 h the sulfate production zone front was not calibrated because the spatial resolution of the laboratory experiments was not sufficient to provide precise location of the plume peak or boundaries see fig 3 in santizo et al 2020 in particular the spacing of the sulfate samples was 10 20 mm while the spatial resolution of the do optode data was 0 44 mm effective porosity was set to 0 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis and coefficients a sensitivity analysis of 26 model runs was conducted in modflow and seam3d to determine the influence of model input parameters table 2 on mixing and production zone thickness and front location for na2so3 do so4 and tracer do in this analysis the calibrated models one for each δh were deemed the basecase as they were the scenarios that matched the laboratory experiments the inflow ratio which is the ratio between the upwelling gw flow rate and the downwelling sw flow rate was varied by adjusting the bottom boundary head and values below and above those of the basecase were used the inflow ratio was maintained at values higher than 1 0 since any value below that would indicate a losing condition and a hyporheic flow cell larger than the model domain thus inflow ratio indicates the degree to which gw inflow exceeds downwelling flow rate for a given sw δh the constant head boundaries at the top of the model were not changed to maintain constant sw δh the reaction observed is considered instantaneous due to the kinetic rate however kinetic rates may vary due to different temperature and concentration conditions thus we wanted to observe the impact of a lower and higher kinetic rate on the mixing dependent reaction we calculated sensitivity coefficients to compare the influence of each sensitivity analysis parameter table 2 on changes in mixing production zone thickness and front location relative to the basecase sensitivity coefficients eq 6 were calculated for all parameters and time steps using zheng and bennett 2002 6 x m n y m a n a n y m a n a n y m a n a n a n where xm n is the sensitivity coefficient of the dependent variable y with respect to the mth parameter at the nth observation point do so3 so4 tracer at basecase an is the parameter value for the basecase δan is a change in the parameter from the basecase value and y a n and y a n a n are the values of the model dependent variable obtained for the basecase and for the varied parameter case respectively the values were calculated per parameter changed and per head drop however the maximum and minimum value calculated among all timesteps and head drops was used for the comparison of sensitivity coefficients 3 results our results focus on four main outcomes 1 basecase head and concentration distributions and their match with laboratory experimental observations 2 temporal trends of mixing zone and reactant production zone thicknesses and front locations for the basecase 3 zone front locations from model sensitivity analysis compared to the basecase scenarios and 4 zone thicknesses from model sensitivity analysis compared to the basecase scenarios 3 1 basecase head and concentration distributions and match to laboratory observations modflow and seam3d head and concentration distributions for the two basecase scenarios are shown in fig 2 seam3d results show the hyporheic flow cell with high do concentration 10 mg l red colour upwelling gw below and to the right with low do concentration 0 mg l blue colour and a thin mixing zone between 0 9 mg l fig 2 cdef the do tracer concentration distributions fig 2 cd illustrate a larger zone of mid concentrations i e greenish colors between the oxic and anoxic values whereas in the reactive do concentration distributions fig 2 ef this greenish band has narrowed demonstrating the influence of the reaction on the concentration profiles there was good agreement between model results and laboratory observations fig 3 the observed and modeled profiles were generally in good agreement fig 3a we acknowledge disagreement between experimental and model normalized concentrations particularly for normalized do 1 for δh 6 0 cm which is caused by our choosing to normalize to peak values which for the laboratory results are noisiest at higher values left side of mixing zone in the figure however this approach provides the best match within the region of normalized do concentrations where do mixing zone thicknesses and fronts were calculated i e 0 16 0 84 3 2 temporal trends chemical concentration histories revealed dynamic changes in transport and reaction processes despite steady state hydraulics fig 4 both the do mixing front and so4 plume moved upstream to the left in fig 4 with time as the reaction consumed do from the downstream side from the right in fig 4 the concentration profiles for do limiting reactant and so4 reaction product did not fully overlap the so4 peak was located approximately where do concentrations went to zero and thus approximately half of the so4 plume was in anoxic conditions this indicates that so4 produced was within the mixing zone as so4 production rapidly increased as do concentration decreased the so4 concentration profiles exhibited a gaussian distribution as commonly seen in groundwater plumes the shift upstream with time was seen in both the do and so4 for each δh the 2 h and 3 h profiles are similar indicating balance between kinetics and transport was being approached this match was better i e this transport balance occurred earlier for the lower δh of 4 5 cm when analyzing mixing production zone thickness and front location over time for all chemical species some trends emerged fig 5 first the tracer was constant with time consistent with steady state hydraulics second the trends for zone thickness and front location varied among chemical species for example the do mixing zone thicknesses for the lower and higher sw δh were closer in value to each other than each respective value to another species at the same sw δh the largest relative change over time for either zone thickness or front location was the increase in so4 production zone thickness with time fig 5b probably reflecting the large so4 production in the system there was no so4 in the system prior to the reaction therefore when so4 was produced the zone thickness quickly increased whereas the already established do and so3 zone thickness changed comparatively minimally the so3 change was even less so than the do change likely due to the excess quantity of so3 in the system where so3 consumption had less relative effect on zone thickness the zone front locations changed minimally in all cases regardless of the reaction indicating that hydraulics have a larger influence on the zone front location than reaction kinetics 3 3 mixing and production zone front location sensitivity sensitivity coefficients relative to the basecase table 2 were calculated for each model scenario for mixing front and production zone locations fig 6 overall zone front locations were most sensitive to changes in inflow ratios and relatively insensitive to changes in chemical concentration and λ this makes sense because a primary control on front location is the size of the hyporheic flow cell which is controlled by hydraulics exceptions included do mixing front responding to changes in so3 concentration and so4 production zone responding to changes to the kinetic rate λ mixing fronts moved upstream i e left in fig 1 with increasing inflow ratio for all chemical species fig 7 this is consistent with negative sensitivity coefficients fig 6 and is expected as stronger upwelling gaining shrinks the hyporheic flow cell in addition all chemical species had the same trend with the tracer front position trends falling in line closely with the so4 line 3 4 mixing and production zone thickness sensitivity sensitivity coefficients indicate that mixing and production zone thicknesses were most sensitive to inflow ratio for all chemical species fig 8 the next largest sensitivity was to so3 concentration for do and so3 mixing zone thickness fig 8 ac and to λ for so4 production zone thickness fig 8b these make sense as these are the kinetic parameters reactant concentrations or reaction rates do tracer was only affected by inflow ratio fig 8d consistent with no reaction taking place trends of mixing and production zone thickness versus inflow ratio reveal that the do trend was opposite those for so3 so4 and the do tracer fig 9 in particular as the mixing zone thickness for do increased with inflow ratio the mixing zone thicknesses of so3 and do tracer as well as production thickness of so4 all decreased the fact that increasing do mixing zone thickness corresponded with decreasing so4 production zone thickness indicates that with a decreased so4 production there was more do in the mixing zone in other words the so3 reaction consumes do in such a spatial pattern that it decreases the mixing zone thickness further the magnitude of the trend for do mixing zone thickness was larger than those of so3 and do tracer the thickness value also differed based on chemical species where so4 production thickness was in general double the value of the so3 and do tracer the smallest mixing zone thickness was for do most likely due to do being a limiting reactant and therefore having sharp concentration gradients in addition the so3 and do tracer trends overlapped each other likely due to the fact so3 is in such excess that it is not changed by changing inflow ratios how the do mixing zone thickness may be influenced by mass consumption and production is discussed in section 4 3 4 discussion and analysis 4 1 temporal evolution of reactive mixing zones mass consumption and production exhibited temporal dynamics fig 10 do consumption began at 0 5 1 0 h and leveled off at 1 5 h fig 10 a b as a result cumulative consumption increased linearly from 1 5 h until the end of the experiment fig 10a mixing zone thickness also leveled off but perhaps slightly later by 2 h fig 5b confirming that do mixing zone thickness responded to do consumption so4 production rate cumulative production and production thickness followed very similar trends figs 10c d 5b again confirming that so4 production zone thickness responded to so4 production itself consumption rate production rate and thicknesses thus achieved steady state with time which likely requires steady state hydraulics and or short reaction timescales we expect this is a general finding that applies to other chemical species reactions in particular contaminants and their attenuation in the hyporheic zone while temporal aspects of abiotic mixing dependent reactions were explored in our earlier laboratory study santizo et al 2020 simulations in this study allowed more complete analysis of how variations in concentration kinetic rate and hydraulics affect mixing and production zones over time figs 4 5 and 10 particularly the relationship between mixing and production zones for example this study showed that production zone thickness is larger than mixing zone thickness which was not fully captured in santizo et al 2020 this study confirms tentative conclusions in santizo et al 2020 that even in the presence of steady state hydraulics transport and reaction processes create dynamic evolution of concentration patterns that influence hyporheic zone processes figs 4 5 and 10 as reactions occur concentration gradients shift potentially influencing the extent of surface water derived oxic zones this transiency in transport and reaction influences potential for natural attenuation of contaminants and would be further enhanced with unsteady flowrates and sediment heterogeneity unsteady hydraulics in surface water and groundwater are ubiquitous and would move the mixing zone and potentially enhance mixing with more solutes coming in contact with one another hester et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 spatial heterogeneity of grain size distribution sediment hydraulic conductivity carbon sources or microbial populations are also widespread and may create microzones or hotspots which affect residence times and reactant availability harvey et al 2013 newcomer et al 2018 roy chowdhury et al 2020 previous studies fox et al 2016 galloway et al 2019 su et al 2020 wolke et al 2020 have shown how transport transiency and heterogeneity affect hyporheic processes but not specifically mixing dependent reactions one exception was hester et al 2019 but their model was not calibrated against laboratory data and did not analyze temporal evolution of mixing and reaction zones in detail moreover do is a major biogeochemical driver of hyporheic chemistry which is frequently a limiting reactant the temporal variations in do concentrations and mixing zones shown here fig 4 are therefore relevant to understanding how do concentration profiles are shifted depleted and consumed in the hyporheic zone do mixing zone thickness fig 5b and consumption fig 10a b steadied out with time as the simulations progressed similar to santizo et al 2020 these temporal trends indicate potential behavior changes in the system that could influence other redox reactions such of those involving nutrients or metals finally it is important to note that the location of high do concentration at a given point in time is not where the most so4 production is occurring or has occurred but rather where minimal so4 production has occurred conversely the location of the so4 production peak at any given time reflects the location where significant do has been consumed in the past this spatiotemporal aspect of reactive mixing zone dynamics has direct relevance to how field measurements are done particularly how areas of analysis and observation are chosen and used to determine chemical concentrations and reactions taking place santizo et al 2020 fig 6 therefore understanding how hyporheic exchange and flowpaths are influenced by the reactions and chemical concentrations may allow more accurate spatial targeting of chemical gradient characterization 4 2 dimensionless analysis we used dimensionless analysis to quantify the relative balance of advection dispersion and reaction processes occurring along the mixing zone between the hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater we used modpath pollock 2016 to determine the mixing zone length from the stagnation point at the bottom left of the hyporheic flow cell fig 1 to a point 3 5 cm below the top of the sediment we also obtained porewater velocities vp along that mixing zone which increased from zero at the stagnation point for each scenario a single particle was initiated at the bottom of the hyporheic flow cell were the flow cell meets the no flow boundary this allowed

which transport process was dominant with pe 1 indicating advection dominated while pe 1 indicating dispersion dominated da similarly quantified whether the reaction was transport dispersion da 1 or kinetic da 1 limited we expected all the experiment runs to be in the advection dominated regime based on santizo et al 2020 and hester et al 2021 which was confirmed by pe always 100 fig 11 ab this is consistent with thin mixing zones because solutes have little time to disperse through the porous media high pe is in turn consistent with high da i e da always 105 fig 11 cd indicating reaction limitation by slow transport by dispersion because l is used to calculate pe and da mixing front location fig 11 bd was a more important control than concentration or zone thickness fig 11 ac pe and da generally increased as the front position location moved downstream probably due to increasing l which appeared to outweigh changes in vp or λ the increase in pe and da is not as significant for the model domain as a whole since the values all still showed advection dominated conditions and the trends stay fairly constant for the zone thickness and zone front location fig 5 however the mixing front location and l are dependent on the inflow ratio thus showing the influence of inflow ratio on dimensionless values as well similar to the inflow ratio trends fig 9 do showed opposite trends from so3 and so4 where do mixing zone thickness decreased with increasing so3 mixing zone thickness and so4 production zone thickness however the changes to zone thickness with increasing pe or da are not as large as those for inflow ratio compare figs 9 and 11 this was not surprising considering that the inflow ratios show similar trends with the mixing zone thickness varying by 0 5 cm for each chemical species as the inflow ratio was varied similar to the inflow ratio the zone front locations were influenced by changes in mixing lengths along the hyporheic flow cell where mixing front locations increased with pe and da 4 3 mass consumption and production mass analysis was completed to determine whether there was a relationship between mass consumed produced and mixing production zone thickness such relationships could help interpret reaction processes based on more practical system observations such as zone thickness this analysis was not possible in the original lab study santizo et al 2020 due to insufficient mass balance data highlighting the value of this analysis the relationships between inflow ratio and the rates of so4 mass production and do mass consumption were complicated fig 12 there was a weak overall decrease in consumption production as sw δh decreased from 6 0 cm to 4 5 cm inflow ratio correspondingly increased indicating an overall weak trend of decreasing consumption production with increasing inflow ratio these trends are consistent with the instantaneous nature of the reaction and the excess of so3 which together allow the extra do advecting in from the sw boundary in lower inflow ratio higher sw δh conditions to fully react despite the shorter residence times along the mixing zone this illustrates the importance of having matching timescales between transport and kinetics to maximize natural attenuation as the relatively small change in sw δh 1 5 cm produced a molar factor of 1 6 difference in so4 produced the higher do mass consumption and so4 mass production at lower inflow ratios fig 12 may explain why the do mixing zone thickness was smaller for the lower inflow ratios than the higher inflow ratios fig 9 along with the overall trend with sw δh there was also a trend within the cluster of inflow ratios corresponding to each sw δh for both sets of inflow ratios the consumption and production rates increased with increasing inflow ratio the increase in rates was most noticeable with the cluster of lower inflow ratios that corresponds to the larger sw δh of 6 0 cm therefore in the analysis of consumption and production rates the values were most dependent on the surface water δh contrary to the zone thickness which was most sensitive to inflow ratio fig 8 surface water δh also played an important role in the relationships between zone thickness and consumption and production rates fig 13 do mixing zones were thicker and so4 production zones were thinner for lower δh black symbols than for higher δh red symbols this trend corresponds to larger production for higher δh lower inflow ratios despite smaller residence times thus showing that larger do consumption corresponds to sharper do gradients and therefore thinner mixing zones thus we hypothesize that reaction rates and therefore reactive consumption control mixing zone thickness this indicates potential for simpler field metrics like mixing zone thickness to act as surrogate for more challenging field metrics such as contaminant flux or consumption yet we acknowledge that the opposite may also be true i e that thinner mixing zones allow faster mixing dependent reaction to occur due to steeper concentration gradients in end it is likely that both are occurring simultaneously within the cluster of inflow ratios for each δh we also saw a small trend of increasing average do consumption rate with increasing average mixing zone thickness fig 13a do consumption and so4 production are of course themselves related fig 12 with an approximate 1 6 m ratio do consumed to so4 produced regardless of inflow ratio as determined through stoichiometric analysis 5 novelty and limitations our results expand our understanding of transport and reaction processes behind mixing dependent reaction dynamics observed during steady state hyporheic zone hydraulics we conceptually link the evolution of mixing dependent reactions to readily observable mixing zone parameters such as mixing zone thickness and mixing front location we matched the model to the laboratory observations of do mixing zone thickness and mixing front location the model then allowed us to calculate mixing or production zone thickness for so3 so4 and a do tracer which enhances our understanding of how mixing zones differ based on chemical species concentration gradient and mass flux inflow ratio of groundwater to surface water inflow rate was a key control leading to improved understanding of how both hydraulic and reaction parameters influence mixing dependent reaction in the hyporheic zone this indicates that the balance between upwelling and downwelling flowpaths is crucial to optimize attenuation prior studies focused on hydraulic influences on hyporheic mixing and mixing dependent reactions which this study complements through basic insights regarding the influence of reaction kinetics chiogna et al 2012 observed the relationship between mixing and reactions in porous media in ways more specific to deeper aquifers they quantified mixing on the margins of reactive plumes using flux related dilution index which aided in interpreting reaction processes in this study we quantify mixing in the hyporheic flow cell using mixing production zone thickness and front locations and they gave us insight into how mixing influences reaction processes thus they can also provide useful information on reactions this study focused on simulating and interpreting a specific prior laboratory experiment an important extension of this work would be varying hydraulic conductivity and introducing spatial heterogeneity we expect a potentially large influence of heterogeneity on flow fields mixing and reaction kinetics bandopadhyay et al 2017 li et al 2017 navel et al 2011 roy chowdhury et al 2020 however basic relationships among mixing production zone thickness fronts and chemical transformations would likely remain the same due the inflow ratio having the largest influence su et al 2020 showed the largest impact on mixing to be upwelling groundwater rather than heterogeneity consistent with inflow ratio being a dominant control that emerged from our results while the abiotic mixing dependent reaction evaluated here provides useful insight into mixing production zone thickness and reaction kinetics abiotic reactions are simple compared to the complexity of biotically mediated reactions for example our abiotic reaction was instantaneous and first order which makes it simplistic and ideal for observation yet because prior analyses of mixing dependent reactions and their influence on attenuation in the hyporheic zone are rare starting from this simple reference point provides fundamental insights and interpretations that build understanding that is useful for future analyses of more complex biotic mixing dependent reactions thus many of our methods and calculations can be applied to understanding biotic mixing dependent reactions and natural attenuation in the hyporheic zone 6 conclusions mixing can enhance natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants in the hyporheic zone as they upwell toward surface water bodies here we numerically simulated prior laboratory experiments in santizo et al 2020 of abiotic mixing dependent reactions of sodium sulfite so3 in upwelling groundwater and dissolved oxygen do in surface water downwelling into the hyporheic zone to create sodium sulfate so4 in the mixing zone this reaction is not common in hyporheic zones in the field but can be viewed as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance hyporheic hydraulics were maintained at two different steady state conditions i e two surface water head drops δh that drove hyporheic exchange while chemical transport and reaction were simulated for the 3 h duration of the laboratory experiments do so3 and so4 concentrations were varied in a sensitivity analysis reaction kinetic rate and groundwater constant head were also varied to determine their influence on mixing dependent reaction extent of mixing dependent reaction was quantified via mixing production zone thicknesses 16 84 normalized concentration and mixing production zone front locations 84 normalized concentration position results show that under steady state hydraulics mixing production zone thickness and front locations varied over time as the reaction progressed figs 4 and 5 a relationship resulted between the do mixing zone thickness and so4 production zone thickness and amount of so4 produced fig 5 the more so4 was produced over time the larger the so4 production zone thickness while do mixing zone thickness shrank as do was simultaneously consumed overall small changes in mixing production zone thicknesses led to large changes in mass consumed and produced fig 12 this indicates potential for simpler field measurements like mixing zone thickness to act as surrogates for more challenging field measurements such as contaminant flux or consumption in addition mixing production zone thickness and mixing production zone front location were most sensitive to inflow ratio upwelling gw to downwelling sw figs 6 and 8 however the effect of inflow ratio on mass produced and consumed was distinct and there was a clear divide at around inflow ratio of 3 e g fig 11 in other words inflow ratios under 3 and over 3 had similar mass production and consumption respectively therefore mass consumption and production were more sensitive to surface water δh than inflow ratio overall this study emphasizes that mixing dependent reactions in the hyporheic zone depend on matching transport and kinetics this underlines the complexity of controls on hyporheic zone attenuation such as inflow ratios surface water δh and chemical concentrations whose variations can either interfere or enhance reactions this is important for understanding controls on attenuation in the hyporheic zone and their implications for water quality management and ecosystem health credit authorship contribution statement katherine y santizo conceptualization formal analysis investigation

1242,mixing dependent reactions occur where groundwater and surface water mix in shallow sediments hyporheic zone and can attenuate contaminants along upwelling flowpaths thus reducing transport to surface water here we used modflow seam3d to numerically simulate prior laboratory observations of a mixing dependent reaction between sodium sulfite na2so3 and dissolved oxygen do to produce sodium sulfate na2so4 this reaction is not common in nature but is used as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance we evaluated how location and thickness of mixing zones and reaction product production zones dynamically respond to variations in hydraulic and chemical boundary conditions and reaction kinetic rate sensitivity analysis showed that location and thickness of mixing zones and reactant production zones were most sensitive to changes in the balance of hydrologic inflow from groundwater and surface water inflow ratio mixing zone thickness for reactive do calibrated to experimental data was thinner than that for the do tracer identical source location and concentration as do but conservative tracer indicating that as do is consumed its mixing zone narrows the so4 production zone was consistently thicker than the do mixing zone small changes in mixing production zone thicknesses were linked to large changes in mass consumed and produced indicating the potential for simpler field metrics like thickness to act as surrogates for more challenging measurements such as contaminant flux or consumption in monitoring natural attenuation this study improves understanding of the evolution of hyporheic mixing dependent reaction zones that occur even under steady state hydraulics emphasizing their complex controls keywords surface water groundwater interaction mixing zone thickness production zone thickness dispersion dissolved oxygen 1 introduction the hyporheic zone occurs where surface water and groundwater interact below or adjacent to stream and riverbeds it is a key interface within the river corridor where important chemical reactions occur in the presence of unique biological communities mixing along subsurface flowpaths is an important process that influences contaminant attenuation in the hyporheic zone bandopadhyay et al 2018 hester et al 2014 2017 li et al 2017 mixing of source waters is particularly important for upwelling groundwater contaminant plumes which may undergo natural attenuation via mixing dependent mixing controlled reactions in the hyporheic zone and thus protect surface water boano et al 2018 conant et al 2004 ellis and rivett 2007 freitas et al 2015 hester et al 2014 2019 krause et al 2013 weatherill et al 2019 controls on natural attenuation of upwelling pollutants in the hyporheic zone have been of growing interest including how such attenuation may be enhanced for example weatherill et al 2019 observed that areas where nitrate plumes had already denitrified were more favorable to reductive dechlorination of upwelling chlorinated ethenes due to lowered redox potential similarly burke et al 2014 studied temperature dependent attenuation of micropollutants and showed that the presence of colder surface water allowed for deeper penetration of oxygen rich water into the subsurface this in turn aided oxic dependent attenuation as the mixing of the oxic water and micropollutants enhanced reactions and mass consumption finally krause et al 2013 showed the greatest denitrification in upwelling groundwater occurred where low hydraulic conductivity led to higher residence times which allowed for longer mixing times and hence do depletion these studies demonstrate that attenuation may be dependent on mixing of solutes that provide ideal location for reactions to occur given the importance of mixing dependent reactions for natural attenuation of upwelling contaminants in the hyporheic zone analysis of variables that influence hyporheic mixing processes is an important area of study previous studies have shown that key parameters that enhance mixing and therefore mixing dependent reactions include heterogeneity transiency and residence times bandopadhyay et al 2018 hester et al 2013 2014 2019 for example hester et al 2014 employed a numerical model to study mixing dependent denitrification in the hyporheic zone and observed that mixing zone thickness was relatively small with values of approximately 1 cm a follow up study showed that surface water fluctuations increased mixing dependent reaction of denitrification by roughly 80 hester et al 2019 su et al 2020 used a stochastic approach to determine that surface water velocity and groundwater flux were more influential than heterogeneity at inducing hyporheic mixing while these studies show the relative importance of physical parameters on mixing dependent reactions in the hyporheic zone the influence of transport variables such as reactant concentrations and kinetic rates have received less attention herzog et al 2016 herzog et al 2018 herzog et al 2016 in particular evaluated the effects of kinetic rate and residence time yet did not quantitatively evaluate mixing and mass transformation in spatially detailed ways further many prior studies have focused on the overall influence of controlling parameters but have not carefully evaluated the dynamic evolution of reactive hyporheic mixing zones over time including how that informs knowledge of process finally the relationship between mixing and attenuation in the hyporheic zone has not been fully explored chiogna et al 2011 2012 rolle et al 2013 the dilution index quantifies irreversible mixing by determining how the volume of water that a given parcel of solute occupies increases over time kitanidis 1994 chiogna et al 2012 introduced the flux related dilution index which applied to the particular case where a plume emanates from a constant ongoing source they concluded that the flux related dilution index varied based on the progression of the reactive plume without having to know the location of concentration distributions however the flux related dilution index may be hard to obtain from field and laboratory experiments as it relies on detailed knowledge of location and magnitude of mass fluxes in comparison mixing zone thicknesses and locations are practical measurements of mixing that can be more readily taken in field laboratory and modeling experiments using these measurements to relate field or lab observations of mixing to dilution index mass flux or consumption can clarify what processes are occurring and therefore what may enhance attenuation in this study we aimed to expand on our understanding of the influence of kinetic and hydraulic parameters on mixing and mixing dependent reactions in a model simulated hyporheic zone based on laboratory observations from santizo et al 2020 described further in section 2 below our specific objectives were to 1 simulate mixing dependent abiotic reaction observed in laboratory data from santizo et al 2020 2 quantify variation in the location and thickness of both reactant mixing zones and resulting production zones of mixing dependent reaction products in response to variations in controlling factors 3 determine the relative influence of such controlling factors through sensitivity coefficients and 4 analyze the relationship between mixing and production zone thicknesses and mass consumed produced 2 methods we used modflow to simulate hyporheic flow and seam3d to simulate hyporheic solute transport and reaction as described in more detail in the subsequent sections the model was calibrated to the laboratory experiments of santizo et al 2020 a sensitivity analysis was then performed to determine relative effects of controlling factors 2 1 model domain and governing equations we designed the model domain to simulate the laboratory experimental set up from santizo et al 2020 where a mixing dependent reaction occurred in shallow submerged sediments between a hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater the experimental reaction eq 1 was of sodium sulfite na2so3 with dissolved oxygen do to form sodium sulfate na2so4 1 na 2 so 3 1 2 o 2 na 2 so 4 this reaction is not expected to be common in nature but rather was intended as a simple abiotic reaction representing do consumption in shallow sediments with reaction products that could easily be measured in a laboratory setting the experiments represented conditions where curved transverse mixing zones occur in shallow aquatic or marine sediments between advected surface water and upwelling groundwater as induced by bedforms or structures azinheira et al 2014 cardenas and wilson 2007 lautz and siegel 2006 thibodeaux and boyle 1987 the purpose of the experiments was to understand how such mixing zones evolve in unprecedented spatial detail using dissolved oxygen planar optodes and evaluate the effects of controlling factors such as hydraulic boundary conditions the flow cell in the laboratory experiments was driven by two different head drops in the surface water boundary condition δh fig 1a which represented the variation in pressure along the sediment water interface induced by such bedforms and structures the values of δh in the experiments spanned the range that was physically possible in the experimental setup and were within the range of values observed in prior lab and field studies elliott and brooks 1997 endreny et al 2011 hester and doyle 2008 the model domain for the current study encompassed the experimental sand box and a vertical in stream partition from santizo et al 2020 red dashed box in fig 1a the model domain was 80 cm by 43 cm by 10 cm with the partition placed 20 cm from the left boundary and to 6 cm depth in the sand modflow hughes et al 2017 was used to simulate groundwater flow occurring in the laboratory experimental setup modflow solves the 3d groundwater equation eq 2 2 x i k ii h x i w s s h t using a finite difference method where k ii is hydraulic conductivity l t in the direction of respective cartesian coordinate axes x i l h is the piezometric head l w is a source sink term t 1 s s is specific storage l 1 and t is time t we used the 3d sequential electron acceptor model seam3d widdowson et al 2002 to numerically model solute transport and reaction in groundwater the reaction in santizo et al 2020 was the abiotic mixing dependent reaction of sodium sulfite na2so3 from gw with dissolved oxygen do from sw to produce sodium sulfate na2so4 in the mixing zone this reaction was chosen by santizo et al 2020 for its use of oxygen as its electron acceptor like many hyporheic reactions as well as its simple kinetics this reaction is not common in nature but is used as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance seam3d simulated the three reactive chemical species plus a do tracer i e conservative tracer entering the model at the same location and concentration as the reactive do to compare mixing dependent reaction to non reactive mixing seam3d incorporates the modflow cell by cell flow output to solve the advection dispersion and reaction equation in groundwater eq 3 3 θ c k t x i θ d ij c k x j x i θ v i c k w c s k r 4 d ij d m v i α ij where θ is the porosity dimensionless c k is concentration of dissolved component k ml 3 t is time t x i j is distance along respective cartesian coordinate axes l d ij is the hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient tensor eq 4 l2t 1 where dm is the molecular diffusion l2t 1 and αij is the dispersivity l v i is linear pore water velocity lt 1 c s k is the source sink flux concentration for constituent k ml 3 and r is the chemical reaction term ml 3 t 1 in this case the chemical reaction term is the abiotic first order reaction of na2so3 and do to na2so4 which takes the form of eq 5 5 r λ c do where λ is the reaction kinetic rate constant t 1 and cdo is concentration of do ml 3 the cell grid size for both modflow and seam3d was 0 0025 m by 0 0025 m by 0 10 m several grid sizes were tested for accuracy in matching observed values and minimizing numerical dispersion the chosen grid size balanced these concerns against run times larger grid sizes had too much numerical dispersion and run times for smaller grid sizes were too long given minimal improvement in matching observed values eqs 2 and 3 are the general 3d case but in this study we simulated the laboratory set up in 2d fig 1 the model simulated a 3 h period that matched the experiments in the experiments the first two hours entailed observations of dynamic evolution of transport and reaction zones which are simulated and evaluated in the present study and the third hour was used for reaction imaging and sampling of steady state transport conditions which were used for calibration purposes in the present study in this study modflow was run in steady state mode and seam3d simulated dynamic transient transport with a timestep of 5 9 10 6 days 0 51 s 2 2 model inputs calibration and outputs input parameters for modflow and seam3d were initially determined from the laboratory experimental data of santizo et al 2020 and then certain parameters were varied slightly during calibration until the mixing thickness and front location for the two different experimental δh conditions matched the laboratory observations fig 1a table 1 the calibration process was manual because the parameter values were heavily constrained by observation data from the experiments note that while measurements of so4 and do were taken at slightly different depths in the experiments of santizo et al 2020 fig 1 for the purposes of modeling in this study we assumed for convenience that both occurred at a single depth 3 5 cm do mixing zone thickness fig 1b was calculated using linear interpolation to estimate locations of the 0 16 and 0 84 normalized divided by maximum concentrations hester et al 2021 marzadri et al 2016 santizo et al 2020 at 3 5 cm depth in the sand model row 14 and then calculating their spatial separation normalized values of 0 16 and 0 84 are frequently used to delineate plumes and can be derived from gaussian dispersion theory domenico and schwartz 1998 this method was also used to determine so3 and do tracer mixing zone thicknesses so4 production zone thicknesses were calculated as the spatial separation between the two 0 16 normalized concentrations on each side of the plume the mixing front location for all chemical species was taken as the position of the 0 84 normalized concentration including the location of so4 production which used the descending front right side in fig 1b again at 3 5 cm depth we used the 0 84 normalized concentration for mixing front location rather than 0 16 or 0 5 because it better represents the right hand side of the mixing zone and hence where mixing dependent reaction is initiated than do the other two values peak location and concentration for so4 were also estimated the left and right modflow boundaries of the model domain were no flow the top and bottom boundaries were constant head boundaries that produced the two different sw head drops δh fig 1a of 4 5 cm and 6 0 cm from the experiments the top and bottom boundary heads in modflow were not measured in the experiments but were set to match the observed mixing zone front location for t 3 h after transport conditions reached steady state the transverse dispersivity and the longitudinal to transverse dispersivity ratio in seam3d were also not measured in the experiments and were set to match the observed mixing zone thickness at t 3 h kinetic rate and boundary do concentrations were varied in seam3d until normalized simulated concentrations to the right of the partition matched the laboratory observations of do mixing zone thickness and do concentration profile at 3 5 cm depth model row 14 for both δh 4 5 cm and 6 0 cm again at t 3 h the sulfate production zone front was not calibrated because the spatial resolution of the laboratory experiments was not sufficient to provide precise location of the plume peak or boundaries see fig 3 in santizo et al 2020 in particular the spacing of the sulfate samples was 10 20 mm while the spatial resolution of the do optode data was 0 44 mm effective porosity was set to 0 3 2 3 sensitivity analysis and coefficients a sensitivity analysis of 26 model runs was conducted in modflow and seam3d to determine the influence of model input parameters table 2 on mixing and production zone thickness and front location for na2so3 do so4 and tracer do in this analysis the calibrated models one for each δh were deemed the basecase as they were the scenarios that matched the laboratory experiments the inflow ratio which is the ratio between the upwelling gw flow rate and the downwelling sw flow rate was varied by adjusting the bottom boundary head and values below and above those of the basecase were used the inflow ratio was maintained at values higher than 1 0 since any value below that would indicate a losing condition and a hyporheic flow cell larger than the model domain thus inflow ratio indicates the degree to which gw inflow exceeds downwelling flow rate for a given sw δh the constant head boundaries at the top of the model were not changed to maintain constant sw δh the reaction observed is considered instantaneous due to the kinetic rate however kinetic rates may vary due to different temperature and concentration conditions thus we wanted to observe the impact of a lower and higher kinetic rate on the mixing dependent reaction we calculated sensitivity coefficients to compare the influence of each sensitivity analysis parameter table 2 on changes in mixing production zone thickness and front location relative to the basecase sensitivity coefficients eq 6 were calculated for all parameters and time steps using zheng and bennett 2002 6 x m n y m a n a n y m a n a n y m a n a n a n where xm n is the sensitivity coefficient of the dependent variable y with respect to the mth parameter at the nth observation point do so3 so4 tracer at basecase an is the parameter value for the basecase δan is a change in the parameter from the basecase value and y a n and y a n a n are the values of the model dependent variable obtained for the basecase and for the varied parameter case respectively the values were calculated per parameter changed and per head drop however the maximum and minimum value calculated among all timesteps and head drops was used for the comparison of sensitivity coefficients 3 results our results focus on four main outcomes 1 basecase head and concentration distributions and their match with laboratory experimental observations 2 temporal trends of mixing zone and reactant production zone thicknesses and front locations for the basecase 3 zone front locations from model sensitivity analysis compared to the basecase scenarios and 4 zone thicknesses from model sensitivity analysis compared to the basecase scenarios 3 1 basecase head and concentration distributions and match to laboratory observations modflow and seam3d head and concentration distributions for the two basecase scenarios are shown in fig 2 seam3d results show the hyporheic flow cell with high do concentration 10 mg l red colour upwelling gw below and to the right with low do concentration 0 mg l blue colour and a thin mixing zone between 0 9 mg l fig 2 cdef the do tracer concentration distributions fig 2 cd illustrate a larger zone of mid concentrations i e greenish colors between the oxic and anoxic values whereas in the reactive do concentration distributions fig 2 ef this greenish band has narrowed demonstrating the influence of the reaction on the concentration profiles there was good agreement between model results and laboratory observations fig 3 the observed and modeled profiles were generally in good agreement fig 3a we acknowledge disagreement between experimental and model normalized concentrations particularly for normalized do 1 for δh 6 0 cm which is caused by our choosing to normalize to peak values which for the laboratory results are noisiest at higher values left side of mixing zone in the figure however this approach provides the best match within the region of normalized do concentrations where do mixing zone thicknesses and fronts were calculated i e 0 16 0 84 3 2 temporal trends chemical concentration histories revealed dynamic changes in transport and reaction processes despite steady state hydraulics fig 4 both the do mixing front and so4 plume moved upstream to the left in fig 4 with time as the reaction consumed do from the downstream side from the right in fig 4 the concentration profiles for do limiting reactant and so4 reaction product did not fully overlap the so4 peak was located approximately where do concentrations went to zero and thus approximately half of the so4 plume was in anoxic conditions this indicates that so4 produced was within the mixing zone as so4 production rapidly increased as do concentration decreased the so4 concentration profiles exhibited a gaussian distribution as commonly seen in groundwater plumes the shift upstream with time was seen in both the do and so4 for each δh the 2 h and 3 h profiles are similar indicating balance between kinetics and transport was being approached this match was better i e this transport balance occurred earlier for the lower δh of 4 5 cm when analyzing mixing production zone thickness and front location over time for all chemical species some trends emerged fig 5 first the tracer was constant with time consistent with steady state hydraulics second the trends for zone thickness and front location varied among chemical species for example the do mixing zone thicknesses for the lower and higher sw δh were closer in value to each other than each respective value to another species at the same sw δh the largest relative change over time for either zone thickness or front location was the increase in so4 production zone thickness with time fig 5b probably reflecting the large so4 production in the system there was no so4 in the system prior to the reaction therefore when so4 was produced the zone thickness quickly increased whereas the already established do and so3 zone thickness changed comparatively minimally the so3 change was even less so than the do change likely due to the excess quantity of so3 in the system where so3 consumption had less relative effect on zone thickness the zone front locations changed minimally in all cases regardless of the reaction indicating that hydraulics have a larger influence on the zone front location than reaction kinetics 3 3 mixing and production zone front location sensitivity sensitivity coefficients relative to the basecase table 2 were calculated for each model scenario for mixing front and production zone locations fig 6 overall zone front locations were most sensitive to changes in inflow ratios and relatively insensitive to changes in chemical concentration and λ this makes sense because a primary control on front location is the size of the hyporheic flow cell which is controlled by hydraulics exceptions included do mixing front responding to changes in so3 concentration and so4 production zone responding to changes to the kinetic rate λ mixing fronts moved upstream i e left in fig 1 with increasing inflow ratio for all chemical species fig 7 this is consistent with negative sensitivity coefficients fig 6 and is expected as stronger upwelling gaining shrinks the hyporheic flow cell in addition all chemical species had the same trend with the tracer front position trends falling in line closely with the so4 line 3 4 mixing and production zone thickness sensitivity sensitivity coefficients indicate that mixing and production zone thicknesses were most sensitive to inflow ratio for all chemical species fig 8 the next largest sensitivity was to so3 concentration for do and so3 mixing zone thickness fig 8 ac and to λ for so4 production zone thickness fig 8b these make sense as these are the kinetic parameters reactant concentrations or reaction rates do tracer was only affected by inflow ratio fig 8d consistent with no reaction taking place trends of mixing and production zone thickness versus inflow ratio reveal that the do trend was opposite those for so3 so4 and the do tracer fig 9 in particular as the mixing zone thickness for do increased with inflow ratio the mixing zone thicknesses of so3 and do tracer as well as production thickness of so4 all decreased the fact that increasing do mixing zone thickness corresponded with decreasing so4 production zone thickness indicates that with a decreased so4 production there was more do in the mixing zone in other words the so3 reaction consumes do in such a spatial pattern that it decreases the mixing zone thickness further the magnitude of the trend for do mixing zone thickness was larger than those of so3 and do tracer the thickness value also differed based on chemical species where so4 production thickness was in general double the value of the so3 and do tracer the smallest mixing zone thickness was for do most likely due to do being a limiting reactant and therefore having sharp concentration gradients in addition the so3 and do tracer trends overlapped each other likely due to the fact so3 is in such excess that it is not changed by changing inflow ratios how the do mixing zone thickness may be influenced by mass consumption and production is discussed in section 4 3 4 discussion and analysis 4 1 temporal evolution of reactive mixing zones mass consumption and production exhibited temporal dynamics fig 10 do consumption began at 0 5 1 0 h and leveled off at 1 5 h fig 10 a b as a result cumulative consumption increased linearly from 1 5 h until the end of the experiment fig 10a mixing zone thickness also leveled off but perhaps slightly later by 2 h fig 5b confirming that do mixing zone thickness responded to do consumption so4 production rate cumulative production and production thickness followed very similar trends figs 10c d 5b again confirming that so4 production zone thickness responded to so4 production itself consumption rate production rate and thicknesses thus achieved steady state with time which likely requires steady state hydraulics and or short reaction timescales we expect this is a general finding that applies to other chemical species reactions in particular contaminants and their attenuation in the hyporheic zone while temporal aspects of abiotic mixing dependent reactions were explored in our earlier laboratory study santizo et al 2020 simulations in this study allowed more complete analysis of how variations in concentration kinetic rate and hydraulics affect mixing and production zones over time figs 4 5 and 10 particularly the relationship between mixing and production zones for example this study showed that production zone thickness is larger than mixing zone thickness which was not fully captured in santizo et al 2020 this study confirms tentative conclusions in santizo et al 2020 that even in the presence of steady state hydraulics transport and reaction processes create dynamic evolution of concentration patterns that influence hyporheic zone processes figs 4 5 and 10 as reactions occur concentration gradients shift potentially influencing the extent of surface water derived oxic zones this transiency in transport and reaction influences potential for natural attenuation of contaminants and would be further enhanced with unsteady flowrates and sediment heterogeneity unsteady hydraulics in surface water and groundwater are ubiquitous and would move the mixing zone and potentially enhance mixing with more solutes coming in contact with one another hester et al 2017 lewandowski et al 2020 spatial heterogeneity of grain size distribution sediment hydraulic conductivity carbon sources or microbial populations are also widespread and may create microzones or hotspots which affect residence times and reactant availability harvey et al 2013 newcomer et al 2018 roy chowdhury et al 2020 previous studies fox et al 2016 galloway et al 2019 su et al 2020 wolke et al 2020 have shown how transport transiency and heterogeneity affect hyporheic processes but not specifically mixing dependent reactions one exception was hester et al 2019 but their model was not calibrated against laboratory data and did not analyze temporal evolution of mixing and reaction zones in detail moreover do is a major biogeochemical driver of hyporheic chemistry which is frequently a limiting reactant the temporal variations in do concentrations and mixing zones shown here fig 4 are therefore relevant to understanding how do concentration profiles are shifted depleted and consumed in the hyporheic zone do mixing zone thickness fig 5b and consumption fig 10a b steadied out with time as the simulations progressed similar to santizo et al 2020 these temporal trends indicate potential behavior changes in the system that could influence other redox reactions such of those involving nutrients or metals finally it is important to note that the location of high do concentration at a given point in time is not where the most so4 production is occurring or has occurred but rather where minimal so4 production has occurred conversely the location of the so4 production peak at any given time reflects the location where significant do has been consumed in the past this spatiotemporal aspect of reactive mixing zone dynamics has direct relevance to how field measurements are done particularly how areas of analysis and observation are chosen and used to determine chemical concentrations and reactions taking place santizo et al 2020 fig 6 therefore understanding how hyporheic exchange and flowpaths are influenced by the reactions and chemical concentrations may allow more accurate spatial targeting of chemical gradient characterization 4 2 dimensionless analysis we used dimensionless analysis to quantify the relative balance of advection dispersion and reaction processes occurring along the mixing zone between the hyporheic flow cell and upwelling groundwater we used modpath pollock 2016 to determine the mixing zone length from the stagnation point at the bottom left of the hyporheic flow cell fig 1 to a point 3 5 cm below the top of the sediment we also obtained porewater velocities vp along that mixing zone which increased from zero at the stagnation point for each scenario a single particle was initiated at the bottom of the hyporheic flow cell were the flow cell meets the no flow boundary this allowed estimating the transverse dispersion coefficient dt eq 7 domenico and schwartz 1998 hester et al 2021 7 d t thickness 2 v p l where mixing zone thicknesses m are from the do tracer for each constant head combination vp is the velocity of porewater at the end i e at 3 5 cm depth of the mixing length m s and l m is the mixing zone length all at t 3 h i e after steady state transport had been achieved the peclet number pe eq 8 was calculated as haggerty et al 2014 hester et al 2021 santizo et al 2020 8 pe v p l d t where l m is again the mixing length along the mixing zone at t 3 h finally the dahmkoler number da eq 9 was calculated as dykaar and kitanidis 1996 santizo et al 2020 taylor and guha 2017 9 da λl 2 d t where λ is the kinetic rate of so3 oxidation 1 s table 2 pe quantified which transport process was dominant with pe 1 indicating advection dominated while pe 1 indicating dispersion dominated da similarly quantified whether the reaction was transport dispersion da 1 or kinetic da 1 limited we expected all the experiment runs to be in the advection dominated regime based on santizo et al 2020 and hester et al 2021 which was confirmed by pe always 100 fig 11 ab this is consistent with thin mixing zones because solutes have little time to disperse through the porous media high pe is in turn consistent with high da i e da always 105 fig 11 cd indicating reaction limitation by slow transport by dispersion because l is used to calculate pe and da mixing front location fig 11 bd was a more important control than concentration or zone thickness fig 11 ac pe and da generally increased as the front position location moved downstream probably due to increasing l which appeared to outweigh changes in vp or λ the increase in pe and da is not as significant for the model domain as a whole since the values all still showed advection dominated conditions and the trends stay fairly constant for the zone thickness and zone front location fig 5 however the mixing front location and l are dependent on the inflow ratio thus showing the influence of inflow ratio on dimensionless values as well similar to the inflow ratio trends fig 9 do showed opposite trends from so3 and so4 where do mixing zone thickness decreased with increasing so3 mixing zone thickness and so4 production zone thickness however the changes to zone thickness with increasing pe or da are not as large as those for inflow ratio compare figs 9 and 11 this was not surprising considering that the inflow ratios show similar trends with the mixing zone thickness varying by 0 5 cm for each chemical species as the inflow ratio was varied similar to the inflow ratio the zone front locations were influenced by changes in mixing lengths along the hyporheic flow cell where mixing front locations increased with pe and da 4 3 mass consumption and production mass analysis was completed to determine whether there was a relationship between mass consumed produced and mixing production zone thickness such relationships could help interpret reaction processes based on more practical system observations such as zone thickness this analysis was not possible in the original lab study santizo et al 2020 due to insufficient mass balance data highlighting the value of this analysis the relationships between inflow ratio and the rates of so4 mass production and do mass consumption were complicated fig 12 there was a weak overall decrease in consumption production as sw δh decreased from 6 0 cm to 4 5 cm inflow ratio correspondingly increased indicating an overall weak trend of decreasing consumption production with increasing inflow ratio these trends are consistent with the instantaneous nature of the reaction and the excess of so3 which together allow the extra do advecting in from the sw boundary in lower inflow ratio higher sw δh conditions to fully react despite the shorter residence times along the mixing zone this illustrates the importance of having matching timescales between transport and kinetics to maximize natural attenuation as the relatively small change in sw δh 1 5 cm produced a molar factor of 1 6 difference in so4 produced the higher do mass consumption and so4 mass production at lower inflow ratios fig 12 may explain why the do mixing zone thickness was smaller for the lower inflow ratios than the higher inflow ratios fig 9 along with the overall trend with sw δh there was also a trend within the cluster of inflow ratios corresponding to each sw δh for both sets of inflow ratios the consumption and production rates increased with increasing inflow ratio the increase in rates was most noticeable with the cluster of lower inflow ratios that corresponds to the larger sw δh of 6 0 cm therefore in the analysis of consumption and production rates the values were most dependent on the surface water δh contrary to the zone thickness which was most sensitive to inflow ratio fig 8 surface water δh also played an important role in the relationships between zone thickness and consumption and production rates fig 13 do mixing zones were thicker and so4 production zones were thinner for lower δh black symbols than for higher δh red symbols this trend corresponds to larger production for higher δh lower inflow ratios despite smaller residence times thus showing that larger do consumption corresponds to sharper do gradients and therefore thinner mixing zones thus we hypothesize that reaction rates and therefore reactive consumption control mixing zone thickness this indicates potential for simpler field metrics like mixing zone thickness to act as surrogate for more challenging field metrics such as contaminant flux or consumption yet we acknowledge that the opposite may also be true i e that thinner mixing zones allow faster mixing dependent reaction to occur due to steeper concentration gradients in end it is likely that both are occurring simultaneously within the cluster of inflow ratios for each δh we also saw a small trend of increasing average do consumption rate with increasing average mixing zone thickness fig 13a do consumption and so4 production are of course themselves related fig 12 with an approximate 1 6 m ratio do consumed to so4 produced regardless of inflow ratio as determined through stoichiometric analysis 5 novelty and limitations our results expand our understanding of transport and reaction processes behind mixing dependent reaction dynamics observed during steady state hyporheic zone hydraulics we conceptually link the evolution of mixing dependent reactions to readily observable mixing zone parameters such as mixing zone thickness and mixing front location we matched the model to the laboratory observations of do mixing zone thickness and mixing front location the model then allowed us to calculate mixing or production zone thickness for so3 so4 and a do tracer which enhances our understanding of how mixing zones differ based on chemical species concentration gradient and mass flux inflow ratio of groundwater to surface water inflow rate was a key control leading to improved understanding of how both hydraulic and reaction parameters influence mixing dependent reaction in the hyporheic zone this indicates that the balance between upwelling and downwelling flowpaths is crucial to optimize attenuation prior studies focused on hydraulic influences on hyporheic mixing and mixing dependent reactions which this study complements through basic insights regarding the influence of reaction kinetics chiogna et al 2012 observed the relationship between mixing and reactions in porous media in ways more specific to deeper aquifers they quantified mixing on the margins of reactive plumes using flux related dilution index which aided in interpreting reaction processes in this study we quantify mixing in the hyporheic flow cell using mixing production zone thickness and front locations and they gave us insight into how mixing influences reaction processes thus they can also provide useful information on reactions this study focused on simulating and interpreting a specific prior laboratory experiment an important extension of this work would be varying hydraulic conductivity and introducing spatial heterogeneity we expect a potentially large influence of heterogeneity on flow fields mixing and reaction kinetics bandopadhyay et al 2017 li et al 2017 navel et al 2011 roy chowdhury et al 2020 however basic relationships among mixing production zone thickness fronts and chemical transformations would likely remain the same due the inflow ratio having the largest influence su et al 2020 showed the largest impact on mixing to be upwelling groundwater rather than heterogeneity consistent with inflow ratio being a dominant control that emerged from our results while the abiotic mixing dependent reaction evaluated here provides useful insight into mixing production zone thickness and reaction kinetics abiotic reactions are simple compared to the complexity of biotically mediated reactions for example our abiotic reaction was instantaneous and first order which makes it simplistic and ideal for observation yet because prior analyses of mixing dependent reactions and their influence on attenuation in the hyporheic zone are rare starting from this simple reference point provides fundamental insights and interpretations that build understanding that is useful for future analyses of more complex biotic mixing dependent reactions thus many of our methods and calculations can be applied to understanding biotic mixing dependent reactions and natural attenuation in the hyporheic zone 6 conclusions mixing can enhance natural attenuation of groundwater contaminants in the hyporheic zone as they upwell toward surface water bodies here we numerically simulated prior laboratory experiments in santizo et al 2020 of abiotic mixing dependent reactions of sodium sulfite so3 in upwelling groundwater and dissolved oxygen do in surface water downwelling into the hyporheic zone to create sodium sulfate so4 in the mixing zone this reaction is not common in hyporheic zones in the field but can be viewed as a surrogate for mixing dependent do consuming reactions of environmental significance hyporheic hydraulics were maintained at two different steady state conditions i e two surface water head drops δh that drove hyporheic exchange while chemical transport and reaction were simulated for the 3 h duration of the laboratory experiments do so3 and so4 concentrations were varied in a sensitivity analysis reaction kinetic rate and groundwater constant head were also varied to determine their influence on mixing dependent reaction extent of mixing dependent reaction was quantified via mixing production zone thicknesses 16 84 normalized concentration and mixing production zone front locations 84 normalized concentration position results show that under steady state hydraulics mixing production zone thickness and front locations varied over time as the reaction progressed figs 4 and 5 a relationship resulted between the do mixing zone thickness and so4 production zone thickness and amount of so4 produced fig 5 the more so4 was produced over time the larger the so4 production zone thickness while do mixing zone thickness shrank as do was simultaneously consumed overall small changes in mixing production zone thicknesses led to large changes in mass consumed and produced fig 12 this indicates potential for simpler field measurements like mixing zone thickness to act as surrogates for more challenging field measurements such as contaminant flux or consumption in addition mixing production zone thickness and mixing production zone front location were most sensitive to inflow ratio upwelling gw to downwelling sw figs 6 and 8 however the effect of inflow ratio on mass produced and consumed was distinct and there was a clear divide at around inflow ratio of 3 e g fig 11 in other words inflow ratios under 3 and over 3 had similar mass production and consumption respectively therefore mass consumption and production were more sensitive to surface water δh than inflow ratio overall this study emphasizes that mixing dependent reactions in the hyporheic zone depend on matching transport and kinetics this underlines the complexity of controls on hyporheic zone attenuation such as inflow ratios surface water δh and chemical concentrations whose variations can either interfere or enhance reactions this is important for understanding controls on attenuation in the hyporheic zone and their implications for water quality management and ecosystem health credit authorship contribution statement katherine y santizo conceptualization formal analysis investigation

detector was gradually raised to the operating voltage 1600 volt the amplifier coarse gain fine gain and peak shaping time were also adjusted to the desired values rangel et al 2001 after all these settings had been done a period of about half an hour was allowed for stabilization of the system then the energy calibration of the detector was checked by placing 137cs and 60co point sources at the detector axis with a source to detector distance of about 20 cm so that 661 66 kev 1170 kev and 1332 kev peaks could appear in the appropriate channels fig si 1 energy calibration curve shows that straight line calibration curve for the gamma sources 137cs 661 66 kev 40k 1460 kev 60co 1173 and 1332 kev 2 4 3 effective dose calculation this estimates the human body exposure to determine the

decide of toxic metals in amphibian conditions this model s presentation depends on exact factorization strategies that compute profile and source input and is generally used to sort the metal sources jafarabadi et al 2021 it is valuable for gauging information by involving vulnerability as a receptor model and it doesn t need a source profile dash et al 2021 we can analyze the profiles and contributions of metal sources utilizing the positive network factorization pmf model 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace metals in groundwater 3 1 1 trace metals in the groundwater samples the concentration of trace metals mn fe zn ni co pb cd as hg cu li be b v ga sr ag and ba major cations k na mg and ca and anions so4 2 no3 in the analyzed water samples are tabulated in table 1 the f test revealed that each elemental concentration in 11 different sampling points were significantly different p 0 041 f stat 1 876 f critic 1 944 at a 95 confidence level which indicated that the sources of metals are mainly anthropogenic this study revealed that the average concentration of the studied metals was lower than the recommended level set by who 2011 doe 1997 and bis 2012 with the exception of only mn concentration the average mn concentration 667 09 7 481 μg l in the analyzed samples was found be much higher than the recommended limit 100 300 μg l the high concentration of mn can be from the nature such as manganese oxide dissolution carbonates and silicates or the anthropogenic origin such as industrial discharge landfill leaching kohl and medlar 2006 however an elevated concentration of mn might be deleterious for human health who are drinking the mn contaminated groundwater this study also revealed that mn and fe were the dominant trace metals in the study area the concerning metal like pb in some samples was higher but within the safe limit for drinking purposes recommended by the well known guidelines table 1 continuance exposure to these metals mainly through drinking water can lead to chronic diseases thus source appointments for these high concentrations in the groundwater might be interesting for future research in the power plant area elemental concentration for each sampling point could found in supplementary section table si 4 3 1 2 spatial distribution of trace metals the spatial distribution maps were prepared using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to explain the extents of selected trace metals i e pb cr as mn fe zn ni and co in water the study area fig 2 fig 2 demonstrated that pb were found to be the highest in the northern part of the study area the lowest pb values μg l were found in the extended portion of the northwest part though these values were measured to a very small extent in the sampling site spatial variances for cr and as in the study area were found to have increased from the southern to the northern part of the area a scattered distribution was also seen for the spatial extent of fe and co μg l concentration in fig 2 mn and ni showed significant variation in the spatial expression on the other hand north western variation was found for zn in the study area 3 1 3 pollution evaluation indices different pollution evaluation indices i e hpi hei ni cd for the presence of metals in groundwater samples were calculated following the eqs 2 3 5 6 and the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 2 results showed that the heavy metal pollution index hpi was ranged from 8 88 to 20 64 with a mean value of 201 13 it was found that about 81 of sampling sites exhibited a high degree of pollution in groundwater and the rest 19 show a low level of pollution results showed that the heavy metal evaluation index hei was ranged from 6 96 to 20 64 with a mean value of 12 59 about 64 of the sampling sites tw 1 tw 3 tw 4 tw 6 tw 7 tw 9 and tw 10 were characterized as a medium degree of pollution while 9 tw 5 and 27 tw 2 tw 8 and tw 11 sampling sites characterized as high and medium degree respectively in groundwater again the degree of contamination c d was used to determine the metal pollution extent in the sampling sites edet and offiong 2002 islam et al 2016 the result of c d ranged from 15 25 to 3 11 with a mean value of 2 86 pollution category results for c d in this study revealed that 100 of sampling sites were characterized as the high category of pollution occurrence nemerrow pollution index ni was further applied to identify how different heavy metals pollute the groundwater in the studied sampling sites zhong et al 2015 the range of ni for the groundwater samples varied from 1 96 to 10 09 with a mean value of 4 80 it was found that about 100 of sampling sites exhibited a high degree of pollution in groundwater for groundwater the heavy metal pollution index shows a high level of pollution for all locations except tw 2 and tw 11 sampling sites 3 1 4 identification of sources of metals in ground water by pmf model the positive matrix factorization pmf model was applied to more readily comprehend the sources of the parameters and to decide the endowments signal to noise s n values fluctuated somewhere in the range of 2 1 and 9 featuring the great of the information proshad et al 2022 which were categorized as strong three to six variables with 20 base runs and irregular seed numbers were analyzed to get the base distinctions between q valid and q hearty and characterize the ideal component number by setting the quantity of variables to 5 the worth of q valid met on values near q strong i e q valid q powerful 0 95 the pmf results interpretation for each factor profile are shown in fig 3 factor 1 was extremely loaded with fe 54 6 zn 34 7 and mn 27 5 which were ranked 4th 24th 12th respectively based on the quantity of elements in earth s crust the high concentration observed due to flushing dissolution of lithogenic and non lithogenic materials by infiltrating water rajmohan and elango 2005 in general agricultural activities and rock water interaction are the major source for inflated concentration of these metals in the study area therefore factor 1 is regulated primarily by natural rather than anthropogenic factors factor 2 was predominated by so4 2 74 6 fe 37 1 and mn with weak loadings of 27 6 respectively this factor was influenced by a mixed anthropogenic and geogenic sources primary natural sources of sulfate include atmospheric deposition dissolution of sulfate mineral and sulfide mineral oxidation krouse and mayer 1999 anthropogenic sources include power plants coal mines metallurgical refineries and phosphate refineries goher et al 2019 almost all compositionally immature and sub mature rocks contain fe and mn either bound in surface species or as minerals phases chemical weathering induced by fluctuations and meteoric recharge in ph mobilize fe and mn both cation exchange and mineral dissolution factor 3 of the pmf model is characterized by na 44 9 and cr 24 4 and suggests the presence of parameters may be released by leachates of solid waste mineral deposits sewage effluents in the study area it is worth mentioning that the application of fertilizers and contributions from industrial municipal wastewater were the main sources of na and cr respectively the pmf model indicated that na reflects a mixed source of fertilizers and wastewaters whereas cr is sourced from solid waste and wastewaters with the high contribution of zn 65 3 in factor 4 atmospheric deposition of vehicular emissions followed by infiltration into the aquifer caused by surface runoff is also supported by the pmf model the chemical profile of factor 5 is mainly defined by b 59 3 no3 1 47 ni 41 6 li 40 8 b is added to groundwater naturally through water rock interactions and precipitation that incorporate sorption reactions with iron hydroxides and clay minerals demetriou and pashalidis 2012 anthropogenic sources of b and no3 1 to groundwaters incorporate fertilizers and septic frameworks or sewage vengosh et al 2005 metal plating and treating industry are liable for ni and li pollutions chen et al 2019 the spatial dissemination of ni had comparative examples with a few focal points of high focuses found encompass the petrochemical petroleum purifying metal plating and treating industry 3 1 5 health risk assessment possible health for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic metals through oral exposure pathway ingestion and dermal pathway adsorption were estimated for both adults and children the non carcinogenic health risks hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi represent the overall potential health risk through different exposures riginated from elemental abundances of toxic metal oid s in the existing samples at rnpp site non carcinogenic health risks hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi appraisals through oral exposure for eight trace metals viz pb cr as mn fe zn ni and co were calculated and presented in table 3 findings show that the hazard index hi for adults was ranged from 1 9637 tw 11 to 3 7797 tw 2 with the mean value of 3 0516 about 96 of the sampling sites exhibited a medium degree of pollution in groundwater for adults table 3 except the tw 5 sampling site which showed a high level of pollution for children hi was ranged from 3 04 tw 10 to 5 6 tw 5 with a mean value of 3 88 about 64 of the sampling sites tw 1 tw 3 tw 6 tw 8 tw 10 and tw 11 were characterized as the medium degree of pollution while tw 2 tw 4 tw 5 tw 7 tw 9 sampling sites characterized as high and medium degree respectively in groundwater according to usepa 1999 hq and hi value for adults through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows a medium level of chronic while children through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows medium to the high level of chronic risk table 3 on the other hand hi assessment through dermal exposure pathway was found to be 3 0e 01 ranging from 1 8e 01 tw 2 to 4 9e 01 tw 5 this study revealed that about 100 of the sampling sites exhibited a low degree of pollution in groundwater for adults and children for children hi was ranged from 8 6e 01 tw 5 to 3 3e 01 tw 2 with a mean value of 5 3e 01 according to usepa 1999 hq and hi value for adults and children through dermal exposure pathway shows the low level of chronic risk in the study area detailed results could be found in the supplementary section table si 5 cancer risk for lead pb chromium cr and arsenic as consumption from oral exposure pathway through groundwater among the adult and children are shown in fig 4 cancer risk for pb cr and as was found as the mean value of 4 3e 06 adult and 5 52e 06 children 8 1e 05 adult and 1 03e 04 children 3 4e 04 adult and 4 35e 04 children respectively according to usepa 2009 the average cancer risk from pb and cr was found comparatively lower that the threshold limit 1 0e 04 for both children and adults but unfortunately higher for as from the oral pathway it might be happened due to the reason that as level in soil in the study area is comparatively higher rahman et al 2021b however a detailed health risks assessment data for each sampling point for the studied metal could be found somewhere else table si 6 3 2 radionuclides in groundwater 3 2 1 activity concentrations of natural radionuclide the calculated activity concentrations of radionuclides were obtained from gamma spectrometry measurements for 20 groundwater samples collected from in and around the rooppur npp site bangladesh table si 7 three major natural gamma radiation sources were identified firstly radium 226 226ra was the precursor of most of the γ emitting radionuclide identified in the uranium decay series secondly radium 228 228ra was likely the precursor of the isotopes identified in the thorium decay series and potassium 40 40k which accounts for most of the radioactivity which is the third source the observed activity concentration of 226ra for all samples ranges from 1 53 1 11 to 4 9 1 24 bq l with the mean 3 17 1 14 bq l and the activity concentrations of 228ra range from 0 53 0 13 to 1 71 0 43 bq l with the mean 1 11 0 4 bq l for groundwater samples the activity concentration of 40k ranges from 4 81 0 96 to 15 43 3 08 bq l with a mean of 9 99 3 59 bq l for measuring groundwater from the rnpp site fig 5 it can be observed that 40k has the maximum radionuclide activity in the groundwater samples which is similar to the finding in literature joel et al 2019 icrp 2005 though 40k has the low isotopic prosperity it has been reflected as the chief naturally occurring radionuclide causing internal radiations 3 2 2 effective dose assessment the annual effective dose due to intake of 226ra 228ra and 40k was calculated based on yearly consumption of water by adults agreed well with the range of intakes given for the reference man by icrp table 4 where dose conversion factors dsfs for 226ra 228ra and 40k were 0 00028 0 0000062 and is 0 00069 respectively the estimated annual effective dose due to intake of 226ra radionuclide for adults is 0 68 msv y 1 228ra radionuclide for an adult is 0 56 msv y 1 and 40k radionuclide for an adult is 0 05 msv y 1 which is significantly lower than the international commission on radiological protection icrp limits for public and the total annual effective dose is measured as 0 4273 msv y which is under the unscear 2000 allowable limit and does not pose significant radiological hazards to the surrounding area 3 2 3 spatial distribution maps of radionuclides using idw technique the spatial distribution maps for the selected radionuclides such as 226ra 228ra 40k were prepared using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to explain the extents during december in the study area fig 2 b the radionuclides in bq l were demonstrated as 226ra was found to be the highest in the north eastern part of the study area during december subsequently the lowest 226ra values bq l were found in the lower extended part of the western part spatial variances are also found in 228ra and 40k were during the study concentrations bq l are found to have increased from the northwestern to the southern part of the study area in fig 6 south western variation was found for th and u 238 in the study area where both of these radioactive materials showed higher concentrations in the eastern part of the study area 4 conclusion trace elemental mn fe zn ni co pb cd as hg cu li be b v ga sr ag ba na mg and ca concentration was observed in 11 different sampling points at the rooppur nuclear power plant site this study revealed that the average concentration of the studied metals was lower than the recommended level who doe and bis with the exception of only mn concentration the statistical analysis showed that the sources of trace metals at different sampling points in the study area might be anthropogenic as well as elemental concentrations were not homogeneously distributed the special distribution demonstrated that pb were found to be the highest in the northern part of the study area while cr and as in the study area were found to have increased from the southern to the northern part of the area subsequently different pollution evaluation indices i e hpi hei ni cd were applied for the assessment of groundwater quality which indicated that the degree of metal pollution was low to medium level non carcinogenic health risks value for adults through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows a medium level of chronic while children through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows medium to the high level of chronic risk subsequently the average cancer risk from pb and cr was found to be comparatively lower that the threshold limit 1 0e 04 for both children and adults but unfortunately higher for as considering the groundwater quality pollution assessment indices and estimated the potential health risk it has been suggested that groundwater in the study area safe for drinking therefore groundwater samples in the study area should be used for drinking after proper management however a continuous monitoring should be continuing in the study area on the other hand the activity concentrations of 226ra 228ra and 40k in groundwater samples were measured from the roppur nuclear power plant from different locations to analyze their activity concentrations their radionuclide levels their radiological effects and to assess their allegiance with the regulation on national and international level thus collect the data which can significantly be utilized as the baseline for probable change in the groundwater radioactivity level due to human activities this is the foremost detailed study of the naturally occurring radionuclide levels in the groundwater samples in the roppur nuclear power plant bangladesh the radiological measurements of the corresponding radionuclides assessed in the study are comparatively lower than unscear allowable limits the present study revealed that the dwellers are not exposed to any serious radiological complications from water in and around the rnpp site

dominant metals in the study area different pollution evaluation indices i e hpi hei ni c d data revealed that the study area was under a low to medium level of pollution due to the presence of metals in water subsequently non carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks assessments for both adults and children were conducted which indicated that health risk for the carcinogenic metals were below the threshold level except as through oral exposure for both adult and children the activity concentrations of 226ra 228ra and 40k were measured to demonstrate probable radioactivity pollution using gamma ray spectrometry high resolution hpge detector the highest activity concentration of 226ra 228ra and 40k in groundwater samples were 4 9 1 24 bq l rnpp 15 1 71 0 43 bq l rnpp 15 and 15 43 3 08 bq l rnpp 15 among the three studied radionuclides 40k has the highest average activity concentration the radiological indicators referred to the annual effective dose aed is 0 4273 msv yr 1 which implies

directly by the measurement of the gamma ray transitions at 1460 8 kev uosif and el taher 2008 2 3 pollution evaluation indices 2 3 1 single factor pollution index i i a single factor pollution index can help to evaluate heavy metal pollutants and the degree of the harness it is generally expressing as a pollution index that the ratio of the measured value on heavy metal type to the corresponding evaluation standard value 1 i i c i s i here i i the pollution index of the heavy metal i c i actual concentration of heavy metal i and s i evaluation standard value of heavy metal i when i i 1 the content of the heavy metal exceeds the standard 2 3 2 nemerow pollution index ni the ni is presented by the simple and clear mathematical process xiong et al 2019 ni is the comprehensive method to evaluate how the sampling site is contaminated by different metals the ni combines with single factor pollution index the extreme value and the maximum and minimum pollution degree the calculation

with 6 degree of pollution categories like no pollution 0 5 clean 0 5 0 7 warm 0 7 1 0 polluted 1 0 2 0 medium pollution 2 0 3 0 and severe pollution 3 0 bodrud doza et al 2019 2 3 3 heavy metal pollution index hpi the hpi for water samples was evaluated using the following equation described by edet and offiong 2002 3 hpi i 1 n q i w i i 1 n w i where q i the sub index of the ith parameter w i is the unit weight of the ith parameter and n the number of parameters considered therefore the subindex q i of the parameter is determined by 4 q i i 1 n m i i i s i i i 100 here m i the examined value of the heavy metal of the ith parameter i i the ideal value of the ith parameter and s i is the standard value of the ith parameter according s to prasad and bose 2001 the critical pollution index for drinking water is 100 however an adjusted scale using three classes has been utilized in the present study the classes have been separated as low medium and high for hpi values 15 15 30 and

1999 the hei is calculated by the following equation 5 hei i 1 n h c h mac here h c the monitored value of the ith parameter and h mac the maximum permissible concentration mac of the ith parameter the degree of hei was classified into three divisions like low hei 10 medium hei 10 20 and high hei 20 bodrud doza et al 2016 rahman et al 2022 2 3 5 contamination index cd for water quality groundwater is being assessed by estimating the degree of contamination and calculated separately for each groundwater sample analyzed in the form of the sum of individual component s contamination factors exceeding mac maximum admissible concentration therefore the contamination index shows a combined effect of multiple quality parameters which is considered detrimental for drinking purposes the c d can be calculated by the following equation 6 c d i 1 n cf 7 c d c a c n 1 here cf contamination factor for i component ca analytical value for i component cn upper permissible concentration of i component the cd values can be grouped into three categories and that are cd 1 low cd 1 3 medium and cd 3 high nasrabadi 2015 2 4 radiometric assessment 2 4 1 measurement of activity concentration the radionuclides activity concentrations a of the groundwater samples were measured following the counts per second cps for the same counting efficiency after reducing background counts out of the gross counts under the absolute gamma ray efficiency peaks the weight of the sample ω absolute efficiency ε and the fraction of the number of gamma rays emitted pγ knoll 1998 followed by 8 activity a net count per second ρ γ ϵ ω where a activity of the radionuclide bq l 1 pγ the fraction of gamma rays emitted from a particular radionuclide ε absolute efficiency of the detector for particular gamma ray energy emitted from the specific radionuclide of interest and ω weight of the sample uncertainties of the measurements were estimated in terms of standard deviation σ expressed as joel et al 2019 9 σ n s t s 2 n b t b 2 1 2 where ns in time ts measured counts nb in time tb measured background counts ns counts measured in time ts and nb is the background counts measured in time

ray spectrometry analysis the radioactivity concentration of natural and fallout radionuclides of the samples have been determined by a gamma ray spectrometry system using an hpge detector hpge detector was filled with liquid nitrogen at least 12 h before the measurement and the detector system were turned on 15 min before the first measurement of each day the high voltage bias supply to the detector was gradually raised to the operating voltage 1600 volt the amplifier coarse gain fine gain and peak shaping time were also adjusted to the desired values rangel et al 2001 after all these settings had been done a period of about half an hour was allowed for stabilization of the system then the energy calibration of the detector was checked by placing 137cs and 60co point sources at the detector axis with a source to detector distance of about 20 cm so that 661 66 kev 1170 kev and 1332 kev peaks could appear in the appropriate channels fig si 1 energy calibration curve shows that

decide of toxic metals in amphibian conditions this model s presentation depends on exact factorization strategies that compute profile and source input and is generally used to sort the metal sources jafarabadi et al 2021 it is valuable for gauging information by involving vulnerability as a receptor model and it doesn t need a source profile dash et al 2021 we can analyze the profiles and contributions of metal sources utilizing the positive network factorization pmf model 3 results and discussion 3 1 trace metals in groundwater 3 1 1 trace metals in the groundwater samples the concentration of trace metals mn fe zn ni co pb cd as hg cu li be b v ga sr ag and ba major cations k na mg and ca and anions so4 2 no3 in the analyzed water samples are tabulated in table 1 the f test revealed that each elemental concentration in 11 different sampling points were significantly different p 0 041 f stat 1 876 f critic 1 944 at a 95 confidence level which indicated that the sources of metals are mainly anthropogenic this study revealed that the average concentration of the studied metals was lower than the recommended level set by who 2011 doe 1997 and bis 2012 with the exception of only mn concentration the average mn concentration 667 09 7 481 μg l in the analyzed samples was found be much higher than the recommended limit 100 300 μg l the high concentration of mn can be from the nature such as manganese oxide dissolution carbonates and silicates or the anthropogenic origin such as industrial discharge landfill leaching kohl and medlar 2006 however an elevated concentration of mn might be deleterious for human health who are drinking the mn contaminated groundwater this study also revealed that mn and fe were the dominant trace metals in the study area the concerning metal like pb in some samples was higher but within the safe limit for drinking purposes recommended by the well known guidelines table 1 continuance exposure to these metals mainly through drinking water can lead to chronic diseases thus source appointments for these high concentrations in the groundwater might be interesting for future research in the power plant area elemental concentration for each sampling point could found in supplementary section table si 4 3 1 2 spatial distribution of trace metals the spatial distribution maps were prepared using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to explain the extents of selected trace metals i e pb cr as mn fe zn ni and co in water the study area fig 2 fig 2 demonstrated that pb were found to be the highest in the northern part of the study area the lowest pb values μg l were found in the extended portion of the northwest part though these values were measured to a very small extent in the sampling site spatial variances for cr and as in the study area were found to have increased from the southern to the northern part of the area a scattered distribution was also seen for the spatial extent of fe and co μg l concentration in fig 2 mn and ni showed significant variation in the spatial expression on the other hand north western variation was found for zn in the study area 3 1 3 pollution evaluation indices different pollution evaluation indices i e hpi hei ni cd for the presence of metals in groundwater samples were calculated following the eqs 2 3 5 6 and the results of pollution evaluation indices are presented in table 2 results showed that the heavy metal pollution index hpi was ranged from 8 88 to 20 64 with a mean value of 201 13 it was found that about 81 of sampling sites exhibited a high degree of pollution in groundwater and the rest 19 show a low level of pollution results showed that the heavy metal evaluation index hei was ranged from 6 96 to 20 64 with a mean value of 12 59 about 64 of the sampling sites tw 1 tw 3 tw 4 tw 6 tw 7 tw 9 and tw 10 were characterized as a medium degree of pollution while 9 tw 5 and 27 tw 2 tw 8 and tw 11 sampling sites characterized as high and medium degree respectively in groundwater again the degree of contamination c d was used to determine the metal pollution extent in the sampling sites edet and offiong 2002 islam et al 2016 the result of c d ranged from 15 25 to 3 11 with a mean value of 2 86 pollution category results for c d in this study revealed that 100 of sampling sites were characterized as the high category of pollution occurrence nemerrow pollution index ni was further applied to identify how different heavy metals pollute the groundwater in the studied sampling sites zhong et al 2015 the range of ni for the groundwater samples varied from 1 96 to 10 09 with a mean value of 4 80 it was found that about 100 of sampling sites exhibited a high degree of pollution in groundwater for groundwater the heavy metal pollution index shows a high level of pollution for all locations except tw 2 and tw 11 sampling sites 3 1 4 identification of sources of metals in ground water by pmf model the positive matrix factorization pmf model was applied to more readily comprehend the sources of the parameters and to decide the endowments signal to noise s n values fluctuated somewhere in the range of 2 1 and 9 featuring the great of the information proshad et al 2022 which were categorized as strong three to six variables with 20 base runs and irregular seed numbers were analyzed to get the base distinctions between q valid and q hearty and characterize the ideal component number by setting the quantity of variables to 5 the worth of q valid met on values near q strong i e q valid q powerful 0 95 the pmf results interpretation for each factor profile are shown in fig 3 factor 1 was extremely loaded with fe 54 6 zn 34 7 and mn 27 5 which were ranked 4th 24th 12th respectively based on the quantity of elements in earth s crust the high concentration observed due to flushing dissolution of lithogenic and non lithogenic materials by infiltrating water rajmohan and elango 2005 in general agricultural activities and rock water interaction are the major source for inflated concentration of these metals in the study area therefore factor 1 is regulated primarily by natural rather than anthropogenic factors factor 2 was predominated by so4 2 74 6 fe 37 1 and mn with weak loadings of 27 6 respectively this factor was influenced by a mixed anthropogenic and geogenic sources primary natural sources of sulfate include atmospheric deposition dissolution of sulfate mineral and sulfide mineral oxidation krouse and mayer 1999 anthropogenic sources include power plants coal mines metallurgical refineries and phosphate refineries goher et al 2019 almost all compositionally immature and sub mature rocks contain fe and mn either bound in surface species or as minerals phases chemical weathering induced by fluctuations and meteoric recharge in ph mobilize fe and mn both cation exchange and mineral dissolution factor 3 of the pmf model is characterized by na 44 9 and cr 24 4 and suggests the presence of parameters may be released by leachates of solid waste mineral deposits sewage effluents in the study area it is worth mentioning that the application of fertilizers and contributions from industrial municipal wastewater were the main sources of na and cr respectively the pmf model indicated that na reflects a mixed source of fertilizers and wastewaters whereas cr is sourced from solid waste and wastewaters with the high contribution of zn 65 3 in factor 4 atmospheric deposition of vehicular emissions followed by infiltration into the aquifer caused by surface runoff is also supported by the pmf model the chemical profile of factor 5 is mainly defined by b 59 3 no3 1 47 ni 41 6 li 40 8 b is added to groundwater naturally through water rock interactions and precipitation that incorporate sorption reactions with iron hydroxides and clay minerals demetriou and pashalidis 2012 anthropogenic sources of b and no3 1 to groundwaters incorporate fertilizers and septic frameworks or sewage vengosh et al 2005 metal plating and treating industry are liable for ni and li pollutions chen et al 2019 the spatial dissemination of ni had comparative examples with a few focal points of high focuses found encompass the petrochemical petroleum purifying metal plating and treating industry 3 1 5 health risk assessment possible health for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic metals through oral exposure pathway ingestion and dermal pathway adsorption were estimated for both adults and children the non carcinogenic health risks hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi represent the overall potential health risk through different exposures riginated from elemental abundances of toxic metal oid s in the existing samples at rnpp site non carcinogenic health risks hazard quotient hq and hazard index hi appraisals through oral exposure for eight trace metals viz pb cr as mn fe zn ni and co were calculated and presented in table 3 findings show that the hazard index hi for adults was ranged from 1 9637 tw 11 to 3 7797 tw 2 with the mean value of 3 0516 about 96 of the sampling sites exhibited a medium degree of pollution in groundwater for adults table 3 except the tw 5 sampling site which showed a high level of pollution for children hi was ranged from 3 04 tw 10 to 5 6 tw 5 with a mean value of 3 88 about 64 of the sampling sites tw 1 tw 3 tw 6 tw 8 tw 10 and tw 11 were characterized as the medium degree of pollution while tw 2 tw 4 tw 5 tw 7 tw 9 sampling sites characterized as high and medium degree respectively in groundwater according to usepa 1999 hq and hi value for adults through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows a medium level of chronic while children through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows medium to the high level of chronic risk table 3 on the other hand hi assessment through dermal exposure pathway was found to be 3 0e 01 ranging from 1 8e 01 tw 2 to 4 9e 01 tw 5 this study revealed that about 100 of the sampling sites exhibited a low degree of pollution in groundwater for adults and children for children hi was ranged from 8 6e 01 tw 5 to 3 3e 01 tw 2 with a mean value of 5 3e 01 according to usepa 1999 hq and hi value for adults and children through dermal exposure pathway shows the low level of chronic risk in the study area detailed results could be found in the supplementary section table si 5 cancer risk for lead pb chromium cr and arsenic as consumption from oral exposure pathway through groundwater among the adult and children are shown in fig 4 cancer risk for pb cr and as was found as the mean value of 4 3e 06 adult and 5 52e 06 children 8 1e 05 adult and 1 03e 04 children 3 4e 04 adult and 4 35e 04 children respectively according to usepa 2009 the average cancer risk from pb and cr was found comparatively lower that the threshold limit 1 0e 04 for both children and adults but unfortunately higher for as from the oral pathway it might be happened due to the reason that as level in soil in the study area is comparatively higher rahman et al 2021b however a detailed health risks assessment data for each sampling point for the studied metal could be found somewhere else table si 6 3 2 radionuclides in groundwater 3 2 1 activity concentrations of natural radionuclide the calculated activity concentrations of radionuclides were obtained from gamma spectrometry measurements for 20 groundwater samples collected from in and around the rooppur npp site bangladesh table si 7 three major natural gamma radiation sources were identified firstly radium 226 226ra was the precursor of most of the γ emitting radionuclide identified in the uranium decay series secondly radium 228 228ra was likely the precursor of the isotopes identified in the thorium decay series and potassium 40 40k which accounts for most of the radioactivity which is the third source the observed activity concentration of 226ra for all samples ranges from 1 53 1 11 to 4 9 1 24 bq l with the mean 3 17 1 14 bq l and the activity concentrations of 228ra range from 0 53 0 13 to 1 71 0 43 bq l with the mean 1 11 0 4 bq l for groundwater samples the activity concentration of 40k ranges from 4 81 0 96 to 15 43 3 08 bq l with a mean of 9 99 3 59 bq l for measuring groundwater from the rnpp site fig 5 it can be observed that 40k has the maximum radionuclide activity in the groundwater samples which is similar to the finding in literature joel et al 2019 icrp 2005 though 40k has the low isotopic prosperity it has been reflected as the chief naturally occurring radionuclide causing internal radiations 3 2 2 effective dose assessment the annual effective dose due to intake of 226ra 228ra and 40k was calculated based on yearly consumption of water by adults agreed well with the range of intakes given for the reference man by icrp table 4 where dose conversion factors dsfs for 226ra 228ra and 40k were 0 00028 0 0000062 and is 0 00069 respectively the estimated annual effective dose due to intake of 226ra radionuclide for adults is 0 68 msv y 1 228ra radionuclide for an adult is 0 56 msv y 1 and 40k radionuclide for an adult is 0 05 msv y 1 which is significantly lower than the international commission on radiological protection icrp limits for public and the total annual effective dose is measured as 0 4273 msv y which is under the unscear 2000 allowable limit and does not pose significant radiological hazards to the surrounding area 3 2 3 spatial distribution maps of radionuclides using idw technique the spatial distribution maps for the selected radionuclides such as 226ra 228ra 40k were prepared using the inverse distance weighting idw technique to explain the extents during december in the study area fig 2 b the radionuclides in bq l were demonstrated as 226ra was found to be the highest in the north eastern part of the study area during december subsequently the lowest 226ra values bq l were found in the lower extended part of the western part spatial variances are also found in 228ra and 40k were during the study concentrations bq l are found to have increased from the northwestern to the southern part of the study area in fig 6 south western variation was found for th and u 238 in the study area where both of these radioactive materials showed higher concentrations in the eastern part of the study area 4 conclusion trace elemental mn fe zn ni co pb cd as hg cu li be b v ga sr ag ba na mg and ca concentration was observed in 11 different sampling points at the rooppur nuclear power plant site this study revealed that the average concentration of the studied metals was lower than the recommended level who doe and bis with the exception of only mn concentration the statistical analysis showed that the sources of trace metals at different sampling points in the study area might be anthropogenic as well as elemental concentrations were not homogeneously distributed the special distribution demonstrated that pb were found to be the highest in the northern part of the study area while cr and as in the study area were found to have increased from the southern to the northern part of the area subsequently different pollution evaluation indices i e hpi hei ni cd were applied for the assessment of groundwater quality which indicated that the degree of metal pollution was low to medium level non carcinogenic health risks value for adults through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows a medium level of chronic while children through oral exposure pathway in groundwater shows medium to the high level of chronic risk subsequently the average cancer risk from pb and cr was found to be comparatively lower that the threshold limit 1 0e 04 for both children and adults but unfortunately higher for as considering the groundwater quality pollution assessment indices and estimated the potential health risk it has been suggested that groundwater in the study area safe for drinking therefore groundwater samples in the study area should be used for drinking after proper management however a continuous monitoring should be continuing in the study area on the other hand the activity concentrations of 226ra 228ra and 40k in groundwater samples were measured from the roppur nuclear power plant from different locations to analyze their activity concentrations their radionuclide levels their radiological effects and to assess their allegiance with the regulation on national and international level thus collect the data which can significantly be utilized as the baseline for probable change in the groundwater radioactivity level due to human activities this is the foremost detailed study of the naturally occurring radionuclide levels in the groundwater samples in the roppur nuclear power plant bangladesh the radiological measurements of the corresponding radionuclides assessed in the study are comparatively lower than unscear allowable limits the present study revealed that the dwellers are not exposed to any serious radiological complications from water in and around the rnpp site

1244,there has been an increase in marine transportation in cold regions which in turn has led to an increasing risk of oil spills in these areas to better support risk assessment and pollution control of oil spills it is important to have a good understanding of oil transport in the environment this information is essential to manage response priorities and help prepare contingency and mitigating measures this study aims to simulate 3d wave propagation in shallow water with different broken ice aerial coverage percentages to assess the fate and transport of oil spill in a nearshore area under different conditions based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum equations for an incompressible viscous fluid and the volume of fluid vof method that is coupled with six degree of freedom 6 dof model a 3d numerical model of three phase transient flow was developed it was found that the presence of ice makes the spreading of spilled oil slower in the horizontal direction since the ice can build natural barriers to oil movement the higher the ice concentration the slower spilled oil migrates in all directions the maximum oil volume fraction varies with increasing ice coverage on the water surface area the wave frequency the averaged flow velocity and oil properties affect the oil spread extent and the oil volume fraction the dumping effect of the wave due to the presence of ice makes the impact of this factor less critical than those in open water keywords oil spill nearshore ice covered water oil transport cfd 1 introduction the unexpected discharges of oil often pollute the marine environment afenyo et al 2016 chen et al 2020 yue et al 2022 during the three month british petroleum bp oil spill in the gulf of mexico approximately 486 000 t of crude oil were released in 1520 m of water depth mcnutt et al 2011 contaminating 9900 km2 of water wei et al 2014 recently there has been an increase in marine transportation in cold regions yumashev et al 2017 which in turn has led to an increasing risk of oil spills in these areas johansson et al 2013 wang et al 2022 to mitigate the impact caused by oil spills it is necessary to predict the fate and transport of spilled oil brandvik et al 2006 chen et al 2021 ng et al 2014 this is a complex process consisting of evaporation spreading diffusion advection emulsification dispersion dissolution photo oxidation biodegradation encapsulation and sedimentation especially when the oil spill is adjacent to ice feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2015 the nearshore area has shallow water with the temperature wave and tide characteristics different from those in the open ocean in order to build accurate predictive models it is crucial to understand these oil transport processes especially for developing emergency oil spill response strategies anon 2003 environmental modeling can help determine the pollutant behavior and develop the control measures babamiri et al 2020 chang and clement 2013 kochukrishnan et al 2022 sundar et al 2021 accurate models can be used to estimate the transport of spilled oil which can help better predict the potential impacts of oil related impact and develop mitigation measures cai et al 2021 song et al 2022 the current knowledge of the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered waters is very limited compared with that in ice free waters french mccay et al 2017 some studies suggest that ice has little impact on oil transport when ice coverage is below 30 but has significant influence when ice coverage exceeds 70 reed et al 1999 french mccay et al 2017 fingas and hollebone 2003 found that the type of ice covered waters where oil spilled determines how the spilled oil will spread through those water areas ice is a natural barrier to oil movement and will likely further delay the spread of oil evers et al 2004 spilled oil can also transfer many kilometers from where it spilled if it gets encapsulated in or trapped under ice buist et al 2013 fingas 2015 the simulation of oil behaviors has been conducted in some previous studies for example geng et al 2020 reported the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous shoreline aquifers affected by tides there was also the simulation of spilt oil on water surface in previous studies melaku canu et al 2015 it should be noted that the characteristics of nearshore areas are quite different from those of open ocean in a study of oil spilled under broken ice yapa and weerasuriya 1997 expanded the relationship between axis symmetrical oil spread and unidirectional oil spread under broken ice boufadel et al 2018 conducted a numerical investigation to explore the behavior of oil droplets under ice li et al 2013 explored the movement of oil that spilled in ice covered waters through computational fluid dynamics cfd method few studies have conducted cfd simulations taking into consideration the wavy condition in the presence of broken ice a low ice coverage percentage 30 the occurrence of oil spill in a nearshore area and the impacts of environmental conditions the goal of the current study was to simulate 3d wave propagation in shallow water with different broken ice aerial coverage percentages to assess the fate and transport of oil spill in a nearshore area under different conditions 2 methodologies 2 1 governing equations for the volume of fluid model in the current study ice pieces broken ice were treated as rigid bodies that could move freely in response to waves and current the problem was simulated with a volume of fluid vof model coupled with the general equations of rigid body motion six degrees of freedom or 6dof raznahan et al 2021 for incompressible fluids with constant viscosity the governing equations of fluid motions are the reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum and continuity equations given by 1 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i u i u j x j g i 2 u i x i 0 where u i and u i are the reynolds averaged velocity component and velocity fluctuation in the x i direction respectively x i are the space coordinates i 1 2 3 g i represents the gravitational acceleration t p ρ and ν represent time pressure density and kinematic viscosity respectively for turbulence closure the shear stress transfer sst k ω turbulence model based on devolder et al s work devolder et al 2018 was used 2 2 volume of fluid with surface tension the air layer above the water surface which is 50 of the vertical dimension of the domain 2 m was considered the location of the oil spill is tracked in a three phase model using the vof method by considering some oil spills near the water surface the volume fraction of various fluids in the vof model over the entire domain was tracked the volume fraction of the qth fluid in the computational cell was a q when a q 0 it means that there was no water or oil in the cell and if a q 1 the cell was full if 0 a q 1 the cell had a border between the qth fluid and one or two other fluids the interface s between the phases were tracked using the following equation 3 q 1 n a q 1 q 1 2 3 4 a q t v a q 0 where v is the average velocity vector of the cell when the subscript q is 1 2 and 3 it represents the water phase air phase and oil phase respectively the vof permits to consider the impact of surface tension as well as the interface tension between phases and the contact angles between phases and walls therefore continuous surface force models and wall adhesion options were used in this study brackbill et al 1992 the surface tension coefficients used in this research were obtained from previous studies environment and climate change canada 2021 johansson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 2 3 dynamic mesh model and six degrees of freedom solver the problem of time dependent changes in the shape of the flow field due to boundary motion can be solved by a dynamic grid approach ansys fluent can automatically control the volume mesh update at each time step based on the new position of each ice piece to understand the motion of each ice piece in real time ansys fluent theory guide 2013 in this study a mesh deformation test method based on the spring approximation principle and a local cell re meshing method for mesh re generation in the computational region are used it is important to determine the hydrodynamic loads acting on the ice piece at each time step when the motion leads to domain adjustment this helps in measuring the changes in the ice piece s location that determine the new shape of the domain which can be achieved by 6dof ansys fluent theory guide 2013 the governing equation for the center of gravity of the ice is solved by solving in the inertial coordinate system 5 v g 1 m f g 6 ω b ι 1 m b ω b ι ω b where v g corresponds to the vectorial velocity of the center of gravity m is the mass f g is the load of each ice piece s body which may relate to the loads created by the flow ω b is the angular movement of the ice piece

coordinate 2 5 boundary conditions the model domain for the simulations is described in fig s1 each ice piece was treated as a rigid body in this study fig s2 how oil trapped below the ice moves is affected by some factors such as the roughness of the ice bottom the ice concentration the size of the ice cover and the freezing and melting processes beegle krause et al 2013 each ice piece s shape and dimension were considered based on the work done by gjøsteen and løset 2004 the ice piece thickness was about 5 6 cm and the first ice piece was located at a 2 m horizontal distance from the inlet three different ice aerial coverage percentages were taken into account in this study 10 30 and 50 of the water surface area for each ice piece a zero shear stress boundary condition in all directions was set for the ice wall roughness the sand grain roughness height was considered on the basis of the works done by badgley 1965 and fingas and hollebone 2003 the details of initial conditions computational mesh and simulation parameters are described in the previous study raznahan et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ice aerial coverage percentage on the nearshore oil behavior the presence of ice at the water surface has an impact on the fate and transport of spilled oil brandvik et al 2006 to evaluate the effect of the ice aerial coverage percentage a film of sable island condensate crude oil on the water surface with a volume of 1500 cm3 was considered at t 0 at the distance of 0 2 m from the inlet and 0 3 m from the first ice piece the water temperature was 5 c and the average flow velocity was set at 0 5 m s in this part of the study three different ice aerial coverage percentages for the water surface were considered 10 30 and 50 fig 1 compares the transport of spilled oil at different water surface ice coverage percentages when k 1 and 2 it was found that if the k value was kept constant i e a fixed oceanic forcing condition and if the water surface ice coverage percentage was increased from 10 to 30 the movement of oil plume in the x direction would decrease by 10 15 depending on the k value fig 1d e and f demonstrate the transport of spilled oil with k 1 when the broken ice pieces covered 10 of the water surface area the spilled oil reached a 12 m distance from the inlet the reduced oil movement in the x direction can be explained by the fact that the friction action of the lower ice surface led to a lower transport velocity of the oil film compared to the free water surface the increase in ice aerial coverage percentage from 30 to 50 seems to have a negligible impact on the movement of the oil in the x direction the maximum movements of the oil plume in the x direction for the flows with a similar k value 1 and with 30 and 50 ice covered areas were about 11 2 and 10 6 m respectively fig 2 actually the presence of ice made the oil trapped under the ice move toward the seabed in the scenario where k 2 case 9 10 and 11 the difference in the speed of oil spread at different ice aerial coverage percentages was remarkable the spilled oil almost reached the beach area with a 10 ice covered water surface area and was still approximately 5 and 6 2 m away from the beach area for the scenarios where the ice aerial coverage percentages were 30 and 50 respectively fig 1 also shows that when the ice aerial coverage percentage was increased the spilled oil spread with larger variability this variability was significantly reduced in the flow with 50 water surface ice coverage fig 1c and f this indicates that with a relatively large ice aerial coverage percentage the under ice roughness can be a major driver of movement of spilled oil in the water for the transport of spilled oil in the y and z directions for flows with different ice aerial coverage percentages fig 2 demonstrates the spilled oil behavior in detail much of the spilled oil was transported at the initial water surface y 0 m with different boundary conditions but increased ice aerial coverage made the oil move more toward the seabed fig 2b e h k n and q interestingly this spilled oil transport toward the seabed dramatically increased when k 2 as can be seen in fig 2n and q when 50 or 30 of the water surface area was covered with ice and k 2 some oil moved at a 0 2 m distance toward the seabed y 0 8 m in the z direction while the broken ice s presence in the flow with k 1 did not cause a considerable difference in the lateral oil migration decreasing the ice coverage percentage in the flow with k 2 made the spilled oil increasingly more resistant to lateral transport as shown in fig 2o and r the oil film was spread in the z direction from z 0 m to z 1 m the ice aerial coverage percentage affects the volume fraction of spilled oil in the water fig 2 shows the volume fraction of spilled oil in the x y and z directions for different ice aerial coverage percentages with k 1 and 2 the results indicate that the maximum oil volume fraction increased about twofold as the water surface ice coverage percentage increased from 10 to 30 under the same flow conditions however such behavior was not observed when the water surface ice coverage percentage increased from 30 to 50 and when k 1 case 5 6 and 7 the maximum oil volume fraction with a 50 ice coverage percentage was 19 lower than that of the flow with a 30 ice concentration our results demonstrate that compared to open water ice covered water generally reduces the spread of spilled oil in the x direction which is consistent with the findings of the previous studies fingas and hollebone 2003 evers et al 2004 brandvik et al 2006 this is most likely because the presence of ice floes or irregularities under the ice surface creates natural barriers that retard the spread of spilled oil in the water however these results are not completely compatible with those obtained by li et al 2017 and french mccay et al 2017 which indicated that oil transport was practically unaffected by ice areal coverage when the coverage was lower than 30 regarding oil migration in the y direction the results showed that when the ice aerial coverage percentage increased from 10 to 30 more oil trapped under the ice moved toward the seabed specifically for flows with k 2 case 9 10 and 11 these results may be partly in agreement with those obtained by gjøsteen and løset 2004 because in the aforementioned study the impact of the waves was not considered in the analysis and the impact of the ice coverage percentage on oil migration in the y direction was investigated by keeping the oceanic forcing condition the same the current study also indicated that the oil volume fraction and the variability of oil spread changed with the ice concentration a decrease in the ice aerial coverage greatly promoted the dilution of the spilled oil transport in the x and y directions 3 2 effect of the average flow velocity on the nearshore oil behavior the hydraulic conditions play the important role in environmental process analysis di et al 2021 huang and fan 2021 li and li 2020 xu and li 2020 to study the effect of the average flow velocity on the spilled oil spread behavior a film of sable island condensate crude oil was considered as spilled oil the water temperature was 5 c and k 1 in this part of the study three different average flow velocities at the inlet were taken into account 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m s spilled oil spreads like a slim slick covering a large water surface area this is the result of the effects of viscosity gravity buoyancy and surface tension between the phases drozdowski et al 2011 fig 3 shows that an increase in the average flow velocity significantly enhanced the control of the water current on the oil migration in the x direction the maximum horizontal migration distances after 18 s in a flow with k 1 and a 10 ice coverage percentage were 6 1 8 9 and 12 2 m for the flow with u 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m s respectively in the scenarios where 30 of the water surface was covered by broken ice case 2 4 and 6 the difference between the speed of oil spread at different average flow velocities was almost the same as that in the flow with a 10 ice concentration the aerial extent of the oil contaminated zone is another critical dimension of the oil spread vankatesh et al 1990 for the analysis of this dimension figs 3 and 4 compare how spilled oil tends to be transported in different directions and how much the maximum oil volume fraction varies when the average flow velocity at the inlet changes in this study the maximum oil volume fraction in all directions increased more than twofold when the average flow velocity changed from 0 1 to 0 3 m s no matter what percentage of the water surface was covered by the broken ice interestingly when the average flow velocity increased from 0 3 to 0 5 m s for the flow with a 10 ice concentration the maximum oil volume fraction in all directions was slightly reduced but for the flow with a higher ice coverage percentage 30 this amount did not change although the extent of oil spread in the x direction was significantly affected when the average flow velocity was increased in the flows with different ice concentrations 10 and 30 the extent of oil spread in the z direction increasingly changed specifically in the flow with a higher ice coverage percentage when the average flow velocity was changed the oil diffusion in the z direction became greater as the average flow velocity increased the amplitude of oil transport in the y direction at 10 ice cover varied slowly with the mean flow velocity when the average flow velocity was increased as shown in fig 4b e and h much of the oil migration was at the initial water surface y 0 m and increasing the flow velocity made the spilled oil tend to move toward the seafloor these changes in the level of oil migration with the average flow velocity occurred rapidly when the ice covered 30 of the water surface area fig 4k n and q consequently decreasing the average flow velocity made spilled oil transport less diluted in the y direction mostly at the water surface 3 3 effect of the waves on the nearshore oil behavior waves as one of the important forms of ocean motion that can occur from the surface to the interior are necessary for predicting complex oil dispersal processes korea coast guard kcg 2008 to evaluate the effects of waves on spilled oil behavior simulations were conducted by changing the k value 1 and 2 which changed the wave frequency the water temperature was 5 c average inlet flow rate was 0 1 m s and the ice coverage percentage was 10 sable island condensate crude oil bunker c fuel oil and hibernia oil were considered for this section of the study the effect of water on oil is more than buoyancy under the condition of sea waves this means that when the k value is increased the oil will tend to move horizontally rather than vertically and laterally for any type of oil spill a twofold increase in k increased the migration distance in the x direction significantly fig 5 such increase was the highest for bunker c fuel oil hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil experienced the same increase in horizontal migration distance when the k value was changed from 1 to 2 the maximum horizontal migration for bunker c fuel oil sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil with k 1 were 5 9 6 2 and 6 2 m respectively while this amount for the flow condition with k 2 was 10 2 m for all the types of spilled oil the maximum oil distances in the x direction for hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil were similar because the physical properties of these oils are almost the same at the 5 c water temperature this result showed good agreement with that obtained by anon 2011 a comparison of figs 6 and 2 case 1 6 8 and 10 revealed that the presence of ice slightly weakened the wave action this means that increasing the ice coverage percentage from 10 to 30 would reduce the effect of waves on oil spread this result agrees to a certain extent with that of the works done by anon 1987 and singsaas et al 1994 in which dispersion in ice covered water suppressed the effects of waves thus it can be said that although the wave frequency largely affects the oil volume fraction and the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered waters the damping effect of the ice on the waves lessens the impact of this factor compared to its impact on ice free waters in addition fig 6 compares the oil volume fraction and the motion of the oil spill in the y and z directions as influenced by the wave frequencies of different types of oil an increase in the wave frequency made the spilled oil movement more diluted in the y and z directions the maximum oil volume fraction of bunker c fuel oil decreased by 50 from 0 09 to 0 042 when the k value was changed from 1 to 2 while the maximum oil volume fraction of sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil decreased by almost 75 from 0 14 to 0 05 also the extent of oil movement in the y direction increased twofold for all types of oil which means that the spilled oils were more likely to move toward the seafloor regarding the effect of the wave frequency on the extent of oil spread in the z direction it was found that in the flow condition with a lower k value 1 the different types of spilled oil spread less in the z direction the maximum oil volume fraction in the flow with a lower k value was much higher than that in the flow with a higher k value 2 regardless of the oil properties 3 4 effect of the oil properties on the nearshore oil behavior the chemical and physical properties of spilled oil can affect its fate and transport bi et al 2020 density viscosity and interfacial tension are important factors affecting oil spill diffusion emulsification and dispersion fingas 2015 geng et al 2021 in this section two average flow rates were simulated by varying the type of oil 10 of the water surface was covered by ice and k 1 u 0 1 and 0 3 m s and thus the effect of oil properties on the fate and transport of the spilled oil and the volume fraction of the oil were investigated three different types of oils bunker c fuel oil hibernia oil and sable island condensate were used for the analysis bunker c fuel oil density of 0 98 g cm3 viscosity 45 000 cst is a heavy oil with a high dynamic viscosity hibernia oil density of 0 87 g cm3 viscosity of 18 cst and sable island condensate crude oil density of 0 82 g cm3 viscosity 2 cst are lighter oils and hibernia oil has a lower interfacial tension with water environment and climate change canada 2021 figs 7 and 8 show the transport of different types of oil in the horizontal vertical and lateral directions and fig 8 also shows the change in oil volume fraction after 18 s of flow it can be seen that the spilled oils did not show significant difference in horizontal migration when the average flow speed was 0 1 m s the spilled oil spread from a 4 to 6 m distance at the inlet bunker c fuel oil s maximum oil volume fraction was lower than those of sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil 0 09 and 0 14 respectively the results for sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil whose surface tensions were almost the same may be acceptable because apart from being highly viscous oils they will generally spread due to their special surface tension buist et al 2013 in addition the results of the current study are similar to those of zhu et al 2017 where only oil density was taken into account for the horizontal migration assessment and the presence of ice was not considered when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 3 m s bunker c fuel oil moved relatively the slowest which could be because of its excessively high density although its high dynamic viscosity should help it move with the water current regarding the maximum oil volume fraction in the flow with u 0 3 m s it was found that sable island condensate crude oil moved in the x direction with a lower oil volume fraction its density was the lowest among the three types of oil in this study and its interfacial surface tension with water was relatively larger than that of hibernia oil and lower than that of bunker c fuel oil as can be seen in fig 8 the movement of bunker c fuel oil in the y direction was more diluted than those of the two other types of oil in both flow conditions u 0 1 and 0 3 m s because its maximum oil volume fraction was lower than those of the two other oil types and the extent of its spread in the vertical direction was larger than those of hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil this can be explained by the higher density interfacial surface tension and dynamic viscosity of bunker c fuel oil compared to those of the two other oil types the conditions for the migration of the spilled oils in the z direction ultimately looked like those for the spread in the y direction 4 conclusions in this study the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered nearshore waters under different ice concentrations wave conditions average flow velocities and oil properties were investigated the results show that ice is a natural barrier to oil movement and inhibits the spread of oil spills the higher the ice concentration the slower the oil spill transport in all directions the maximum oil volume fraction increased approximately two times when the surface ice coverage increased from 10 to 30 under the same flow condition regardless of the k value consequently decreasing the ice coverage percentage diluted the spilled oil transport the degree of oil spill dispersion and oil volume fraction were significantly affected by wave frequency average flow velocity and oil properties the movement of oil in all directions became faster as the average flow velocity increased and decreasing the average flow velocity would lessen the dilution of the spilled oil transport in the y direction mostly at the water surface increasing the wave frequency twofold increased the distance of migration of the spilled oil in the x direction regardless of the oil properties in addition the damping effect of ice on the waves made the impact of the wave frequency less important than that in open water finally it was found that the horizontal migration of the different types of spilled oil in this study did not show a significant difference when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 1 m s but when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 3 m s bunker c fuel oil moved relatively the slowest and this could be because of its excessively high density the movement of bunker c fuel oil in the y and z directions was more diluted than those of the two other oil types in both flow conditions the findings of this study can help provide a better understanding of oil transport after spills which is crucial for assessing the risks and determining the appropriate response measures the finer mesh resolution and longer period for simulation can be further considered in the future research the

1244,there has been an increase in marine transportation in cold regions which in turn has led to an increasing risk of oil spills in these areas to better support risk assessment and pollution control of oil spills it is important to have a good understanding of oil transport in the environment this information is essential to manage response priorities and help prepare contingency and mitigating measures this study aims to simulate 3d wave propagation in shallow water with different broken ice aerial coverage percentages to assess the fate and transport of oil spill in a nearshore area under different conditions based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum equations for an incompressible viscous fluid and the volume of fluid vof method that is coupled with six degree of freedom 6 dof model a 3d numerical model of three phase transient flow was developed it was found that the presence of ice makes the spreading of spilled oil slower in the horizontal direction since the ice can build natural barriers to oil movement the higher the ice concentration the slower spilled oil migrates in all directions the maximum oil volume fraction varies with increasing ice coverage on the water surface area the wave frequency the averaged flow velocity and oil properties affect the oil spread extent and the oil volume fraction the dumping effect of the wave due to the presence of ice makes the impact of this factor less critical than those in open water keywords oil spill nearshore ice covered water oil transport cfd 1 introduction the unexpected discharges of oil

which in turn has led to an increasing risk of oil spills in these areas johansson et al 2013 wang et al 2022 to mitigate the impact caused by oil spills it is necessary to predict the fate and transport of spilled oil brandvik et al 2006 chen et al 2021 ng et al 2014 this is a complex process consisting of evaporation spreading diffusion advection emulsification dispersion dissolution photo oxidation biodegradation encapsulation and sedimentation especially when the oil spill is adjacent to ice feng et al 2021 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2015 the nearshore area has shallow water with the temperature wave and tide characteristics different from those in the open ocean in order to build accurate predictive models it is crucial to understand these oil transport processes especially for

2013 kochukrishnan et al 2022 sundar et al 2021 accurate models can be used to estimate the transport of spilled oil which can help better predict the potential impacts of oil related impact and develop mitigation measures cai et al 2021 song et al 2022 the current knowledge of the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered waters is very limited compared with that in ice free waters french mccay et al 2017 some studies suggest that ice has little impact on oil transport when ice coverage is below 30 but has significant influence when ice coverage exceeds 70 reed et al 1999 french mccay et al 2017 fingas and hollebone 2003 found that the type of ice covered waters where oil spilled determines how the spilled oil will spread through those water areas ice is a natural barrier to oil movement and will likely further delay the spread of oil evers et al 2004 spilled oil can also transfer many kilometers from where it spilled if it gets encapsulated in or trapped under ice buist et al 2013 fingas 2015 the simulation of oil behaviors has been conducted in some previous studies for example geng et al 2020 reported the simulation of solute transport in heterogeneous shoreline aquifers affected by tides there was also the simulation of spilt oil on water surface in previous studies melaku canu et al 2015 it should be noted that the characteristics of nearshore areas are quite different from those of open ocean in a study of oil spilled under broken ice yapa and weerasuriya 1997 expanded the relationship between axis symmetrical oil spread and unidirectional oil spread under broken ice boufadel et al 2018 conducted a numerical investigation to explore the behavior of oil droplets under ice li et al 2013 explored the movement of oil that spilled in ice covered waters through computational fluid dynamics cfd method few studies have conducted cfd simulations taking into consideration the wavy condition in the presence of broken ice a low ice coverage percentage 30 the occurrence of oil spill in a nearshore area and the impacts of environmental conditions the goal of the current study was to simulate 3d wave propagation in shallow water with different broken ice aerial coverage percentages to assess the fate and transport of oil spill in a nearshore area under different conditions 2 methodologies 2 1 governing equations for the volume of fluid model in the current study ice pieces broken ice were treated as rigid bodies that could move freely in response to waves and current the problem was simulated with a volume of fluid vof model coupled with the general equations of rigid body motion six degrees of freedom or 6dof raznahan et al 2021 for incompressible fluids with constant viscosity the governing equations of fluid motions are the reynolds averaged navier stokes momentum and continuity equations given by 1 u i t u i u j x j 1 ρ p x i ν 2 u i u i u j x j g i 2 u i x i 0 where u i and u i are the reynolds averaged

density and kinematic viscosity respectively for turbulence closure the shear stress transfer sst k ω turbulence model based on devolder et al s work devolder et al 2018 was used 2 2 volume of fluid with surface tension the air layer above the water surface which is 50 of the vertical dimension of the domain 2 m was considered the location of the oil spill is tracked in a three phase model using the vof method by considering some oil spills near the water surface the volume fraction of various fluids in the vof model over the entire domain was tracked the volume fraction of the qth fluid in the computational cell was a q when a q 0 it means that there was no water or oil in the cell and if a q 1 the cell was full if 0 a q 1 the cell had a border between the qth fluid and one or two other fluids the interface s between the phases were tracked using the following equation 3 q 1 n a q 1 q 1 2 3 4 a q t v a q 0 where v is the average velocity vector of the cell when the subscript q is 1 2 and 3 it represents the water phase air phase and oil phase respectively the vof permits to consider the impact of surface tension as well as the interface tension between phases and the contact angles between phases and walls therefore continuous surface force models and wall adhesion options were used in this study brackbill et al 1992 the surface tension coefficients used in this research were obtained from previous studies environment and climate change canada 2021 johansson et al 2013 gao et al 2017 2 3 dynamic mesh model and six degrees of freedom solver the problem of time

on the new position of each ice piece to understand the motion of each ice piece in real time ansys fluent theory guide 2013 in this study a mesh deformation test method based on the spring approximation principle and a local cell re meshing method for mesh re generation in the computational region are used it is important to determine the hydrodynamic loads acting on the ice piece at each time step when the motion leads to domain adjustment this helps in measuring the changes in the ice piece s location that determine the new shape of the domain which can be achieved by 6dof ansys

affected by some factors such as the roughness of the ice bottom the ice concentration the size of the ice cover and the freezing and melting processes beegle krause et al 2013 each ice piece s shape and dimension were considered based on the work done by gjøsteen and løset 2004 the ice piece thickness was about 5 6 cm and the first ice piece was located at a 2 m horizontal distance from the inlet three different ice aerial coverage percentages were taken into account in this study 10 30 and 50 of the water surface area for each ice piece a zero shear stress boundary condition in all directions was set for the ice wall roughness the sand grain roughness height was considered on the basis of the works done by badgley 1965 and fingas and hollebone 2003 the details of initial conditions computational mesh and simulation parameters are described in the previous study raznahan et al 2021 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of the ice aerial coverage percentage on the nearshore oil behavior the presence of ice at the water surface has an impact on the fate and transport of spilled oil brandvik et al 2006 to evaluate the effect of the ice aerial coverage percentage a film of sable island condensate crude oil on the water surface with a volume of 1500 cm3 was considered at t 0 at the distance of 0 2 m from the inlet and 0 3 m from the first ice piece the water temperature was 5 c and the average flow velocity was set at 0 5 m s in this part of the study three different ice aerial coverage percentages for the water surface were considered 10 30 and 50 fig 1 compares the transport of spilled oil at different water surface ice coverage percentages when k 1 and 2 it was found that if the k value was kept constant i e a fixed oceanic forcing condition and if the water surface ice coverage percentage was increased from 10 to 30 the movement of oil plume in the x direction would decrease by 10 15 depending on the k value fig 1d e and f demonstrate the transport of spilled oil with k 1 when the broken ice pieces covered 10 of the water surface area the spilled oil reached a 12 m distance from the inlet the reduced oil movement in the x direction can be explained by the fact that the friction action of the lower ice surface led to a lower transport velocity of the oil film compared to the free water surface the increase in ice aerial coverage percentage from 30 to 50 seems to have a negligible impact on the movement of the oil in the x direction the maximum movements of the oil plume in the x direction for the flows with a similar k value 1 and with 30 and 50 ice covered areas were about 11 2 and 10 6 m respectively fig 2 actually the presence of ice made the oil trapped under the ice move toward the seabed in the scenario where k 2 case 9 10 and 11 the difference in the speed of oil spread at different ice aerial coverage percentages was remarkable the spilled oil almost reached the beach area with a 10 ice covered water surface area and was still approximately 5 and 6 2 m away from the beach area for the scenarios where the ice aerial coverage percentages were 30 and 50 respectively fig 1 also shows that when the ice aerial coverage percentage was increased the spilled oil spread with larger variability this variability was significantly reduced in the flow with 50 water surface ice coverage fig 1c and f this indicates that with a relatively large ice aerial coverage percentage the under ice roughness can be a major driver of movement of spilled oil in the water for the transport of spilled oil in the y and z directions for flows with different ice aerial coverage percentages fig 2 demonstrates the spilled oil behavior in detail much of the spilled oil was transported at the initial water surface y 0 m with different boundary conditions but increased ice aerial coverage made the oil move more toward the seabed fig 2b e h k n and q interestingly this spilled oil transport toward the seabed dramatically increased when k 2 as can be seen in fig 2n and q when 50 or 30 of the water surface area was covered with ice and k 2 some oil moved at a 0 2 m distance toward the seabed y 0 8 m in the z direction while the broken ice s presence in the flow with k 1 did not cause a considerable difference in the lateral oil migration decreasing the ice coverage percentage in the flow with k 2 made the spilled oil increasingly more resistant to lateral transport as shown in fig 2o and r the oil film was spread in the z direction from z 0 m to z 1 m the ice aerial coverage percentage affects the volume fraction of spilled oil in the water fig 2 shows the volume fraction of spilled oil in the x y and z directions for different ice aerial coverage percentages with k 1 and 2 the results indicate that the maximum oil volume fraction increased about twofold as the water surface ice coverage percentage increased from 10 to 30 under the same flow conditions however such behavior was not observed when the water surface ice coverage percentage increased from 30 to 50 and when k 1 case 5 6 and 7 the maximum oil volume fraction with a 50 ice coverage percentage was 19 lower than that of the flow with a 30 ice concentration our results demonstrate that compared to open water ice covered water generally reduces the spread of spilled oil in the x direction which is consistent with the findings of the previous studies fingas and hollebone 2003 evers et al 2004 brandvik et al 2006 this is most likely because the presence of ice floes or irregularities under the ice surface creates natural barriers that retard the spread of spilled oil in the water however these results are not completely compatible with those obtained by li et al 2017 and french mccay et al 2017 which indicated that oil transport was practically unaffected by ice areal coverage when the coverage was lower than 30 regarding oil migration in the y direction the results showed that when the ice aerial coverage percentage increased from 10 to 30 more oil trapped under the ice moved toward the seabed specifically for flows with k 2 case 9 10 and 11 these results may be partly in agreement with those obtained by gjøsteen and løset 2004 because in the aforementioned study the impact of the waves was not considered in the analysis and the impact of the ice coverage percentage on oil migration in the y direction was investigated by keeping the oceanic forcing condition the same the current study also indicated that the oil volume fraction and the variability of oil spread changed with the ice concentration a decrease in the ice aerial coverage greatly promoted the dilution of the spilled oil transport in the x and y directions 3 2 effect of the average flow velocity on the nearshore oil behavior the hydraulic conditions play the important role in environmental process analysis di et al 2021 huang and fan 2021 li and li 2020 xu and li 2020 to study the effect of the average flow velocity on the spilled oil spread behavior a film of sable island condensate crude oil was considered as spilled oil the water temperature was 5 c and k 1 in this part of the study three different average flow velocities at the inlet were taken into account 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m s spilled oil spreads like a slim slick covering a large water surface area this is the result of the effects of viscosity gravity buoyancy and surface tension between the phases drozdowski et al 2011 fig 3 shows that an increase in the average flow velocity significantly enhanced the control of the water current on the oil migration in the x direction the maximum horizontal migration distances after 18 s in a flow with k 1 and a 10 ice coverage percentage were 6 1 8 9 and 12 2 m for the flow with u 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m s respectively in the scenarios where 30 of the water surface was covered by broken ice case 2 4 and 6 the difference between the speed of oil spread at different average flow velocities was almost the same as that in the flow with a 10 ice concentration the aerial extent of the oil contaminated zone is another critical dimension of the oil spread vankatesh et al 1990 for the analysis of this dimension figs 3 and 4 compare how spilled oil tends to be transported in different directions and how much the maximum oil volume fraction varies when the average flow velocity at the inlet changes in this study the maximum oil volume fraction in all directions increased more than twofold when the average flow velocity changed from 0 1 to 0 3 m s no matter what percentage of the water surface was covered by the broken ice interestingly when the average flow velocity increased from 0 3 to 0 5 m s for the flow with a 10 ice concentration the maximum oil volume fraction in all directions was slightly reduced but for the flow with a higher ice coverage percentage 30 this amount did not change although the extent of oil spread in the x direction was significantly affected when the average flow velocity was increased in the flows with different ice concentrations 10 and 30 the extent of oil spread in the z direction increasingly changed specifically in the flow with a higher ice coverage percentage when the average flow velocity was changed the oil diffusion in the z direction became greater as the average flow velocity increased the amplitude of oil transport in the y direction at 10 ice cover varied slowly with the mean flow velocity when the average flow velocity was increased as shown in fig 4b e and h much of the oil migration was at the initial water surface y 0 m and increasing the flow velocity made the spilled oil tend to move toward the seafloor these changes in the level of oil migration with the average flow velocity occurred rapidly when the ice covered 30 of the water surface area fig 4k n and q consequently decreasing the average flow velocity made spilled oil transport less diluted in the y direction mostly at the water surface 3 3 effect of the waves on the nearshore oil behavior waves as one of the important forms of ocean motion that can occur from the surface to the interior are necessary for predicting complex oil dispersal processes korea coast guard kcg 2008 to evaluate the effects of waves on spilled oil behavior simulations were conducted by changing the k value 1 and 2 which changed the wave frequency the water temperature was 5 c average inlet flow rate was 0 1 m s and the ice coverage percentage was 10 sable island condensate crude oil bunker c fuel oil and hibernia oil were considered for this section of the study the effect of water on oil is more than buoyancy under the condition of sea waves this means that when the k value is increased the oil will tend to move horizontally rather than vertically and laterally for any type of oil spill a twofold increase in k increased the migration distance in the x direction significantly fig 5 such increase was the highest for bunker c fuel oil hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil experienced the same increase in horizontal migration distance when the k value was changed from 1 to 2 the maximum horizontal migration for bunker c fuel oil sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil with k 1 were 5 9 6 2 and 6 2 m respectively while this amount for the flow condition with k 2 was 10 2 m for all the types of spilled oil the maximum oil distances in the x direction for hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil were similar because the physical properties of these oils are almost the same at the 5 c water temperature this result showed good agreement with that obtained by anon 2011 a comparison of figs 6 and 2 case 1 6 8 and 10 revealed that the presence of ice slightly weakened the wave action this means that increasing the ice coverage percentage from 10 to 30 would reduce the effect of waves on oil spread this result agrees to a certain extent with that of the works done by anon 1987 and singsaas et al 1994 in which dispersion in ice covered water suppressed the effects of waves thus it can be said that although the wave frequency largely affects the oil volume fraction and the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered waters the damping effect of the ice on the waves lessens the impact of this factor compared to its impact on ice free waters in addition fig 6 compares the oil volume fraction and the motion of the oil spill in the y and z directions as influenced by the wave frequencies of different types of oil an increase in the wave frequency made the spilled oil movement more diluted in the y and z directions the maximum oil volume fraction of bunker c fuel oil decreased by 50 from 0 09 to 0 042 when the k value was changed from 1 to 2 while the maximum oil volume fraction of sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil decreased by almost 75 from 0 14 to 0 05 also the extent of oil movement in the y direction increased twofold for all types of oil which means that the spilled oils were more likely to move toward the seafloor regarding the effect of the wave frequency on the extent of oil spread in the z direction it was found that in the flow condition with a lower k value 1 the different types of spilled oil spread less in the z direction the maximum oil volume fraction in the flow with a lower k value was much higher than that in the flow with a higher k value 2 regardless of the oil properties 3 4 effect of the oil properties on the nearshore oil behavior the chemical and physical properties of spilled oil can affect its fate and transport bi et al 2020 density viscosity and interfacial tension are important factors affecting oil spill diffusion emulsification and dispersion fingas 2015 geng et al 2021 in this section two average flow rates were simulated by varying the type of oil 10 of the water surface was covered by ice and k 1 u 0 1 and 0 3 m s and thus the effect of oil properties on the fate and transport of the spilled oil and the volume fraction of the oil were investigated three different types of oils bunker c fuel oil hibernia oil and sable island condensate were used for the analysis bunker c fuel oil density of 0 98 g cm3 viscosity 45 000 cst is a heavy oil with a high dynamic viscosity hibernia oil density of 0 87 g cm3 viscosity of 18 cst and sable island condensate crude oil density of 0 82 g cm3 viscosity 2 cst are lighter oils and hibernia oil has a lower interfacial tension with water environment and climate change canada 2021 figs 7 and 8 show the transport of different types of oil in the horizontal vertical and lateral directions and fig 8 also shows the change in oil volume fraction after 18 s of flow it can be seen that the spilled oils did not show significant difference in horizontal migration when the average flow speed was 0 1 m s the spilled oil spread from a 4 to 6 m distance at the inlet bunker c fuel oil s maximum oil volume fraction was lower than those of sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil 0 09 and 0 14 respectively the results for sable island condensate crude oil and hibernia oil whose surface tensions were almost the same may be acceptable because apart from being highly viscous oils they will generally spread due to their special surface tension buist et al 2013 in addition the results of the current study are similar to those of zhu et al 2017 where only oil density was taken into account for the horizontal migration assessment and the presence of ice was not considered when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 3 m s bunker c fuel oil moved relatively the slowest which could be because of its excessively high density although its high dynamic viscosity should help it move with the water current regarding the maximum oil volume fraction in the flow with u 0 3 m s it was found that sable island condensate crude oil moved in the x direction with a lower oil volume fraction its density was the lowest among the three types of oil in this study and its interfacial surface tension with water was relatively larger than that of hibernia oil and lower than that of bunker c fuel oil as can be seen in fig 8 the movement of bunker c fuel oil in the y direction was more diluted than those of the two other types of oil in both flow conditions u 0 1 and 0 3 m s because its maximum oil volume fraction was lower than those of the two other oil types and the extent of its spread in the vertical direction was larger than those of hibernia oil and sable island condensate crude oil this can be explained by the higher density interfacial surface tension and dynamic viscosity of bunker c fuel oil compared to those of the two other oil types the conditions for the migration of the spilled oils in the z direction ultimately looked like those for the spread in the y direction 4 conclusions in this study the fate and transport of spilled oil in ice covered nearshore waters under different ice concentrations wave conditions average flow velocities and oil properties were investigated the results show that ice is a natural barrier to oil movement and inhibits the spread of oil spills the higher the ice concentration the slower the oil spill transport in all directions the maximum oil volume fraction increased approximately two times when the surface ice coverage increased from 10 to 30 under the same flow condition regardless of the k value consequently decreasing the ice coverage percentage diluted the spilled oil transport the degree of oil spill dispersion and oil volume fraction were significantly affected by wave frequency average flow velocity and oil properties the movement of oil in all directions became faster as the average flow velocity increased and decreasing the average flow velocity would lessen the dilution of the spilled oil transport in the y direction mostly at the water surface increasing the wave frequency twofold increased the distance of migration of the spilled oil in the x direction regardless of the oil properties in addition the damping effect of ice on the waves made the impact of the wave frequency less important than that in open water finally it was found that the horizontal migration of the different types of spilled oil in this study did not show a significant difference when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 1 m s but when the average flow speed at the inlet was 0 3 m s bunker c fuel oil moved relatively the slowest and this could be because of its excessively high density the movement of bunker c fuel oil in the y and z directions was more diluted than those of the two other oil types in both flow conditions the findings of this study can help provide a better understanding of oil transport after spills which is crucial for assessing the risks and determining the appropriate response measures the finer mesh resolution and longer period for simulation can be further considered in the future research the
