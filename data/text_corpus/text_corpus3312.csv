16560,rare information is available on fouling behavior of customized nanofiltration nf membrane evoked by pharmaceutically active compounds phacs under real multiple influent matrices pretreated by ultrafiltration module beforehand to this end a novel tight nf membrane with excellent perm selectivity and antiadhesion was fabricated and used to assess its separation performance mechanism and fouling behavior to a broad range of small molecular phacs in the context the adsorption ratio results revealed that the affinities between five selected phacs and the customized nanocomposite membrane surface were all much weaker below 5 5 than the solute solute interacting forces between 23 6 and 83 2 whether for natural or synthetic complex micropollutants the predominant membrane fouling could be interpreted by the incomplete blocking model in the permeation of both influent conditions for neat nanocomposite membrane the order of critical factors important on separation mechanism was electrostatic effect adsorption and steric hindrance the fouling layer seemed to act as a secondary separating layer for those negatively charged or hydrophilic phacs but showed the cake enhanced concentration polarization effect for the neutral and hydrophobic ones this study provides valuable insights for defining phacs fate and nf membrane fouling behavior to fit increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater treatment graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords customized nanocomposite membrane pharmaceutically active compounds multiple influent matrices separation mechanism fouling behavior 1 introduction in recent decades the ever increasing efforts have been devoted to adopting nanofiltration nf membrane as a bench pilot or even commercial scale tertiary treatment technique to efficiently remove the ubiquitous and biorefractory trace level organic micropollutants particularly pharmaceutically active compounds phacs from aquatic environments due to their potential health related risks dai et al 2020 garcia ivars et al 2017 taheran et al 2016 this is probably because nf could precisely reject phacs with molecular weights between 150 1000 da while reserving some beneficial minerals resulting in low energy consumption and also inheriting other merits of membrane technology such as easy to scale up modularize and almost no secondary pollution introduced etc song et al 2021b wang et al 2021 overall these related studies mainly focused on quantifying the removal mechanisms of a broad range of phacs spiked in various synthetic and real surface waters involving size hindrance electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic adsorption and partitioning for pristine nf membranes additional secondary selective barrier and cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp for fouled nf membranes respectively cai et al 2018 fonseca couto et al 2018 besides the detailed influencing effects of critical factors such as the properties of membranes target compounds and influent matrices as well as operating parameters were also explored more deeply and comprehensively kim et al 2018 maryam et al 2020 xu et al 2020b nevertheless it should be mentioned that the existing reports are basically limited to two aspects firstly in terms of efficient removal of phacs although several researches have been concentrated on customizing novel nf membranes for minimizing the perm selectivity tradeoff and elucidating the corresponding rejection mechanisms little information is available on follow up development of fouling resistant membrane dai et al 2020 khanzada et al 2020 paseta et al 2019 wang et al 2018 especially considering that compared with other wildly popular measures such as optimizing pretreatment cleaning strategies and operating conditions adopted to limit the negative impact of fouling on membrane lifespan preparing novel anti fouling nf membrane could mitigate fouling propensity from the viewpoint of molecular interaction so its role in wastewater reclamation against the backdrop of upgrading standards is expected taheran et al 2016 secondly with regards to the fouling behaviors of selected phacs to nf membranes many of them were only involved the applications of those commercial negatively charged polyamide nf membranes with low ph isoelectric points thus dragging the effective separation of cationic micropollutants at normal operating conditions in artificial wastewater licona et al 2018 yang et al 2019 thereinto the effect of no or simple influent matrix for instance cation content ca2 or na species of traditional foulants humic acid ha sodium alginate bovine serum albumin bsa or silica colloids was usually concerned xu et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 additionally former research has attempted to delineate the removal mechanisms of phacs affected by the solute membrane clean and or fouled interactions liu et al 2018b wang et al 2018 xie et al 2013 while few have noticed the solute solute interactions in the pre fouling stage and the foulant solute interactions in the second stage sadmani et al 2014 notwithstanding that fact the effects of cations in presence of organics and advanced pretreatment on nf membrane fouling behavior but without micropollutants have extensively reported adusei gyamfi et al 2019 mustafa et al 2016 it is generally believed that there is a critical concentration of ca2 mg2 in membrane fouling and bulk complexation would slow down the effective transfer of foulants at high content miao et al 2018 remarkably recent study showed that fewer mg2 ions could entirely associate with the residual natural organics left over after ultrafiltration uf unit resulting in more dense and larger flocs by the bridging complexation interactions and the worsening nf membrane fouling with more compact layer structure song et al 2021a it was totally different with some traditional studies about microscopic interaction forces among ha mg2 ca2 and polymeric membrane in which circumstances anchoring with ha and aggregating contaminants on uf membranes evoked by ca2 were both more prominent than those triggered by mg2 at the same content as a result of the former more favourable binding and charge neutralization capacities miao et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in brief knowledge about the solute solute interactions and fouling behavior of customized nf membrane to a wide range of phacs under multiple influent matrices which better represent real wastewater treatment conditions is rarely reported hence considering that phacs with small steric hindrance are difficult to be effectively removed by reported commercial nf membranes even several rejection rates 85 cuhorka et al 2020 a novel positively charged tight nf membrane with outstanding both perm selectivity and fouling resistance the competitiveness compared to other recent nf membranes depicted in table s1 by doping nanostructured quaternized carbon quantum dots qcqds into the selective layer was prepared firstly secondly the effects of phacs properties on their competitive adsorption onto customized nf membrane or background matrixes including both simulate and real river waters pretreated by uf module beforehand because of being increasingly applied as pretreatment unit in the current wastewater treatment and sampling point nearby xiaoshangzhuang wastewater treatment plant xinxiang city were investigated afterwards separation performance mechanisms virgin and fouled and fouling behavior of the resultant nf membrane to selected phacs under both influent matrices were elucidated in detail this work might provide useful guidance for defining small molecular phacs fate and nf fouling behavior induced by them in response to increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater treatment in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris 99 8 betaine hydrochloride 99 bsa 96 and neutral polyethylene glycol peg with numerous molecular weights 200 400 600 800 and 1000 da were provided by aladdin china analytical grade polyetherimide pei sodium dodecyl sulfate sds trimesoyl chloride tmc and n hexane from macklin china were used for interfacial polymerization to form polyamide layer five hplc grade phacs of atenolol atn trimethoprim tmp sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and chloramphenicol cap with wide variations in physicochemical features but the similar and smaller molecular weights mws 330 da table 1 were chosen as target compounds due to their high detection frequency in natural surface waters in the huanghuai region of china bu et al 2013 liu and wong 2013 and supplied by tokyo chemical industry co ltd japan besides analytical grade ha adopted as representation of nom in surface water was got from international humic substance society and other chemicals hcl naoh na3po4 12h2o cacl2 and mgcl2 6h2o as well as highly purified methanol 99 9 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 2 2 membranes and feedwater self made polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane module molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda with an effective surface area of 0 01 m2 was employed for plausible pretreatment customized positively charged dense nanocomposite membrane was fabricated by the cross linked reaction between qcqds pei and tmc via interfacial polymerization with sds as surfactant and na3po4 12h2o as acid accept agent in which qcqds were prepared by thermal oxidation of tris and betaine hydrochloride according to method described by bourlinos et al 2011 briefly pvdf substrate with pure water permeability coefficient of 142 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was firstly exposed in aqueous phase which contained 0 5 wt pei 0 1 wt sds and na3po4 12h2o as well as 0 3 g l 1 qcqds for 5 min specifically the optimal doping content of qcqds for preparing nanocomposite membranes was identified on the basis of their perm selectivity orthogonal experimental results as presented in fig s1 then after removing excess aqueous solution pei qcqds saturated membrane was immersed into organic phase with 0 1 w v tmc in n hexane for 3 min finally the as prepared tight nf membrane with the nominal pore size of 0 42 nm was thermal treated under 70 c for 10 min presumably due to the positively participated effect on interfacial polymerization for qcqds the customized nanocomposite membrane exhibited superior both perm selectivity for targeted mixed phacs solution and antifouling performance treated with 100 mg l 1 bsa solution lasted for 48 h specifically it possessed high permeate flux of 24 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 99 3 99 1 94 8 94 4 and 94 3 rejection rates for tmp atn cbz cap and smx flux decline ratio fdr of 14 3 respectively the synthetic complex micropollutants sample s cmps was prepared as follows 20 mg l 1 ha working solution was obtained in milli q water 18 2 mω cm at 25 c by ph adjustment with 0 10 mol l 1 hcl naoh for complete dissolution then it was doped with 5 mmol l 1 critical concentration song et al 2021a cacl2 and mgcl2 6h2o and filtrated by uf module immediately followed by spiking each phac component dissolved in highly purified methanol to reach a fixed concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 as for natural complex micropollutants sample n cmps raw surface water collected from weihe river in the city of xinxiang china was successively treated by sedimentation and 0 45 μm filter and its characteristics before and after uf filtration were summarized in table 2 the subsequent processing steps were in accord with the preparation of s cmps 2 3 experimental protocol the fate of selected phacs under multiple influent matrixes including residual natural organics left over after uf unit and divalent cations was evaluated in terms of both static adsorption and dynamic membrane fouling behaviors static adsorption trial was performed to assess the interactions between customized nf membrane or corresponding background matrixes and phacs as for the membrane solute interactions a pristine nf membrane with area of 56 6 cm2 was soaked in milli q water containing the mixture of phacs at 4 c for 48 h in an enclosed and dust free environment samples before and after membrane immersion were taken to analyze the individual adsorption capacity of nf membrane surface to each phac with respect to the solute solute interactions the fresh s cmps and n cmps samples were also settled for 48 h under the aforementioned conditions to achieve complete adsorption desorption equilibrium hajibabania et al 2011 then filtrated by a super hydrophilic uf membrane mwco 8 kda ca 28 0 module with antiadhesion surface to remove bound state phacs based on their particle size data see fig 3 the attenuation degree of each free phac was used for quantitatively assessing the interaction potential between it and other matrixes dynamic fouling experiment was conducted in a cross flow flat sheet nf system under a semi closed loop mode as illustrated in fig 1 each permeation test was composed of two stages and each stage contained fouling and physical rinsing procedures customized nf membrane with the same area as used in the adsorption experiment was firstly compacted with milli q water for 2 h under 8 0 bar to reach a steady original pure water flux j 0 then s cmps n cmps 40 l for each stage was pumped into the nf unit with constant transmembrane pressure of 6 0 bar and tangential velocity of 8 0 2 m s 1 under 25 0 2 c and the final membrane flux j f was obtained when each batch test ran for 48 h finally the pure water flux after physical cleaning j p n n 1 2 was measured again corresponding fouling indexes including fdr irreversible fouling ratio r ir and reversible fouling ratio r r were calculated according to former study song et al 2021a each predominant nf fouling mechanism under both influent conditions was evaluated by modified hermia s theory suited to cross flow configurations which discriminated four models complete blocking standard blocking incomplete blocking and gel layer formation respectively carbonell alcaina et al 2016 corbatón báguena et al 2016 hermia 1982 xu et al 2019 overall they allow a deeper comprehension of the fouling mechanisms taking place onto the membrane surface and or inside its pores by accurately identifying the degree of intersection between particle size and membrane pore size 2 4 analytical methods characteristics of the as prepared nf membrane skin layer in terms of surface features including chemical constitution morphology wettability charge pore size and body structure containing porosity and thickness were analyzed by xps escalab 250xi america atr ftir bruker 70 v germany fe sem su8010 japan afm multimode 8 america goniometer theta finland self made electrokinetic analyzer and peg rejection experiments respectively the detailed instrumental parameters for membrane characterization were based on published researches li et al 2019b song et al 2021a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was employed to investigate the distribution of proteins in the fouling layer with the aid of fluorescence dye and the image was got by software las af lite according to previous studies du et al 2021 wenhui lee et al 2021 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra and particle size distribution of s cmps n cmps samples were detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan and a laser particle size analyzer nano zs90 malvern uk respectively concentrations of targeted phacs in nf feedwater and permeate were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters america system by using a beh c18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 40 methanol and 60 milli q water at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 under 25 c 2 5 environmental risk assessment to check the separating behavior reliability and safety of the customized positively charged tight nf membrane the potential risk of residual phacs in nf permeate was investigated by risk quotient rq through eq 1 commission 2003 1 r q m e c p n e c where mec is the detected environmental concentration and pnec is the predicted no effect content of a candidate phac wherein pnec was computed by eq 2 2 p n e g e c 50 a f where ec 50 is median effect concentration and af is an appropriate safety factor of 100 and 1000 for chronic and acute toxicity general ranking standard for rq were used in this paper rq 1 high risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk rq 0 1 low risk xu et al 2020a 3 results and discussion 3 1 inherent properties of the tailored nf membrane both skin features chemical constituent morphology charge wettability and pore size distribution and nanoporous body structure porosity and thickness of the customized nf membrane functional layer were characterized measured as depicted in fig 2 in particular characteristic adsorption peaks at 1562 and 1670 cm 1 related to n h bending c o stretching vibrations in amide groups were observed in fig 2a respectively indicating the successful formation of polyamide layer through interfacial polymerization reaction besides peaks at 2927 and 2854 cm 1 could be attributed to stretching vibrations of excess primary and secondary amine groups from pei monomer song et al 2021c furthermore the detected weak peak at 3440 cm 1 might be ascribed to the successfully incorporating qcqds into the skin layer which causes the inevitable adsorption of water molecules by the enhanced surface positive charges akbari et al 2015 the signal of n 1 s detected by xps with content of 14 8 also manifested that the resultant skin layer owned plenty of amine functional groups especially considering that the 0d qcqds nanoparticles were successfully embedded li et al 2019a some critical properties about the skin layer including surface charge wettability pore size distribution and porosity are presented in fig 2b notably the resultant nf membrane surface possessed isoelectric point at approximately ph value of 8 1 and exhibited positive charge of 5 5 mv at neutral circumstance due to the introduction of nr ch3 3 groups resulting from the positively charged qcqds in addition the hydrophilic surface with water contact angle ca of 46 5 the narrow pore size distribution with small nominal pore size of 0 42 nm and large porosity of 43 2 made the tailored nf membrane suitable for efficient removal of refractory phacs in aqueous solution fig 2 c f exhibited the surface and cross sectional topographies of the as prepared membrane skin layer which were observed by fe sem and afm respectively not surprisingly the pristine membrane selective layer displayed a smooth and dense structure with finely scattered nodular morphology the root mean square roughness of merely 9 1 0 3 nm and thickness of 172 nm in short the vast majority of these excellent features make it a successful construction of desirable antifouling membrane with antiadhesion surface especially for the targeted organic contaminants in this study shan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 3 2 static adsorption behavior in general the solute solute interactions between the doping phacs and the multiple influent matrixes will definitely be reflected in terms of changing in hydrodynamic particle sizes or even categories of these micropollutants azaïs et al 2016 wang et al 2021 thus effect of adding the targeted phacs or not on the particle size distribution and 3deem fluorescence spectra of s cmps n cmps were detected and calculated which are depicted in figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3 the statistical average particle sizes of both s cmps and n cmps at stable state increased from 9 48 9 03 nm in the absence of selected phacs components to 12 6 11 9 nm respectively clearly these results can be verified from the specific fractal dimension changing trends during this period namely that the strong peak located in the left and the remaining medium strong peak moved towards the direction of larger colloidal particle size slightly and obviously at the expense of moderately worsening dispersion degree this could be ascribed by the following positive effects first of all according to the previous resin both dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns involved separation results song et al 2021a hydrophobic components contributed almost all 85 5 of doc value of residual organics left over after uf unit therefore the hydrophobic interactions between them and hydrophobic neutral phacs will boost the rise in colloidal size for the right peak secondly the small sized positively charged phacs and the oppositely charged multiple influent matrixes at the moment could form compound humic substance pseudo complexes through charge neutralization or bridging action thus further promoting the rightward shift of the medium strong peak sadmani et al 2014 thirdly the bonded mg2 ca2 ion on the edges of s cmps n cmps with an empty orbital could complex with partial of the free state phacs as electron donors that accelerates those small particles corresponding to the left peak growing slightly song et al 2020 with respect to the evolution of organics as shown in fig 4a a wide characteristic peak λex λem 250 nm 445 nm was observed in s cmps in the absence of targeted phacs which extended across regions iii and v related to fulvic like and humic like matters respectively of course the larger area of the peak was located in region iii this analysis is highly consistent with our expectation for the components of residual organics left over after uf unit in ca2 mg2 environment however after adding the mixed phacs fluorescence spectrum of s cmps depicted in fig 4c was found to be blue shifted significantly and divided into two narrow peaks λex λem 225 nm 312 nm and 260 nm 350 nm sited in region i related to aromatic proteins derived from those phacs with protein like structure as association reactants and iv related to soluble microbial by product like substances liu et al 2018a respectively it could be inferred that almost all humic and fulvic acids in s cmps associated with the trace level studied phacs effectively and forcefully with the aid of appropriate amounts of divalent cations after deducting the background of more complex organic components with higher concentration in real river water sample 8 33 and 2 29 mg l 1 for n cmps and s cmps in terms of doc value it was found that whether phacs doping or not had similar effect on the fluorescence spectrum of n cmps and the amplitude of change was reserved based on the critical role played by the adsorption effect for micropollutants when retained by nf membrane and the fact that they are usually distributed in different species in a multi component solution wang et al 2021 the static adsorption behaviors of selected phacs through the associated solute membrane and solute solute s cmps and n cmps interactions are quantitatively assessed as illustrated in fig 5 for the former it was found that the affinities between selected phacs and the customized nanocomposite membrane surface were all very weak specifically the ratios of atn tmp smx cbz and cap adsorbed onto virgin positively charged and relatively hydrophobic membrane after attaining equilibrium were merely 3 6 and 3 3 3 8 4 0 and 5 5 respectively obviously it could be judged from their respective physico chemical properties see table 1 that the same charged and hydrophilic with low logkow phacs were less likely to be adsorbed onto the membrane surface in contrast the amount of targeted phacs adsorbed onto the multiple background matrixes were much higher between 23 6 and 83 2 whether for n cmps or s cmps this may be mainly because for one thing these originally free phacs with small sizes could associate with residual organics left over after uf unit or ca2 mg2 ion through hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions complexation electrostatic neutralization or bridging and participate in various adsorption processes among the three parties secondly as far as the solute membrane adsorption is concerned the phacs adsorbed onto membrane surface need to overcome the competitive interference of background solutes with larger specific surface area in the mass transfer process over long distance moreover the weak polarity of positively charged polymeric membrane surface than that of ca2 mg2 ion which further retards the adsorption intensity of the former process the adsorption rates of five phacs in simulated or real river water samples were both in order of tmp atn cbz cap smx at this point the electrostatic attraction effect for tmp with extra aid of weak hydrophobic interactions and atn promotes their adsorption rates to maintain at high levels since zeta potentials of their respective solutions containing background colloidal particles are both negative song et al 2020 on the contrary the electrostatic repulsion effect and its extreme hydrophilicity give smx the lowest adsorption rate the remaining cap is less hydrophobic than cbz which makes its adsorption efficiency slightly lower than the latter in addition owing to the complex polar components and small colloidal particles see fig 3 in real river water the relatively weak hydrophobic interactions endowed by them make the adsorption rates of targeted phacs onto the background matrixes in n cmps generally lower than those in s cmps 3 3 fouling behavior of customized nf membrane induced by s cmps n cmps the changes of membrane permeate flux versus operating time and the relevant fouling parameters after each physical cleaning under different influent matrices are plotted in fig 6 water cas of the fouled membranes after the final physical rinsing are also depicted in fig 6 for comparison with the membrane fouling by s cmps and n cmps it can be seen that at the ends of stage i and ii s cmps and n cmps fouled membranes suffered flux decline ratios of 5 88 and 2 94 11 8 and 8 82 respectively surprisingly when only physical flushing was involved the refractory r ir under simulated or real multi influent matrices contributed less to fdr and this index was almost negligible or very low e g merely 0 20 and 0 for s cmps and n cmps during the initial fouling stage this directly reflects that the customized membrane material shows unparalleled fouling resistance and antiadhesion potential as well as the anticipated low maintenance cost in the process of efficient rejecting the selected phacs under such backgrounds compared with its counterpart at the end of stage ii a series of membrane fouling indexes in terms of fdr r r and r ir showed obvious deterioration trends and the weight value of r ir at this time also increased significantly it is conceivable that the large sized and hydrophobic colloidal particles formed by the dominant solute solute interactions with the aid of selected phacs among the multi matrices display very weak solute membrane interactions when they initially invade the virgin as fabricated membrane with antiadhesion surface however once a small amount of irreversible fouling generates on the membrane surface as scattered strongholds the subsequent hydrophobic attractive foulant solute interactions will be fierce this can be evidenced by the sharp increase in water ca of the membrane surface after being physically flushed during this period whether in s cmps rose by 18 2 or n cmp increased by 7 8 compared with its counterpart in the s cmps system in addition to the forceful evidences including larger average particle size and the bigger change in fluorescence spectrum mentioned above it should be noted that ca2 and mg2 concentrations of the former see table 2 were only 75 8 and 27 3 mg l 1 while those of the latter were as high as 200 and 120 mg l 1 equivalent to 5 mmol l 1 thus both the associated hydrophobic interactions between phacs and residual organics and the adsorption rates of targeted phacs onto the background matrixes with the aid of divalent cations are stronger which induce more serious fouling of the self made polymeric nf membrane under s cmps circumstance the fouling mechanism for the customized positively charged tight nf membrane with the simulated or real multi influent matrices involving phacs was evaluated by using hermia s theory the fitted correlation coefficients r 2 calculated according to the aforementioned four fouling models and their attached error ranges are illustrated in table 3 it was evident that standard blocking model showed the worst fitting degree which showed that most of the multi influent matrices couldn t deposit on membrane pores and inner pore walls this is in accordance with the results that the average particle sizes of s cmps and n cmps 12 6 and 11 9 nm respectively in the presence of selected phacs are much larger than the nominal pore size 0 42 nm of the customized nf membrane by contrast the fouling model of incomplete blocking fitted best to the experimental data with r 2 values of 0 983 0 014 in s cmps and 0 976 0 009 in n cmps respectively suggesting that it was the dominant fouling mechanism this once again confirms that the prevailing large sized colloidal particles which cannot pass through membrane pores completely are most likely to pile up other particles already deposited on membrane surface and then gradually form a thin fouling layer on this basis the rejection rates of pristine and s cmps n cmps fouled nf membranes to selected phacs are demonstrated in fig 7 for the former rejection ratios of atn tmp smx cbz and cap were 99 1 99 3 94 3 94 8 and 94 4 respectively considering that the customized nf membrane surface possessed positive charge of 5 5 mv in working solution the effect of electrostatic repulsion between membrane and the same charged phacs resulting in higher removal rates to atn and tmp in contrast negatively charged smx had the lowest removal rate even compared with the remaining neutral phacs cbz and cap nevertheless from the point of view of the adsorption effect it should be noticed from fig 5 that the ratios of these phacs adsorbed to membrane surface followed the order of cap 5 5 cbz 4 0 smx 3 8 atn 3 6 tmp 3 3 clearly only the adsorption capacity of negatively charged and super hydrophilic smx doesn t support its lowest removal rate but other adsorption data are further helpful to interpret their apparent rejection order wang et al 2021 however for the steric hindrance effect alone more confusion will be discovered in short it can be inferred that the electrostatic adsorption and steric hindrance effects play the primary supportive and negligible roles respectively in elucidating the separation mechanism of neat nanocomposite membrane to selected phacs compared with the pristine one the employed membranes fouled by s cmps and n cmps showed similar variation trends in the removal rate of each phac take the s cmps fouled membrane for instance the rejection ratios of negatively charged and super hydrophilic smx positively charged and hydrophilic atn and tmp increased by 1 9 merely 0 3 and 0 4 respectively this may be mainly because the fouling layer formed by the colloidal particles turns the originally positively charged polymeric membrane surface into negatively charged and more hydrophobic and performs like a secondary separating layer simultaneously atn and tmp data suggest that the enhanced hydrophobic repulsion of the fouled membrane surface and the additional barrier layer have positive effects on their removal rates which barely masks the unfavorable electrostatic attraction effect at that moment in respect to neutral and relatively hydrophobic cbz and cap their decreased removal ratios by 0 9 and 1 5 respectively are mainly caused by the cecp effect because the more hydrophobic fouling layer is still diffuse and permeable to these solutes and the concentration polarization for the employed tight nf membrane is easy to be high mahlangu et al 2014 risk quotients of the five selected phacs in the pristine and s cmps n cmps fouled nf permeate samples were assessed according to the most sensitive ec 50 values and the environmental risk assessment results are presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the rqs values of five targeted phacs were all less than 0 1 probably posing no risk on aquatic organisms xu et al 2019 yao et al 2017 in particular the rqs values of the three hydrophilic and charged phacs atn tmp and smx were even as low as 0 01 and they further reduced after being rejected by the s cmps n cmps fouled nf membrane this shows that the customized positively charged tight nf membrane with excellent perm selectivity and anti fouling properties could be used as a reliable barrier to effectively prevent these phacs with smaller mws from entering the aquatic environment clsm images further represented the spatial distribution of these phacs with protein like structure in the foulant layers after the second batch of physical flushing the results depicted in fig 9 indicated that s cmps fouled membrane manifested appreciably higher protein coverage ratio on surface and deeper foulant layer substructure over 1 0 μm than those under n cmps circumstance both of which might be the critical factors for explaining the different hydrophobicity increments of the membrane surfaces fouled by s cmps and n cmps more precisely this may be due to the presence of polar anti adhesive amino acids coming from the secondary effluent of local wastewater treatment plant and the interference of accompanying inorganic impurities in n cmps thus enabling the hydrophobicity of s cmps fouled membrane to increase significantly furthermore this result is highly consistent with the amounts of those refractory irreversible fouling see fig 6 remaining on the membrane surface under the two influent patterns of course due to the complexity and diversity of the surface river water components n cmps possessed a slightly stronger fluorescence intensity which substantially confirms the accuracy of the 3d eem see fig 4 analysis results involving the related peak intensities presented in region i 3 4 combined effects of adsorption and fouling on removal of selected phacs as discussed before adsorption especially the dominated solute solute adsorption in the pre fouling stage and the fouling layer formed by the multi influent constituents will have critical impacts on the species and fates of selected phacs thus the relative behaviors of five targeted phacs rejected by the customized nanocomposite membrane in the absence presence of background influent matrices before and after fouling by s cmps and n cmps were assessed as shown in fig 10 thereinto effect of fouling layer was computed by the difference in rejection of fouled and pristine membranes as can be seen in fig 10 the formed more hydrophobic fouling layer with capability of switching the membrane surface charge property acted like a secondary separating layer that has a positive effect on the removal ratios of those hydrophilic phacs especially for the negatively charged smx with rejection rate increased by 1 9 on the contrary the diminished removal efficiencies to neutral cbz and cap are mainly due to the negative effect of cecp which overpowered the beneficial effect of the solute solute adsorption in the pre fouling stage in short the vast majority of phacs are already in non free states but entrapped into the associated states in colloidal particles with sizes of about tens or hundreds of nanometers before approaching the membrane whether for s cmps or n cmps as for the pristine nanocomposite membrane its separation mechanism on targeted phacs covering different properties follows the order electrostatic effect adsorption effect steric hindrance effect once the fouling layer is formed on membrane surface by the multi influent constituents it will also participate and exert impacts on removal performance from three aspects firstly the electrostatic effect is indirectly altered by possibly changing membrane surface charge property secondly it acts as an additional barrier layer for those charged and more hydrophilic phacs thereby producing a positive effect thirdly for the hydrophobic and neutral phacs the fouling layer exerts a drag effect caused by cecp 4 conclusion in response to increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater advanced treatment a novel tight nf membrane with excellent perm selectivity and fouling resistance was fabricated and used to assess its separation performance mechanism and fouling behavior to a broad range of small molecular phacs under real multiple influent matrices pretreated by uf module beforehand it was observed that the customized nf membrane permanently possessed high permeate flux of more than 20 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 93 0 rejection rate for selected phacs very low r ir of less than 2 94 in a two stage running cycle whether for s cmps or n cmps it directly reflects that the resultant membrane shows unparalleled fouling resistance and antiadhesion potential as well as the anticipated low maintenance cost in the process of efficient rejecting the selected phacs under such backgrounds besides it can be inferred that the electrostatic adsorption and steric hindrance effects play the primary supportive and negligible roles respectively in elucidating the separation mechanism of neat nanocomposite membrane to selected phacs furthermore the fouling layer seemed to act as a second secondary separating layer for those negatively charged or hydrophilic phacs but showed the cecp effect for the neutral and hydrophobic ones more profoundly this research triggers redescribing of phacs induced membrane fouling behavior from the perspective of both customized nf material and advanced pretreatment involved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

fouling behavior to a broad range of small molecular phacs in the context the adsorption ratio results revealed that the affinities between five selected phacs and the customized nanocomposite membrane surface were all much weaker below 5 5 than the solute solute interacting forces between 23 6 and 83 2 whether for natural or synthetic complex micropollutants the predominant membrane fouling could be interpreted by the incomplete blocking model in the permeation of both influent conditions for neat nanocomposite membrane the order of critical factors important on separation mechanism was electrostatic effect adsorption and steric hindrance the fouling layer seemed to act as a secondary separating layer for those negatively charged or hydrophilic phacs but showed the cake enhanced concentration polarization effect for the neutral and hydrophobic ones this study provides valuable insights for defining phacs fate and nf membrane fouling behavior to fit increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater treatment graphical abstarct image graphical abstract keywords customized nanocomposite membrane pharmaceutically active compounds multiple influent matrices separation mechanism fouling behavior 1 introduction in recent decades the ever increasing efforts have been devoted to adopting nanofiltration nf membrane as a bench pilot or even commercial scale tertiary treatment technique to efficiently remove the ubiquitous and biorefractory trace level organic micropollutants particularly pharmaceutically active compounds phacs from aquatic environments due to their potential health related risks dai et al 2020 garcia ivars et al 2017 taheran et al 2016 this is probably because nf could precisely reject phacs with molecular weights between 150 1000 da while reserving some beneficial minerals resulting in low energy consumption and also inheriting other merits of membrane technology such as easy to scale up modularize and almost no secondary pollution introduced etc song et al 2021b wang et al 2021 overall these related studies mainly focused on quantifying the removal mechanisms of a broad range of phacs spiked in various synthetic and real surface waters involving size hindrance electrostatic repulsion hydrophobic adsorption and partitioning for pristine nf membranes additional secondary selective barrier and cake enhanced concentration polarization cecp for fouled nf membranes respectively cai et al 2018 fonseca couto et al 2018 besides the detailed influencing effects of critical factors such as the properties of membranes target compounds and influent matrices as well as operating parameters were also explored more deeply and comprehensively kim et al 2018 maryam et al 2020 xu et al 2020b nevertheless it should be mentioned that the existing reports are basically limited to two aspects firstly in terms of efficient removal of phacs although several researches have been concentrated on customizing novel nf membranes for minimizing the perm selectivity tradeoff and elucidating the corresponding rejection mechanisms little information is available on follow up development of fouling resistant membrane dai et al 2020 khanzada et al 2020 paseta et al 2019 wang et al 2018 especially considering that compared with other wildly popular measures such as optimizing pretreatment cleaning strategies and operating conditions adopted to limit the negative impact of fouling on membrane lifespan preparing novel anti fouling nf membrane could mitigate fouling propensity from the viewpoint of molecular interaction so its role in wastewater reclamation against the backdrop of upgrading standards is expected taheran et al 2016 secondly with regards to the fouling behaviors of selected phacs to nf membranes many of them were only involved the applications of those commercial negatively charged polyamide nf membranes with low ph isoelectric points thus dragging the effective separation of cationic micropollutants at normal operating conditions in artificial wastewater licona et al 2018 yang et al 2019 thereinto the effect of no or simple influent matrix for instance cation content ca2 or na species of traditional foulants humic acid ha sodium alginate bovine serum albumin bsa or silica colloids was usually concerned xu et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 additionally former research has attempted to delineate the removal mechanisms of phacs affected by the solute membrane clean and or fouled interactions liu et al 2018b wang et al 2018 xie et al 2013 while few have noticed the solute solute interactions in the pre fouling stage and the foulant solute interactions in the second stage sadmani et al 2014 notwithstanding that fact the effects of cations in presence of organics and advanced pretreatment on nf membrane fouling behavior but without micropollutants have extensively reported adusei gyamfi et al 2019 mustafa et al 2016 it is generally believed that there is a critical concentration of ca2 mg2 in membrane fouling and bulk complexation would slow down the effective transfer of foulants at high content miao et al 2018 remarkably recent study showed that fewer mg2 ions could entirely associate with the residual natural organics left over after ultrafiltration uf unit resulting in more dense and larger flocs by the bridging complexation interactions and the worsening nf membrane fouling with more compact layer structure song et al 2021a it was totally different with some traditional studies about microscopic interaction forces among ha mg2 ca2 and polymeric membrane in which circumstances anchoring with ha and aggregating contaminants on uf membranes evoked by ca2 were both more prominent than those triggered by mg2 at the same content as a result of the former more favourable binding and charge neutralization capacities miao et al 2018 wang et al 2015 in brief knowledge about the solute solute interactions and fouling behavior of customized nf membrane to a wide range of phacs under multiple influent matrices which better represent real wastewater treatment conditions is rarely reported hence considering that phacs with small steric hindrance are difficult to be effectively removed by reported commercial nf membranes even several rejection rates 85 cuhorka et al 2020 a novel positively charged tight nf membrane with outstanding both perm selectivity and fouling resistance the competitiveness compared to other recent nf membranes depicted in table s1 by doping nanostructured quaternized carbon quantum dots qcqds into the selective layer was prepared firstly secondly the effects of phacs properties on their competitive adsorption onto customized nf membrane or background matrixes including both simulate and real river waters pretreated by uf module beforehand because of being increasingly applied as pretreatment unit in the current wastewater treatment and sampling point nearby xiaoshangzhuang wastewater treatment plant xinxiang city were investigated afterwards separation performance mechanisms virgin and fouled and fouling behavior of the resultant nf membrane to selected phacs under both influent matrices were elucidated in detail this work might provide useful guidance for defining small molecular phacs fate and nf fouling behavior induced by them in response to increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater treatment in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemical reagents tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane tris 99 8 betaine hydrochloride 99 bsa 96 and neutral polyethylene glycol peg with numerous molecular weights 200 400 600 800 and 1000 da were provided by aladdin china analytical grade polyetherimide pei sodium dodecyl sulfate sds trimesoyl chloride tmc and n hexane from macklin china were used for interfacial polymerization to form polyamide layer five hplc grade phacs of atenolol atn trimethoprim tmp sulfamethoxazole smx carbamazepine cbz and chloramphenicol cap with wide variations in physicochemical features but the similar and smaller molecular weights mws 330 da table 1 were chosen as target compounds due to their high detection frequency in natural surface waters in the huanghuai region of china bu et al 2013 liu and wong 2013 and supplied by tokyo chemical industry co ltd japan besides analytical grade ha adopted as representation of nom in surface water was got from international humic substance society and other chemicals hcl naoh na3po4 12h2o cacl2 and mgcl2 6h2o as well as highly purified methanol 99 9 were purchased from sigma aldrich usa 2 2 membranes and feedwater self made polyvinylidene difluoride pvdf hollow fiber uf membrane module molecular weight cut off mwco 50 kda with an effective surface area of 0 01 m2 was employed for plausible pretreatment customized positively charged dense nanocomposite membrane was fabricated by the cross linked reaction between qcqds pei and tmc via interfacial polymerization with sds as surfactant and na3po4 12h2o as acid accept agent in which qcqds were prepared by thermal oxidation of tris and betaine hydrochloride according to method described by bourlinos et al 2011 briefly pvdf substrate with pure water permeability coefficient of 142 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 was firstly exposed in aqueous phase which contained 0 5 wt pei 0 1 wt sds and na3po4 12h2o as well as 0 3 g l 1 qcqds for 5 min specifically the optimal doping content of qcqds for preparing nanocomposite membranes was identified on the basis of their perm selectivity orthogonal experimental results as presented in fig s1 then after removing excess aqueous solution pei qcqds saturated membrane was immersed into organic phase with 0 1 w v tmc in n hexane for 3 min finally the as prepared tight nf membrane with the nominal pore size of 0 42 nm was thermal treated under 70 c for 10 min presumably due to the positively participated effect on interfacial polymerization for qcqds the customized nanocomposite membrane exhibited superior both perm selectivity for targeted mixed phacs solution and antifouling performance treated with 100 mg l 1 bsa solution lasted for 48 h specifically it possessed high permeate flux of 24 1 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 99 3 99 1 94 8 94 4 and 94 3 rejection rates for tmp atn cbz cap and smx flux decline ratio fdr of 14 3 respectively the synthetic complex micropollutants sample s cmps was prepared as follows 20 mg l 1 ha working solution was obtained in milli q water 18 2 mω cm at 25 c by ph adjustment with 0 10 mol l 1 hcl naoh for complete dissolution then it was doped with 5 mmol l 1 critical concentration song et al 2021a cacl2 and mgcl2 6h2o and filtrated by uf module immediately followed by spiking each phac component dissolved in highly purified methanol to reach a fixed concentration of 1 0 mg l 1 as for natural complex micropollutants sample n cmps raw surface water collected from weihe river in the city of xinxiang china was successively treated by sedimentation and 0 45 μm filter and its characteristics before and after uf filtration were summarized in table 2 the subsequent processing steps were in accord with the preparation of s cmps 2 3 experimental protocol the fate of selected phacs under multiple influent matrixes including residual natural organics left over after uf unit and divalent cations was evaluated in terms of both static adsorption and dynamic membrane fouling behaviors static adsorption trial was performed to assess the interactions between customized nf membrane or corresponding background matrixes and phacs as for the membrane solute interactions a pristine nf membrane with area of 56 6 cm2 was soaked in milli q water containing the mixture of phacs at 4 c for 48 h in an enclosed and dust free environment samples before and after membrane immersion were taken to analyze the individual adsorption capacity of nf membrane surface to each phac with respect to the solute solute interactions the fresh s cmps and n cmps samples were also settled for 48 h under the aforementioned conditions to achieve complete adsorption desorption equilibrium hajibabania et al 2011 then filtrated by a super hydrophilic uf membrane mwco 8 kda ca 28 0 module with antiadhesion surface to remove bound state phacs based on their particle size data see fig 3 the attenuation degree of each free phac was used for quantitatively assessing the interaction potential between it and other matrixes dynamic fouling experiment was conducted in a cross flow flat sheet nf system under a semi closed loop mode as illustrated in fig 1 each permeation test was composed of two stages and each stage contained fouling and physical rinsing procedures customized nf membrane with the same area as used in the adsorption experiment was firstly compacted with milli q water for 2 h under 8 0 bar to reach a steady original pure water flux j 0 then s cmps n cmps 40 l for each stage was pumped into the nf unit with constant transmembrane pressure of 6 0 bar and tangential velocity of 8 0 2 m s 1 under 25 0 2 c and the final membrane flux j f was obtained when each batch test ran for 48 h finally the pure water flux after physical cleaning j p n n 1 2 was measured again corresponding fouling indexes including fdr irreversible fouling ratio r ir and reversible fouling ratio r r were calculated according to former study song et al 2021a each predominant nf fouling mechanism under both influent conditions was evaluated by modified hermia s theory suited to cross flow configurations which discriminated four models complete blocking standard blocking incomplete blocking and gel layer formation respectively carbonell alcaina et al 2016 corbatón báguena et al 2016 hermia 1982 xu et al 2019 overall they allow a deeper comprehension of the fouling mechanisms taking place onto the membrane surface and or inside its pores by accurately identifying the degree of intersection between particle size and membrane pore size 2 4 analytical methods characteristics of the as prepared nf membrane skin layer in terms of surface features including chemical constitution morphology wettability charge pore size and body structure containing porosity and thickness were analyzed by xps escalab 250xi america atr ftir bruker 70 v germany fe sem su8010 japan afm multimode 8 america goniometer theta finland self made electrokinetic analyzer and peg rejection experiments respectively the detailed instrumental parameters for membrane characterization were based on published researches li et al 2019b song et al 2021a confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm was employed to investigate the distribution of proteins in the fouling layer with the aid of fluorescence dye and the image was got by software las af lite according to previous studies du et al 2021 wenhui lee et al 2021 the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3deem fluorescence spectra and particle size distribution of s cmps n cmps samples were detected by a fluorescence spectrophotometer fp 6500 jasco japan and a laser particle size analyzer nano zs90 malvern uk respectively concentrations of targeted phacs in nf feedwater and permeate were determined by high performance liquid chromatography hplc waters america system by using a beh c18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 40 methanol and 60 milli q water at a flow rate of 1 0 ml min 1 under 25 c 2 5 environmental risk assessment to check the separating behavior reliability and safety of the customized positively charged tight nf membrane the potential risk of residual phacs in nf permeate was investigated by risk quotient rq through eq 1 commission 2003 1 r q m e c p n e c where mec is the detected environmental concentration and pnec is the predicted no effect content of a candidate phac wherein pnec was computed by eq 2 2 p n e g e c 50 a f where ec 50 is median effect concentration and af is an appropriate safety factor of 100 and 1000 for chronic and acute toxicity general ranking standard for rq were used in this paper rq 1 high risk 0 1 rq 1 medium risk rq 0 1 low risk xu et al 2020a 3 results and discussion 3 1 inherent properties of the tailored nf membrane both skin features chemical constituent morphology charge wettability and pore size distribution and nanoporous body structure porosity and thickness of the customized nf membrane functional layer were characterized measured as depicted in fig 2 in particular characteristic adsorption peaks at 1562 and 1670 cm 1 related to n h bending c o stretching vibrations in amide groups were observed in fig 2a respectively indicating the successful formation of polyamide layer through interfacial polymerization reaction besides peaks at 2927 and 2854 cm 1 could be attributed to stretching vibrations of excess primary and secondary amine groups from pei monomer song et al 2021c furthermore the detected weak peak at 3440 cm 1 might be ascribed to the successfully incorporating qcqds into the skin layer which causes the inevitable adsorption of water molecules by the enhanced surface positive charges akbari et al 2015 the signal of n 1 s detected by xps with content of 14 8 also manifested that the resultant skin layer owned plenty of amine functional groups especially considering that the 0d qcqds nanoparticles were successfully embedded li et al 2019a some critical properties about the skin layer including surface charge wettability pore size distribution and porosity are presented in fig 2b notably the resultant nf membrane surface possessed isoelectric point at approximately ph value of 8 1 and exhibited positive charge of 5 5 mv at neutral circumstance due to the introduction of nr ch3 3 groups resulting from the positively charged qcqds in addition the hydrophilic surface with water contact angle ca of 46 5 the narrow pore size distribution with small nominal pore size of 0 42 nm and large porosity of 43 2 made the tailored nf membrane suitable for efficient removal of refractory phacs in aqueous solution fig 2 c f exhibited the surface and cross sectional topographies of the as prepared membrane skin layer which were observed by fe sem and afm respectively not surprisingly the pristine membrane selective layer displayed a smooth and dense structure with finely scattered nodular morphology the root mean square roughness of merely 9 1 0 3 nm and thickness of 172 nm in short the vast majority of these excellent features make it a successful construction of desirable antifouling membrane with antiadhesion surface especially for the targeted organic contaminants in this study shan et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 3 2 static adsorption behavior in general the solute solute interactions between the doping phacs and the multiple influent matrixes will definitely be reflected in terms of changing in hydrodynamic particle sizes or even categories of these micropollutants azaïs et al 2016 wang et al 2021 thus effect of adding the targeted phacs or not on the particle size distribution and 3deem fluorescence spectra of s cmps n cmps were detected and calculated which are depicted in figs 3 and 4 respectively as shown in fig 3 the statistical average particle sizes of both s cmps and n cmps at stable state increased from 9 48 9 03 nm in the absence of selected phacs components to 12 6 11 9 nm respectively clearly these results can be verified from the specific fractal dimension changing trends during this period namely that the strong peak located in the left and the remaining medium strong peak moved towards the direction of larger colloidal particle size slightly and obviously at the expense of moderately worsening dispersion degree this could be ascribed by the following positive effects first of all according to the previous resin both dax 8 and xad 4 resin columns involved separation results song et al 2021a hydrophobic components contributed almost all 85 5 of doc value of residual organics left over after uf unit therefore the hydrophobic interactions between them and hydrophobic neutral phacs will boost the rise in colloidal size for the right peak secondly the small sized positively charged phacs and the oppositely charged multiple influent matrixes at the moment could form compound humic substance pseudo complexes through charge neutralization or bridging action thus further promoting the rightward shift of the medium strong peak sadmani et al 2014 thirdly the bonded mg2 ca2 ion on the edges of s cmps n cmps with an empty orbital could complex with partial of the free state phacs as electron donors that accelerates those small particles corresponding to the left peak growing slightly song et al 2020 with respect to the evolution of organics as shown in fig 4a a wide characteristic peak λex λem 250 nm 445 nm was observed in s cmps in the absence of targeted phacs which extended across regions iii and v related to fulvic like and humic like matters respectively of course the larger area of the peak was located in region iii this analysis is highly consistent with our expectation for the components of residual organics left over after uf unit in ca2 mg2 environment however after adding the mixed phacs fluorescence spectrum of s cmps depicted in fig 4c was found to be blue shifted significantly and divided into two narrow peaks λex λem 225 nm 312 nm and 260 nm 350 nm sited in region i related to aromatic proteins derived from those phacs with protein like structure as association reactants and iv related to soluble microbial by product like substances liu et al 2018a respectively it could be inferred that almost all humic and fulvic acids in s cmps associated with the trace level studied phacs effectively and forcefully with the aid of appropriate amounts of divalent cations after deducting the background of more complex organic components with higher concentration in real river water sample 8 33 and 2 29 mg l 1 for n cmps and s cmps in terms of doc value it was found that whether phacs doping or not had similar effect on the fluorescence spectrum of n cmps and the amplitude of change was reserved based on the critical role played by the adsorption effect for micropollutants when retained by nf membrane and the fact that they are usually distributed in different species in a multi component solution wang et al 2021 the static adsorption behaviors of selected phacs through the associated solute membrane and solute solute s cmps and n cmps interactions are quantitatively assessed as illustrated in fig 5 for the former it was found that the affinities between selected phacs and the customized nanocomposite membrane surface were all very weak specifically the ratios of atn tmp smx cbz and cap adsorbed onto virgin positively charged and relatively hydrophobic membrane after attaining equilibrium were merely 3 6 and 3 3 3 8 4 0 and 5 5 respectively obviously it could be judged from their respective physico chemical properties see table 1 that the same charged and hydrophilic with low logkow phacs were less likely to be adsorbed onto the membrane surface in contrast the amount of targeted phacs adsorbed onto the multiple background matrixes were much higher between 23 6 and 83 2 whether for n cmps or s cmps this may be mainly because for one thing these originally free phacs with small sizes could associate with residual organics left over after uf unit or ca2 mg2 ion through hydrophobic hydrophobic interactions complexation electrostatic neutralization or bridging and participate in various adsorption processes among the three parties secondly as far as the solute membrane adsorption is concerned the phacs adsorbed onto membrane surface need to overcome the competitive interference of background solutes with larger specific surface area in the mass transfer process over long distance moreover the weak polarity of positively charged polymeric membrane surface than that of ca2 mg2 ion which further retards the adsorption intensity of the former process the adsorption rates of five phacs in simulated or real river water samples were both in order of tmp atn cbz cap smx at this point the electrostatic attraction effect for tmp with extra aid of weak hydrophobic interactions and atn promotes their adsorption rates to maintain at high levels since zeta potentials of their respective solutions containing background colloidal particles are both negative song et al 2020 on the contrary the electrostatic repulsion effect and its extreme hydrophilicity give smx the lowest adsorption rate the remaining cap is less hydrophobic than cbz which makes its adsorption efficiency slightly lower than the latter in addition owing to the complex polar components and small colloidal particles see fig 3 in real river water the relatively weak hydrophobic interactions endowed by them make the adsorption rates of targeted phacs onto the background matrixes in n cmps generally lower than those in s cmps 3 3 fouling behavior of customized nf membrane induced by s cmps n cmps the changes of membrane permeate flux versus operating time and the relevant fouling parameters after each physical cleaning under different influent matrices are plotted in fig 6 water cas of the fouled membranes after the final physical rinsing are also depicted in fig 6 for comparison with the membrane fouling by s cmps and n cmps it can be seen that at the ends of stage i and ii s cmps and n cmps fouled membranes suffered flux decline ratios of 5 88 and 2 94 11 8 and 8 82 respectively surprisingly when only physical flushing was involved the refractory r ir under simulated or real multi influent matrices contributed less to fdr and this index was almost negligible or very low e g merely 0 20 and 0 for s cmps and n cmps during the initial fouling stage this directly reflects that the customized membrane material shows unparalleled fouling resistance and antiadhesion potential as well as the anticipated low maintenance cost in the process of efficient rejecting the selected phacs under such backgrounds compared with its counterpart at the end of stage ii a series of membrane fouling indexes in terms of fdr r r and r ir showed obvious deterioration trends and the weight value of r ir at this time also increased significantly it is conceivable that the large sized and hydrophobic colloidal particles formed by the dominant solute solute interactions with the aid of selected phacs among the multi matrices display very weak solute membrane interactions when they initially invade the virgin as fabricated membrane with antiadhesion surface however once a small amount of irreversible fouling generates on the membrane surface as scattered strongholds the subsequent hydrophobic attractive foulant solute interactions will be fierce this can be evidenced by the sharp increase in water ca of the membrane surface after being physically flushed during this period whether in s cmps rose by 18 2 or n cmp increased by 7 8 compared with its counterpart in the s cmps system in addition to the forceful evidences including larger average particle size and the bigger change in fluorescence spectrum mentioned above it should be noted that ca2 and mg2 concentrations of the former see table 2 were only 75 8 and 27 3 mg l 1 while those of the latter were as high as 200 and 120 mg l 1 equivalent to 5 mmol l 1 thus both the associated hydrophobic interactions between phacs and residual organics and the adsorption rates of targeted phacs onto the background matrixes with the aid of divalent cations are stronger which induce more serious fouling of the self made polymeric nf membrane under s cmps circumstance the fouling mechanism for the customized positively charged tight nf membrane with the simulated or real multi influent matrices involving phacs was evaluated by using hermia s theory the fitted correlation coefficients r 2 calculated according to the aforementioned four fouling models and their attached error ranges are illustrated in table 3 it was evident that standard blocking model showed the worst fitting degree which showed that most of the multi influent matrices couldn t deposit on membrane pores and inner pore walls this is in accordance with the results that the average particle sizes of s cmps and n cmps 12 6 and 11 9 nm respectively in the presence of selected phacs are much larger than the nominal pore size 0 42 nm of the customized nf membrane by contrast the fouling model of incomplete blocking fitted best to the experimental data with r 2 values of 0 983 0 014 in s cmps and 0 976 0 009 in n cmps respectively suggesting that it was the dominant fouling mechanism this once again confirms that the prevailing large sized colloidal particles which cannot pass through membrane pores completely are most likely to pile up other particles already deposited on membrane surface and then gradually form a thin fouling layer on this basis the rejection rates of pristine and s cmps n cmps fouled nf membranes to selected phacs are demonstrated in fig 7 for the former rejection ratios of atn tmp smx cbz and cap were 99 1 99 3 94 3 94 8 and 94 4 respectively considering that the customized nf membrane surface possessed positive charge of 5 5 mv in working solution the effect of electrostatic repulsion between membrane and the same charged phacs resulting in higher removal rates to atn and tmp in contrast negatively charged smx had the lowest removal rate even compared with the remaining neutral phacs cbz and cap nevertheless from the point of view of the adsorption effect it should be noticed from fig 5 that the ratios of these phacs adsorbed to membrane surface followed the order of cap 5 5 cbz 4 0 smx 3 8 atn 3 6 tmp 3 3 clearly only the adsorption capacity of negatively charged and super hydrophilic smx doesn t support its lowest removal rate but other adsorption data are further helpful to interpret their apparent rejection order wang et al 2021 however for the steric hindrance effect alone more confusion will be discovered in short it can be inferred that the electrostatic adsorption and steric hindrance effects play the primary supportive and negligible roles respectively in elucidating the separation mechanism of neat nanocomposite membrane to selected phacs compared with the pristine one the employed membranes fouled by s cmps and n cmps showed similar variation trends in the removal rate of each phac take the s cmps fouled membrane for instance the rejection ratios of negatively charged and super hydrophilic smx positively charged and hydrophilic atn and tmp increased by 1 9 merely 0 3 and 0 4 respectively this may be mainly because the fouling layer formed by the colloidal particles turns the originally positively charged polymeric membrane surface into negatively charged and more hydrophobic and performs like a secondary separating layer simultaneously atn and tmp data suggest that the enhanced hydrophobic repulsion of the fouled membrane surface and the additional barrier layer have positive effects on their removal rates which barely masks the unfavorable electrostatic attraction effect at that moment in respect to neutral and relatively hydrophobic cbz and cap their decreased removal ratios by 0 9 and 1 5 respectively are mainly caused by the cecp effect because the more hydrophobic fouling layer is still diffuse and permeable to these solutes and the concentration polarization for the employed tight nf membrane is easy to be high mahlangu et al 2014 risk quotients of the five selected phacs in the pristine and s cmps n cmps fouled nf permeate samples were assessed according to the most sensitive ec 50 values and the environmental risk assessment results are presented in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the rqs values of five targeted phacs were all less than 0 1 probably posing no risk on aquatic organisms xu et al 2019 yao et al 2017 in particular the rqs values of the three hydrophilic and charged phacs atn tmp and smx were even as low as 0 01 and they further reduced after being rejected by the s cmps n cmps fouled nf membrane this shows that the customized positively charged tight nf membrane with excellent perm selectivity and anti fouling properties could be used as a reliable barrier to effectively prevent these phacs with smaller mws from entering the aquatic environment clsm images further represented the spatial distribution of these phacs with protein like structure in the foulant layers after the second batch of physical flushing the results depicted in fig 9 indicated that s cmps fouled membrane manifested appreciably higher protein coverage ratio on surface and deeper foulant layer substructure over 1 0 μm than those under n cmps circumstance both of which might be the critical factors for explaining the different hydrophobicity increments of the membrane surfaces fouled by s cmps and n cmps more precisely this may be due to the presence of polar anti adhesive amino acids coming from the secondary effluent of local wastewater treatment plant and the interference of accompanying inorganic impurities in n cmps thus enabling the hydrophobicity of s cmps fouled membrane to increase significantly furthermore this result is highly consistent with the amounts of those refractory irreversible fouling see fig 6 remaining on the membrane surface under the two influent patterns of course due to the complexity and diversity of the surface river water components n cmps possessed a slightly stronger fluorescence intensity which substantially confirms the accuracy of the 3d eem see fig 4 analysis results involving the related peak intensities presented in region i 3 4 combined effects of adsorption and fouling on removal of selected phacs as discussed before adsorption especially the dominated solute solute adsorption in the pre fouling stage and the fouling layer formed by the multi influent constituents will have critical impacts on the species and fates of selected phacs thus the relative behaviors of five targeted phacs rejected by the customized nanocomposite membrane in the absence presence of background influent matrices before and after fouling by s cmps and n cmps were assessed as shown in fig 10 thereinto effect of fouling layer was computed by the difference in rejection of fouled and pristine membranes as can be seen in fig 10 the formed more hydrophobic fouling layer with capability of switching the membrane surface charge property acted like a secondary separating layer that has a positive effect on the removal ratios of those hydrophilic phacs especially for the negatively charged smx with rejection rate increased by 1 9 on the contrary the diminished removal efficiencies to neutral cbz and cap are mainly due to the negative effect of cecp which overpowered the beneficial effect of the solute solute adsorption in the pre fouling stage in short the vast majority of phacs are already in non free states but entrapped into the associated states in colloidal particles with sizes of about tens or hundreds of nanometers before approaching the membrane whether for s cmps or n cmps as for the pristine nanocomposite membrane its separation mechanism on targeted phacs covering different properties follows the order electrostatic effect adsorption effect steric hindrance effect once the fouling layer is formed on membrane surface by the multi influent constituents it will also participate and exert impacts on removal performance from three aspects firstly the electrostatic effect is indirectly altered by possibly changing membrane surface charge property secondly it acts as an additional barrier layer for those charged and more hydrophilic phacs thereby producing a positive effect thirdly for the hydrophobic and neutral phacs the fouling layer exerts a drag effect caused by cecp 4 conclusion in response to increasingly stringent criteria for wastewater advanced treatment a novel tight nf membrane with excellent perm selectivity and fouling resistance was fabricated and used to assess its separation performance mechanism and fouling behavior to a broad range of small molecular phacs under real multiple influent matrices pretreated by uf module beforehand it was observed that the customized nf membrane permanently possessed high permeate flux of more than 20 3 l m 2 h 1 bar 1 93 0 rejection rate for selected phacs very low r ir of less than 2 94 in a two stage running cycle whether for s cmps or n cmps it directly reflects that the resultant membrane shows unparalleled fouling resistance and antiadhesion potential as well as the anticipated low maintenance cost in the process of efficient rejecting the selected phacs under such backgrounds besides it can be inferred that the electrostatic adsorption and steric hindrance effects play the primary supportive and negligible roles respectively in elucidating the separation mechanism of neat nanocomposite membrane to selected phacs furthermore the fouling layer seemed to act as a second secondary separating layer for those negatively charged or hydrophilic phacs but showed the cecp effect for the neutral and hydrophobic ones more profoundly this research triggers redescribing of phacs induced membrane fouling behavior from the perspective of both customized nf material and advanced pretreatment involved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

16561,the combined fouling effect prevalent in the nanofiltration nf process severely limits its use in this study cation exchange membrane cem electrolysis was performed to alleviate nf membrane fouling by controlling interface characteristics the results revealed that cem electrolysis hydraulic retention time with 0 24 or 0 36 h effectively improved nf membrane permeability by 201 211 and achieved a stability of 8 lmh bar the divalent cations were removed through cem electrolysis with a decrease in ca2 and mg2 by approximately 68 8 and 30 9 respectively which was related to scaling potential reduction this softening function reduced the possibility of bridging of organics with divalent cations which contributed to the lower molecular weight of organic matter mainly humic substances distributed in 1 4 23 kda the improved organic indicators of the nf membrane permeate quality implied that the membrane interface characteristics improved the foulant layer on the nf membrane dominated humic substances and biopolymers exhibited hydrophobic smooth and porous characteristics the self aggregation of foulants on the nf membrane surface stimulated the interface

critical for alleviating combined fouling in nf concentrate treatment studies have revealed that preremoval of inorganic matter e g mg and ca is effective to mitigate fouling of the nf process heijmana et al used ion exchange resins to remove divalent cations before the nf process and reported that fouling caused by the bridging effects of ca humic substances was considerably diminished heijman et al 2009 imbrogno et al 2018 the addition of sodium bicarbonate for lime softening enhances the removal of divalent cations under high alkalinity and ph prevents scaling and alleviates combined membrane fouling comstock et al 2011 furthermore the addition of antiscalants such as ntmp hedp and pesa alleviates scaling by adsorption on the crystallisation surface yu et al 2020 however the main drawbacks of these strategies are the use of chemical reagents electrochemical softening has attracted considerable attention in the nf concentrate treatment because of its chemical free

cem electrolysis was developed to soften the salt solution pan et al 2020 in this system ca2 mg2 cations were concentrated into the cathode chamber to achieve a caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitation rate of higher than 90 díaz nieto et al 2019 in addition to softening the generated precipitates such as amorphous magnesium hydroxide enhanced organic matter removal and reduced the combined nf membrane fouling potential lei et al 2018 low cost high performance cation exchange membranes are conducive to the application of cem electrolysis chakraborty et al 2020 studies have shown that cem

remove the organic foulants and produce high quality reused water the cem electrolysis has been demonstrated to relieve the uf membrane fouling in the previous study wang et al 2020a to the best of our knowledge cem electrolysis for nf membrane fouling control including its practice feasibility and mechanism is not investigated therefore this study mainly investigated the feasibility of the hybrid process and evaluated nf membrane permeability and rejection performance the effect of cem electrolysis on nf membrane fouling was examined on the basis of interface characteristics including fouling morphology chemical composition and surface free energy this study provided theoretical and practical strategies for advanced treatments of nf concentrates and membrane fouling control 2

steel the active areas of the electrodes were 10 cm2 and the distance between two electrodes was fixed at 25 mm the dc power it 6302 itech china was used to supply a stable current 10 ma cm2 after cem electrolysis the ultrafiltration membrane polyvinylidene difluoride material sinap china with a nominal membrane pore size of less than 0 1 μm was used ren et al 2021 after uf treatment the permeate

generate the two 2d cos maps including synchronous and asynchronous maps atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolve bruker usa was used to characterise the membrane surface roughness scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 500 zeiss germany equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x maxn oxford uk was used to analyse the membrane surface the excitation emission matrix eem spectra were generated through scanning with excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm by using a fluorescence spectrometer f7000 hitachi japan the eem instrument used a front face sample holder with an incident angle of 30 orient koji china for characterising nf membranes based on the xdlvo theory the foulant foulant interaction energy of cohesion δg 131 and foulant membrane interaction energy of adhesion δg 132 were quantified to evaluate the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism caused by cem electrolysis chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in this study 3 μl of each of diiodomethane aladdin china glycerol aladdin china and milli q water was probed on the membrane surfaces with a microsyringe contact angles were measured using a contact angle goniometer sl200b kino usa six measurements were conducted at randomly selected locations for each membrane sample the interaction energy analysis results are displayed in table 1 to quantify the calcium sulfate scaling content the fouled nf membranes were soaked in the hcl solution ph 2 24 h and then ion concentrations in the

rate was controlled at 0 4 ml min the it6302 dc supplier was used to record the resistance variation for cem electrolysis ibm spss statistics 20 software was employed to evaluate considerable differences using anova and the post hoc tukey s test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux permeability and conductivity variation the variations in nf membrane flux and the conductivity for each test are displayed in fig 2 fig 2a reveals that the conductivity of the nf influent decreased after cem electrolysis which revealed that cem electrolysis could mitigate salt accumulation on the nf membrane for the group without cem electrolysis pretreatment control group nf permeability was initially 6 81 lmh bar which continuously decreased to approximately 2 69 lmh bar after filtration for 22 h the control group membrane fluxes exhibited a higher flux decline rate than membrane fluxes treated with cem electrolysis which indicated severe membrane fouling by using cem electrolysis for 0 12 0 24 and 0 36 h the initial permeability increased to 7 14 7 41 and 7 46 as displayed in fig 2 such results were related to a relieved cp in the nf process caused by a decrease in the conductivity hoek and elimelech 2003 cem electrolysis 0 12 h hrt increased the final permeability after the 22 h nf process by 123 over the control group after the increase in the hrt to 0 24 and 0 36 h the permeability decline was marginal which could be attributed to the low scaling potential calcium cations and alkalinity were effectively removed by the cem electrolysis simultaneously and thereby calcium carbonate scaling was controlled and eliminated besides the saturation index si of gypsum was calculated based on equations s1 s3 in supplementary materials showing reducton of sigypsum from 0 42 hrt 0 h to 0 41 hrt 0 12 h 0 22 hrt 0 24 h and 0 15 hrt 0 36 h after using the cem electrolysis the scaling of gypsum was also relieved by the cem electrolysis when using the cem electrolysis with hrt of 0 36 h the slight increase in the nf permeability over filtration time was attributed to the swelling of membrane caused by electrostatic repulsion between the charged solutes ions and charged dom and the membrane itself showing the improvement of membrane interface characteristics lin et al 2019 sadrzadeh et al 2018 3 2 removal performance to reveal nf fouling the effects of cem electrolysis on removal performance were investigated with an increase in hrt to 0 36 h cem electrolysis exhibited considerable rejection of ca2 and mg2 that is 66 1 mg ca2 l fig 3 a and 47 2 mg mg2 l respectively fig 3b fig s2 shows the ph improvement in the cathode chamber and anode chamber during the stable electrolysis stage the cathode transformed the calcium cations into caco3 crystal solid which caused apparent reduction díaz nieto et al 2019 in the mg2 removal mechanism mg2 concentration decreased with the generation of amorphous magnesium hydroxide in the cathode chamber wang et al 2021a furthermore cem electrolysis considerably reduced the ca2 concentration which reached 7 5 11 7 mg l in the nf membrane permeate the average mg2 concentration in the membrane permeate decreased marginally fig 3c reveals that cem electrolysis did not considerably increase the na k cl and so 4 concentrations in the nf permeate the results revealed that cem electrolysis played a softening role the aforementioned removal performance revealed that cem electrolysis did not damage the integrity of the nf membrane to assess the feasibility of cem electrolysis the concentration of organic matter was measured although the cem cathode chamber of cem electrolysis generated mg oh 2 particles and adsorbed the organic substances the overall nom rejection of uf was limited at 5 1 8 fig s3 the results were agreed with the uf membrane flux trends fig s4 however the uf membrane rejection on nom was cem electrolysis exhibited negligible toc substance removal such a pretreatment reduced the toc concentration of the nf permeate which revealed that the organic removal behaviour on the nf membranes could be modified 3 3 fluorescence and molecular weight distributions of the nom cem electrolysis is typically used to remove organic compounds through adsorption acidic alkaline media and hydrolysis paidar et al 2016 wang et al 2020a the fluorescence and molecular weight mw distributions were used to evaluate cem electrolysis modification on the nom the eem spectra exhibited two major peaks fig s5 the peak intensity and location of each peak are displayed in fig 4 a peak a ex em 270 420 nm is dominated by humic like fluorescence which is similar to the humic like component reported in previous studies he and hur 2015 stedmon et al 2003 this component exhibited potential terrestrial sources such as nom derived from soils forested streams and wetlands and is negatively correlated with salinity in estuarine ecosystems ishii and boyer 2012 peak b ex em 330 420 nm was reported with an increasing detection frequency in freshwater environments and represented anthropogenic humic like substances that were resistant to photo degradation in surface waters jørgensen et al 2011 murphy et al 2008 the two peaks have been combined in numerous studies because both relate to humic like components fellman et al 2011 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2008 as displayed in fig 4a the total intensity in the nf influent increased and subsequently decreased with the hrt of cem electrolysis the slight toc reduction fig 3d implied that the fluorescent increase was mainly related to lower salinity fig 2a after cem electrolysis treatment when continuously prolonging hrt the cem electrolysis removed the humic like substance and eliminated fluorescent organic residues the fluorescence analysis of the nf membrane permeate revealed a negative correlation with electrolysis hrt more than 90 of humic like organic compounds were removed by the nf membrane which indicated the molecular weight distribution of fluorescence organics was higher than 500 da the molecular weight cut off of nf270 membrane which is consistent with previous findings li et al 2019b shin et al 2020 table 2 and fig 4b reveal the effect of cem electrolysis on the molecular weight distributions of nom the feed water and nf influents included three peaks peak 1 distributed in the range of 5 5 23 kda peak 2 distributed in the range of 1 4 5 5 kda and peak 3 distributed in the range of 200 1400 da studies cai et al 2020 guo et al 2020 huber et al 2011 have revealed that peak 1 is related to proteinaceous biopolymers and humic substances hs peak 2 is related to the building blocks of hs the intensity of peak 3 was positively correlated with potential nitrification and bacterial activity such as oxidised nitrogen concentration aliphatic polysaccharide and intermediate aromatic protein in water through n π transitions her et al 2008 liu et al 2010 cem electrolysis could generate fresh precipitate with organic adsorption and reduce the probability of bridging between nom and divalent cations which contributed to intensity reduction for peak 1 along with an mw decrease wang et al 2015 this result is consistent with the toc removal in this study mw enhancement of peak 2 and results of previous studies cheng et al 2017 guo et al 2020 because of the excellent nf steric hindrance behaviour the nf permeates only showed a major peak peak 3 and a minor peak peak 1 the enhancement of peak 3 intensity could be attributed to the hydrolysis of aromatic protein like substances and oxidation of nitrogen containing low molecules park et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the aforementioned results revealed that cem electrolysis could modify organic matter the fouling interaction of the modified organics differed from the control group 3 4 membrane fouling interaction 3 4 1 membrane surface morphology in our previous studies cem electrolysis has been found beneficial to membrane fouling of uf due to the adsorption of fresh inorganic particles and the supramolecularization of humic like substances wang et al 2021a the relationship between cem electrolysis and uf has been investigated in this work the fouling interaction on nf membrane following by the cem electrolysis uf treatment was mainly studied table 3 and fig 5 reveal that the virgin nf270 membrane exhibited a smooth surface and its average roughness ra was 5 7 nm the water contact angle wca of the virgin nf270 membrane was approximately 44 54 which is consistent with the reported result li et al 2019a after the operation of nf processes the fouled membrane surface exhibited rough morphology in the control group the ra of fouled membranes with distributed high peaks were measured to be 160 0 4 6 nm as the crystals covered the nf membrane song et al 2020 as seen in table s1 the numbers of atoms including ca and o were reduced with the electrolysis time besides s element content was also decreased in table s2 it can be speculated the cem electrolysis controlled the gypsum caso4 2h2o one of the most common constituents of scale content on the nf membrane wang et al 2016 furthermore the wca in the control group was reduced to 38 89 2 89 due to the coarse crystal particles such as caco3 and caso4 covering the nf membrane which was consistent with the previous study ashfaq et al 2020 after cem electrolysis as displayed from fig 5 and table 3 the ra reduced and wca enhanced for the nf membrane interface hs dominated nom fig 4 huber et al 2011 studies have revealed that the hs increased the wca to 60 66 lin 2017 yuan and zydney 2000 therefore the wca increased after cem electrolysis for 0 12 h the smooth peaks figs 5 6 on the membrane surface revealed that crystals decreased which resulted in higher wca than the control group as the hrt increased to 0 24 and 0 36 h the results of afm and the contact angle revealed that crystals could be removed because the closer contact angle and rms values were measured on the fouled membranes 69 62 43 9 nm hrt 0 24 h 64 54 34 9 nm hrt 0 36 h the hs embodied aromatic groups exhibited higher hydrophobicity than the hydrophilic nf270 membrane which is consistent with the aforementioned results lin 2017 nghiem et al 2008 in addition comparing the 2d afm and sem images microbe like substances accumulated on the surface of the membrane which might be due to microorganism regenerated during the 22 h nf process the atp content of the foulant layer on the nf membrane surface table s3 agreed with the above images as displayed in the sem images inorganic scaling on the nf membrane surface was considerably alleviated by cem electrolysis thereby exposing the morphology of organic matter thus cem electrolysis resulted in effective mitigation of combined membrane fouling inorganic scaling and organic fouling 3 4 2 membrane surface chemical composition after cem electrolysis uf treatment hs was the major foulants for the nf membrane as proved by the aforementioned results the front face eem was directly used to characterise the nf membrane unlike the hs fluorescence spectra solid phase hs did not exhibit any peaks in ff eem fig 7 the variation in hs fluorescence from the liquid to solid form was attributed to the strong inner filter effect resulting from the presence of highly light absorptive chromophores in hs yu et al 2019 the intrinsic fluorescence of polyamide membrane ex em 205 310 354 326 nm was quenched with foulants deposition with the prolongation of hrt the increased fluorescence revealed the high porosity fouling layer or thin nf membrane surfaces the results indicated the water channel numbers increased through cem electrolysis ftir analysis was conducted to verify the membrane surface chemistry change according to the ftir result of the virgin nf270 membrane fig 8 a the peaks at 1585 1488 cm 1 aromatic ring stretch 1294 cm 1 o s o asymmetric stretch and 1149 cm 1 o s o symmetric stretch were observed for the polysulphone sublayer balcıoğlu et al 2021 ben david et al 2010 kwon et al 2012 after 22 h nf operation the ftir spectrum revealed some variations the wide absorption band 2700 3700 cm 1 was attributed to the biopolymers and hs which contained numerous cooh and oh groups on the fouled membrane compared with the virgin membrane a new peak of 1639 nm was detected for the fouled membranes which corresponded to the protein secondary structure and was consistent with peak 3 of molecular weight distribution and sem images balcıoğlu et al 2021 furthermore an absorption band 1320 1530 cm 1 was smoothed which was related to the reduction of co2 3 saha et al 2013 the results showed the cem electrolysis can relieve the caco3 scaling on the nf membranes the fluorescence attenuation in the ff eem would be attributed to the light absorption or light shelter by particles yu et al 2019 meanwhile strong correlations between ftir intensity and thickness of the fouling layers were found in previous studies guo et al 2019 yan et al 2019 as the hrt prolonged from 0 to 0 36 h characteristic peaks o s o and aromatic ring on the virgin nf membrane were gradually exposed from the membrane samples in the ff eem and ftir spectrum the results showed the light shelter of membrane samples was reduced after cem electrolysis treatment and the light easily through the fouling layer of nf membrane interface therefore ff eem and ftir results revealed that cem electrolysis improved the water permeability of the nf membrane interface 3 4 3 xdlvo analysis table 4 lists the surface energy parameters and the interfacial free energy of cohesion amongst foulants δg 131 and between the foulants and membrane material δg 132 for δg 131 the positive value at 38 06 mj m2 revealed that foulants repelled each other and exhibited hydrophilicity and thermodynamic stability after cem electrolysis the δg 131 values that turned negative indicated the foulants with hydrophobicity which was in agreement with the results in fig 6 smooth foulants morphology covered with eps the hydrophobic foulants attracted each other forming a heterogeneous and porous fouling layer on the nf membrane wang et al 2017 with the prolongation of the hrt of the cem electrolysis to 0 24 h the lowest δg 131 implied the most potent attractive effect a further increase in hrt improved the ph level in the surface of nf membranes leading to the weak foulant attraction to each other regarding δg 132 positive δg 132 indicated repulsive interactions between foulants and nf membrane after 0 24 h of hrt negative δg 132 exhibited attractive interactions between the foulants and membrane an increase in the hrt to 0 36 h resulted in high ph 9 41 solution environment on the membrane which led δg 132 to turn negative again negative δg 131 and δg 132 revealed the self aggregation behaviours of foulants and repulsion between foulants and membranes respectively which resulted in excellent fouling tolerance this speculation is consistent with the flux permeability and afm morphology 3 5 mechanisms of cem electrolysis on nanofiltration and energy consumption the mechanisms of cem electrolysis on nf membrane fouling were proposed on the basis of the aforementioned results with cem electrolysis considerable ca2 and mg2 cations in the nf concentrate were removed fig 3 subsequently the bridges between divalent cations and nom were broken which resulted in smaller organic substances fig 4b and table 2 although the results of the fluorescence intensity and toc concentration exhibited limited removal effects on toc the nf permeate quality improved fig 3d and a furthermore cem electrolysis pretreatment enhanced nf membrane permeability fig 2b therefore cem controlled the interface characteristics of the nf membrane and improved nf performances the impervious scaling fig 6 fig 8a and table s1 and bridging effects were reduced on the nf membrane which resulted in a smooth organic substances layer biopolymers and hs figs 5 8 in the organic substances layer modified organic foulants attracted each other table 4 which increased the permeability of the nf membrane interface figs 7 8 to investigate the feasibility of cem electrolysis application to the nf process total energy consumption et kwh m3 was calculated e is the sum of running cem electrolysis e1 kwh m3 running uf e2 kwh m3 and running nf e3 kwh m3 as displayed in eq 1 by using the data recorded from dc power the energy of cem electrolysis was calculated with eq 2 the generated h2 gas and o2 gas in the cem electrolysis system can be reused in hydrogen fuel cells to reduce energy consumption in the future therefore after applying cem electrolysis of 0 12 0 24 and 0 36 h the energy consumptions of e1 were 0 435 0 771 and 1 230 kwh m3 respectively the uf process as post treatment for the electrolysis process was calculated based on the previous experiments with 0 096 0 156 kwh m3 of energy consumption e2 wang et al 2020a e3 in the control group called e3c was estimated using dupont s wave software the nf270 membrane elements and the initial chemical composition values of the nf concentrate used in the simulation were obtained from section 2 1 the daily flow and recovery rate were set to 10 000 m3 d and 90 with the e3c of 1 42 kwh m3 other e3 values in this study were calculated using eq 4 the energy consumption results presented in table 5 indicated the feasibility of using cem electrolysis for high concentration nfs for the higher salt concentration than

conclusions in this study cem electrolysis was performed before nf membrane treatment to investigate its effect on foulants removal and membrane interface characteristics the following conclusions can be drawn 1 cem electrolysis could maintain the nf membrane permeability at 6 01 8 41 lmh bar which was higher than that 123 211 of the control nf the energy consumption of the pretreatment was 1 230 kwh m3 which revealed its application feasibility to nf fouling control 2 cem electrolysis exhibited abilities on salt content decease 1344 to 970 μs cm ca2 mg2 softening 68 8 and 30 9 removal and elimination of bridging between nom and divalent cations which reduced the combined nf fouling from the perspective of removal performance the cem electrolysis did not damage the integrity of the nf membrane 3 membrane interface characteristics were controlled and revealed hydrophobic smooth and porous characteristics with the prolongation of hrt of cem electrolysis cem electrolysis contributed to the inorganic scaling alleviation dominantly leaving hs and biopolymers on the nf membrane surface 4 increased water channel numbers in the foulant layer of the nf membrane surface were obtained by prolonging the cem electrolysis pretreatment time despite the limited bridging effects the xdlvo theory demonstrated that the self aggregation behaviours of foulants on the nf membrane surface also

16561,the combined fouling effect prevalent in the nanofiltration nf process severely limits its use in this study cation exchange membrane cem electrolysis was performed to alleviate nf membrane fouling by controlling interface characteristics the results revealed that cem electrolysis hydraulic retention time with 0 24 or 0 36 h effectively improved nf membrane permeability by 201 211 and achieved a stability of 8 lmh bar the divalent cations were removed through cem electrolysis with a decrease in ca2 and mg2 by approximately 68 8 and 30 9 respectively which was related to scaling potential reduction this softening function reduced the possibility of bridging of organics with divalent cations which contributed to the lower molecular weight of organic matter mainly humic substances distributed in 1 4 23 kda the improved organic indicators of the nf membrane permeate quality implied that the membrane interface characteristics improved the foulant layer on the nf membrane dominated humic substances and biopolymers exhibited hydrophobic smooth and porous characteristics the self aggregation of foulants on the nf membrane surface stimulated the interface characteristics with high water permeability energy consumption confirmed the feasibility of cem electrolysis on nf application thus cem electrolysis as a chemical free approach that can be combined

notably membrane separation especially the nf process exhibits considerable potential for removing nf concentrates and a 99 recovery has been achieved almasri et al 2015 guo 2008 nevertheless membrane

heijmana et al used ion exchange resins to remove divalent cations before the nf process and reported that fouling caused by the bridging effects of ca humic substances was considerably diminished heijman et al 2009 imbrogno et al 2018 the addition of sodium bicarbonate for lime softening enhances the removal of divalent cations under high alkalinity and ph prevents scaling and alleviates combined membrane fouling comstock et al 2011 furthermore the addition of antiscalants such as ntmp hedp and pesa alleviates scaling by adsorption on the crystallisation surface yu et al 2020 however the main drawbacks of these strategies are the use of chemical reagents electrochemical softening has attracted considerable attention in the nf concentrate treatment because of its chemical free superiority simple manual maintenance environmental compatibility and intelligent operation sanjuán et al 2019 zöllig et al 2015 it is generally based on water electrolysis where oh ions are created with the assistant of electrodes and promote the precipitate formation calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxide effectively separating divalent cations based on a high ph condition with a little or without dosing extra ions sanjuán et al 2019 for overcoming undesired reactions of precursors or intermediate products in the electrochemical process cation exchange membrane cem assisted electrolysis cem electrolysis was developed to soften the salt solution pan et al 2020 in this system ca2 mg2 cations were concentrated into the cathode chamber to achieve a caco3 and mg oh 2 precipitation rate of higher than 90 díaz nieto et al 2019 in addition to softening the generated precipitates such as amorphous magnesium hydroxide enhanced organic matter removal and reduced the combined nf membrane fouling potential lei et al 2018 low cost high performance cation exchange membranes are conducive to the application of cem electrolysis chakraborty et al 2020 studies have shown that cem electrolysis might be a promising approach to controlling combined nf membrane fouling therefore in this study an innovative process integrating cem electrolysis and nf was developed to treat nf concentrate cem electrolysis was performed to preremove the divalent cations with the aim to regulate the pollutants in the feed and relieve the combined nf membrane fouling the nf process was used to remove the organic foulants and produce high quality reused water the cem electrolysis has been demonstrated to relieve the uf membrane fouling in the previous study wang et al 2020a to the best of our knowledge cem electrolysis for nf membrane fouling control including its practice feasibility and mechanism is not investigated therefore this study mainly investigated the feasibility of the hybrid process and evaluated nf membrane permeability and rejection performance the effect of cem electrolysis on nf membrane fouling was examined on the basis of interface characteristics including fouling morphology chemical composition and surface free energy this study provided theoretical and practical strategies for advanced treatments of nf concentrates and membrane fouling control 2 materials and methods 2 1 feed water in october the feed water was sampled from a pilot scale mf nf system which purifies the songhua river water in harbin china the nf concentrate discharged out of the nf modules was collected and filtered with 0 45 μm glass fibre filters xingya shanghai china and stored in the dark at 4 c before use the feed water sample had a ph of 8 2 0 3 42 4 mg l nom

the suspended substances and solids produced through cem electrolysis next the two effluents were mixed and used as the nf influent finally nf was performed for 22 h to monitor its flux permeability developments and membrane fouling permeate was collected to analyse the rejection performance of the nf membrane in stage i the feed water was treated using the cem electrolysis process and the anode and the cathode feed tanks were used to store the feed water fig 1b the feed water was continuously injected into the anode and cathode chambers 150 ml each which were separated by a cem nafion117 dupont usa various hrts were set to evaluate effects of electrolysis time on nf membrane fouling the anode was titanium plate coating with 1 μm platinum whereas the cathode was polished stainless steel the active areas of the electrodes were 10 cm2 and the distance between two electrodes was fixed at 25 mm the dc power it 6302 itech china was used to supply a stable current 10 ma cm2 after cem electrolysis the ultrafiltration membrane polyvinylidene difluoride material sinap china with a nominal membrane pore size of less than 0 1 μm was used ren et al 2021 after uf treatment the permeate flows were mixed and fed to the subsequent nf process the nf process involved a gear pump mrb170szklf jonsn china and a crossflow flat sheet membrane cell cf042d sterlitech usa a loose nf membrane nf270 dupont usa was used for filtration the nf module was driven under 6 bar of transmembrane pressure and a 64 l h of crossflow during filtration the temperature of the bulk solution was sustained at 20 0 5 c by using a temperature controller the nf permeate was recorded using an electric balance si 2002 denver usa and laptop the detailed information of nf process is presented in fig s1 2 3 membrane characterization after the nf process the nf membrane was naturally dried and stored for characterisation the main functional groups of pollutants on the surface of membranes were measured through attenuated total reflectance atr fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy spectrum one perkinelmer usa 2dshige software https sites google com site shigemorita home 2dshige was used to generate the two 2d cos maps including synchronous and asynchronous maps atomic force microscopy afm bioscope resolve bruker usa was used to characterise the membrane surface roughness scanning electron microscopy sem sigma 500 zeiss germany equipped with energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds x maxn oxford uk was used to analyse the membrane surface the excitation emission matrix eem spectra were generated through scanning with excitation wavelengths of 200 450 nm at an interval of 5 nm and emission wavelengths of 250 550 nm at an interval of 1 nm by using a fluorescence spectrometer f7000 hitachi japan the eem instrument used a front face sample holder with an incident angle of 30 orient koji china for characterising nf membranes based on the xdlvo theory the foulant foulant interaction energy of cohesion δg 131 and foulant membrane interaction energy of adhesion δg 132 were quantified to evaluate the membrane fouling mitigation mechanism caused by cem electrolysis chen et al 2012 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2017 in this study 3 μl of each of diiodomethane aladdin china glycerol aladdin china and milli q water was probed on the membrane surfaces with a microsyringe contact angles were measured using a contact angle goniometer sl200b kino usa six measurements were conducted at randomly selected locations for each membrane sample the interaction energy analysis results are displayed in table 1 to quantify the calcium sulfate scaling content the fouled nf membranes were soaked in the hcl solution ph 2 24 h and then ion concentrations in the

spectrometry optima 5300dv perkin elmer usa anions were detected with ion chromatography ic 3000 dionex usa high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec with online uv detection 210 nm was used to determine the distribution of the molecular weight of nom the mobile phase for hpsec was phosphate buffer solution 0 1 mol l nacl 0 002 mol l k2hpo4 and 0 002 mol l kh2po4 ph 6 85 and the flow rate was controlled at 0 4 ml min the it6302 dc supplier was used to record the resistance variation for cem electrolysis ibm spss statistics 20 software was employed to evaluate considerable differences using anova and the post hoc tukey s test p 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 flux permeability and conductivity variation the variations in nf membrane flux and the conductivity for each test are displayed in fig 2 fig 2a reveals that the conductivity of the nf influent decreased after cem electrolysis which revealed that cem electrolysis could mitigate salt accumulation on the nf membrane for the group without cem electrolysis pretreatment control group nf permeability was initially 6 81 lmh bar which continuously decreased to approximately 2 69 lmh bar after filtration for 22 h the control group membrane fluxes exhibited a higher flux decline rate than membrane fluxes treated with cem electrolysis which indicated severe membrane fouling by using cem electrolysis for 0 12 0 24 and 0 36 h the initial permeability increased to 7 14 7 41 and 7 46 as displayed in fig 2 such results were related to a relieved cp in the nf process caused by a decrease in the conductivity hoek and elimelech 2003 cem electrolysis 0 12 h hrt increased the final permeability after the 22 h nf process by 123 over the control group after the increase in the hrt to 0 24 and 0 36 h the permeability decline was marginal which could be attributed to the low scaling potential calcium cations and alkalinity were effectively removed by the cem electrolysis simultaneously and thereby calcium carbonate scaling was controlled and eliminated besides the saturation index si of gypsum was calculated based on equations s1 s3 in supplementary materials showing reducton of sigypsum from 0 42 hrt 0 h to 0 41 hrt 0 12 h 0 22 hrt 0 24 h and 0 15 hrt 0 36 h after using the cem electrolysis the scaling of gypsum was also relieved by the cem electrolysis when using the cem electrolysis with hrt of 0 36 h the slight increase in the nf permeability over filtration time was attributed to the swelling of membrane caused by electrostatic repulsion between the charged solutes ions and charged dom and the membrane itself showing the improvement of membrane interface characteristics lin et al 2019 sadrzadeh et al 2018 3 2 removal performance to reveal nf fouling the effects of cem electrolysis on removal performance were investigated with an increase in hrt to 0 36 h cem electrolysis exhibited considerable rejection of ca2 and mg2 that is 66 1 mg ca2 l fig 3 a and 47 2 mg mg2 l respectively fig 3b fig s2 shows the ph improvement in the cathode chamber and anode chamber during the stable electrolysis stage the cathode transformed the calcium cations into caco3 crystal solid which caused apparent reduction díaz nieto et al 2019 in the mg2 removal mechanism mg2 concentration decreased with the generation of amorphous magnesium hydroxide in the cathode chamber wang et al 2021a furthermore cem electrolysis considerably reduced the ca2 concentration which reached 7 5 11 7 mg l in the nf membrane permeate the average mg2 concentration in the membrane permeate decreased marginally fig 3c reveals that cem electrolysis did not considerably increase the na k cl and so 4 concentrations in the nf permeate the results revealed that cem electrolysis played a softening role the aforementioned removal performance revealed that cem electrolysis did not damage the integrity of the nf membrane to assess the feasibility of cem electrolysis the concentration of organic matter was measured although the cem cathode chamber of cem electrolysis generated mg oh 2 particles and adsorbed the organic substances the overall nom rejection of uf was limited at 5 1 8 fig s3 the results were agreed with the uf membrane flux trends fig s4 however the uf membrane rejection on nom was cem electrolysis exhibited negligible toc substance removal such a pretreatment reduced the toc concentration of the nf permeate which revealed that the organic removal behaviour on the nf membranes could be modified 3 3 fluorescence and molecular weight distributions of the nom cem electrolysis is typically used to remove organic compounds through adsorption acidic alkaline media and hydrolysis paidar et al 2016 wang et al 2020a the fluorescence and molecular weight mw distributions were used to evaluate cem electrolysis modification on the nom the eem spectra exhibited two major peaks fig s5 the peak intensity and location of each peak are displayed in fig 4 a peak a ex em 270 420 nm is dominated by humic like fluorescence which is similar to the humic like component reported in previous studies he and hur 2015 stedmon et al 2003 this component exhibited potential terrestrial sources such as nom derived from soils forested streams and wetlands and is negatively correlated with salinity in estuarine ecosystems ishii and boyer 2012 peak b ex em 330 420 nm was reported with an increasing detection frequency in freshwater environments and represented anthropogenic humic like substances that were resistant to photo degradation in surface waters jørgensen et al 2011 murphy et al 2008 the two peaks have been combined in numerous studies because both relate to humic like components fellman et al 2011 ishii and boyer 2012 murphy et al 2008 as displayed in fig 4a the total intensity in the nf influent increased and subsequently decreased with the hrt of cem electrolysis the slight toc reduction fig 3d implied that the fluorescent increase was mainly related to lower salinity fig 2a after cem electrolysis treatment when continuously prolonging hrt the cem electrolysis removed the humic like substance and eliminated fluorescent organic residues the fluorescence analysis of the nf membrane permeate revealed a negative correlation with electrolysis hrt more than 90 of humic like organic compounds were removed by the nf membrane which indicated the molecular weight distribution of fluorescence organics was higher than 500 da the molecular weight cut off of nf270 membrane which is consistent with previous findings li et al 2019b shin et al 2020 table 2 and fig 4b reveal the effect of cem electrolysis on the molecular weight distributions of nom the feed water and nf influents included three peaks peak 1 distributed in the range of 5 5 23 kda peak 2 distributed in the range of 1 4 5 5 kda and peak 3 distributed in the range of 200 1400 da studies cai et al 2020 guo et al 2020 huber et al 2011 have revealed that peak 1 is related to proteinaceous biopolymers and humic substances hs peak 2 is related to the building blocks of hs the intensity of peak 3 was positively correlated with potential nitrification and bacterial activity such as oxidised nitrogen concentration aliphatic polysaccharide and intermediate aromatic protein in water through n π transitions her et al 2008 liu et al 2010 cem electrolysis could generate fresh precipitate with organic adsorption and reduce the probability of bridging between nom and divalent cations which contributed to intensity reduction for peak 1 along with an mw decrease wang et al 2015 this result is consistent with the toc removal in this study mw enhancement of peak 2 and results of previous studies cheng et al 2017 guo et al 2020 because of the excellent nf steric hindrance behaviour the nf permeates only showed a major peak peak 3 and a minor peak peak 1 the enhancement of peak 3 intensity could be attributed to the hydrolysis of aromatic protein like substances and oxidation of nitrogen containing low molecules park et al 2019 wang et al 2020a the aforementioned results revealed that cem electrolysis could modify organic matter the fouling interaction of the modified organics differed from the control group 3 4 membrane fouling interaction 3 4 1 membrane surface morphology in our previous studies cem electrolysis has been found beneficial to membrane fouling of uf due to the adsorption of fresh inorganic particles and the supramolecularization of humic like substances wang et al 2021a the relationship between cem electrolysis and uf has been investigated in this work the fouling interaction on nf membrane following by the cem electrolysis uf treatment was mainly studied table 3 and fig 5 reveal that the virgin nf270 membrane exhibited a smooth surface and its average roughness ra was 5 7 nm the water contact angle wca of the virgin nf270 membrane was approximately 44 54 which is consistent with the reported result li et al 2019a after the operation of nf processes the fouled membrane surface exhibited rough morphology in the control group the ra of fouled membranes with distributed high peaks were measured to be 160 0 4 6 nm as the crystals covered the nf membrane song et al 2020 as seen in table s1 the numbers of atoms including ca and o were reduced with the electrolysis time besides s element content was also decreased in table s2 it can be speculated the cem electrolysis controlled the gypsum caso4 2h2o one of the most common constituents of scale content on the nf membrane wang et al 2016 furthermore the wca in the control group was reduced to 38 89 2 89 due to the coarse crystal particles such as caco3 and caso4 covering the nf membrane which was consistent with the previous study ashfaq et al 2020 after cem electrolysis as displayed from fig 5 and table 3 the ra reduced and wca enhanced for the nf membrane interface hs dominated nom fig 4 huber et al 2011 studies have revealed that the hs increased the wca to 60 66 lin 2017 yuan and zydney 2000 therefore the wca increased after cem electrolysis for 0 12 h the smooth peaks figs 5 6 on the membrane surface revealed that crystals decreased which resulted in higher wca than the control group as the hrt increased to 0 24 and 0 36 h the results of afm and the contact angle revealed that crystals could be removed because the closer contact angle and rms values were measured on the fouled membranes 69 62 43 9 nm hrt 0 24 h 64 54 34 9 nm hrt 0 36 h the hs embodied aromatic groups exhibited higher hydrophobicity than the hydrophilic nf270 membrane which is consistent with the aforementioned results lin 2017 nghiem et al 2008 in addition comparing the 2d afm and sem images microbe like substances accumulated on the surface of the membrane which might be due to microorganism regenerated during the 22 h nf process the atp content of the foulant layer on the nf membrane surface table s3 agreed with the above images as displayed in the sem images inorganic scaling on the nf membrane surface was considerably alleviated by cem electrolysis thereby exposing the morphology of organic matter thus cem electrolysis resulted in effective mitigation of combined membrane fouling inorganic scaling and organic fouling 3 4 2 membrane surface chemical composition after cem electrolysis uf treatment hs was the major foulants for the nf membrane as proved by the aforementioned results the front face eem was directly used to characterise the nf membrane unlike the hs fluorescence spectra solid phase hs did not exhibit any peaks in ff eem fig 7 the variation in hs fluorescence from the liquid to solid form was attributed to the strong inner filter effect resulting from the presence of highly light absorptive chromophores in hs yu et al 2019 the intrinsic fluorescence of polyamide membrane ex em 205 310 354 326 nm was quenched with foulants deposition with the prolongation of hrt the increased fluorescence revealed the high porosity fouling layer or thin nf membrane surfaces the results indicated the water channel numbers increased through cem electrolysis ftir analysis was conducted to verify the membrane surface chemistry change according to the ftir result of the virgin nf270 membrane fig 8 a the peaks at 1585 1488 cm 1 aromatic ring stretch 1294 cm 1 o s o asymmetric stretch and 1149 cm 1 o s o symmetric stretch were observed for the polysulphone sublayer balcıoğlu et al 2021 ben david et al 2010 kwon et al 2012 after 22 h nf operation the ftir spectrum revealed some variations the wide absorption band 2700 3700 cm 1 was attributed to the biopolymers and hs which contained numerous cooh and oh groups on the fouled membrane compared with the virgin membrane a new peak of 1639 nm was detected for the fouled membranes which corresponded to the protein secondary structure and was consistent with peak 3 of molecular weight distribution and sem images balcıoğlu et al 2021 furthermore an absorption band 1320 1530 cm 1 was smoothed which was related to the reduction of co2 3 saha et al 2013 the results showed the cem electrolysis can relieve the caco3 scaling on the nf membranes the fluorescence attenuation in the ff eem would be attributed to the light absorption or light shelter by particles yu et al 2019 meanwhile strong correlations between ftir intensity and thickness of the fouling layers were found in previous studies guo et al 2019 yan et al 2019 as the hrt prolonged from 0 to 0 36 h characteristic peaks o s o and aromatic ring on the virgin nf membrane were gradually exposed from the membrane samples in the ff eem and ftir spectrum the results showed the light shelter of membrane samples was reduced after cem electrolysis treatment and the light easily through the fouling layer of nf membrane interface therefore ff eem and ftir results revealed that cem electrolysis improved the water permeability of the nf membrane interface 3 4 3 xdlvo analysis table 4 lists the surface energy parameters and the interfacial free energy of cohesion amongst foulants δg 131 and between the foulants and membrane material δg 132 for δg 131 the positive value at 38 06 mj m2 revealed that foulants repelled each other and exhibited hydrophilicity and thermodynamic stability after cem electrolysis the δg 131 values that turned negative indicated the foulants with hydrophobicity which was in agreement with the results in fig 6 smooth foulants morphology covered with eps the hydrophobic foulants attracted each other forming a heterogeneous and porous fouling layer on the nf membrane wang et al 2017 with the prolongation of the hrt of the cem electrolysis to 0 24 h the lowest δg 131 implied the most potent attractive effect a further increase in hrt improved the ph level in the surface of nf membranes leading to the weak foulant attraction to each other regarding δg 132 positive δg 132 indicated repulsive interactions between foulants and nf membrane after 0 24 h of hrt negative δg 132 exhibited attractive interactions between the foulants and membrane an increase in the hrt to 0 36 h resulted in high ph 9 41 solution environment on the membrane which led δg 132 to turn negative again negative δg 131 and δg 132 revealed the self aggregation behaviours of foulants and repulsion between foulants and membranes respectively which resulted in excellent fouling tolerance this speculation is consistent with the flux permeability and afm morphology 3 5 mechanisms of cem electrolysis on nanofiltration and energy consumption the mechanisms of cem electrolysis on nf membrane fouling were proposed on the basis of the aforementioned results with cem electrolysis considerable ca2 and mg2 cations in the nf concentrate were removed fig 3 subsequently the bridges between divalent cations and nom were broken which resulted in smaller organic substances fig 4b and table 2 although the results of the fluorescence intensity and toc concentration exhibited limited removal effects on toc the nf permeate quality improved fig 3d and a furthermore cem electrolysis pretreatment enhanced nf membrane permeability fig 2b therefore cem controlled the interface characteristics of the nf membrane and improved nf performances the impervious scaling fig 6 fig 8a and table s1 and bridging effects were reduced on the nf membrane which resulted in a smooth organic substances layer biopolymers and hs figs 5 8 in the organic substances layer modified organic foulants attracted each other table 4 which increased the permeability of the nf membrane interface figs 7 8 to investigate the feasibility of cem electrolysis application to the nf process total energy consumption et kwh m3 was calculated e is the sum of running cem electrolysis e1 kwh m3 running uf e2 kwh m3 and running nf e3 kwh m3 as displayed in eq 1 by using the data recorded from dc power the energy of cem electrolysis was calculated with eq 2 the generated h2 gas and o2 gas in the cem electrolysis system can be reused in hydrogen fuel cells to reduce energy consumption in the future therefore after applying cem electrolysis of 0 12 0 24 and 0 36 h the energy consumptions of e1 were 0 435 0 771 and 1 230 kwh m3 respectively the uf process as post treatment for the electrolysis process was calculated based on the previous experiments with 0 096 0 156 kwh m3 of energy consumption e2 wang et al 2020a e3 in the control group called e3c was estimated using dupont s wave software the nf270 membrane elements and the initial chemical composition values of the nf concentrate used in the simulation were obtained from section 2 1 the daily flow and recovery rate were set to 10 000 m3 d and 90 with the e3c of 1 42 kwh m3 other e3 values in this study were calculated using eq 4 the energy consumption results presented in table 5 indicated the feasibility of using cem electrolysis for high concentration nfs for the higher salt concentration than

conclusions in this study cem electrolysis was performed before nf membrane treatment to investigate its effect on foulants removal and membrane interface characteristics the following conclusions can be drawn 1 cem electrolysis could maintain the nf membrane permeability at 6 01 8 41 lmh bar which was higher than that 123 211 of the control nf the energy consumption of the pretreatment was 1 230 kwh m3 which revealed its application feasibility to nf fouling control 2 cem electrolysis exhibited abilities on salt content decease 1344 to 970 μs cm ca2 mg2 softening 68 8 and 30 9 removal and elimination of bridging between nom and divalent cations which reduced the combined nf fouling from the perspective of removal performance the cem electrolysis did not damage the integrity of the nf membrane 3 membrane interface characteristics were controlled and revealed hydrophobic smooth and porous characteristics with the prolongation of hrt of cem electrolysis cem electrolysis contributed to the inorganic scaling alleviation dominantly leaving hs and biopolymers on the nf membrane surface 4 increased water channel numbers in the foulant layer of the nf membrane surface were obtained by prolonging the cem electrolysis pretreatment time despite the limited bridging effects the xdlvo theory demonstrated that the self aggregation behaviours of foulants on the nf membrane surface also

16562,assessing the transport and reactive processes of contaminants in freshwater streams is crucial in managing water resources sustainably particularly the hyporheic zone the sediment water interface where surface water and groundwater mix may possess significant contaminant removal capacities due to its myriad physical chemical and microbiological processes however modelling approaches aiming at assessing the hyporheic zone s reactivity are either based on simple assumptions such as predefining the shape of the residence times distribution rtd function or are computationally not feasible due to a too detailed system characterisation in addition parent daughter reactions of contaminants are barely investigated the present study introduces a numerical modelling framework for assessing hyporheic reactions of contaminant transformation reactions based on a non parametric residence time approach combined with multiple sorption models and first order removal reactions the proposed framework uses natural electrical conductivity fluctuations to determine conservative transport properties and is demonstrated by interpreting time series of hyporheic point measurements of trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products using two commonly used sorption models namely the simple retardation and the first order kinetic sorption model the developed approach gives similar reaction rate coefficient estimates for all contaminants considered for both sorption models tested the findings highlight that i the accurate shape of the rtd is most certainly important for reactive parameter determination and ii the daughter reaction rate coefficient may be underestimated if its parent transformation is ignored the model provides reactive parameter estimates of contaminant transformation reactions with high parameter identifiability and informs which specific parent daughter pathway has occurred keywords hyporheic zone trace organic compounds removal rates parent daughter simulation non parametric rtd sorption models plain language summary sediments of rivers may help to remove organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and by this help to improve stream water quality we present a novel approach to determine how fast certain contaminants are removed within the sediments of streams in addition the approach helps to inform to which compounds the contaminants are transformed 1 introduction the increasing occurrence of trace organic compounds trocs in aquatic ecosystems primarily originating from wastewater treatment plants poses an emerging threat to human and ecosystem health mezzelani et al 2018 richmond et al 2018 in streams the hyporheic zone hz the mixing zone of surface water and groundwater in the streambed sediment is often considered a hydrodynamically driven bioreactor findlay 1995 recent studies have shown the hz s significant removal capacities for contaminants such as pharmaceuticals lewandowski et al 2011 schaper et al 2018a 2018b determining the hzs contaminant removal capacity and its contribution to whole stream contaminant attenuation is vital for stream water quality management harvey et al 2013 to this end a number of modelling approaches describing the transport and biogeochemical processes in the hz engelhardt et al 2014 schaper et al 2019 trauth 2015 as well as conjunctive hz stream models fang et al 2020 knapp and cirpka 2017 liao et al 2013 mccallum et al 2020 have been proposed and implemented however modelling the transport and reactive processes in the hz is still challenging boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 a compilation of removal rates for 82 trocs from different experiments and field sites using different model approaches reveals a wide variation in calculated estimates greskowiak et al 2017 removal is influenced by redox conditions and residence times in the hz due to the hz s great heterogeneity solute reactive transport along the stream and within the hz occurs at multiple spatial and temporal scales molins and knabner 2019 current model approaches either implement too many details that may result into high computational cost low parameter identifiability and rather small scale investigations trauth 2015 or are based on simplifying assumptions that may assign inappropriate physical properties liao et al 2014 in regard to reactive transport modelling studies for streams and their hzs mccallum et al 2020 have recently demonstrated that reactive parameter estimates are highly sensitive to their underlying residence time distribution rtd function the rtd function is a common concept that takes on defined shapes when presuming certain transport properties of the system investigated leray et al 2016 for instance the commonly assumed first order exchange between the stream and their hzs results in an exponentially shaped rtd function bencala and walters 1983 however ginn et al 2009 strongly emphasise that the rtd function should be in the simplest case of homogeneous steady flow at least an inverse gaussian distribution which arises from the solution of the standard advection dispersion equation ade any simplifications below such as exponentially shaped are neither appropriate nor needed ginn et al 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 notes that even the classical ade framework introduces significant flaws if applied to heterogeneous systems hence any natural system thus berkowitz et al 2006 have stressed the need for more sophisticated transport characterisations in reactive transport modelling frameworks recent advancements in describing heterogeneous transport properties such as for the hz include the non parametric deconvolution approach engdahl et al 2019 the deconvolution approach provides two key benefits first specific to streams and applied to a conservative tracer the approach yields a non parametric rtd function describing the full heterogeneous transport processes occurring in the investigated system cirpka et al 2007 in other words this conservative rtd function informs the system s transport properties with directly observed concentrations of a conservative compound but without physical parameters eliminating the need for estimating any transport parameters and appropriately conceptualising the system s transport properties generally reduces the total model error i e approximates the optimum point between the errors introduced by the number of parameters and the underlying model concept used moore and doherty 2005 second the non parametric rtd function can be flexibly modified so that it includes parametric terms for linear reactive processes such as first order decay and two site sorption guillet et al 2019 liao et al 2013 however this powerful approach has rarely been applied for assessing the removal capacity of the hz for complex contaminants such as trace organic compounds trocs and their transformation products tps current studies have determined the hz s reactivity either for complex trocs such as pharmaceuticals using simplified assumptions for the hyporheic transport properties i e shaped rtd functions schaper et al 2019 or only for applied tracers considering the heterogeneous transport properties using non parametric rtd functions liao et al 2013 in addition sorption processes which can extend the exposure time to favourable conditions have barely been considered in determining the reactivity of trocs in the hz beyond that the joint simulation of specific parent daughter reactions of trocs and likewise the fate of the according tps is widely lacking for hyporheic sediments the overall objective of the present study is to develop a general reactive transport model to determine reactive parameters for complex reactions of trocs and their tps in the hz for steady state conditions the model is based on a conservative rtd function derived by non parametric deconvolution and modified so that it includes linear reactive processes similar to guillet et al 2019 and liao et al 2013 the modified rtd function is developed in laplace space which yielded a general solution for any linear reaction to be flexibly included the presented framework provides the capacity i to test different linear reactive models flexibly and ii to investigate complex reactions of trocs and their tps in the hz the approach is demonstrated for point observations of trocs in different depths in the hz considering two different sorption models namely the simple retardation model and the first order kinetic sorption model the non parametric rtd function is derived using naturally occurring electrical conductivity ec fluctuations as conservative tracer the main objective of this demonstration is to compare how the reactive parameter estimates vary with different sorption models used as well as whether or not any tps are considered simultaneously 2 model development 2 1 general concept the model approach is based on the transfer function theory that introduces a so called non parametric transfer function the transfer function characterises the net properties of an investigated system assuming linear and steady state conditions jury 1982 specific to streams the transfer function is equivalent to the rtd of compounds residing in the system liao and cirpka 2011 in particular the concept assumes that the occurring transport and reactive processes along the stream are creating a certain flow field fig 1 in other words the frequency and distribution of all flow paths occurring along the stream are a direct result of the stream properties in steady state the flow field can be interpreted as distribution of residence times a solute spends in the stream system in consequence the function describing the rtd informs the systems transport and reactive properties leray et al 2016 the rtd function can directly be obtained by deconvolving the input and output concentration time series of any compound cirpka et al 2007 any compound implies that its rtd function describes the net processes from the compound s interaction with the stream system for example using a conservative compound i e a compound that is only transported along the stream yields a rtd function describing the net transport properties of the investigated stream system without parameters in other words this so derived non parametric rtd function informs the conservative transport without a priori assumption on the rtd shape to simplify computation the rtd function is commonly derived in laplace space a conservative rtd function in laplace space reads as 1 g s c o u t p u t c i n p u t where g s is the laplace transformed conservative transfer function with the laplace variable s accounting for the transport properties c o u t p u t and c i n p u t are the laplace transformed measured output and input signals of the conservative compound used in the study here electrical conductivity working in laplace space introduces further advantages for instance parametric terms for specific linear reactions can be flexibly included in the non parametric rtd function using the mathematical method presented by villermaux 1974 in brief the laplace variable s describing the transport processes is replaced by a term containing the laplace variable s extended by parameters describing linear reactive processes the extended laplace variable s can be derived solving reactive transport models for instance as presented by liao et al 2013 for the two site sorption model this so modified rtd function is an equation that describes the complex transport processes without parameters and simultaneously includes parametric terms for specific linear reactions using this modified rtd function in a numerical model framework provides the advantage that only the reactive parameters have to be estimated for instance taking a reactive compound only undergoing a certain first order reaction as calibration target only the first order reaction rate coefficient has to be estimated the presented concept provides many advantages over existing models first compared to common approaches only reactive parameters are estimated whilst accounting for the full transport properties appropriately having less parameters to estimate not only speeds up computation but also increases parameter identifiability in addition simplifying assumptions of the hz such as uniform flow homogeneous medium or spatial invariant dispersion are not required using the presented non parametric transport transfer function second multiple linear reactive processes can be flexibly included and tested 2 2 governing equations the conservative rtd function describing the transport processes without parameters was derived using the method presented in cirpka et al 2007 in brief cirpka et al 2007 developed a deconvolution method that directly generates non parametric transfer function estimates i e rtd function estimates the approach uses a geostatistical method to impose smoothness and lagrange multipliers to ensure non negativity of the transfer function estimates the method assumes stationarity and has been well established for hzs liao and cirpka 2011 liao et al 2013 but also for other heterogeneous natural systems such as for groundwater kirchner et al 2000 and for bank filtration liao et al 2014 general information on rtds can be found in bruce nauman 1981 jury 1982 and leray et al 2016 in this study two different sorption models i e simple retardation and first order kinetic sorption were tested to determine the according reactive parameters for trocs and their tps in the hz the reactive parameters can be calculated for each flow path or rather residence time assuming i linear processes which enables the independent treatment of each flow path and its according measured concentration and ii steady state conditions which implies that each flow path equals a residence time to account for the frequency of each flow path the modelled concentration time series using the reactive parameter estimates are weighted with the conservative rtd function which informs about the frequency of occurring residence times beyond that treating flow paths independently mathematically encapsulates the dispersion term in the shape of the rtd function liao et al 2013 in other words the effects of dispersion are considered for reactive parameter determination without an explicit dispersion term in the equations the approach implemented is referred to in chemical engineering as segregation bruce nauman 1981 this approach however is valid for the reactions implemented in the manuscript zero and first order as the superposition principle holds details on the full derivation of the final general solutions for the parent and daughter compounds and the sorption models tested can be found in the supporting material sm 2 2 1 simple retardation model transport along a one dimensional 1d streamline including retardation adsorption and desorption and a general sink and source term chemical and biological reactions reads as 2 r c l t c l x v f where r is the retardation coefficient c l is the concentration of the compound investigated in the liquid phase m l 3 v is the velocity along one flow path l t 1 t is time t x is one flow path of the stream reach investigated l and f describes the sink source term which can take multiple forms m l 3 t 1 in the present study we focus on two examples i e parent and parent daughter reactions for parent compounds the general sink source term is assumed to be a first order degradation term i e initial mass is constant in contrast for parent daughter reactions the sink source term is the sum of the first order degradation of the daughter plus the first order degradation of the parent times the yield of parent compound degrading to the daughter compound i e initial mass of the daughter is not constant f parent λ p c l p daughter λ d c l d 1 i λ p i c l p i y p i d where λ p λ d are the first order reaction rate coefficients for the parent subscript p and daughter subscript d compounds respectively c l p c l d are the parent and daughter compound concentrations in the liquid phase respectively and y p d is the yield coefficient for the respective parent daughter reaction the yield coefficient represents the mass of the daughter product generated for the decay of a unit mass of the parent compound the subscript i indicates different possible parent compounds 2 2 2 first order kinetic sorption model transport along a 1d streamline including first order kinetic sorption and a general sink and source term can be described according to bahr and rubin 1987 as follows 3 c l t ρ θ c s t v c l x f 4 ρ c s t k f o r c l k r e v c s f s where c l m l 3 and c s m m 1 are the concentrations of the compound dissolved in the stream water and sorbed on the streambed matrix respectively note the different units for c l and c s the solid phase concentration c s is expressed as the mass of the compound for the unit mass of sediment ρ is the bulk density m l 3 θ is the porosity of the medium k f o r t 1 and k r e v m l 3 t 1 are the forward and reverse sorption coefficients onto the streambed matrix respectively f s m l 3 t 1 is a general sink source term for the streambed matrix and reads as f s parent λ s p c s p daughter λ s d c s d 1 i λ s p i c s p i y p i d where λ s p λ s d m l 3 t 1 are the first order reaction rate coefficients for the parent and daughter compounds on the streambed matrix respectively the first order reaction rate coefficients on the streambed matrix are equivalent to the first order reaction rate coefficients in the liquid phase corrected for the bulk density λ s λ l ρ note that the first order reaction rate coefficient of the simple retardation model includes both reactions in the liquid phase as well as on the streambed matrix due to the consideration of retardation processes in that the first order reaction rate coefficients of both models can be compared 2 3 parameter estimation the parameter estimation scheme for the reactive parameters is based on the dream algorithm presented by vrugt et al 2009 the algorithm is an evolutionary markov chain monte carlo approach for parameter uncertainty analysis and bayesian calibration in the present study the dream algorithm is only used as non linear optimizer to find the optimum parameter set using the maximum likelihood approach and considering prior ranges the maximum likelihood approach determines parameter values so that the underlying likelihood function is maximized in the present study the logarithmic likelihood function for normally distributed parameters consisted of the troc measurements and their measurement error and was defined as follows 5 l c m e a σ 0 n t r o c ln 1 σ t r o c 2 π 0 n t r o c 1 2 σ t r o c 2 c m e a c m o d 2 where n t r o c is the number of troc measurements c m e a and c m o d are the measured and modelled concentrations respectively σ is the measurement error for each troc where the largest error observed in the repeat measurements was taken schaper et al 2019 2 4 model implementation the developed model is implemented in the programming language python and uses the python message passing interface mpi package mpi4py by dalcín et al 2005 to speed up computation posterior estimates of the reactive parameters are determined by taking the best estimates of the reactive parameters for each realization of the conservative rtd the best estimates were obtained using the dream algorithm as a non linear solver for each realization the estimated reactive parameters from the chain with the current highest likelihood were taken after 100 samples the initial prior ranges for λ c l 0 c s 0 and r or rather k f o r and k r e v have covered several orders of magnitude and were assumed to be uniformly distributed compare sm table sm 1 in addition the parameter range for λ was log transformed and varied by six orders of magnitude assuming that the exchange between liquid and solid phase is fast relative to the flushing time the sorption parameters i e k f o r and k r e v from the first order kinetic sorption model can be translated into the retardation coefficient r from the simple retardation model according to bahr and rubin 1987 as follows 6 r 1 ρ θ k f o r k r e v 3 application to field data 3 1 erpe river dataset the present study demonstrates the novel model using data that has previously been published by schaper et al 2019 the objective of schaper et al 2019 was to determine first order reaction rate and retardation coefficients for trocs in the hz in particular the authors investigated the influence of retardation the benthic biolayer and organic carbon on the reactivity of the hz for the trocs investigated the authors used the 1d ade approach including first order reaction and simple retardation to interpret measured troc time series at different depths in the hz the ade approach assumes that the conservative transport was controlled by fickian transport which results in an inverse gaussian shaped rtd function ginn et al 2009 in addition the authors assumed steady and uniform flow in the hz time invariant dispersion as well as a vertical flow from the surface water into the hz i e insignificant horizontal flow components the latter assumption is in accordance with conducted temperature measurements indicating strong downwelling conditions the model was solved numerically using a finite difference scheme in two steps first estimating the transport parameters by taking paired sites of ec time series as calibration input whilst setting the reaction rate coefficient to zero and the retardation coefficient to unity second determining the reactive parameters using the troc data as calibration target and the previously estimated transport parameters as priors parameter estimation was done using the dream algorithm the experiment was conducted at erpe river an highly treated wastewater impacted lowland stream located south east of berlin germany in brief surface water samples were taken hourly for 47 h between 0 30 am on june 15th and 11 30 pm on june 16th 2016 pore water samples were taken hourly for 33 h between 7 30 am on june 15th and 3 30 pm on june 16th 2016 at four different depths i e 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm in the streambed sediment water samples were analyzed for 28 trocs including 7 tps dissolved organic carbon nitrate total dissolved iron manganese and ec ec and temperature were additionally measured adjacent to the troc sampling location using ctd divers van essen instruments b v netherlands at five minute interval one ctd diver was installed in a surface water stilling well 2 m upstream from the sampling location and four ctd divers were attached to metal tubes and inserted into the streambed sediment so that the ec measurement cell of the ctd divers was located in 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth below the sediment water interface the ctd divers were installed in approximately 10 cm distance to the troc sampling locations in an array perpendicular to the surface water flow direction to prevent sediment grains from clogging the diver s measurement cells the cells were covered with nylon socks the ec signal at erpe river shows characteristic diurnal troughs due to the large proportion of treated wastewater in the river and the pronounced diurnal cycle of the discharge of the wastewater treatment plant this characteristic pattern served as a natural conservative tracer in order to derive the hyporheic transport parameters a rain event prior to sampling enhanced these characteristic troughs on that note the stream discharge ranged approximatley between 0 25 and 1 25 m 3 d over the course of the experiment figure s 1 in jaeger et al 2019 which caused stream stage fluctuations i e non stationary conditions according to mccallum and shanafield 2016 the shape of rtds depends on the timing and magnitude of transient stream stage fluctuations we acknowledge that the presented model approach is only valid for stationary conditions and that this assumption is not met for the dataset used nevertheless the dataset is sufficient for the main objective of the presented study namely the development of a model that includes the non parametric transfer function concept and multiple sorption models flexibly further details on the experimental setup water sampling and analytical procedures can be found in schaper et al 2019 3 2 model interpretation in the present study the measured specific ec time series were used as conservative tracer to infer the conservative rtd function the dataset of schaper et al 2019 provides ec time series for all depths from two devices one from ctd divers located adjacent to the troc sampling locations providing observations at 5 min interval from 08 pm on june 14th to 12 am on june 19th 2016 and one using an handheld ec meter multi 340i wtw to measure the ec of the troc samples directly yielding measurements between 7 30 am on june 15th and 3 30 pm on june 16th 2016 at 1 h intervals comparing both ec time series shows that measurements from the same depth and in close proximity can be significantly different compare sm figure sm 3 therefore the direct ec measurements from the troc samples would be the accurate choice to derive the conservative rtd function as both measurements can be attributed to exactly the same location however the ec time series from the troc samples are too short in order to apply the deconvolution method in general the time series should i cover the time period before and during sampling and ii be at least twice as long as the expected frequency of the repeating characteristic pattern of interest therefore in the present study the conservative rtd functions were derived using the ec time series from the ctd divers despite their aforementioned limitation the ec dataset from the ctd divers is sufficient in order to test the developed model approach in addition the 10 cm depth measurements are fairly similar for both ec devices and thus generally suitable for reactive parameter determination the deconvolution of the ec surface water time series with each streambed sediment time series would give the conservative rtd functions describing the full transport processes occurring along the stream stretch until the respective sampling depth in the streambed sediment the conservative rtd functions for 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth however cannot be used to ultimately estimate the reactive parameters as the measured surface water concentration time series of the trocs are too short i e cannot inform all residence times occurring in the hz as a rule of thumb the width of the conservative rtd function equates to the minimum data requirement of the input time series i e troc surface water measurements prior to the characteristic tracer signal in the data for instance the rtd function for 20 cm depth varies between 0 and about 17 h meaning that the trocs may reside and undergo reactions in the hz for this period of time compare sm figure sm 4 in order to assess the trocs hyporheic transformation reactions the time series of the troc surface water measurements would need to contain measurements of at least 17 h prior to the characteristic trough from the rain event instead the troc surface water measurements only inform about 10 h prior to the trough therefore each time series was deconvolved with its subsequent deeper one i e 10 cm to 20 cm 20 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 40 cm fig 2 in that only the resulting rtd function for 10 cm depth accounts for the full range of flow path occurring i e the full transport properties along the stream stretch until the 10 cm depth point measurement in contrast the so derived rtd functions for 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm imply a 1d vertical downward flow this resulting assumption is also assumed by schaper et al 2019 and generally acceptable as strong downwelling conditions were reported at the study site in the present study 1000 realizations and the best estimate for the conservative rtd function were generated the troc measurements from schaper et al 2019 were used to demonstrate the developed model approach considering two different sorption models i e simple retardation and first order kinetic sorption in particular the developed model approach for the two different sorption models were used in a numerical framework taking the troc measurements as calibration target simulating compounds that are already present in the stream introduces the issue to define the initial sorbed concentration on the sediment matrix c s 0 in equations sm 16 and sm 17 in the sm which may alter due to river concentration fluctuations in the present study the reactive parameter estimates were found to be insensitive to changes in river concentrations compare sm section sm 7 the initial sorbed concentration on the sediment matrix was therefore simply included into the parameter estimation scheme the trocs acesulfame acs an artificial sweetener 4 formylaminoantipyrin faa a human metabolite of the painkiller metamizole and primidone pri an anticonvulsant were used for general model demonstration the four measured parent daughter pairs of trocs namely metformin mef an antidiabetic drug and its main tp guanylurea gua gabapentin gab an antiepileptic drug and its tp gabapentin lactam gpl metoprolol mtp a beta blocker ant its tp metoprolol acid mta as well as the antihypertensive drugs valsartan val olmesartan olm irbesartan irb and candesartan can and their common tp product valsartan acid vsa were used to investigate complex troc transformation reactions the aim was to compare the reaction rate coefficient estimates for the different sorption models used as well as for the daughter compound simulations considering i no parent compounds and i parent compounds simultaneously in order to derive advisable insights on the hyporheic net reactivity for complex troc transformation reactions only the results for 10 cm depth are discussed since they include the full heterogeneous transport properties section 3 2 the results for the according retardation coefficients and yield estimates are shown in the sm note that schaper et al 2019 only used a subset of their dataset i e did not use the 20 cm depth data and only used the last 17 h of their hyporheic troc measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative residence time distribution functions the measured ec time series show a distinct trough at about 15 h ec served as conservative tracer to infer the conservative rtd functions fig 2 a the solid lines represent the modelled ec time series derived by convolving the best estimate from each rtd function fig 2 right with its according input ec time series eq 1 for instance the 10 cm ec time series is modelled by convolving the surface water ec time series with the surface water to 10 cm depth rtd function doing so allows to validate the derived rtd function for each depth in particular if the modelled time series is in accordance with the measured one then the rtd function accurately represents the according properties the results indicate that all conservative rtd functions inferred represent their underlying transport properties well note that subsequent results for the 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depths ought to be treated with caution since their conservative rtd functions imply 1d downward flow which may not represent the actual transport properties the inferred conservative rtd functions range from 0 to 12 h 10 cm depth rtd function and 1 to 20 h others for frequencies up to 0 5 h 1 fig 2 b all conservative rtd functions show various peaks whereby their frequencies generally decrease for longer residence times the peaks of the 20 cm and 30 cm depth rtd functions are mainly overlapping while the 10 cm and 40 cm rtd functions have primarily distinct peaks the rtd function for 40 cm depth slightly increases after 20 h this is attributed to boundary effects from the deconvolution method indicating that the time series is too short to inform all occurring residence times in that depth overall the variety among the rtd functions and their multimodalities demonstrate the heterogeneity of occurring transport processes along the entire stream system 10 cm depth rtd function as well as vertically between different depths others in contrast commonly used shapes such as exponential power law and even the inverse gaussian distribution from the classical ade approach which was claimed to be assumed at least are certainly much simpler than the shapes of the rtd functions derived in the present study 4 2 general model performance the measurements of acs contain a significant peak at 20 h fig 3 which almost coincidently appear for the surface water as well as for the 10 cm and 20 cm depth measurements indicating preferential flow in contrast the measurements of faa and pri show a shifted trough towards later times with increasing depth between 30 to about 40 h note that the peak trough events were reproduced better for the 10 cm depth than for the 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm measurements which is attributed to the aforementioned limitations for the derivation of the according underlying conservative rtd function section 3 2 overall the model demonstration for acs pri and faa performed well for both the simple retardation and the first order kinetic sorption model in fact no major qualitative difference between the different sorption models tested can be seen the reactive parameter estimates using the different sorption models generally agree and are narrowly distributed fig 4 poor agreement and wide estimate ranges for the retardation and reaction rate coefficients are generally attributed to the lack of a distinct temporal pattern and a clear drop in concentration in the measurements respectively for instance the time series for faa and pri at 40 cm show no pronounced temporal pattern furthermore the time series for acs at 20 cm and 30 cm does contain a distinct peak but no temporal pattern i e both peaks appear coincidentially in regard to determining the sorption properties the first order kinetic sorption model is generally more sensitive to the lack of a clear temporal pattern i e results in wide parameter ranges in contrast the estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 compare poorly to the estimates using the two sorption models tested especially the reaction rate coefficient estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 mainly appear higher than the estimates in the present study schaper et al 2019 also used the simple retardation model assuming 1d downward flow as well as an inverse gaussian shaped rtd function comparing the inverse gaussian shaped rtd function with the actual shapes reported in the present study fig 2 suggests that the inverse gaussian shape introduces significant simplifications for the actual heterogeneous transport properties assuming simple transport properties and a 1d vertical flow path may have resulted in an overestimation of the reaction rate coefficient in addition considering the complex streambed heterogeneity and the resulting diverse flow paths distribution along the actual stream reach the lack of an increasing retardation coefficient with greater depths may be against expectations the low retardation coefficients reported by schaper et al 2019 as well as the according estimates at 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth presented in this study may result from the 1d downward flow assumption i e the assignment of short flow path lengths which may have constrained the extent of retardation processes according to a compilation of reported first order reaction rate coefficients for 82 trocs including acs faa and pri from several batch column and field investigations using hyporheic sediments estimates may vary by several orders of magnitude greskowiak et al 2017 greskowiak et al 2017 attributed the large variability in rate estimates to site specific microbial population as well as physical and chemical heterogeneities of the natural porous medium however the model demonstration presented highlights that the accurate shape of the rtd function is also most certainly important for reactive parameter determination and suggests that commonly used shapes are not ideal in order to conceptualise the heterogeneous transport properties of natural systems such as the hz in fact it is well known that the hitherto almost exclusively used ade framework and particularly predefined shapes for the rtd functions introduce some serious inadequacies if applied to heterogeneous systems berkowitz et al 2006 therefore the developed general reactive transport model provides a more sophisticated alternative to determine reactive parameters of contaminants or rather the reactive net properties of heterogeneous systems in particular if the dataset is of sufficient quality i e contains a pronounced temporal pattern and a clear drop in concentration the presented general model framework provides reactive parameter estimates with high identifiability even for different sorption models 4 3 reactive parameter estimates for parent daughter reactions the presented model approach performed well for single troc consideration however trocs are barely fully metabolized in the natural environment i e they are rather transformed to lower molecular weight compounds investigating trocs and their transformation processes i e parent daughter reactions is very challenging and has barely been done since tp can be produced from several parent compounds under various conditions the general model framework presented allows to consider the daughter production from several parent compounds however considering multiple parent daughter transformation reactions simultaneously encountered problems during parameter estimation in particular the reaction rate coefficient of the parent compound and its yield coefficient for the transformation to its daughter compound showed strong correlations a common approach to deal with highly correlated parameters during parameter estimation is to constrain one of the respective parameters constraining the yield coefficient is not applicable to the dataset used in the present study since the parent daughter reactions for trocs are highly complex in particular the yield coefficient for the same parent daughter pair is not constant and may vary due to many possible reaction pathways and kinetics however the prior parameter range for the reaction rate coefficients of the parent compounds may be sufficiently narrowed for instance the parent compound can be modelled individually in order to use the posterior parameter estimates as priors for the simultaneous parent daughter simulations doing so is only applicable if the total mass of produced daughter compound can be solely attributed to the reduction in mass of its respective parent compound in other words the measurements of both the parent and daughter compound have to cover the full time scale of their respective parent daughter reaction the reactive rtd function for each parent compound namely the modified conservative rtd function for the respective sorption model compare sm equations sm 7 and sm 16 informs about the aforementioned timescale for its reactive processes to occur the reactive rtd functions were derived by using the mean of the posterior parameter estimates from the individual parent compound simulations further details in sm section sm 5 for all parent compounds investigated in the present study reactions have generally occurred during the first 5 10 h compare sm figure sm 3 having a time series length of 33 h for the daughter compounds therefore allows the assumption that the daughter compounds would have been completely produced during the time period investigated this assumption enables to take the posterior parameter ranges from the individual parent simulations as priors for the respective simultaneous parent daughter simulations constraining the parameter ranges of the parent compounds for the simultaneous parent daughter simulations consequently mitigates issues with high parameter correlations the reaction rate coefficient estimates using different sorption models are similar for all parent and daughter compounds considered except for can irb mta mef and gua fig 5 poor agreement for can irb mta and mef is attributed to the lack of a clear drop in the according measured concentration time series compare sm section sm 6 in addition the large range of the estimates from the first order kinetic sorption model for mef may have affected the estimates for gua considering mef and gua simultaneously overall the reactive parameter estimation using the first order kinetic sorption model appears more sensitive to the quality of the measured time series i e wider parameter range due to no clear drop in concentration and no pronounced temporal pattern than the simple retardation model the estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 generally appear higher compared to the estimates using the two sorption models except for mef which is in the same range as the first order kinetic sorption model estimate from the present study the reaction rate coefficient estimates for the daughter compounds vsa gpl and mta appear higher if their parent compounds are simulated simultaneously for both sorption models tested this is reasonable since an overall higher mass of the daughter compound due to its parent production requires a higher reaction rate coefficient estimate in contrast the estimates of the daughter compound gua are rather similar for both simulation scenarios indicating that the reaction rate coefficient of gua is not dependent on the degradation of its parent compound mef this is against expectations since tisler and zwiener 2019 have reported that mef is almost exclusively transformed to gua one reason may be that the additional mass of gua which is produced by the transformation of its parent mef contributes relatively little to the total mass of gua for instance at 10 cm depth the molar mass of mef corresponds to less than 4 percent to the molar mass of gua to the best of our knowledge reaction rate coefficients of daughter compounds considering their parent compounds simultaneously has not been investigated for natural systems berkner and thierbach 2014 have suggested that many tps are significantly more stable than their parent compounds for instance vsa and val however in the present study the estimates for all daughter compounds considering their according parent compounds simultaneously were found to be in the same order of magnitude than the estimates of their according parent compounds for both sorption models tested this finding stresses the need for further investigations on the transformation potential of trocs and their tps under environmental conditions since tps may even pose a higher risk for water resources contamination than hitherto expected beyond that correlation plots for all reactive parameter estimates of the parent daughter pairs investigated reveal that the estimates are generally not correlated for both models fig 6 the strong correlation between the daughter reaction rate coefficient and the additional daughter mass produced by the transformation of its parent compound i e the yield coefficient is attributable to their linear dependency compare sm equations sm 8 and sm 17 however this strong correlation barely affects the accuracy of the daughter reaction rate coefficient estimates for instance the range of the reaction rate coefficient estimates of the daughter compounds are not significantly different for both scenarios fig 5 i e with and without accounting for the parent compounds note that this correlation is low for mef and gua due to the aforementioned insignificant contribution of mef to the molar mass of gua in addition the correlation plot of vsa and their four parent compounds consistently indicate that can contributed most and irb contributed nothing to their common tp vsa for both sorption models tested this finding highlights that the simultaneous consideration of trocs and their tps helps to inform if the respective parent daughter transformation has occurred along the system investigated or rather which parent compound contributed the most to the according daughter compound especially for the sartan trocs such as val olm irb and can there is an urgent need to investigate the relative contribution to their common tp vsa under environmental conditions nödler et al 2013 overall the correlation plot illustrates that the estimates from the model framework presented generally show low correlation indicating high parameter identifiability the high parameter identifiability is in accordance with the similar results of the reactive parameter estimates for both sorption models tested 5 conclusions and recommendations modelling the transport and fate of contaminants especially in the hz is challenging due to the hzs vast physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities the presented model framework performed well for various measured troc time series including simultaneous parent daughter consideration at different depths in the hz for the two sorption models considered the application of the proposed model framework to field measurements demonstrates the low total model error of the novel conceptual approach enabling reactive parameter determination of contaminants in heterogeneous systems with high parameter identifiability one key gap in modelling the transport and fate of contaminants in the hz is the appropriate description of the heterogenous transport and reactive processes in the conceptual model the presented general reactive transport model framework provides a sophisticated alternative to current approaches that ensures the accurate conceptualisation of transport heterogeneities and the flexible investigation of biogeochemical heterogeneities using state of the art parameter estimation uncertainty analysis and multiprocessing schemes beyond that the model reveals that the shape of the rtd function i e the proper representation of the transport properties is most certainly important for reactive parameter determination in heterogeneous systems in brief the two different sorption models that use the same accurate shape of the rtd function yield similar reactive parameter estimates whereas the two models using the same sorption approach but fundamentally differ in their rtd function give different results in addition the present study has shown that the actual conservative rtd functions are much more complex than commonly used shapes such as exponentially power law and even inverse gaussian shaped rtd functions i e differ significantly in shape and the range of occurring residence times for different depths this finding suggests that predefined shapes for the rtd function introduce flawed transport conceptualisations and are therefore not ideal particularly for reactive parameter determination in heterogeneous systems such as the hz in regard to the reactivity of trocs and their tps the findings highlight that the simultaneous consideration of parent daughter pairs is important for the reactive parameter determination of the daughter compound in particular the findings indicate that i the neglect of the additional daughter production from the according parent transformation may lead to an underestimation of the daughter reaction rate coefficient and ii the implementation of the parent daughter pairs may inform if the respective reaction pathway has occurred or rather if the parent has contributed to the daughter compound future studies investigating the reactive transport of compounds in heterogeneous media such as column experiments stream or groundwater sampling campaigns tracer studies can easily apply the novel model framework presented the key requirement is to obtain a sufficient time series of a conservative tracer showing a pronounced temporal pattern at a high sampling resolution at steady state conditions if no suitable naturally occurring conservative tracer such as characteristic ec fluctuations is present a tracer test with a conservative tracer can be conducted for instance a fluorescence or salt tracer test a major benefit of artificial tracers is that applied as dirac pulse or even as heaviside i e a sum of multiple dirac pulses the rtd function effectively equals the measured output concentration time series i e convolving the output time series with 1 in laplace space in regard to hzs höhne et al 2021 recently presented a novel device for in situ point measurements of fluorescent tracers in sediment pore water according to höhne et al 2021 future device development aims at providing automated fluorescence spectroscopy analyses in sediment pore water in real time such a device would not only provide measurements with a sufficient duration and resolution but also opens up the many applications of fluorescence spectroscopy applying the developed model framework to such a high quality fluorescence dataset may elucidate the biogeochemical functioning of hzs and ultimately their contribution to in stream water quality in general a good sampling design should meet the following minimum requirements first the conservative tracer and the according reactive compounds of interest need to be sampled at the same location second the time series of the conservative tracer has to cover the time before and during sampling the reactive compound of interest whereby the time period before the sampling has to inform at least one period of the target characteristic pattern for instance one period of the diurnal ec fluctuations in the erpe river lasts 24 h thus a decent dataset would require measurements for at least 24 h before the actual sampling of the reactive compounds in addition the measurement resolution has to be sufficient so that characteristic periods of the investigated system such as diurnal ec fluctuations are informed third the time series of the reactive compounds of interest ideally last for one period of the characteristic pattern however the upstream time series of the reactive compound should additionally contain measurements before the start of the downstream sampling of the reactive compound in particular the additional measurements should cover the time period which equals the width of the according conservative rtd function derived from the respective upstream and downstream measurements for the conservative tracer used for instance the surface water time series in the present study would have needed measurements at least up to 17 h before the actual sampling of the pore water along the diurnal trough to inform the

16562,assessing the transport and reactive processes of contaminants in freshwater streams is crucial in managing water resources sustainably particularly the hyporheic zone the sediment water interface where surface water and groundwater mix may possess significant contaminant removal capacities due to its myriad physical chemical and microbiological processes however modelling approaches aiming at assessing the hyporheic zone s reactivity are either based on simple assumptions such as predefining the shape of the residence times distribution rtd function or are computationally not feasible due to a too detailed system characterisation in addition parent daughter reactions of contaminants are barely investigated the present study introduces a numerical modelling framework for assessing hyporheic reactions of contaminant transformation reactions based on a non parametric residence time approach combined with multiple sorption models and first order removal reactions the proposed framework uses natural electrical conductivity fluctuations to determine conservative transport properties and is demonstrated by interpreting time series of hyporheic point measurements of trace organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and their transformation products using two commonly used sorption models namely the simple retardation and the first order kinetic sorption model the developed approach gives similar reaction rate coefficient estimates for all contaminants considered for both sorption models tested the findings highlight that i the accurate shape of the rtd is most certainly important for reactive parameter determination and ii the daughter reaction rate coefficient may be underestimated if its parent transformation is ignored the model provides reactive parameter estimates of contaminant transformation reactions with high parameter identifiability and informs which specific parent daughter pathway has occurred keywords hyporheic zone trace organic compounds removal rates parent daughter simulation non parametric rtd sorption models plain language summary sediments of rivers may help to remove organic compounds such as pharmaceuticals and by this help to improve stream water quality we present a novel approach to determine how fast certain contaminants are removed within the sediments of streams in addition the approach helps to inform to which compounds the contaminants are transformed 1 introduction the increasing occurrence of trace organic compounds trocs in aquatic ecosystems primarily originating from wastewater treatment plants poses an emerging threat to human and ecosystem health mezzelani et al 2018 richmond et al 2018 in streams the hyporheic zone hz the mixing zone of surface water and groundwater in the streambed sediment is often considered a hydrodynamically driven bioreactor findlay 1995 recent studies have shown the hz s significant removal capacities for contaminants such as pharmaceuticals lewandowski et al 2011 schaper et al 2018a 2018b determining the hzs contaminant removal capacity and its contribution to whole stream contaminant attenuation is vital for stream water quality management harvey et al 2013 to this end a number of modelling approaches describing the transport and biogeochemical processes in the hz engelhardt et al 2014 schaper et al 2019 trauth 2015 as well as conjunctive hz stream models fang et al 2020 knapp and cirpka 2017 liao et al 2013 mccallum et al 2020 have been proposed and implemented however modelling the transport and reactive processes in the hz is still challenging boano et al 2014 lewandowski et al 2019 a compilation of removal rates for 82 trocs from different experiments and field sites using different model approaches reveals a wide variation in calculated estimates greskowiak et al 2017 removal is influenced by redox conditions and residence times in the hz due to the hz s great heterogeneity solute reactive transport along the stream and within the hz occurs at multiple spatial and temporal scales molins and knabner 2019 current model approaches either implement too many details that may result into high computational cost low parameter identifiability and rather small scale investigations trauth 2015 or are based on simplifying assumptions that may assign inappropriate physical properties liao et al 2014 in regard to reactive transport modelling studies for streams and their hzs mccallum et al 2020 have recently demonstrated that reactive parameter estimates are highly sensitive to their underlying residence time distribution rtd function the rtd function is a common concept that takes on defined shapes when presuming certain transport properties of the system investigated leray et al 2016 for instance the commonly assumed first order exchange between the stream and their hzs results in an exponentially shaped rtd function bencala and walters 1983 however ginn et al 2009 strongly emphasise that the rtd function should be in the simplest case of homogeneous steady flow at least an inverse gaussian distribution which arises from the solution of the standard advection dispersion equation ade any simplifications below such as exponentially shaped are neither appropriate nor needed ginn et al 2009 berkowitz et al 2006 notes that even the classical ade framework introduces significant flaws if applied to heterogeneous systems hence any natural system thus berkowitz et al 2006 have stressed the need for more sophisticated transport characterisations in reactive transport modelling frameworks recent advancements in describing heterogeneous transport properties such as for the hz include the non parametric deconvolution approach engdahl et al 2019 the deconvolution approach provides two key benefits first specific to streams and applied to a conservative tracer the approach yields a non parametric rtd function describing the full heterogeneous transport processes occurring in the investigated system cirpka et al 2007 in other words this conservative rtd function informs the system s transport properties with directly observed concentrations of a conservative compound but without physical parameters eliminating the need for estimating any transport parameters and appropriately conceptualising the system s transport properties generally reduces the total model error i e approximates the optimum point between the errors introduced by the number of parameters and the underlying model concept used moore and doherty 2005 second the non parametric rtd function can be flexibly modified so that it includes parametric terms for linear reactive processes such as first order decay and two site sorption guillet et al 2019 liao et al 2013 however this powerful approach has rarely been applied for assessing the removal capacity of the hz for complex contaminants such as trace organic compounds trocs and their transformation products tps current studies have determined the hz s reactivity either for complex trocs such as pharmaceuticals using simplified assumptions for the hyporheic transport properties i e shaped rtd functions schaper et al 2019 or only for applied tracers considering the heterogeneous transport properties using non parametric rtd functions liao et al 2013 in addition sorption processes which can extend the exposure time to favourable conditions have barely been considered in determining the reactivity of trocs in the hz beyond that the joint simulation of specific parent daughter reactions of trocs and likewise the fate of the according tps is widely lacking for hyporheic sediments the overall objective of the present study is to develop a general reactive transport model to determine reactive parameters for complex reactions of trocs and their tps in the hz for steady state conditions the model is based on a conservative rtd function derived by non parametric deconvolution and modified so that it includes linear reactive processes similar to guillet et al 2019 and liao et al 2013 the modified rtd function is developed in laplace space which yielded a general solution for any linear reaction to be flexibly included the presented framework provides the capacity i to test different linear reactive models flexibly and ii to investigate complex reactions of trocs and their tps in the hz the approach is demonstrated for point observations of trocs in different depths in the hz considering two different sorption models namely the simple retardation model and the first order kinetic sorption model the non parametric rtd function is derived using naturally occurring electrical conductivity ec fluctuations as conservative tracer the main objective of this demonstration is to compare how the reactive parameter estimates vary with different sorption models used as well as whether or not any tps are considered simultaneously 2 model development 2 1 general concept the model approach is based on the transfer function theory that introduces a so called non parametric transfer function the transfer function characterises the net properties of an investigated system assuming linear and steady state conditions jury 1982 specific to streams the transfer function is equivalent to the rtd of compounds residing in the system liao and cirpka 2011 in particular the concept assumes that the occurring transport and reactive processes along the stream are creating a certain flow field fig 1 in other words the frequency and distribution of all flow paths occurring along the stream are a direct result of the stream properties in steady state the flow field can be interpreted as distribution of residence times a solute spends in the stream system in consequence the function describing the rtd informs the systems transport and reactive properties leray et al 2016 the rtd function can directly be obtained by deconvolving the input and output concentration time series of any compound cirpka et al 2007 any compound implies that its rtd function describes the net processes from the compound s interaction with the stream system for example using a conservative compound i e a compound that is only transported along the stream yields a rtd function describing the net transport properties of the investigated stream system without parameters in other words this so derived non parametric rtd function informs the conservative transport without a priori assumption on the rtd shape to simplify computation the rtd function is commonly derived in laplace space a conservative rtd function in laplace space reads as 1 g s c o u t p u t c i n p u t where g s is the laplace transformed conservative transfer function with the laplace variable s accounting for the transport properties c o u t p u t and c i n p u t are the laplace transformed measured output and input signals of the conservative compound used in the study here electrical conductivity working in laplace space introduces further advantages for instance parametric terms for specific linear reactions can be flexibly included in the non parametric rtd function using the mathematical method presented by villermaux 1974 in brief the laplace variable s describing the transport processes is replaced by a term containing the laplace variable s extended by parameters describing linear reactive processes the extended laplace variable s can be derived solving reactive transport models for instance as presented by liao et al 2013 for the two site sorption model this so modified rtd function is an equation that describes the complex transport processes without parameters and simultaneously includes parametric terms for specific linear reactions using this modified rtd function in a numerical model framework provides the advantage that only the reactive parameters have to be estimated for instance taking a reactive compound only undergoing a certain first order reaction as calibration target only the first order reaction rate coefficient has to be estimated the presented concept provides many advantages over existing models first compared to common approaches only reactive parameters are estimated whilst accounting for the full transport properties appropriately having less parameters to estimate not only speeds up computation but also increases parameter identifiability in addition simplifying assumptions of the hz such as uniform flow homogeneous medium or spatial invariant dispersion are not required using the presented non parametric transport transfer function second multiple linear reactive processes can be flexibly included and tested 2 2 governing equations the conservative rtd function describing the transport processes without parameters was derived using the method presented in cirpka et al 2007 in brief cirpka et al 2007 developed a deconvolution method that directly generates non parametric transfer function estimates i e rtd function estimates the approach uses a geostatistical method to impose smoothness and lagrange multipliers to ensure non negativity of the transfer function estimates the method assumes stationarity and has been well established for hzs liao and cirpka 2011 liao et al 2013 but also for other heterogeneous natural systems such as for groundwater kirchner et al 2000 and for bank filtration liao et al 2014 general information on rtds can be found in bruce nauman 1981 jury 1982 and leray et al 2016 in this study two different sorption models i e simple retardation and first order kinetic sorption were tested to determine the according reactive parameters for trocs and their tps in the hz the reactive parameters can be calculated for each flow path or rather residence time assuming i linear processes which enables the independent treatment of each flow path and its according measured concentration and ii steady state conditions which implies that each flow path equals a residence time to account for the frequency of each flow path the modelled concentration time series using the reactive parameter estimates are weighted with the conservative rtd function which informs about the frequency of occurring residence times beyond that treating flow paths independently mathematically encapsulates the dispersion term in the shape of the rtd function liao et al 2013 in other words the effects of dispersion are considered for reactive parameter determination without an explicit dispersion term in the equations the approach implemented is referred to in chemical engineering as segregation bruce nauman 1981 this approach however is valid for the reactions implemented in the manuscript zero and first order as the superposition principle holds details on the full derivation of the final general solutions for the parent and daughter compounds and the sorption models tested can be found in the supporting material sm 2 2 1 simple retardation model transport along a one dimensional 1d streamline including retardation adsorption and desorption and a general sink and source term chemical and biological reactions reads as 2 r c l t c l x v f where r is the retardation coefficient c l is the concentration of the compound investigated in the liquid phase m l 3 v is the velocity along one flow path l t 1 t is time t x is one flow path of the stream reach investigated l and f describes the sink source term which can take multiple forms m l 3 t 1 in the present study we focus on two examples i e parent and parent daughter reactions for parent compounds the general sink source term is assumed to be a first order degradation term i e initial mass is constant in contrast for parent daughter reactions the sink source term is the sum of the first order degradation of the daughter plus the first order degradation of the parent times the yield of parent compound degrading to the daughter compound i e initial mass of the daughter is not constant f parent λ p c l p daughter λ d c l d 1 i λ p i c l p i y p i d where λ p λ d are the first order reaction rate coefficients for the parent subscript p and daughter subscript d compounds respectively c l p c l d are the parent and daughter compound concentrations in the liquid phase respectively and y p d is the yield coefficient for the respective parent daughter reaction the yield coefficient represents the mass of the daughter product generated for the decay of a unit mass of the parent compound the subscript i indicates different possible parent compounds 2 2 2 first order kinetic sorption model transport along a 1d streamline including first order kinetic sorption and a general sink and source term can be described according to bahr and rubin 1987 as follows 3 c l t ρ θ c s t v c l x f 4 ρ c s t k f o r c l k r e v c s f s where c l m l 3 and c s m m 1 are the concentrations of the compound dissolved in the stream water and sorbed on the streambed matrix respectively note the different units for c l and c s the solid phase concentration c s is expressed as the mass of the compound for the unit mass of sediment ρ is the bulk density m l 3 θ is the porosity of the medium k f o r t 1 and k r e v m l 3 t 1 are the forward and reverse sorption coefficients onto the streambed matrix respectively f s m l 3 t 1 is a general sink source term for the streambed matrix and reads as f s parent λ s p c s p daughter λ s d c s d 1 i λ s p i c s p i y p i d where λ s p λ s d m l 3 t 1 are the first order reaction rate coefficients for the parent and daughter compounds on the streambed matrix respectively the first order reaction rate coefficients on the streambed matrix are equivalent to the first order reaction rate coefficients in the liquid phase corrected for the bulk density λ s λ l ρ note that the first order reaction rate coefficient of the simple retardation model includes both reactions in the liquid phase as well as on the streambed matrix due to the consideration of retardation processes in that the first order reaction rate coefficients of both models can be compared 2 3 parameter estimation the parameter estimation scheme for the reactive parameters is based on the dream algorithm presented by vrugt et al 2009 the algorithm is an evolutionary markov chain monte carlo approach for parameter uncertainty analysis and bayesian calibration in the present study the dream algorithm is only used as non linear optimizer to find the optimum parameter set using the maximum likelihood approach and considering prior ranges the maximum likelihood approach determines parameter values so that the underlying likelihood function is maximized in the present study the logarithmic likelihood function for normally distributed parameters consisted of the troc measurements and their measurement error and was defined as follows 5 l c m e a σ 0 n t r o c ln 1 σ t r o c 2 π 0 n t r o c 1 2 σ t r o c 2 c m e a c m o d 2 where n t r o c is the number of troc measurements c m e a and c m o d are the measured and modelled concentrations respectively σ is the measurement error for each troc where the largest error observed in the repeat measurements was taken schaper et al 2019 2 4 model implementation the developed model is implemented in the programming language python and uses the python message passing interface mpi package mpi4py by dalcín et al 2005 to speed up computation posterior estimates of the reactive parameters are determined by taking the best estimates of the reactive parameters for each realization of the conservative rtd the best estimates were obtained using the dream algorithm as a non linear solver for each realization the estimated reactive parameters from the chain with the current highest likelihood were taken after 100 samples the initial prior ranges for λ c l 0 c s 0 and r or rather k f o r and k r e v have covered several orders of magnitude and were assumed to be uniformly distributed compare sm table sm 1 in addition the parameter range for λ was log transformed and varied by six orders of magnitude assuming that the exchange between liquid and solid phase is fast relative to the flushing time the sorption parameters i e k f o r and k r e v from the first order kinetic sorption model can be translated into the retardation coefficient r from the simple retardation model according to bahr and rubin 1987 as follows 6 r 1 ρ θ k f o r k r e v 3 application to field data 3 1 erpe river dataset the present study demonstrates the novel model using data that has previously been published by schaper et al 2019 the objective of schaper et al 2019 was to determine first order reaction rate and retardation coefficients for trocs in the hz in particular the authors investigated the influence of retardation the benthic biolayer and organic carbon on the reactivity of the hz for the trocs investigated the authors used the 1d ade approach including first order reaction and simple retardation to interpret measured troc time series at different depths in the hz the ade approach assumes that the conservative transport was controlled by fickian transport which results in an inverse gaussian shaped rtd function ginn et al 2009 in addition the authors assumed steady and uniform flow in the hz time invariant dispersion as well as a vertical flow from the surface water into the hz i e insignificant horizontal flow components the latter assumption is in accordance with conducted temperature measurements indicating strong downwelling conditions the model was solved numerically using a finite difference scheme in two steps first estimating the transport parameters by taking paired sites of ec time series as calibration input whilst setting the reaction rate coefficient to zero and the retardation coefficient to unity second determining the reactive parameters using the troc data as calibration target and the previously estimated transport parameters as priors parameter estimation was done using the dream algorithm the experiment was conducted at erpe river an highly treated wastewater impacted lowland stream located south east of berlin germany in brief surface water samples were taken hourly for 47 h between 0 30 am on june 15th and 11 30 pm on june 16th 2016 pore water samples were taken hourly for 33 h between 7 30 am on june 15th and 3 30 pm on june 16th 2016 at four different depths i e 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm in the streambed sediment water samples were analyzed for 28 trocs including 7 tps dissolved organic carbon nitrate total dissolved iron manganese and ec ec and temperature were additionally measured adjacent to the troc sampling location using ctd divers van essen instruments b v netherlands at five minute interval one ctd diver was installed in a surface water stilling well 2 m upstream from the sampling location and four ctd divers were attached to metal tubes and inserted into the streambed sediment so that the ec measurement cell of the ctd divers was located in 10 cm 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth below the sediment water interface the ctd divers were installed in approximately 10 cm distance to the troc sampling locations in an array perpendicular to the surface water flow direction to prevent sediment grains from clogging the diver s measurement cells the cells were covered with nylon socks the ec signal at erpe river shows characteristic diurnal troughs due to the large proportion of treated wastewater in the river and the pronounced diurnal cycle of the discharge of the wastewater treatment plant this characteristic pattern served as a natural conservative tracer in order to derive the hyporheic transport parameters a rain event prior to sampling enhanced these characteristic troughs on that note the stream discharge ranged approximatley between 0 25 and 1 25 m 3 d over the course of the experiment figure s 1 in jaeger et al 2019 which caused stream stage fluctuations i e non stationary conditions according to mccallum and shanafield 2016 the shape of rtds depends on the timing and magnitude of transient stream stage fluctuations we acknowledge that the presented model approach is only valid for stationary conditions and that this assumption is not met for the dataset used nevertheless the dataset is sufficient for the main objective of the presented study namely the development of a model that includes the non parametric transfer function concept and multiple sorption models flexibly further details on the experimental setup water sampling and analytical procedures can be found in schaper et al 2019 3 2 model interpretation in the present study the measured specific ec time series were used as conservative tracer to infer the conservative rtd function the dataset of schaper et al 2019 provides ec time series for all depths from two devices one from ctd divers located adjacent to the troc sampling locations providing observations at 5 min interval from 08 pm on june 14th to 12 am on june 19th 2016 and one using an handheld ec meter multi 340i wtw to measure the ec of the troc samples directly yielding measurements between 7 30 am on june 15th and 3 30 pm on june 16th 2016 at 1 h intervals comparing both ec time series shows that measurements from the same depth and in close proximity can be significantly different compare sm figure sm 3 therefore the direct ec measurements from the troc samples would be the accurate choice to derive the conservative rtd function as both measurements can be attributed to exactly the same location however the ec time series from the troc samples are too short in order to apply the deconvolution method in general the time series should i cover the time period before and during sampling and ii be at least twice as long as the expected frequency of the repeating characteristic pattern of interest therefore in the present study the conservative rtd functions were derived using the ec time series from the ctd divers despite their aforementioned limitation the ec dataset from the ctd divers is sufficient in order to test the developed model approach in addition the 10 cm depth measurements are fairly similar for both ec devices and thus generally suitable for reactive parameter determination the deconvolution of the ec surface water time series with each streambed sediment time series would give the conservative rtd functions describing the full transport processes occurring along the stream stretch until the respective sampling depth in the streambed sediment the conservative rtd functions for 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth however cannot be used to ultimately estimate the reactive parameters as the measured surface water concentration time series of the trocs are too short i e cannot inform all residence times occurring in the hz as a rule of thumb the width of the conservative rtd function equates to the minimum data requirement of the input time series i e troc surface water measurements prior to the characteristic tracer signal in the data for instance the rtd function for 20 cm depth varies between 0 and about 17 h meaning that the trocs may reside and undergo reactions in the hz for this period of time compare sm figure sm 4 in order to assess the trocs hyporheic transformation reactions the time series of the troc surface water measurements would need to contain measurements of at least 17 h prior to the characteristic trough from the rain event instead the troc surface water measurements only inform about 10 h prior to the trough therefore each time series was deconvolved with its subsequent deeper one i e 10 cm to 20 cm 20 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 40 cm fig 2 in that only the resulting rtd function for 10 cm depth accounts for the full range of flow path occurring i e the full transport properties along the stream stretch until the 10 cm depth point measurement in contrast the so derived rtd functions for 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm imply a 1d vertical downward flow this resulting assumption is also assumed by schaper et al 2019 and generally acceptable as strong downwelling conditions were reported at the study site in the present study 1000 realizations and the best estimate for the conservative rtd function were generated the troc measurements from schaper et al 2019 were used to demonstrate the developed model approach considering two different sorption models i e simple retardation and first order kinetic sorption in particular the developed model approach for the two different sorption models were used in a numerical framework taking the troc measurements as calibration target simulating compounds that are already present in the stream introduces the issue to define the initial sorbed concentration on the sediment matrix c s 0 in equations sm 16 and sm 17 in the sm which may alter due to river concentration fluctuations in the present study the reactive parameter estimates were found to be insensitive to changes in river concentrations compare sm section sm 7 the initial sorbed concentration on the sediment matrix was therefore simply included into the parameter estimation scheme the trocs acesulfame acs an artificial sweetener 4 formylaminoantipyrin faa a human metabolite of the painkiller metamizole and primidone pri an anticonvulsant were used for general model demonstration the four measured parent daughter pairs of trocs namely metformin mef an antidiabetic drug and its main tp guanylurea gua gabapentin gab an antiepileptic drug and its tp gabapentin lactam gpl metoprolol mtp a beta blocker ant its tp metoprolol acid mta as well as the antihypertensive drugs valsartan val olmesartan olm irbesartan irb and candesartan can and their common tp product valsartan acid vsa were used to investigate complex troc transformation reactions the aim was to compare the reaction rate coefficient estimates for the different sorption models used as well as for the daughter compound simulations considering i no parent compounds and i parent compounds simultaneously in order to derive advisable insights on the hyporheic net reactivity for complex troc transformation reactions only the results for 10 cm depth are discussed since they include the full heterogeneous transport properties section 3 2 the results for the according retardation coefficients and yield estimates are shown in the sm note that schaper et al 2019 only used a subset of their dataset i e did not use the 20 cm depth data and only used the last 17 h of their hyporheic troc measurements 4 results and discussion 4 1 conservative residence time distribution functions the measured ec time series show a distinct trough at about 15 h ec served as conservative tracer to infer the conservative rtd functions fig 2 a the solid lines represent the modelled ec time series derived by convolving the best estimate from each rtd function fig 2 right with its according input ec time series eq 1 for instance the 10 cm ec time series is modelled by convolving the surface water ec time series with the surface water to 10 cm depth rtd function doing so allows to validate the derived rtd function for each depth in particular if the modelled time series is in accordance with the measured one then the rtd function accurately represents the according properties the results indicate that all conservative rtd functions inferred represent their underlying transport properties well note that subsequent results for the 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depths ought to be treated with caution since their conservative rtd functions imply 1d downward flow which may not represent the actual transport properties the inferred conservative rtd functions range from 0 to 12 h 10 cm depth rtd function and 1 to 20 h others for frequencies up to 0 5 h 1 fig 2 b all conservative rtd functions show various peaks whereby their frequencies generally decrease for longer residence times the peaks of the 20 cm and 30 cm depth rtd functions are mainly overlapping while the 10 cm and 40 cm rtd functions have primarily distinct peaks the rtd function for 40 cm depth slightly increases after 20 h this is attributed to boundary effects from the deconvolution method indicating that the time series is too short to inform all occurring residence times in that depth overall the variety among the rtd functions and their multimodalities demonstrate the heterogeneity of occurring transport processes along the entire stream system 10 cm depth rtd function as well as vertically between different depths others in contrast commonly used shapes such as exponential power law and even the inverse gaussian distribution from the classical ade approach which was claimed to be assumed at least are certainly much simpler than the shapes of the rtd functions derived in the present study 4 2 general model performance the measurements of acs contain a significant peak at 20 h fig 3 which almost coincidently appear for the surface water as well as for the 10 cm and 20 cm depth measurements indicating preferential flow in contrast the measurements of faa and pri show a shifted trough towards later times with increasing depth between 30 to about 40 h note that the peak trough events were reproduced better for the 10 cm depth than for the 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm measurements which is attributed to the aforementioned limitations for the derivation of the according underlying conservative rtd function section 3 2 overall the model demonstration for acs pri and faa performed well for both the simple retardation and the first order kinetic sorption model in fact no major qualitative difference between the different sorption models tested can be seen the reactive parameter estimates using the different sorption models generally agree and are narrowly distributed fig 4 poor agreement and wide estimate ranges for the retardation and reaction rate coefficients are generally attributed to the lack of a distinct temporal pattern and a clear drop in concentration in the measurements respectively for instance the time series for faa and pri at 40 cm show no pronounced temporal pattern furthermore the time series for acs at 20 cm and 30 cm does contain a distinct peak but no temporal pattern i e both peaks appear coincidentially in regard to determining the sorption properties the first order kinetic sorption model is generally more sensitive to the lack of a clear temporal pattern i e results in wide parameter ranges in contrast the estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 compare poorly to the estimates using the two sorption models tested especially the reaction rate coefficient estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 mainly appear higher than the estimates in the present study schaper et al 2019 also used the simple retardation model assuming 1d downward flow as well as an inverse gaussian shaped rtd function comparing the inverse gaussian shaped rtd function with the actual shapes reported in the present study fig 2 suggests that the inverse gaussian shape introduces significant simplifications for the actual heterogeneous transport properties assuming simple transport properties and a 1d vertical flow path may have resulted in an overestimation of the reaction rate coefficient in addition considering the complex streambed heterogeneity and the resulting diverse flow paths distribution along the actual stream reach the lack of an increasing retardation coefficient with greater depths may be against expectations the low retardation coefficients reported by schaper et al 2019 as well as the according estimates at 20 cm 30 cm and 40 cm depth presented in this study may result from the 1d downward flow assumption i e the assignment of short flow path lengths which may have constrained the extent of retardation processes according to a compilation of reported first order reaction rate coefficients for 82 trocs including acs faa and pri from several batch column and field investigations using hyporheic sediments estimates may vary by several orders of magnitude greskowiak et al 2017 greskowiak et al 2017 attributed the large variability in rate estimates to site specific microbial population as well as physical and chemical heterogeneities of the natural porous medium however the model demonstration presented highlights that the accurate shape of the rtd function is also most certainly important for reactive parameter determination and suggests that commonly used shapes are not ideal in order to conceptualise the heterogeneous transport properties of natural systems such as the hz in fact it is well known that the hitherto almost exclusively used ade framework and particularly predefined shapes for the rtd functions introduce some serious inadequacies if applied to heterogeneous systems berkowitz et al 2006 therefore the developed general reactive transport model provides a more sophisticated alternative to determine reactive parameters of contaminants or rather the reactive net properties of heterogeneous systems in particular if the dataset is of sufficient quality i e contains a pronounced temporal pattern and a clear drop in concentration the presented general model framework provides reactive parameter estimates with high identifiability even for different sorption models 4 3 reactive parameter estimates for parent daughter reactions the presented model approach performed well for single troc consideration however trocs are barely fully metabolized in the natural environment i e they are rather transformed to lower molecular weight compounds investigating trocs and their transformation processes i e parent daughter reactions is very challenging and has barely been done since tp can be produced from several parent compounds under various conditions the general model framework presented allows to consider the daughter production from several parent compounds however considering multiple parent daughter transformation reactions simultaneously encountered problems during parameter estimation in particular the reaction rate coefficient of the parent compound and its yield coefficient for the transformation to its daughter compound showed strong correlations a common approach to deal with highly correlated parameters during parameter estimation is to constrain one of the respective parameters constraining the yield coefficient is not applicable to the dataset used in the present study since the parent daughter reactions for trocs are highly complex in particular the yield coefficient for the same parent daughter pair is not constant and may vary due to many possible reaction pathways and kinetics however the prior parameter range for the reaction rate coefficients of the parent compounds may be sufficiently narrowed for instance the parent compound can be modelled individually in order to use the posterior parameter estimates as priors for the simultaneous parent daughter simulations doing so is only applicable if the total mass of produced daughter compound can be solely attributed to the reduction in mass of its respective parent compound in other words the measurements of both the parent and daughter compound have to cover the full time scale of their respective parent daughter reaction the reactive rtd function for each parent compound namely the modified conservative rtd function for the respective sorption model compare sm equations sm 7 and sm 16 informs about the aforementioned timescale for its reactive processes to occur the reactive rtd functions were derived by using the mean of the posterior parameter estimates from the individual parent compound simulations further details in sm section sm 5 for all parent compounds investigated in the present study reactions have generally occurred during the first 5 10 h compare sm figure sm 3 having a time series length of 33 h for the daughter compounds therefore allows the assumption that the daughter compounds would have been completely produced during the time period investigated this assumption enables to take the posterior parameter ranges from the individual parent simulations as priors for the respective simultaneous parent daughter simulations constraining the parameter ranges of the parent compounds for the simultaneous parent daughter simulations consequently mitigates issues with high parameter correlations the reaction rate coefficient estimates using different sorption models are similar for all parent and daughter compounds considered except for can irb mta mef and gua fig 5 poor agreement for can irb mta and mef is attributed to the lack of a clear drop in the according measured concentration time series compare sm section sm 6 in addition the large range of the estimates from the first order kinetic sorption model for mef may have affected the estimates for gua considering mef and gua simultaneously overall the reactive parameter estimation using the first order kinetic sorption model appears more sensitive to the quality of the measured time series i e wider parameter range due to no clear drop in concentration and no pronounced temporal pattern than the simple retardation model the estimates reported by schaper et al 2019 generally appear higher compared to the estimates using the two sorption models except for mef which is in the same range as the first order kinetic sorption model estimate from the present study the reaction rate coefficient estimates for the daughter compounds vsa gpl and mta appear higher if their parent compounds are simulated simultaneously for both sorption models tested this is reasonable since an overall higher mass of the daughter compound due to its parent production requires a higher reaction rate coefficient estimate in contrast the estimates of the daughter compound gua are rather similar for both simulation scenarios indicating that the reaction rate coefficient of gua is not dependent on the degradation of its parent compound mef this is against expectations since tisler and zwiener 2019 have reported that mef is almost exclusively transformed to gua one reason may be that the additional mass of gua which is produced by the transformation of its parent mef contributes relatively little to the total mass of gua for instance at 10 cm depth the molar mass of mef corresponds to less than 4 percent to the molar mass of gua to the best of our knowledge reaction rate coefficients of daughter compounds considering their parent compounds simultaneously has not been investigated for natural systems berkner and thierbach 2014 have suggested that many tps are significantly more stable than their parent compounds for instance vsa and val however in the present study the estimates for all daughter compounds considering their according parent compounds simultaneously were found to be in the same order of magnitude than the estimates of their according parent compounds for both sorption models tested this finding stresses the need for further investigations on the transformation potential of trocs and their tps under environmental conditions since tps may even pose a higher risk for water resources contamination than hitherto expected beyond that correlation plots for all reactive parameter estimates of the parent daughter pairs investigated reveal that the estimates are generally not correlated for both models fig 6 the strong correlation between the daughter reaction rate coefficient and the additional daughter mass produced by the transformation of its parent compound i e the yield coefficient is attributable to their linear dependency compare sm equations sm 8 and sm 17 however this strong correlation barely affects the accuracy of the daughter reaction rate coefficient estimates for instance the range of the reaction rate coefficient estimates of the daughter compounds are not significantly different for both scenarios fig 5 i e with and without accounting for the parent compounds note that this correlation is low for mef and gua due to the aforementioned insignificant contribution of mef to the molar mass of gua in addition the correlation plot of vsa and their four parent compounds consistently indicate that can contributed most and irb contributed nothing to their common tp vsa for both sorption models tested this finding highlights that the simultaneous consideration of trocs and their tps helps to inform if the respective parent daughter transformation has occurred along the system investigated or rather which parent compound contributed the most to the according daughter compound especially for the sartan trocs such as val olm irb and can there is an urgent need to investigate the relative contribution to their common tp vsa under environmental conditions nödler et al 2013 overall the correlation plot illustrates that the estimates from the model framework presented generally show low correlation indicating high parameter identifiability the high parameter identifiability is in accordance with the similar results of the reactive parameter estimates for both sorption models tested 5 conclusions and recommendations modelling the transport and fate of contaminants especially in the hz is challenging due to the hzs vast physical and biogeochemical heterogeneities the presented model framework performed well for various measured troc time series including simultaneous parent daughter consideration at different depths in the hz for the two sorption models considered the application of the proposed model framework to field measurements demonstrates the low total model error of the novel conceptual approach enabling reactive parameter determination of contaminants in heterogeneous systems with high parameter identifiability one key gap in modelling the transport and fate of contaminants in the hz is the appropriate description of the heterogenous transport and reactive processes in the conceptual model the presented general reactive transport model framework provides a sophisticated alternative to current approaches that ensures the accurate conceptualisation of transport heterogeneities and the flexible investigation of biogeochemical heterogeneities using state of the art parameter estimation uncertainty analysis and multiprocessing schemes beyond that the model reveals that the shape of the rtd function i e the proper representation of the transport properties is most certainly important for reactive parameter determination in heterogeneous systems in brief the two different sorption models that use the same accurate shape of the rtd function yield similar reactive parameter estimates whereas the two models using the same sorption approach but fundamentally differ in their rtd function give different results in addition the present study has shown that the actual conservative rtd functions are much more complex than commonly used shapes such as exponentially power law and even inverse gaussian shaped rtd functions i e differ significantly in shape and the range of occurring residence times for different depths this finding suggests that predefined shapes for the rtd function introduce flawed transport conceptualisations and are therefore not ideal particularly for reactive parameter determination in heterogeneous systems such as the hz in regard to the reactivity of trocs and their tps the findings highlight that the simultaneous consideration of parent daughter pairs is important for the reactive parameter determination of the daughter compound in particular the findings indicate that i the neglect of the additional daughter production from the according parent transformation may lead to an underestimation of the daughter reaction rate coefficient and ii the implementation of the parent daughter pairs may inform if the respective reaction pathway has occurred or rather if the parent has contributed to the daughter compound future studies investigating the reactive transport of compounds in heterogeneous media such as column experiments stream or groundwater sampling campaigns tracer studies can easily apply the novel model framework presented the key requirement is to obtain a sufficient time series of a conservative tracer showing a pronounced temporal pattern at a high sampling resolution at steady state conditions if no suitable naturally occurring conservative tracer such as characteristic ec fluctuations is present a tracer test with a conservative tracer can be conducted for instance a fluorescence or salt tracer test a major benefit of artificial tracers is that applied as dirac pulse or even as heaviside i e a sum of multiple dirac pulses the rtd function effectively equals the measured output concentration time series i e convolving the output time series with 1 in laplace space in regard to hzs höhne et al 2021 recently presented a novel device for in situ point measurements of fluorescent tracers in sediment pore water according to höhne et al 2021 future device development aims at providing automated fluorescence spectroscopy analyses in sediment pore water in real time such a device would not only provide measurements with a sufficient duration and resolution but also opens up the many applications of fluorescence spectroscopy applying the developed model framework to such a high quality fluorescence dataset may elucidate the biogeochemical functioning of hzs and ultimately their contribution to in stream water quality in general a good sampling design should meet the following minimum requirements first the conservative tracer and the according reactive compounds of interest need to be sampled at the same location second the time series of the conservative tracer has to cover the time before and during sampling the reactive compound of interest whereby the time period before the sampling has to inform at least one period of the target characteristic pattern for instance one period of the diurnal ec fluctuations in the erpe river lasts 24 h thus a decent dataset would require measurements for at least 24 h before the actual sampling of the reactive compounds in addition the measurement resolution has to be sufficient so that characteristic periods of the investigated system such as diurnal ec fluctuations are informed third the time series of the reactive compounds of interest ideally last for one period of the characteristic pattern however the upstream time series of the reactive compound should additionally contain measurements before the start of the downstream sampling of the reactive compound in particular the additional measurements should cover the time period which equals the width of the according conservative rtd function derived from the respective upstream and downstream measurements for the conservative tracer used for instance the surface water time series in the present study would have needed measurements at least up to 17 h before the actual sampling of the pore water along the diurnal trough to inform the

16563,calcium phosphate could be accumulated in aerobic granules which attracts attention recently for phosphorus removal and recovery from wastewater in this study partial nitrifying granules with high calcium precipitate content were sorted into different size groups for characterization and evaluation to reveal the dynamic balance of granules at stead state and relevant calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation mechanism it was found that light yellow small granules without calcium precipitates but high microbial activity co existed with deep brown granules with calcium precipitate of around 91 and low microbial activity characterization with specific oxygen uptake rates specific ammonium oxidation rates calcium and phosphate removal rates from solution eps contents elemental compositions by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem for different size groups of granules enabled a proposal of a new hypothesized mechanism for calcium precipitation and accumulation with this proposed mechanism it is believed that sufficient granule retention time in reactors was critical for the accumulation of calcium precipitates followed by a slow microbial growth rate of biomass due to mass transfer resistance the co precipitation of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate mainly occurred in granules with a size less than 710 µm while calcium phosphate dominant minerals were accumulated in granules larger than 710 µm the results and conclusions in this study shed light on the mechanisms of calcium phosphate accumulation in granules which could be used to better operate and control aerobic granular sludge with calcium phosphates for phosphorus removal and recovery keywords calcium phosphate hap nitrifying granules mechanisms size effects eps phosphorus removal and recovery 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is believed as a promising technology to replace conventional activated sludge cas due to its excellent settleability and biomass retention three dimensional structure and large size of granules are the key characteristics that lead to their superior performance meanwhile calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in granular sludge for wastewater treatment are widely observed and reported de kreuk et al 2005 etterer and wilderer 2001 mañas et al 2011 morgenroth et al 1997 although it is not exclusive to the granular sludge system maurer et al 1999 other types of minerals such as calcium carbonate magnesium or ferric precipitates could be formed and accumulated as well at some conditions the mineral precipitates in granules can reach as high as 60 70 which could reduce the microbial activity of granules liu et al 2015 yu et al 2019 but in many cases mineral contents in granules were in a reasonable range which did not affect wastewater treatment performance of bioreactors regarding cod and nitrogen removal but with the extra benefit of phosphorus removal de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 mañas et al 2011 mineral precipitation and accumulation are not just limited to aerobic granules any type of microbial granules such as anaerobic granules anammox granules and aerobic granules with without nitrogen and phosphorus removals could accumulate minerals among different types of minerals it was found that calcium precipitates are more likely to occur in granules even at a calcium concentration as low as around 20 mg l liu et al 2015 2016 when phosphate was present calcium phosphate could be precipitated and accumulated in granules with high phosphorus and calcium retention this phenomenon was often observed in anaerobic granules in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with obvious phosphorus removal capability when treating wastewater fukuzaki et al 1991 and in aerobic granules enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr with elevated phosphate concentration due to anaerobic phosphorus release de kreuk et al 2005 although calcium phosphate precipitation was reported in suspended sludge as well maurer et al 1999 based on this subsequently more and more interests become to be how to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater by promoting calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in anaerobic granules cunha et al 2019 anammox granules xue et al 2021 nitritation anammox granules johansson et al 2017 and aerobic granules li et al 2014 mañas et al 2011 thus it is believed that mineral precipitation in granules is not essentially controlled by a specific type of microorganisms although specific types of bacteria might affect the chemistry of the microenvironment in granules to stimulate mineral precipitation instead the structure of granules or granules characteristics could be the main reason to facilitate mineral accumulation because fast biomineralization of phosphate can easily occur in granules instead of flocs mañas et al 2011 to enhance calcium phosphate precipitation in granules calcium was dosed deliberately in some studies it is generally believed that high calcium concentration high phosphate concentration and high ph which could increase the saturation index of calcium phosphate are beneficial for calcium phosphate precipitation several mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the formation of calcium minerals in granules to better understand this precipitation process for phosphorus removal and recovery ma et al 2020 mañas et al 2011 pishgar et al 2020 yu et al 2019 some of these explained the mechanisms of calcium phosphate in granule cores based on the presumption that minerals incorporated with bio aggregates or bacteria attachment on the tiny inorganic minerals for biofilm growth or minerals deposited on the periphery of bio aggregates ma et al 2020 pishgar et al 2020 these mechanisms were based on the assumptions that the granulation or the growth of young and new granules at steady state were similar to the transformation of flocs into granules during the start up period and tiny mineral particles formed in the bulk solution first these assumptions were not always true because calcium precipitates in granules were observed as well when a bulk solution was unsaturated for example scanning analyses of the flocs and supernatant did not reveal any similar calcium phosphates as in granules mañas et al 2011 thus some researchers believed that chemical gradients in granules due to mass transfer resistance and localized biological reactions such as denitrification with increased ph or biological phosphate release in an anaerobic zone of granules as well as the presence of eps might create a microenvironment with increased saturation index of calcium phosphate in localized space of granules as a kind of biologically induced mineralization de kreuk et al 2005 mañas et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 it is obvious that no unified mechanism of calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in granules have been widely accepted so far this research thus aimed to explore the mechanisms of calcium phosphate accumulation in aerobic granules by investigating size effects of granules partial nitrifying granules were chosen for this study to rule out multiple biological reactions with only biological ammonium oxidation reaction dominant for its simplicity and specificity the ultimate purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanisms of calcium phosphate formation and accumulation in granules for better operation and control in practice to achieve targeted wastewater treatment performance and resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium the synthetic wastewater was made every day and it was composed of ammonium sulfate 400 mg nh4 n l 1 and di potassium phosphate 15

ca2 concentration between 100 and 150 mg l 1 the ph of synthetic wastewater was not adjusted but it was constant at around 7 2 7 4 2 2 inoculum and granules reactor operation the partial nitrifying granules from other experiments liu and cinquepalmi 2021 stored at 4 c for 3 months were inoculated into the sbr reactors for reactivation two perspex columns with a working volume of 2 6 l and a

were washed thrice with tap water to remove residual chemicals before the wet sieving was employed for granule sorting by size granules with a diameter range of 150 250 250 300 300 425 425 500 500 600

with corresponding pore sizes in diameter 2 4 biological batch tests of granules with different sizes for the evaluation of the microbial activity to ensure representative microbial activities granules with four different size ranges after size sorting i e 0 6 0 71 1 18 1 4 2 8 and 2 8 mm respectively were put into flasks each at with 300 ml synthetic wastewater as used for sbrs except that ammonium concentration was reduced to 100 mg nh4 n l 1 to avoid possible bacteria inhibition by free ammonia from high initial ammonium concentration mlvss in each flask was maintained at around 1 5 2 g l 1 the air was supplied via air stones placed at the bottom of the flasks with an aeration rate of 2 l min 1 after an overnight batch culture at 30 c overnight to activate the activity of nitrifing granules supernatant solution in each flasks was discharged and 300 ml fresh sysntethic wastewater was added to each flask to start another batch test with the same conditions to measure the microbial activity of nitrifying bacteria in granules in this batch test 1 ml of liquid sample was taken from each flask every 30 min for the analysis of nh4 no2 no3 po4 3 ca2 and na to evaluate nutrients and cation removal in duplicate the specific ammonia oxidation rate saor was calculated based on ammonium removal divided by the time spent to remove it over the biomass concentration for all size ranges

used to detect the dilution needed for eem analyses with the scanning range from 200 nm to 700 nm at 2 nm interval between each scan 3 results 3 1 nitrifying granules with different sizes and colors at a stable state after a two month operation inoculated partial nitrifying granules reached steady state at which svi5 of nitrifying granuels were less than 20 ml g 1 and the partial nitrifying granules could efficiently oxidize 400 mg nh4 n l 1 to nitrite with negligible nitrate within 4 h cycle time nitrifying granules at a steady state were sorted into different ranges of sizes by sieving it was found that there were two distinct colors of granules dominant in the size range of 150 250 µm as shown in fig 1 a one was light yellow while the other was deep brown with higher density and better settleability in addition sporadic black granules were observed and circled in red in fig 1a the sem analysis showed that most granules were typical microbial granules as reported in the literature but one was very special as shown in fig 1b this special granule was probably one of those sporadic black granules sem photo shows no cells at all and its shape surface and texture were more likely pure inorganic granules instead of microbial granules although it was not pointed out by the authors we observed similar sporadic black granules in granule photoes of the paper on anammox granules for simultaneous n and p removal by forming hydroxyapatite hap at high ca2 concentration ma et al 2020 light yellow granules were observed in other size ranges but the number of light yellow granules was much smaller than that in the sludge with a size range of 150 250 µm as shown in fig 1c even half light yellow and half deep brown granules were overserved or light yellow clusters protruded from the deep brown granules as marked by arrows fig 1d shows much clearer large cluster structure of granules with a size range of 1400 2000 µm from these observations and the cavity of the granule shown in fig 1d it seems that small light yellow granules could be the detached dense clusters from relatively large granules gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 reported similar cluster architecture of aerobic granules and believed that microbial clusters rooting from the interior of the mature granule structure mainly grow via biomass outgrowth and not by aggregation of small particles those large clusters with perturbated cell colonies are more exposed to fluid shear force to be detached off and thus serve as seed nuclei for the growth of a new granule gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 the cluster structure of granules was reported in different types of granules for wastewater treatment e g anaerobic digestion gonzalez gil et al 2001 aerobic granular systems for cod and n removal liu et al 2004 simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal systems lemaire et al 2008 oland vlaeminck et al 2010 and ebpr barr et al 2010 gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 3 2 microbial activity of nitrifying granules with different sizes and colors to understand the difference between these two types of granules in the same size range granules with the size of 150 250 µm were further sorted into two groups by density with one dominated with light yellow and the other dominated with deep brown granules sour results on ammonium oxidization in fig 2 show that the microbial activity of granules decreased with the increase in granules size when granule size was above 300 µm this result is in agreement with that reported by liu et al 2016 on sour with different heterotrophic granule sizes it is believed that higher mass transfer resistance in larger granules resulted in lower sour of granules thus lower sours of larger granules were fully expected however for granules with a size range of 150 250 µm they demonstrated distinct and opposite sours with light yellow granule having a sour of over 140 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 while deep brown granules having a sour of only less than 20 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 although they were in the same size range a similar sour of 120 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 for granule size of 106 212 μm was reported for heterotrophic granules liu et al 2016 and for nitrifying granules with even larger size xia et al 2007 but there is no any reports so far about the co existence of two distinct types of granules with the same size range but quite different in microbial activities since the amount of granules less than 600 µm was not much all granules less than 600 µm were combined and compared with the size ranges of 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 µm regarding ammonium removal rates in batch tests as shown in fig 3 the highest specific ammonium oxidizing rate was observed for the granules with a size range of less than 600 µm whereas a lower ammonium removal activity was detected for granules with the larger size the corresponding specific ammonium oxidizing rates saor were 0 843 0 328 0 299 and 0 236 g nh4 n g 1 mlvss d 1 as shown in fig 3a due to higher saor the granules with a size range less than 600 µm reduced nh4 to a negligible concentration within 180 min whereas it took 210 257 and 407 min for granules with size ranges of 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 µm respectively data now shownerror reference source not found since the batch tests with different granule size ranges show similar patterns only the results with granule size range less than 600 µm are illustrated in fig 3b it could be seen that nh4 no2 and no3 changes are typical for a partial nitrification system this is mainly because the seeds used to inoculate reactors were partial nitrifying granuels in addition high free ammonia from 400 mg l 1 ammonium in the sythethetic wastewater and short cycle time such as 4 h used inhibited the overgrowth of nitrite oxdising organisms in the 2 month operation period in this study during the nitritation processit is interesting to observe that both po4 3 and ca2 concentrations reduced for granules with size ranges less than 2000 µm calcium and phosphate removal efficiencies decreased with the increase in granule size since no organic carbon and anaerobic phase were provided in batch cycles there was no biological phosphorus removal in granules it was thus believed that calcium and phosphate were removed by forming calcium phosphate precipitates all batch tests show a quick decrease in both elements during the first 30 60 min of the batch cycles which is concurrent with a rapid increase in ph from 8 0 to 8 3 due to co2 degassing when ph decreased from 8 30 to 7 75 due to the nitritation phosphate continued to decrease while ca2 was relatively stable implying a less likelihood that precipitation of calcium phosphate occurred in the liquid more likely ca2 was adsorbed by granules more quickly than phosphate to a saturation value resulting in the precipitation of calcium phosphate in granules with a slower rate than adsorption after the nitritation ph increased again from 7 75 to 8 20 due to the degassing of co2 phosphate reduced continuously at a higher rate than the phase with ph decrease in the whole batch cycle ca2 and phosphate were removed with a ratio of 3 2 which was much higher than 1 67 ca p of pure hydroxyapatite thus it could be reasoned that calcium and phosphate co precipitated with other calcium minerals 3 3 physical characterization of nitrifying granules with different sizes to validate the reasoning of calcium phosphate precipitation and other calcium co precipitation in granules based on fig 3 physical characterization was conducted as shown in table 2 although ash contents of granules for size ranges 600 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 μm were similar i e around 75 89 granule density increased with the particles size almost linearly showing that larger granules had more compact structure the extremely high ash contents of granules with different size ranges indicated excessive mineral precipitation in partial nitrifying granules it needs to point out that synthetic wastewater composition and reactor operation in this study were quite similar to our previous work chen et al 2015 except for different water hardness levels of local tap water used to prepare synthetic wastewater in the study by chen et al 2015 ca2 concentration in tap water was only around 20 mg l 1 while it reached around 100 150 mg l 1 in this study in addition concentrations of minerals such as na mg2 fe3 in tap water were much lower than what we dosed k concentration in tap water was only 1 70 mg l almost negligible thus it could be concluded that the excessive mineral precipitation in the study was mainly caused by high calcium concentration in the tap water except for light yellow granules with a size range of 150 250 μm granules with size ranges from 150 to 710 μm had similar ash contents which were as high as 90 meanwhile it was found that ca and phosphorus contents in these granules were as high as 309 325 and 64 72 mg g 1 mlss with constant ca p ratios between 3 39 and 3 87 in table 1 which were very close to the ratios of ca p removed in the batch cycles shown in fig 3 when granule size was above 710 μm ash contents were lower with lower ca content but much higher phosphorus contents and ca p ratios in granules were in the range of 1 97 2 46 much lower than 3 39 3 87 xrd analysis of granules with different size ranges showed only two crystal inorganics i e hydroxyapatite and calcite but granules with large sizes showed more dominant hydroxyapatite than calcite which is consistent with the results of ca p ratios in granules the results from icp and xrd suggest that granule size affects co precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate the size effects on ash content in this study were quite different from that reported by liu et al 2016 in which ash contents increased with granule size until the size of 700 μm and ash contents stabilized when granule size above 700 μm but interestingly the cut off granule size in both studies on ash contents were around 700 μm it is very interesting to note that for the size range of 150 250 μm ash content in light yellow granules was as low as 2 9 while it reached 91 2 in deep brown granules although light yellow granules have the same size range with deep brown granules both calcium and phosphorus contents in light yellow granules were low without any crystalline detected by xrd this might explain the sour results in fig 3 that light yellow granules had much higher microbial activity with mainly active nitrifying biomass in granules but high ash content in deep brown granules might significantly inhibit the activity of biomass or there was more organic matters such as eps or dead bacteria than live nitrifying bacteria in deep brown granules from the similar ash contents but much lower sour value of deep brown granules with a size of 150 250 μm compared with granules with a size of 300 425 μm it is more likely that organic matters in deep brown granules were not active bacteria from this study we could see that two distinct types of granules co existed in the same reactor with one having high microbial activity and low ash content while the other having low microbial activity and high ash content based on our previous study liu and cinquepalmi 2021 on nitrifying granules by monitoring ash contents of granules from the granulation to the stable state newly formed granules had much lower ash content than mature granules thus it is reasonable to speculate that light yellow granules were newly formed fresh granules while deep brown granules had been staying in the reactor for a long time the finding of the co existence of light yellow granules without calcium minerals and deep brown granules with high mineral content could help elucidate the mechanisms of calcium precipitates in granules sem was conducted to observe the morphologies of granules no clear patterns were found among granules with different sizes but there was a similarity between them regarding the cluster characteristics of localized surface areas of granules it can be seen from fig 4 a that coccus accumulated with amorphous like inorganic deposits on the surface while fig 4b and c show rod type crystals embedded in eps and scalenohedral type crystals adjacent to eps and coccus respectively fig 4d shows net like eps with some inorganics no matter for bacteria inorganics or eps cluster characteristics were found in addition based on element analysis of large granules above 1400 μm by edx less calcium and phosphorus were found on granules surface while much more were in the cores of granules 3 4 extracellular polymeric substances in nitrifying granules with different sizes as shown in fig 5 tb eps contents were much higher than lb eps contents both poly protein gonzalez gil et al 2001 and polysaccharides feldman et al contents increased with the reduction in granule size the ps was found more than pn in smaller granules resulting in pn ps ratios of 0 29 0 71 0 78 and 0 88 respectively for granules with size ranges of less than 600 μm 710 1180 μm 1400 2100 μm and above 2800 μm cuervo lópez et al 1999 reported that pn played a more important role to maintain the stability of structure of anaerobic granules higher pn ps in larger granules might mean that maintaining the structure stability of large granules to avoid breakage could be more challenging thus higher pn ps was needed from table 2 it can be known that organic biomass contents in granules with different sizes were similar but fig 5 showed higher eps contents in larger granules this might imply that more eps was produced in larger granules to maintain the granule architecture the eps results in this study are different from those reported for heterotrophic granules with three size ranges such as 1 mm 0 5 1 mm and 1 mm with higher total eps content in smaller granules rusanowska et al 2019 the different types of granules i e nitrifying granules in this study and heterotrophic granules might be the reason for this difference the compositions of granular sludge lb and tb eps were analyzed by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and representative spectra are shown in fig 6 six regions for different eps components were described in table 1 peaks i and ii were mainly found in lb samples whereas peaks iii and iv were mainly present in tb samples peak i is generally related to the tyrosine aminoacids whereas peak ii represents the tryptophan aminoacids see table peak iv is commonly described as fulvic acid like substances whereas peak iii is described as polysaccharides chen et al 2003 wang et al 2014 wang and zhang 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2003 in addition peak v representing polyaromatic type humic acid was found in tb eps of granules with a size range less than 600 μm while not in granules with other sizes since granules with a size range less than 600 μm included light yellow granules which might contribute to peak v in general however eps compositions of granules with different sizes were quite similar indicating that eps compositions were independent of granule size although larger granules produced more eps 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of ca precipitation in sbrs with nitrifying granules calcium precipitation occurred in partial nitrifying granules except light yellow granules with a size range of 150 250 μm in this study calcium prepipates were also found in other types of granules it is believed that granules three dimensional structure and compact structure play an important for inorganic precipitates due to ph gradient other substrate gradients caused by mass transfer resistance eps in granules is also believed to relate to the adsorption of ca2 by negatively charged groups liu et al 2015 and phosphate adsorption by positively charged groups with eps as a phosphorus reservoir cloete and oosthuizen 2001 oosthuizen and cloete 2001 to facilitate calcium phosphate precipitation to understand calcium phosphate accumulation in granules different mechanisms on the growth of new granules and ca precipitates were proposed it is generally believed that flocs or aggregates formed by incorporating microbial cells and hap micro crystals formed in bulk solution due to the high si value of hap in the wastewater as granulation proceeds microbial cells in the inner part of the granules decay due to the substrate shortage and a hard core mainly consisting of hap and eps was formed ma et al 2020 when the crystallization speed in the reactor was higher newly formed crystals could cover the granule creating a granule with multi layers of inorganics ma et al 2020 this hypothesized mechanism highlights the precipitation of hap in the bulk solution and the incorporation of hap particles from the bulk solution into granules although si of hap is above 0 however mañas et al 2011 believed that confined conditions were more favorable for hydroxyapatite formation or accumulation than conditions in the bulk due to higher local phosphate concentration higher local ph and higher retention time for granules via a biologically induced mineralization mechanism the identification of several phylotypes some even not isolated in pure culture described as potential mineral precipitating bacteria in autotrophic granular sludge made the authors gonzalez martinez et al 2017 speculate that precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate might relate to microbial species however our results in this study about the co existence of light yellow granules without precipitates and deep brown granules with high hap precipitates could not be fully explained by any of these hypothesized mechanisms of ca precipitates in granules our previous work on the excessive caco3 precipitation in aerobic granules after the operation mode was changed from sequential batch to continuous mode liu et al 2015 was unable to be explained by these hypotheses either the absolute retention of granules in an airlift reactor after sbr changed to continuous mode with extended granule retention time and inferior growth competition to flocs liu et al 2015 could be the main factor for the accumulation of calcium precipitates in granules in addition we found that the ash content of partial nitrifying granules increased gradually over time after granular sludge was just formed with the extended granule retention time and reduced microbial growth rate due to mass transfer resistance liu and cinquepalmi 2021 in addition it has been reported that at the exactly same operational conditions including ca2 and phosphate concentrations except for srt aerobic granules for cod removal with low srt and high microbial growth rate got 10 ca p precipitates while long srt resulted in 30 ca p precipitates liu et al 2019 in a full scale anammox reactor 60 ash content of granules located at the bottom of the reactor which co existed with the granules at the top of the reactor with only 10 ash content lin et al 2013 ab halim et al 2016 reported higher phosphorus accumulation in the matured aerobic granules long retention time than the young granules short retention time at three different temperatures in addition ca p precipitates in heterotrophic granules liu et al 2019 were much lower than those in partial nitrifying granules in this study even ca2 and phosphate concentrations were similar this could be due to the much higher microbial growth rate of heterotrophic granules than nitrifying granules from these reports and the co existence of light yellow granules and deep brown granules in this study we thus assume that long granule retention time and slow microbial growth rate are more important than other factors on the accumulation of inorganic precipitates in granules and these two factors could be prerequisites for the accumulation of inorganics in nitrifying granules due to this it is believed that the new growth of nitrifying granules at a stable state might be different from the granulation stage in our study at the steady state we observed spherical clusters rooting from old and large granules were detached to form new granules as shown in fig 1 in this case there are much fewer chances for flocs and inorganic precipitate particles to incorporate into new granules furthermore for different granular sludge systems such as anammox nitrifying granules anaerobic granules heterotrophic granules the calcium precipitation and accumulation in granules might be slightly different due to different microbial activity such as cod oxidation nitrification denitrification biological phosphorus release or uptake in nitrifying granules with only ammonium oxidation in this study based on physical chemical and microbial analysis a hypothesized mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 7 at a steady state the sludge was a mixture of granules with different sizes and colors fresh and young granules are mainly dense clusters detached from large granules which have much higher nitrifying activity microbial growth rate due to less mass transfer resistance and very low ash content i e without calcium precipitation in granules at steady state large granules might also disintegrate due to the hard and dense inorganic precipitates in the cores which could result in inorganic granules as shown in fig 1b and larger light yellow granules as shown in fig 1c when the retention of granules in reactors is long enough the granules adsorb ca2 phosphate and or carbonate to form calcium precipitates in multiple clusters inside of granules as sem images of granules shown by lin et al 2013 mañas et al 2011 this could explain why we observed localized cells and inorganics clusters as shown in fig 4 when granule retention time is further prolonged inorganic clusters could grow and integrate into one large core while nitrifying bacteria only grow in the out layer due to the resistance of mass transfer when the out layer bacteria grow unevenly granules might disintegrate to form inorganic particles with little organics and fresh light yellow granules in this way the granular sludge establishes a dynamic balance between granules with different sizes and microbial activities to maintain a stable average granule size microbial activity and ash content as a whole under the same operational condition we observed that the ash content of granules only gradually increased to stable values after one month of complete granulation liu and cinquepalmi 2021 which supports the hypothesized mechanism proposed in fig 7 it needs to point out that srt in aerobic granule reactors is average value calculated from washed out biomass and biomass in reactors since flocs and small loose granuels are more likely to be washed out while dense and or large granules are easier to be retentioned in reactors srt in aerobic granule reactors might not necessarily be able to represent the real retention time of specific type of granules in reactors thus we prefer to use granule retention time to represent the real granule rentetion time in fig 7 4 2 co precipitation of caco3 and ca p or ca p dominant precipitation in nitrifying granules in this study bicarbonate was provided as an inorganic carbon source as well as a buffer for ph the equilibrium between bicarbonate and carbonate resulted in higher carbonate concentration at alkaline condition it has been reported that the presence of alkalinity either as hco3 or co3 2 can lead to a competitive reaction to that of ca p formation by removing available ca2 to form caco3 chazarenc et al 2007 kim et al 2006 but according to the batch cycle analysis shown in fig 3b ca2 in wastewater was sufficient without the concern of ca2 competition between caco3 and ca p other factors might play more important roles song et al 2002 reported that at ph values of 9 or higher calcium phosphate precipitation would be preferred to caco3 in the presence of co3 2 whereas at ph lower than 8 or higher than 10 the two minerals would interfere or co precipitate according to fig 3 ph in bulk solution varied from 7 75 to 8 30 thus there were chances for co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate from table 2 it can be seen that ca p ratios in all granules with different sizes were larger than 1 67 i e the ratio of pure hydroxyapatite indicating the co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate this was also validated by xrd analysis ca p ratios were much larger and p contents were lower in granules with a size range less than 710 µm implying more caco3 co precipitated in relatively smaller granules this suggests that granule size affects the co precipitation probably from the aspects of interior ph in granules and eps contents although both ca p ratio in wastewater and bulk ph were the same the interior ph in the microenvironment of granules could be different in granules with different sizes due to the different mass transfer resistance liu et al 2005 reported that mass transfer resistance was size dependent and when granules size was over 700 µm mass transfer resistance played an important role it could thus be reasonably speculated that ph in granules with different sizes might be different resulting in co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate or calcium phosphate dominant precipitation in the presence of carbonate depending on granule size the caco3 co precipitation could be more favorable within the smaller granules probably due to less ph difference from bulk ph i e 7 75 8 30 and less mass transfer resistance than larger granules furthermore ca2 could bind with the protein of eps in the matrix and thus bridge extracellular proteins and strength granule structure sheng et al 2013 according to table 2 larger granules above 700 µm had higher p content and lower ca p ratio near to cap with more hydroxyapatite accumulated in this study the density of granules with large sizes table 2 was much higher with a corresponding higher eps amount fig 5 when ca2 was binding with eps more eps in larger granules as seen in fig 5 might lead to higher localized ca2 concentration and higher localized ca p ratio facilitating more cap precipitation as cunha et al 2018 reported that higher ca p is beneficial to ca p precipitation 4 3 potential of phosphorus removal and recovery by forming ca p in microbial granules in biological wastewater treatment reactors such as uasb cunha et al 2018 tervahauta et al 2014 anammox reactors ma et al 2020 or aerobic granules reactors calcium phosphate precipitates with without the addition of calcium were usually present in the core of granules with the out layer as organic matters at least more than 20 to play microbial functional roles furthermore calcium carbonate could co precipitate with calcium phosphate in granules let alone the presence of other metal ions in wastewater which might precipitate as well thus the presence of impurity is a protential problem for the downstream processing for phosphorus recovery when using acids to dissolve phosphate because an extra amount of acid is needed to oxidize organics and or dissolve other inorganics although it was found that calcium phosphate content in granules with a size of above 710 µm could be higher compared with smaller granules there are no strategies developed so far that could be used to well control granule size until now there has little research on phosphorus recovery from microbial granules forming calcium phosphate in microbial granules for phosphorus recovery is still away from a real application in practice secondly the main function of microbial granules is to carry out biological reactions calcium phosphate formation is an additional benefit for simultaneous phosphorus removal however the accumulation of inorganics in granules could reduce microbial activity like reported in this study and by other researchers feldman et al 2019 liu et al 2016 van langerak et al 2000 xing et al 2015 yu et al 2019 in addition too much mineral content could cement sludge limit diffusion and dilute the active biomass batstone et al 2002 the instability of microbial granules with high calcium phosphate content was observed as well xue et al 2020 reported deteriorated settling velocity of anammox hap granules sludge bulking and flotation at the condition of ca2 of 82 mg l 1 and 5 7 mg p l 1 although authors attributed it to the low phosphate concentration in the anammox reactor it is hard to know if it was caused by the long term instability of hap rich anammox granules with ash content as high as 80 the instability of microbial granules with calcium phosphate might be related to high ash content thirdly for downstream sludge treatment and management it has been reported that granules with only 10 mineral content as calcium phosphate generated 30 more biogas than those with 39 mineral content liu et al 2019 therefore given the reduced microbial activity possible instability of granules caused by high mineral contents and impurity of calcium phosphate from co precipitation and less biogas production from excess sludge treatment phosphorus recovery by forming calcium phosphate in microbial granules particularly in aerobic granules need further investigation before it has practical application 5 conclusions size effects of nitrifying granules on calcium phosphate accumulation with a naturally high water hardness level were investigated with the calcium concentration in water ranged between 100 and 150 mg l 1 excessive calcium precipitation in nitrifying granules occurred the key findings are summarized as below at steady state light yellow granules without mineral precipitates and deep brown granules with high mineral precipitates inorganic granules and granules with different sizes co existed in one single reactor based on this and the literature a new hypothesized mechanism for calcium precipitation in nitrifying granules was proposed adsorption of calcium and phosphate could be the first step for biologically induced precipitation in nitrifying granules and calcium adsorption is much faster than phosphate sufficient sludge retention time particularly granule retention time is a prerequisite for the accumulation of calcium precipitates in granules hap and calcite were two calcium precipitates found in granules granules with a size less than 710 µm were favorable for the co precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate while granules with a size larger than 710 µm were enriched with calcium phosphate dominant precipitates the high mineral contents significantly reduced the microbial activity of nitrifying granules eps contents in larger granules were higher while compositions of eps from granules with different sizes were the same the investigation on size effects on calcium precipitates in nitrifying granules distinguished granules without calcium precipitates and high microbial activity from those with excessive calcium precipitates and low microbial activity which is significant to reveal the mechanism of calcium precipitates in microbial granules declaration of competing interest all co authors claim that we do not have any conflict interests 
16563,calcium phosphate could be accumulated in aerobic granules which attracts attention recently for phosphorus removal and recovery from wastewater in this study partial nitrifying granules with high calcium precipitate content were sorted into different size groups for characterization and evaluation to reveal the dynamic balance of granules at stead state and relevant calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation mechanism it was found that light yellow small granules without calcium precipitates but high microbial activity co existed with deep brown granules with calcium precipitate of around 91 and low microbial activity characterization with specific oxygen uptake rates specific ammonium oxidation rates calcium and phosphate removal rates from solution eps contents elemental compositions by energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy edx x ray diffraction xrd and scanning electron microscopy sem for different size groups of granules enabled a proposal of a new hypothesized mechanism for calcium precipitation and accumulation with this proposed mechanism it is believed that sufficient granule retention time in reactors was critical for the accumulation of calcium precipitates followed by a slow microbial growth rate of biomass due to mass transfer resistance the co precipitation of calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate mainly occurred in granules with a size less than 710 µm while calcium phosphate dominant minerals were accumulated in granules larger than 710 µm the results and conclusions in this study shed light on the mechanisms of calcium phosphate accumulation in granules which could be used to better operate and control aerobic granular sludge with calcium phosphates for phosphorus removal and recovery keywords calcium phosphate hap nitrifying granules mechanisms size effects eps phosphorus removal and recovery 1 introduction aerobic granular sludge is believed as a promising technology to replace conventional activated sludge cas due to its excellent settleability and biomass retention three dimensional structure and large size of granules are the key characteristics that lead to their superior performance meanwhile calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in granular sludge for wastewater treatment are widely observed and reported de kreuk et al 2005 etterer and wilderer 2001 mañas et al 2011 morgenroth et al 1997 although it is not exclusive to the granular sludge system maurer et al 1999 other types of minerals such as calcium carbonate magnesium or ferric precipitates could be formed and accumulated as well at some conditions the mineral precipitates in granules can reach as high as 60 70 which could reduce the microbial activity of granules liu et al 2015 yu et al 2019 but in many cases mineral contents in granules were in a reasonable range which did not affect wastewater treatment performance of bioreactors regarding cod and nitrogen removal but with the extra benefit of phosphorus removal de kreuk and van loosdrecht 2006 mañas et al 2011 mineral precipitation and accumulation are not just limited to aerobic granules any type of microbial granules such as anaerobic granules anammox granules and aerobic granules with without nitrogen and phosphorus removals could accumulate minerals among different types of minerals it was found that calcium precipitates are more likely to occur in granules even at a calcium concentration as low as around 20 mg l liu et al 2015 2016 when phosphate was present calcium phosphate could be precipitated and accumulated in granules with high phosphorus and calcium retention this phenomenon was often observed in anaerobic granules in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor with obvious phosphorus removal capability when treating wastewater fukuzaki et al 1991 and in aerobic granules enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr with elevated phosphate concentration due to anaerobic phosphorus release de kreuk et al 2005 although calcium phosphate precipitation was reported in suspended sludge as well maurer et al 1999 based on this subsequently more and more interests become to be how to remove and recover phosphorus from wastewater by promoting calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in anaerobic granules cunha et al 2019 anammox granules xue et al 2021 nitritation anammox granules johansson et al 2017 and aerobic granules li et al 2014 mañas et al 2011 thus it is believed that mineral precipitation in granules is not essentially controlled by a specific type of microorganisms although specific types of bacteria might affect the chemistry of the microenvironment in granules to stimulate mineral precipitation instead the structure of granules or granules characteristics could be the main reason to facilitate mineral accumulation because fast biomineralization of phosphate can easily occur in granules instead of flocs mañas et al 2011 to enhance calcium phosphate precipitation in granules calcium was dosed deliberately in some studies it is generally believed that high calcium concentration high phosphate concentration and high ph which could increase the saturation index of calcium phosphate are beneficial for calcium phosphate precipitation several mechanisms have been proposed to elucidate the formation of calcium minerals in granules to better understand this precipitation process for phosphorus removal and recovery ma et al 2020 mañas et al 2011 pishgar et al 2020 yu et al 2019 some of these explained the mechanisms of calcium phosphate in granule cores based on the presumption that minerals incorporated with bio aggregates or bacteria attachment on the tiny inorganic minerals for biofilm growth or minerals deposited on the periphery of bio aggregates ma et al 2020 pishgar et al 2020 these mechanisms were based on the assumptions that the granulation or the growth of young and new granules at steady state were similar to the transformation of flocs into granules during the start up period and tiny mineral particles formed in the bulk solution first these assumptions were not always true because calcium precipitates in granules were observed as well when a bulk solution was unsaturated for example scanning analyses of the flocs and supernatant did not reveal any similar calcium phosphates as in granules mañas et al 2011 thus some researchers believed that chemical gradients in granules due to mass transfer resistance and localized biological reactions such as denitrification with increased ph or biological phosphate release in an anaerobic zone of granules as well as the presence of eps might create a microenvironment with increased saturation index of calcium phosphate in localized space of granules as a kind of biologically induced mineralization de kreuk et al 2005 mañas et al 2011 yilmaz et al 2008 it is obvious that no unified mechanism of calcium phosphate precipitation and accumulation in granules have been widely accepted so far this research thus aimed to explore the mechanisms of calcium phosphate accumulation in aerobic granules by investigating size effects of granules partial nitrifying granules were chosen for this study to rule out multiple biological reactions with only biological ammonium oxidation reaction dominant for its simplicity and specificity the ultimate purpose of this study is to reveal the mechanisms of calcium phosphate formation and accumulation in granules for better operation and control in practice to achieve targeted wastewater treatment performance and resource recovery 2 materials and methods 2 1 medium the synthetic wastewater was made every day and it was composed of ammonium sulfate 400 mg nh4 n l 1 and di potassium phosphate 15

ca2 concentration between 100 and 150 mg l 1 the ph of synthetic wastewater was not adjusted but it was constant at around 7 2 7 4 2 2 inoculum and granules reactor operation the partial nitrifying granules from other experiments liu and cinquepalmi 2021 stored at 4 c for 3 months were inoculated into the sbr reactors for reactivation two perspex columns with a working volume of 2 6 l and a

granules with four different size ranges after size sorting i e 0 6 0 71 1 18 1 4 2 8 and 2 8 mm respectively were put into flasks each at with 300 ml synthetic wastewater as used for sbrs except that ammonium concentration was reduced to 100 mg nh4 n l 1 to avoid possible bacteria inhibition by free ammonia from high initial ammonium concentration mlvss in each flask was maintained at around 1 5 2

used to detect the dilution needed for eem analyses with the scanning range from 200 nm to 700 nm at 2 nm interval between each scan 3 results 3 1 nitrifying granules with different sizes and colors at a stable state after a two month operation inoculated partial nitrifying granules reached steady state at which svi5 of nitrifying granuels were less than 20 ml g 1 and the partial nitrifying granules could efficiently oxidize 400 mg nh4 n l 1 to nitrite with negligible nitrate within 4 h cycle time nitrifying granules at a steady state were sorted into different ranges of sizes by sieving it was found that there were two distinct colors of granules dominant in the size range of 150 250 µm as shown in fig 1 a one was light yellow while the other was deep brown with higher density and better settleability in addition sporadic black granules were observed and circled in red in fig 1a the sem analysis showed that most granules were typical microbial granules as reported in the literature but one was very special as shown in fig 1b this special granule was probably one of those sporadic black granules sem photo shows no cells at all and its shape surface and texture were more likely pure inorganic granules instead of microbial granules although it was not pointed out by the authors we observed similar sporadic black granules in granule photoes of the paper on anammox granules for simultaneous n and p removal by forming hydroxyapatite hap at high ca2 concentration ma et al 2020 light yellow granules were observed in other size ranges but the number of light yellow granules was much smaller than that in the sludge with a size range of 150 250 µm as shown in fig 1c even half light yellow and half deep brown granules were overserved or light yellow clusters protruded from the deep brown granules as marked by arrows fig 1d shows much clearer large cluster structure of granules with a size range of 1400 2000 µm from these observations and the cavity of the granule shown in fig 1d it seems that small light yellow granules could be the detached dense clusters from relatively large granules gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 reported similar cluster architecture of aerobic granules and believed that microbial clusters rooting from the interior of the mature granule structure mainly grow via biomass outgrowth and not by aggregation of small particles those large clusters with perturbated cell colonies are more exposed to fluid shear force to be detached off and thus serve as seed nuclei for the growth of a new granule gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 the cluster structure of granules was reported in different types of granules for wastewater treatment e g anaerobic digestion gonzalez gil et al 2001 aerobic granular systems for cod and n removal liu et al 2004 simultaneous nitrification denitrification and phosphorus removal systems lemaire et al 2008 oland vlaeminck et al 2010 and ebpr barr et al 2010 gonzalez gil and holliger 2014 3 2 microbial activity of nitrifying granules with different sizes and colors to understand the difference between these two types of granules in the same size range granules with the size of 150 250 µm were further sorted into two groups by density with one dominated with light yellow and the other dominated with deep brown granules sour results on ammonium oxidization in fig 2 show that the microbial activity of granules decreased with the increase in granules size when granule size was above 300 µm this result is in agreement with that reported by liu et al 2016 on sour with different heterotrophic granule sizes it is believed that higher mass transfer resistance in larger granules resulted in lower sour of granules thus lower sours of larger granules were fully expected however for granules with a size range of 150 250 µm they demonstrated distinct and opposite sours with light yellow granule having a sour of over 140 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 while deep brown granules having a sour of only less than 20 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 although they were in the same size range a similar sour of 120 mg o2 g 1 mlvss h 1 for granule size of 106 212 μm was reported for heterotrophic granules liu et al 2016 and for nitrifying granules with even larger size xia et al 2007 but there is no any reports so far about the co existence of two distinct types of granules with the same size range but quite different in microbial activities since the amount of granules less than 600 µm was not much all granules less than 600 µm were combined and compared with the size ranges of 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 µm regarding ammonium removal rates in batch tests as shown in fig 3 the highest specific ammonium oxidizing rate was observed for the granules with a size range of less than 600 µm whereas a lower ammonium removal activity was detected for granules with the larger size the corresponding specific ammonium oxidizing rates saor were 0 843 0 328 0 299 and 0 236 g nh4 n g 1 mlvss d 1 as shown in fig 3a due to higher saor the granules with a size range less than 600 µm reduced nh4 to a negligible concentration within 180 min whereas it took 210 257 and 407 min for granules with size ranges of 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 µm respectively data now shownerror reference source not found since the batch tests with different granule size ranges show similar patterns only the results with granule size range less than 600 µm are illustrated in fig 3b it could be seen that nh4 no2 and no3 changes are typical for a partial nitrification system this is mainly because the seeds used to inoculate reactors were partial nitrifying granuels in addition high free ammonia from 400 mg l 1 ammonium in the sythethetic wastewater and short cycle time such as 4 h used inhibited the overgrowth of nitrite oxdising organisms in the 2 month operation period in this study during the nitritation processit is interesting to observe that both po4 3 and ca2 concentrations reduced for granules with size ranges less than 2000 µm calcium and phosphate removal efficiencies decreased with the increase in granule size since no organic carbon and anaerobic phase were provided in batch cycles there was no biological phosphorus removal in granules it was thus believed that calcium and phosphate were removed by forming calcium phosphate precipitates all batch tests show a quick decrease in both elements during the first 30 60 min of the batch cycles which is concurrent with a rapid increase in ph from 8 0 to 8 3 due to co2 degassing when ph decreased from 8 30 to 7 75 due to the nitritation phosphate continued to decrease while ca2 was relatively stable implying a less likelihood that precipitation of calcium phosphate occurred in the liquid more likely ca2 was adsorbed by granules more quickly than phosphate to a saturation value resulting in the precipitation of calcium phosphate in granules with a slower rate than adsorption after the nitritation ph increased again from 7 75 to 8 20 due to the degassing of co2 phosphate reduced continuously at a higher rate than the phase with ph decrease in the whole batch cycle ca2 and phosphate were removed with a ratio of 3 2 which was much higher than 1 67 ca p of pure hydroxyapatite thus it could be reasoned that calcium and phosphate co precipitated with other calcium minerals 3 3 physical characterization of nitrifying granules with different sizes to validate the reasoning of calcium phosphate precipitation and other calcium co precipitation in granules based on fig 3 physical characterization was conducted as shown in table 2 although ash contents of granules for size ranges 600 710 1180 1400 2000 and 2800 μm were similar i e around 75 89 granule density increased with the particles size almost linearly showing that larger granules had more compact structure the extremely high ash contents of granules with different size ranges indicated excessive mineral precipitation in partial nitrifying granules it needs to point out that synthetic wastewater composition and reactor operation in this study were quite similar to our previous work chen et al 2015 except for different water hardness levels of local tap water used to prepare synthetic wastewater in the study by chen et al 2015 ca2 concentration in tap water was only around 20 mg l 1 while it reached around 100 150 mg l 1 in this study in addition concentrations of minerals such as na mg2 fe3 in tap water were much lower than what we dosed k concentration in tap water was only 1 70 mg l almost negligible thus it could be concluded that the excessive mineral precipitation in the study was mainly caused by high calcium concentration in the tap water except for light yellow granules with a size range of 150 250 μm granules with size ranges from 150 to 710 μm had similar ash contents which were as high as 90 meanwhile it was found that ca and phosphorus contents in these granules were as high as 309 325 and 64 72 mg g 1 mlss with constant ca p ratios between 3 39 and 3 87 in table 1 which were very close to the ratios of ca p removed in the batch cycles shown in fig 3 when granule size was above 710 μm ash contents were lower with lower ca content but much higher phosphorus contents and ca p ratios in granules were in the range of 1 97 2 46 much lower than 3 39 3 87 xrd analysis of granules with different size ranges showed only two crystal inorganics i e hydroxyapatite and calcite but granules with large sizes showed more dominant hydroxyapatite than calcite which is consistent with the results of ca p ratios in granules the results from icp and xrd suggest that granule size affects co precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate the size effects on ash content in this study were quite different from that reported by liu et al 2016 in which ash contents increased with granule size until the size of 700 μm and ash contents stabilized when granule size above 700 μm but interestingly the cut off granule size in both studies on ash contents were around 700 μm it is very interesting to note that for the size range of 150 250 μm ash content in light yellow granules was as low as 2 9 while it reached 91 2 in deep brown granules although light yellow granules have the same size range with deep brown granules both calcium and phosphorus contents in light yellow granules were low without any crystalline detected by xrd this might explain the sour results in fig 3 that light yellow granules had much higher microbial activity with mainly active nitrifying biomass in granules but high ash content in deep brown granules might significantly inhibit the activity of biomass or there was more organic matters such as eps or dead bacteria than live nitrifying bacteria in deep brown granules from the similar ash contents but much lower sour value of deep brown granules with a size of 150 250 μm compared with granules with a size of 300 425 μm it is more likely that organic matters in deep brown granules were not active bacteria from this study we could see that two distinct types of granules co existed in the same reactor with one having high microbial activity and low ash content while the other having low microbial activity and high ash content based on our previous study liu and cinquepalmi 2021 on nitrifying granules by monitoring ash contents of granules from the granulation to the stable state newly formed granules had much lower ash content than mature granules thus it is reasonable to speculate that light yellow granules were newly formed fresh granules while deep brown granules had been staying in the reactor for a long time the finding of the co existence of light yellow granules without calcium minerals and deep brown granules with high mineral content could help elucidate the mechanisms of calcium precipitates in granules sem was conducted to observe the morphologies of granules no clear patterns were found among granules with different sizes but there was a similarity between them regarding the cluster characteristics of localized surface areas of granules it can be seen from fig 4 a that coccus accumulated with amorphous like inorganic deposits on the surface while fig 4b and c show rod type crystals embedded in eps and scalenohedral type crystals adjacent to eps and coccus respectively fig 4d shows net like eps with some inorganics no matter for bacteria inorganics or eps cluster characteristics were found in addition based on element analysis of large granules above 1400 μm by edx less calcium and phosphorus were found on granules surface while much more were in the cores of granules 3 4 extracellular polymeric substances in nitrifying granules with different sizes as shown in fig 5 tb eps contents were much higher than lb eps contents both poly protein gonzalez gil et al 2001 and polysaccharides feldman et al contents increased with the reduction in granule size the ps was found more than pn in smaller granules resulting in pn ps ratios of 0 29 0 71 0 78 and 0 88 respectively for granules with size ranges of less than 600 μm 710 1180 μm 1400 2100 μm and above 2800 μm cuervo lópez et al 1999 reported that pn played a more important role to maintain the stability of structure of anaerobic granules higher pn ps in larger granules might mean that maintaining the structure stability of large granules to avoid breakage could be more challenging thus higher pn ps was needed from table 2 it can be known that organic biomass contents in granules with different sizes were similar but fig 5 showed higher eps contents in larger granules this might imply that more eps was produced in larger granules to maintain the granule architecture the eps results in this study are different from those reported for heterotrophic granules with three size ranges such as 1 mm 0 5 1 mm and 1 mm with higher total eps content in smaller granules rusanowska et al 2019 the different types of granules i e nitrifying granules in this study and heterotrophic granules might be the reason for this difference the compositions of granular sludge lb and tb eps were analyzed by eem fluorescence spectroscopy and representative spectra are shown in fig 6 six regions for different eps components were described in table 1 peaks i and ii were mainly found in lb samples whereas peaks iii and iv were mainly present in tb samples peak i is generally related to the tyrosine aminoacids whereas peak ii represents the tryptophan aminoacids see table peak iv is commonly described as fulvic acid like substances whereas peak iii is described as polysaccharides chen et al 2003 wang et al 2014 wang and zhang 2010 yamashita and tanoue 2003 in addition peak v representing polyaromatic type humic acid was found in tb eps of granules with a size range less than 600 μm while not in granules with other sizes since granules with a size range less than 600 μm included light yellow granules which might contribute to peak v in general however eps compositions of granules with different sizes were quite similar indicating that eps compositions were independent of granule size although larger granules produced more eps 4 discussion 4 1 mechanism of ca precipitation in sbrs with nitrifying granules calcium precipitation occurred in partial nitrifying granules except light yellow granules with a size range of 150 250 μm in this study calcium prepipates were also found in other types of granules it is believed that granules three dimensional structure and compact structure play an important for inorganic precipitates due to ph gradient other substrate gradients caused by mass transfer resistance eps in granules is also believed to relate to the adsorption of ca2 by negatively charged groups liu et al 2015 and phosphate adsorption by positively charged groups with eps as a phosphorus reservoir cloete and oosthuizen 2001 oosthuizen and cloete 2001 to facilitate calcium phosphate precipitation to understand calcium phosphate accumulation in granules different mechanisms on the growth of new granules and ca precipitates were proposed it is generally believed that flocs or aggregates formed by incorporating microbial cells and hap micro crystals formed in bulk solution due to the high si value of hap in the wastewater as granulation proceeds microbial cells in the inner part of the granules decay due to the substrate shortage and a hard core mainly consisting of hap and eps was formed ma et al 2020 when the crystallization speed in the reactor was higher newly formed crystals could cover the granule creating a granule with multi layers of inorganics ma et al 2020 this hypothesized mechanism highlights the precipitation of hap in the bulk solution and the incorporation of hap particles from the bulk solution into granules although si of hap is above 0 however mañas et al 2011 believed that confined conditions were more favorable for hydroxyapatite formation or accumulation than conditions in the bulk due to higher local phosphate concentration higher local ph and higher retention time for granules via a biologically induced mineralization mechanism the identification of several phylotypes some even not isolated in pure culture described as potential mineral precipitating bacteria in autotrophic granular sludge made the authors gonzalez martinez et al 2017 speculate that precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate might relate to microbial species however our results in this study about the co existence of light yellow granules without precipitates and deep brown granules with high hap precipitates could not be fully explained by any of these hypothesized mechanisms of ca precipitates in granules our previous work on the excessive caco3 precipitation in aerobic granules after the operation mode was changed from sequential batch to continuous mode liu et al 2015 was unable to be explained by these hypotheses either the absolute retention of granules in an airlift reactor after sbr changed to continuous mode with extended granule retention time and inferior growth competition to flocs liu et al 2015 could be the main factor for the accumulation of calcium precipitates in granules in addition we found that the ash content of partial nitrifying granules increased gradually over time after granular sludge was just formed with the extended granule retention time and reduced microbial growth rate due to mass transfer resistance liu and cinquepalmi 2021 in addition it has been reported that at the exactly same operational conditions including ca2 and phosphate concentrations except for srt aerobic granules for cod removal with low srt and high microbial growth rate got 10 ca p precipitates while long srt resulted in 30 ca p precipitates liu et al 2019 in a full scale anammox reactor 60 ash content of granules located at the bottom of the reactor which co existed with the granules at the top of the reactor with only 10 ash content lin et al 2013 ab halim et al 2016 reported higher phosphorus accumulation in the matured aerobic granules long retention time than the young granules short retention time at three different temperatures in addition ca p precipitates in heterotrophic granules liu et al 2019 were much lower than those in partial nitrifying granules in this study even ca2 and phosphate concentrations were similar this could be due to the much higher microbial growth rate of heterotrophic granules than nitrifying granules from these reports and the co existence of light yellow granules and deep brown granules in this study we thus assume that long granule retention time and slow microbial growth rate are more important than other factors on the accumulation of inorganic precipitates in granules and these two factors could be prerequisites for the accumulation of inorganics in nitrifying granules due to this it is believed that the new growth of nitrifying granules at a stable state might be different from the granulation stage in our study at the steady state we observed spherical clusters rooting from old and large granules were detached to form new granules as shown in fig 1 in this case there are much fewer chances for flocs and inorganic precipitate particles to incorporate into new granules furthermore for different granular sludge systems such as anammox nitrifying granules anaerobic granules heterotrophic granules the calcium precipitation and accumulation in granules might be slightly different due to different microbial activity such as cod oxidation nitrification denitrification biological phosphorus release or uptake in nitrifying granules with only ammonium oxidation in this study based on physical chemical and microbial analysis a hypothesized mechanism was proposed as shown in fig 7 at a steady state the sludge was a mixture of granules with different sizes and colors fresh and young granules are mainly dense clusters detached from large granules which have much higher nitrifying activity microbial growth rate due to less mass transfer resistance and very low ash content i e without calcium precipitation in granules at steady state large granules might also disintegrate due to the hard and dense inorganic precipitates in the cores which could result in inorganic granules as shown in fig 1b and larger light yellow granules as shown in fig 1c when the retention of granules in reactors is long enough the granules adsorb ca2 phosphate and or carbonate to form calcium precipitates in multiple clusters inside of granules as sem images of granules shown by lin et al 2013 mañas et al 2011 this could explain why we observed localized cells and inorganics clusters as shown in fig 4 when granule retention time is further prolonged inorganic clusters could grow and integrate into one large core while nitrifying bacteria only grow in the out layer due to the resistance of mass transfer when the out layer bacteria grow unevenly granules might disintegrate to form inorganic particles with little organics and fresh light yellow granules in this way the granular sludge establishes a dynamic balance between granules with different sizes and microbial activities to maintain a stable average granule size microbial activity and ash content as a whole under the same operational condition we observed that the ash content of granules only gradually increased to stable values after one month of complete granulation liu and cinquepalmi 2021 which supports the hypothesized mechanism proposed in fig 7 it needs to point out that srt in aerobic granule reactors is average value calculated from washed out biomass and biomass in reactors since flocs and small loose granuels are more likely to be washed out while dense and or large granules are easier to be retentioned in reactors srt in aerobic granule reactors might not necessarily be able to represent the real retention time of specific type of granules in reactors thus we prefer to use granule retention time to represent the real granule rentetion time in fig 7 4 2 co precipitation of caco3 and ca p or ca p dominant precipitation in nitrifying granules in this study bicarbonate was provided as an inorganic carbon source as well as a buffer for ph the equilibrium between bicarbonate and carbonate resulted in higher carbonate concentration at alkaline condition it has been reported that the presence of alkalinity either as hco3 or co3 2 can lead to a competitive reaction to that of ca p formation by removing available ca2 to form caco3 chazarenc et al 2007 kim et al 2006 but according to the batch cycle analysis shown in fig 3b ca2 in wastewater was sufficient without the concern of ca2 competition between caco3 and ca p other factors might play more important roles song et al 2002 reported that at ph values of 9 or higher calcium phosphate precipitation would be preferred to caco3 in the presence of co3 2 whereas at ph lower than 8 or higher than 10 the two minerals would interfere or co precipitate according to fig 3 ph in bulk solution varied from 7 75 to 8 30 thus there were chances for co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate from table 2 it can be seen that ca p ratios in all granules with different sizes were larger than 1 67 i e the ratio of pure hydroxyapatite indicating the co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate this was also validated by xrd analysis ca p ratios were much larger and p contents were lower in granules with a size range less than 710 µm implying more caco3 co precipitated in relatively smaller granules this suggests that granule size affects the co precipitation probably from the aspects of interior ph in granules and eps contents although both ca p ratio in wastewater and bulk ph were the same the interior ph in the microenvironment of granules could be different in granules with different sizes due to the different mass transfer resistance liu et al 2005 reported that mass transfer resistance was size dependent and when granules size was over 700 µm mass transfer resistance played an important role it could thus be reasonably speculated that ph in granules with different sizes might be different resulting in co precipitation of caco3 and calcium phosphate or calcium phosphate dominant precipitation in the presence of carbonate depending on granule size the caco3 co precipitation could be more favorable within the smaller granules probably due to less ph difference from bulk ph i e 7 75 8 30 and less mass transfer resistance than larger granules furthermore ca2 could bind with the protein of eps in the matrix and thus bridge extracellular proteins and strength granule structure sheng et al 2013 according to table 2 larger granules above 700 µm had higher p content and lower ca p ratio near to cap with more hydroxyapatite accumulated in this study the density of granules with large sizes table 2 was much higher with a corresponding higher eps amount fig 5 when ca2 was binding with eps more eps in larger granules as seen in fig 5 might lead to higher localized ca2 concentration and higher localized ca p ratio facilitating more cap precipitation as cunha et al 2018 reported that higher ca p is beneficial to ca p precipitation 4 3 potential of phosphorus removal and recovery by forming ca p in microbial granules in biological wastewater treatment reactors such as uasb cunha et al 2018 tervahauta et al 2014 anammox reactors ma et al 2020 or aerobic granules reactors calcium phosphate precipitates with without the addition of calcium were usually present in the core of granules with the out layer as organic matters at least more than 20 to play microbial functional roles furthermore calcium carbonate could co precipitate with calcium phosphate in granules let alone the presence of other metal ions in wastewater which might precipitate as well thus the presence of impurity is a protential problem for the downstream processing for phosphorus recovery when using acids to dissolve phosphate because an extra amount of acid is needed to oxidize organics and or dissolve other inorganics although it was found that calcium phosphate content in granules with a size of above 710 µm could be higher compared with smaller granules there are no strategies developed so far that could be used to well control granule size until now there has little research on phosphorus recovery from microbial granules forming calcium phosphate in microbial granules for phosphorus recovery is still away from a real application in practice secondly the main function of microbial granules is to carry out biological reactions calcium phosphate formation is an additional benefit for simultaneous phosphorus removal however the accumulation of inorganics in granules could reduce microbial activity like reported in this study and by other researchers feldman et al 2019 liu et al 2016 van langerak et al 2000 xing et al 2015 yu et al 2019 in addition too much mineral content could cement sludge limit diffusion and dilute the active biomass batstone et al 2002 the instability of microbial granules with high calcium phosphate content was observed as well xue et al 2020 reported deteriorated settling velocity of anammox hap granules sludge bulking and flotation at the condition of ca2 of 82 mg l 1 and 5 7 mg p l 1 although authors attributed it to the low phosphate concentration in the anammox reactor it is hard to know if it was caused by the long term instability of hap rich anammox granules with ash content as high as 80 the instability of microbial granules with calcium phosphate might be related to high ash content thirdly for downstream sludge treatment and management it has been reported that granules with only 10 mineral content as calcium phosphate generated 30 more biogas than those with 39 mineral content liu et al 2019 therefore given the reduced microbial activity possible instability of granules caused by high mineral contents and impurity of calcium phosphate from co precipitation and less biogas production from excess sludge treatment phosphorus recovery by forming calcium phosphate in microbial granules particularly in aerobic granules need further investigation before it has practical application 5 conclusions size effects of nitrifying granules on calcium phosphate accumulation with a naturally high water hardness level were investigated with the calcium concentration in water ranged between 100 and 150 mg l 1 excessive calcium precipitation in nitrifying granules occurred the key findings are summarized as below at steady state light yellow granules without mineral precipitates and deep brown granules with high mineral precipitates inorganic granules and granules with different sizes co existed in one single reactor based on this and the literature a new hypothesized mechanism for calcium precipitation in nitrifying granules was proposed adsorption of calcium and phosphate could be the first step for biologically induced precipitation in nitrifying granules and calcium adsorption is much faster than phosphate sufficient sludge retention time particularly granule retention time is a prerequisite for the accumulation of calcium precipitates in granules hap and calcite were two calcium precipitates found in granules granules with a size less than 710 µm were favorable for the co precipitation of calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate while granules with a size larger than 710 µm were enriched with calcium phosphate dominant precipitates the high mineral contents significantly reduced the microbial activity of nitrifying granules eps contents in larger granules were higher while compositions of eps from granules with different sizes were the same the investigation on size effects on calcium precipitates in nitrifying granules distinguished granules without calcium precipitates and high microbial activity from those with excessive calcium precipitates and low microbial activity which is significant to reveal the mechanism of calcium precipitates in microbial granules declaration of competing interest all co authors claim that we do not have any conflict interests

groundwater and these effects were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area hierarchical cluster analysis based on fluorescence parameters divided the groundwater samples into three clusters with significantly different pollution degrees cluster a unpolluted cluster b highly polluted cluster c moderately polluted in particular the intensity of tryptophan like fluorescence was high in the polluted groundwater but was almost undetectable in the unpolluted groundwater suggesting that it is a potential indicator of groundwater quality principal component analysis based on the fluorescence parameters explained 91 5 of the variance with the first two principal components and revealed that the degree of pollution dominated the fluorescence characteristics of groundwater in

were set to 5 nm fluorescence intensity was recorded at ex and em wavelengths of 250 450 nm 5 nm intervals and 300 600 nm 2 nm intervals respectively 2 3 data handling blank subtraction murphy et al 2013 inner filter effect correction kothawala et al 2013 and scatter removal murphy et al 2013 were conducted to correct the eems fluorescence intensities were normalized to raman units ru lawaetz and stedmon 2009 plots of the corrected eems are shown in fig s1 the parafac model was developed based on the corrected eems of the 31 groundwater samples using the stardom package pucher et al 2019 in r software r core team 2021 the noisy range data above 580 nm em was eliminated a three component model fig 2 was validated by split half analysis fig s2 and tucker s congruence coefficients table s2 murphy et al 2013 based on the openfluor database similarity scores 0 90 murphy et al 2014 the three fluorescence components were identified as fulvic acid like components c1 humic like components c2 and tryptophan like components c3 respectively table s3 the content and composition of parafac components in each sample were estimated by calculating fmax fig s3 and fmax fig s4 respectively wauthy et al 2018 the corrected eems and absorbance values were used to calculate optical indices the fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 450 nm to that at 500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcknight 2001 the biological index bix was the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm to that at 430 nm with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm is a254 which indicates the dom content li and hur 2017 the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm was calculated to obtain e2 e3 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was determined by dividing the uv absorbance measured at λ 254 nm by the doc content of the sample weishaar et al 2003 data on dom optical indices and doc content are provided in table s4 spearman correlation was applied to analyze the relationships among the dom parameters including doc fi bix suva254 a254 fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 the fluorescence parameters fi bix fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 were used for hca and pca spearman correlation hca and pca were performed using r software data were standardized before hca and pca euclidian distance was used with ward s method to separate different clusters in the hca the variation of dom and hydrochemistry parameters among the clusters were analyzed by the wilcoxon test using r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 content and optical characteristics of dom a254 was used as a proxy for doc li and hur 2017 as shown in fig 3 a254 and doc showed a strong positive correlation which is consistent with previous study li and hur 2017 generally groundwater has low doc content which is close to 1 mg l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 in addition the values of a254 in unpolluted groundwater were close to or less than 1 m 1 in previous studies chen et al 2010 shen et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 in this study area the values of a254 and doc content in groundwater samples ranged from 0 to 14 74 m 1 and 1 71 to 5 05 mg l 1 respectively table s4 thus the increase in a254 and doc might be associated with groundwater pollution eem parafac was conducted to determine the relationship between the fluorescence characteristics and groundwater pollution as shown in fig 3 fluorescence intensity fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 showed a strong positive correlation with doc and a254 natural waters polluted by anthropogenic activities have been widely demonstrated to exhibit enhanced fluorescence intensity carstea et al 2016 old et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017 in terms of the proportion fmax of the three fluorescence components fmax c2 had a strong negative correlation with doc and a254 while fmax c3 had a strong positive correlation fig 3 previous studies have reported that the elevated intensity and proportion of tryptophan like fluorescence indicate a risk of pollution baker et al 2015 heibati et al 2017 sorensen et al 2020 the results of the dom content and the fluorescence characteristics indicated that the groundwater in the study area has been affected by human activities generally the leachate derived from livestock waste has high doc content fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like substances baker 2002 naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 singh et al 2014 which is consistent with the dom characteristics of polluted groundwater in the study area thus livestock waste is a potential source of groundwater pollution however untreated sewage has similar fluorescence characteristics to livestock waste making it difficult to distinguish pollution sources using fluorescence spectroscopy carstea et al 2016 therefore land use and hydrogeological conditions were analyzed to help identify the pollution sources groundwater in the study area generally flows from northwest to southeast fig 1d according to the land use types in the study area fig 1c rural residential areas were the major sources of sewage but most of rural residential areas are mainly located in the southeastern part of the study area near the discharge area of the groundwater flow systems fig 1d thus the untreated sewage in rural residential areas cannot be the major sources of groundwater pollution at sampling sites in contrast livestock farming was well developed in the study area yue et al 2016 with approximately 50 of the study area covered by pasture land fig 1c in this study area livestock waste is randomly discharged in pasture land or is most commonly used as organic fertilizer in cultivated land therefore the high content and fluorescence of doc with a high proportion of tryptophan like substances in the groundwater were mainly caused by the pollution of livestock waste suva254 can be used to assess the degree of aromaticity of dom weishaar et al 2003 which ranged from 0 to 1 47 l mg 1 m 1 in the study area table s4 a higher degree of aromaticity is associated with a high content of humic substances derrien et al 2020 our study showed that the intensities of the humic like fmax c1 and fulvic like components fmax c2 exhibited a strong positive correlation with suva254 further supporting the findings of a previous study derrien et al 2020 e2 e3 was used to represent the molecular weight of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 demonstrated that e2 e3 is negatively correlated with the molecular weight of dom in this study area e2 e3 ranged from 1 to 33 table s4 and it was negatively correlated with fmax c2 but positively correlated with fmax c3 thus the results of e2 e3 indicated that the humic like component was associated with high molecular weight substances while the tryptophan like component was associated with low molecular weight substances this result is consistent with the findings of nguyen et al 2010 the positive correlation between suva254 e2 e3 doc fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 indicated that the pollution from livestock farming enhanced the degree of aromaticity but decreased the molecular weight of dom in groundwater fi and bix can provide information about the dom source the fi value is 1 4 for dom from terrestrially derived sources and 1 9 for dom from microbially derived sources mcknight 2001 yang et al 2020 the bix value is 0 6 0 7 for terrestrially derived dom and 1 for microbially derived dom huguet et al 2009 qi et al 2018 the values of fi and bix ranged from 1 27 to 1 65 table s4 median 1 50 and 0 to 0 95 table s4 median 0 80 in the study area respectively indicating that there were both terrestrially derived and microbially derived dom in the studied groundwater furthermore both fi and bix exhibited a positive correlation with doc fig 3 fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 suggesting that livestock farming pollution could enhance the inputs of microbially derived dom in groundwater in summary these results suggest that the optical characteristics of dom are sensitive to groundwater pollution from livestock farming in the study area the doc degree of aromaticity microbially derived dom fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like components in groundwater increased with the increase in the pollution degree but the proportion of humic like components and molecular weight of dom decreased 3 2 hca and pca based on fluorescence parameters hca split the groundwater samples into three clusters clusters a b and c fig s5 cluster a had the lowest doc fig 4 a and degree of aromaticity fig 4b moreover the a254 values fig 4c of cluster a median 0 69 m 1 were significantly lower than 1 m 1 these findings indicated that the groundwater in cluster a was unpolluted however the a254 values of clusters b median 11 28 m 1 and c median 3 91 m 1 were significantly higher than 1 m 1 suggesting that the groundwater samples in clusters b and c were polluted moreover the doc content degree of aromaticity and a254 of cluster b were significantly higher than those of cluster c indicating that the groundwater in cluster b was more polluted than that in cluster c as shown in fig 4d no significant difference was observed between clusters b and c in the e2 e3 value wilcoxon test p 0 05 however the e2 e3 ratio of cluster a median 3 31 was significantly lower than those of clusters b median 16 25 and c median 12 41 respectively thus the groundwater in clusters b and c had a similar molecular weight of dom which was lower than that of cluster a in addition no significant difference wilcoxon test p 0 05 was observed in the values of fi and bix between clusters b and c fig 4e and 4f the fi and bix of clusters b median 1 53 and 0 88 respectively and c median 1 56 and 0 82 respectively were higher than 1 4 and 0 7 respectively however the fi median 1 39 and bix median 0 32 of cluster a were lower than 1 4 and 0 7 respectively the results of fi in the three clusters were in agreement with those of bix therefore microbially derived sources had a strong influence on the groundwater in clusters b and c whereas terrestrially derived sources dominated the dom of groundwater in cluster a huguet et al 2009 mcknight 2001 the eems of the groundwater samples are plotted in fig s1 the eems in cluster b had the highest maximum fluorescence intensity of 0 6 ru which was higher than that of cluster c 0 4 ru the maximum fluorescence intensity of eems in cluster a was 0 05 ru which was significantly lower than those of clusters b and c moreover the eem characteristics of clusters b and c were significantly different from those of cluster a the peak b and t excitation 270 280 nm emission 330 368 nm signals fellman et al 2010 of the eems were distinct in clusters b and c but very weak or not detected in cluster a this indicated that the groundwater in clusters b and c contained more tryptophan like substances than that in cluster a in terms of the eem parafac components fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 of cluster a were significantly lower than those of clusters b and c fig 5 a in particular abundant tryptophan like components were found in the groundwater of clusters b median 0 15 ru and c median 0 05 ru whereas almost none were detected in cluster a range 0 0 001 ru median 0 this further confirmed that the groundwater in cluster a was unpolluted the significant differences in the intensities of the tryptophan like components among clusters a b and c suggested that it is a sensitive indicator of groundwater quality fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 of cluster b were significantly higher than those of cluster c demonstrating that the groundwater in cluster b was more polluted than that in cluster c for the proportion of fluorescence components fig 5b the fmax c3 of cluster a was higher than those of cluster b and c while the fmax c2 of cluster a was lower than those in clusters b and c therefore the pollution from livestock farming increased the proportion of tryptophan like components in groundwater but decreased the proportion of humic like components according to the content and optical characteristics of dom in groundwater the three clusters can be classified as follows cluster a unpolluted cluster b highly polluted cluster c moderately polluted according to a previous report livestock waste had a higher ratio of tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity baker 2002 which ranged from 2 5 for cattle and pig slurries and 0 5 4 0 for sheep barn waste we used the ratio of fmax c3 to fmax c1 fmax c3 c1 as a proxy for the ratio of tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity as shown in fig 5c tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity of clusters b median 0 35 and c median 0 25 was significantly lower than that of livestock waste baker 2002 in addition the ratio of tryptophan like to fulvic humic like fluorescence ti fi was used to identify livestock waste pollution livestock waste have been reported to have a relatively high ti fi 2 5 or higher while diluted manure runoff is less than 1 naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 the ratio of fmax c3 to the sum of fmax c1 and fmax c1 fmax c3 c1 c2 was used in our study as a proxy for ti fi as shown in fig 5c the ti fi of clusters b median 0 23 and c median 0 16 were similar to diluted manure runoff but significantly lower than that of livestock waste naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 in summary the ratio of tryptophan like substances significantly decreased during the transportation process from livestock waste into groundwater which could be because of biodegradation and or mineral adsorption singh et al 2014 although the ratio of tryptophan like substances in polluted groundwater was significantly lower than that in livestock waste it was sufficiently high to distinguish it from unpolluted groundwater fig 5c thus tryptophan like fluorescence could be a reliable indicator for identifying the influence of livestock farming pollution on groundwater nevertheless the interaction between biogeochemical processes and the fluorescent dom of livestock waste should be further investigated in the future as shown in fig 6 pca based on the fluorescence parameters explained 91 5 of the variance between the groundwater samples with the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 pc1 explained 73 8 of the variance which was positively correlated with fi bix fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 and negatively correlated with fmax c2 as the pollution from livestock farming enhanced the inputs of microbially derived dom fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like components pc1 could be interpreted as the pollution degree of the groundwater moreover the groundwater samples were in the order of the pollution degree along axis of pc1 further indicating that livestock farming pollution could significantly alter the content and composition of dom pc2 explained 17 7 of the variance which was positively correlated with fmax c1 but negatively correlated with fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c2 generally both biodegradation and mineral adsorption can reduce the fluorescence in water for biodegradation the tryptophan like component has high bioavailability while the humic like and fulvic like components are refractory dom zheng et al 2020 microorganisms preferentially consume tryptophan like components lee et al 2018 in this study the axis of pc2 was almost perpendicular to fmax c3 therefore biodegradation did not significantly correlate with pc2 moreover the humic like component exhibited a longer ex em which could be regarded as a red shift of the fulvic acid like component therefore the molecular weight of the humic like component is larger than that of fulvic acid like component fellman et al 2010 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 dom with a high molecular weight is more readily adsorbed on mineral surfaces inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2015 ohno et al 2007 leading to a decrease in fmax c2 therefore pc2 might be associated with mineral adsorption on dom furthermore the groundwater samples of clusters a b and c did not overlap on the pca map and occupied different locations further validating the results of hca 3 3 hydrochemical characteristics and their implications for pollution identification in this study area no3 was ubiquitously observed in the groundwater previous studies have reported that nitrogen fertilizer and livestock waste are major sources of no3 pollution in groundwater in agricultural areas kim et al 2021 lazcano et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 however the area of cultivated land only accounted for less than 5 in the study area and organic manure from livestock waste is most commonly used to increase soil productivity in cultivated land furthermore the area of pasture land accounted for approximately 50 in the area and large amounts of livestock waste are randomly discharged in the pasture land thus livestock waste was a major source of no3 in the groundwater although there may be other sources of no3 such as inorganic fertilizers in the study area the range of no3 content was 0 73 191 80 mg l 1 table s1 as shown in fig 7 cluster a had the lowest no3 content with a range of 0 73 16 90 mg l 1 median 0 74 mg l 1 while cluster b had the highest no3 content with a range of 95 90 191 80 mg l 1 median 158 60 mg l 1 the no3 content of cluster c was between clusters a and b with a range of 24 50 122 00 mg l 1 median 43 30 mg l 1 in addition the no3 content exhibited a strong positive correlation with fmax c3 r2 0 77 as shown in fig 7 therefore the distribution of no3 was in agreement with the results of the fluorescence parameters validating the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying groundwater pollution caused by livestock farming in addition tryptophan like fluorescence could predict the no3 content of groundwater in livestock farming areas as indicated by the high correlation between no3 content and fmax c3 piper tri linear diagram were used to analyze the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater as shown in fig 8 hco3 was the dominant anion in groundwater accounting for more than 50 61 2 54 8 and 73 6 for clusters a b and c respectively na was the dominant cation in cluster a while ca2 was the dominant cation in clusters b and c fig 8 therefore the hydrochemical type of cluster a was mainly na hco3 while those of clusters b and c was ca hco3 previous studies have reported that na hco3 type groundwater belongs to deep groundwater while the ca hco3 type belongs to shallow groundwater pan et al 2018 rao et al 2015 this indicated that the groundwater in cluster a originated from deep groundwater whereas those in clusters b and c originated from shallow groundwater therefore the effects of livestock farming were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area in addition cl has also been used as a tracer for identifying groundwater pollution caused by livestock farming kohn et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 in this study area the unpolluted groundwater cluster a had a wider range of cl content than the polluted groundwater clusters b and c due to various water rock interactions lyu et al 2019 hindering the indicator ability of cl therefore the interference of background values should be considered when using cl as an indicator to identify groundwater pollution 4 conclusions by utilizing the eem parafac coupled with hca and pca this study provides a potential method for identifying monitoring and assessing groundwater pollution from livestock farming which is rapid low cost and sensitive the main conclusions are as follows pollution from livestock farming significantly enhanced doc content microbially derived dom degree of aromaticity fluorescence intensity and the proportion of the tryptophan like component in the groundwater but decreased the proportion of the humic like component and molecular weight of dom these effects were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area hca based on the fluorescence parameters split the groundwater samples into three clusters with significantly different pollution degrees providing valuable information for the assessment of groundwater pollution pca explained 91 5 of the variance of the fluorescence parameters with the first two principal components and revealed that the degree of pollution dominated the fluorescence characteristics in the study area tryptophan like fluorescence was abundant in the polluted groundwater but almost none was detected in the unpolluted groundwater in the study area indicating that it might be a tracer for groundwater pollution from livestock farming large amounts of no3 which primarily originated from livestock waste in the study area leached into the shallow groundwater clusters b and c while the deep groundwater cluster a had low no3 content further validating the analysis results of the fluorescence characteristics considering the variation in hydrogeological setting land use livestock density and other site conditions between different livestock farming areas further research on this topic in other livestock farming areas would help to enhance and expand the results and

16564,extensive livestock farming has highly threatened groundwater quality thereby necessitating a rapid and effective method to identify groundwater quality in such areas fluorescence spectroscopy has been recognized as an interpretable method for tracking anthropogenic influences on water quality but its applicability in identifying the groundwater pollution from livestock farming remains unknown in this study the fluorescence characteristics of dissolved organic matter dom in groundwater from a typical livestock farming area were investigated by using fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem parallel factor analysis parafac coupled with multivariate statistical methods the results showed that livestock farming significantly altered the content and composition of dom in groundwater and these effects were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area hierarchical cluster analysis based on fluorescence parameters divided the groundwater samples into three clusters with significantly different pollution degrees cluster a unpolluted cluster b highly polluted cluster c moderately polluted in particular the intensity of tryptophan like fluorescence was high in the polluted groundwater but was almost undetectable in the unpolluted groundwater suggesting that it is a potential indicator of groundwater quality principal component analysis based on the fluorescence parameters explained 91 5 of the variance with the first two principal components and revealed that the degree of pollution dominated the fluorescence characteristics of groundwater in the study area in addition no3 was abundant in clusters b and c while it was low in cluster a validating the analysis results of fluorescence spectroscopy these findings indicated that dom fluorescence was sensitive to livestock farming pollution and could be applied to identify monitor and assess groundwater pollution from livestock farming graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords groundwater pollution dissolved organic matter eem parafac hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis 1 introduction the harmful effects of livestock farming on freshwater systems have been widely demonstrated tullo et al 2019 various pollutants such as nitrate kim et al 2021 heavy metals hu et al 2017 antibiotics kivits et al 2018 and even pathogenic microbes kay et al 2008 have been transported into freshwater systems because of extensive livestock farming which threatens the ecological environment and human health hu et al 2017 thus the influence of livestock farming on freshwater systems has received increased interest livestock waste can leave a fluorescence signature in river waters baker 2002 in recent years fluorescence spectroscopy has been applied to dissolved organic matter dom to investigate the influence of livestock farming on the water environment suggesting that fluorescence spectroscopy may be applied to monitor water quality in livestock farming areas naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 singh et al 2014 compared with traditional analysis methods such as chemical and microbiological methods the optical method using fluorescence spectroscopy is more suitable for online monitoring and it is environmentally friendly and does not require the use of hazardous chemicals carstea et al 2016 heibati et al 2017 however these applications mainly focus on the surface water groundwater quality also faces serious challenges in livestock farming areas hu et al 2017 hubbard et al 2020 therefore a rapid and effective method for identifying groundwater pollution from livestock farming would be highly valuable dom is ubiquitous in groundwater lee et al 2018 however its content in natural groundwater is generally lower than that in surface water mcdonough et al 2020 anthropogenic activities such as irrigation hu et al 2020 landfills ma et al 2021 and anthropogenic groundwater recharge zheng et al 2020 can alter the content and composition of dom in groundwater ma et al 2021 and zheng et al 2020 confirmed the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy to identify groundwater pollution from landfills and anthropogenic groundwater recharge respectively based on the sensitive response to anthropogenic activities fluorescence spectroscopy might also be effective for identifying groundwater pollution from livestock farming to the best of our knowledge few studies have applied fluorescence spectroscopy to identify groundwater pollution from livestock farming fluorescence spectroscopy which has the advantages of high sensitivity simple processing and low cost has been widely adopted to characterize dom lee et al 2018 stubbins et al 2014 fluorescence excitation emission matrix eem coupled with parallel factor analysis parafac provides an interpretable method for quantitative analysis of fluorescent substances murphy et al 2013 stedmon and bro 2008 which could support the assessment of water quality baker et al 2015 heibati et al 2017 in addition multivariate statistical analyses such as hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca have been recognized as comprehensive methods for research on water quality han et al 2020 li et al 2011 varol 2020 hca can quantify the similarities and or differences among the samples liu et al 2020 moreover pca is generally used to reduce the dimensionality of data and extract the main factors that influence water quality paca et al 2019 thus the application of hca and pca could improve the interpretation of fluorescence characteristics and support the identification of groundwater pollution in this study a typical livestock farming area in ordos city northwest china was selected to investigate the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying groundwater pollution from livestock farming for this purpose several traditional optical indices eem parafac and multivariate analytical methods pca and hca were utilized the objectives of this study were 1 to investigate the optical characteristics of dom and its association with groundwater pollution 2 to develop a method based on fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying groundwater pollution caused by livestock farming and 3 to validate the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying groundwater pollution in livestock farming areas 2 material and methods 2 1 sample collection and pretreatment ordos city belongs to the arid and semi arid region of northwest china fig 1 a and is administrated by the inner mongolian autonomous region grasslands and deserts cover most of ordos city making it a transitional zone between cropland and rangeland but it is mainly used for livestock farming du et al 2015 according to the land use map in 2018 fig 1b land use data in 2017 is not available ordos city had an area of 87 141 km2 of which 72 087 km2 82 7 was agriculture land moreover pasture land occupied the largest area of agricultural land 78 1 followed by forest land 15 9 however only 5 5 of the agricultural land area was cultivated land the total number of livestock in 2017 reached 7 671 million in ordos city of which sheep and goats were the main livestock accounting for approximately 90 the study area is located in the middle of ordos city and has well developed livestock farming yue et al 2016 as shown in fig 1c the study area is mainly covered by pasture land and saline alkali land or desert while both cultivated land and rural residential land accounted for less than 5 of the study area surface water is scarce in the study area and groundwater is the main water source yin et al 2010 the major aquifer is cretaceous sandstone with good permeability fig 1d which is overlain by thin quaternary sediments and aeolian sands lyu et al 2019 pan et al 2018 as shown in fig 1d there are five groundwater flow systems in the study area including three local flow systems one intermediate flow system and one regional flow system lens of mudstone exist in the cretaceous formation but have limited area and thickness thus they cannot form a regional aquitard lyu et al 2019 in september 2017 36 groundwater samples were collected from wells that served for domestic and agricultural irrigation five groundwater samples were recognized as outliers and removed in the eem parafac process stedmon and bro 2008 the remaining 31 groundwater samples were included in the study and their distribution is shown in fig 1c before sampling the wells were purged for approximately 5 min and the sample bottles were rinsed with abstracted water each water sample was filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter samples for anion analysis were preserved in 50 ml polyethylene bottles while those for cation analysis were acidified to ph 2 with hno3 and then preserved in 50 ml polyethylene bottles samples for dissolved organic carbon doc analysis and dom characterization were preserved in 40 ml

stedmon 2009 plots of the corrected eems are shown in fig s1 the parafac model was developed based on the corrected eems of the 31 groundwater samples using the stardom package pucher et al 2019 in r software r core team 2021 the noisy range data above 580 nm em was eliminated a three component model fig 2 was validated by split half analysis fig s2 and tucker s congruence coefficients table s2 murphy et al 2013 based on the openfluor database similarity scores 0 90 murphy et al 2014 the three fluorescence components were identified as fulvic acid like components c1 humic like components c2 and tryptophan like components c3 respectively table s3 the content and composition of parafac components in each sample were estimated by calculating fmax fig s3 and fmax fig s4 respectively wauthy et al 2018 the corrected eems and absorbance values were used to calculate optical indices the fluorescence index fi was calculated as the ratio of the emission intensity at 450 nm to that at 500 nm with an excitation wavelength of 370 nm mcknight 2001 the biological index bix was the ratio of the emission intensity at 380 nm to that at 430 nm with an excitation wavelength of 310 nm huguet et al 2009 the absorption coefficient at 254 nm is a254 which indicates the dom content li and hur 2017 the ratio of absorbance at 250 nm to 365 nm was calculated to obtain e2 e3 peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 the specific uv absorbance at 254 nm suva254 was determined by dividing the uv absorbance measured at λ 254 nm by the doc content of the sample weishaar et al 2003 data on dom optical indices and doc

standardized before hca and pca euclidian distance was used with ward s method to separate different clusters in the hca the variation of dom and hydrochemistry parameters among the clusters were analyzed by the wilcoxon test using r software 3 results and discussion 3 1 content and optical characteristics of dom a254 was used as a proxy for doc li and hur 2017 as shown in fig 3 a254 and doc showed a strong positive correlation which is consistent with previous study li and hur 2017 generally groundwater has low doc content which is close to 1 mg l 1 mcdonough et al 2020 in addition the values of a254 in unpolluted groundwater were close to or less than 1 m 1 in previous studies chen et al 2010 shen et al 2015 zheng et al 2020 in this study area the values of a254 and doc content in groundwater samples ranged from 0 to 14 74 m 1 and 1 71 to 5 05 mg l 1 respectively table s4 thus the increase in a254 and doc might be associated with groundwater pollution eem parafac was conducted to determine the relationship between the fluorescence characteristics and groundwater pollution as shown in fig 3 fluorescence intensity fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 showed a strong positive correlation with doc and a254 natural waters polluted by anthropogenic activities have been widely demonstrated to exhibit enhanced fluorescence intensity carstea et al 2016 old et al 2012 sgroi et al 2017 in terms of the proportion fmax of the three fluorescence components fmax c2 had a strong negative correlation with doc and a254 while fmax c3 had a strong positive correlation fig 3 previous studies have reported that the elevated intensity and proportion of tryptophan like fluorescence indicate a risk of pollution baker et al 2015 heibati et al 2017 sorensen et al 2020 the results of the dom content and the fluorescence characteristics indicated that the groundwater in the study area has been affected by human activities generally the leachate derived from livestock waste has high doc content fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like substances baker 2002 naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 singh et al 2014 which is consistent with the dom characteristics of polluted groundwater in the study area thus livestock waste is a potential source of groundwater pollution however untreated sewage has similar fluorescence characteristics to livestock waste making it difficult to distinguish pollution sources using fluorescence spectroscopy carstea et al 2016 therefore land use and hydrogeological conditions were analyzed to help identify the pollution sources groundwater in the study area generally flows from northwest to southeast fig 1d according to the land use types in the study area fig 1c rural residential areas were the major sources of sewage but most of rural residential areas are mainly located in the southeastern part of the study area near the discharge area of the groundwater flow systems fig 1d thus the untreated sewage in rural residential areas cannot be the major sources of groundwater pollution at sampling sites in contrast livestock farming was well developed in the study area yue et al 2016 with approximately 50 of the study area covered by pasture land fig 1c in this study area livestock waste is randomly discharged in pasture land or is most commonly used as organic fertilizer in cultivated land therefore the high content and fluorescence of doc with a high proportion of tryptophan like substances in the groundwater were mainly caused by the pollution of livestock waste suva254 can be used to assess the degree of aromaticity of dom weishaar et al 2003 which ranged from 0 to 1 47 l mg 1 m 1 in the study area table s4 a higher degree of aromaticity is associated with a high content of humic substances derrien et al 2020 our study showed that the intensities of the humic like fmax c1 and fulvic like components fmax c2 exhibited a strong positive correlation with suva254 further supporting the findings of a previous study derrien et al 2020 e2 e3 was used to represent the molecular weight of dom peuravuori and pihlaja 1997 demonstrated that e2 e3 is negatively correlated with the molecular weight of dom in this study area e2 e3 ranged from 1 to 33 table s4 and it was negatively correlated with fmax c2 but positively correlated with fmax c3 thus the results of e2 e3 indicated that the humic like component was associated with high molecular weight substances while the tryptophan like component was associated with low molecular weight substances this result is consistent with the findings of nguyen et al 2010 the positive correlation between suva254 e2 e3 doc fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 indicated that the pollution from livestock farming enhanced the degree of aromaticity but decreased the molecular weight of dom in groundwater fi and bix can provide information about the dom source the fi value is 1 4 for dom from terrestrially derived sources and 1 9 for dom from microbially derived sources mcknight 2001 yang et al 2020 the bix value is 0 6 0 7 for terrestrially derived dom and 1 for microbially derived dom huguet et al 2009 qi et al 2018 the values of fi and bix ranged from 1 27 to 1 65 table s4 median 1 50 and 0 to 0 95 table s4 median 0 80 in the study area respectively indicating that there were both terrestrially derived and microbially derived dom in the studied groundwater furthermore both fi and bix exhibited a positive correlation with doc fig 3 fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 suggesting that livestock farming pollution could enhance the inputs of microbially derived dom in groundwater in summary these results suggest that the optical characteristics of dom are sensitive to groundwater pollution from livestock farming in the study area the doc degree of aromaticity microbially derived dom fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like components in groundwater increased with the increase in the pollution degree but the proportion of humic like components and molecular weight of dom decreased 3 2 hca and pca based on fluorescence parameters hca split the groundwater samples into three clusters clusters a b and c fig s5 cluster a had the lowest doc fig 4 a and degree of aromaticity fig 4b moreover the a254 values fig 4c of cluster a median 0 69 m 1 were significantly lower than 1 m 1 these findings indicated that the groundwater in cluster a was unpolluted however the a254 values of clusters b median 11 28 m 1 and c median 3 91 m 1 were significantly higher than 1 m 1 suggesting that the groundwater samples in clusters b and c were polluted moreover the doc content degree of aromaticity and a254 of cluster b were significantly higher than those of cluster c indicating that the groundwater in cluster b was more polluted than that in cluster c as shown in fig 4d no significant difference was observed between clusters b and c in the e2 e3 value wilcoxon test p 0 05 however the e2 e3 ratio of cluster a median 3 31 was significantly lower than those of clusters b median 16 25 and c median 12 41 respectively thus the groundwater in clusters b and c had a similar molecular weight of dom which was lower than that of cluster a in addition no significant difference wilcoxon test p 0 05 was observed in the values of fi and bix between clusters b and c fig 4e and 4f the fi and bix of clusters b median 1 53 and 0 88 respectively and c median 1 56 and 0 82 respectively were higher than 1 4 and 0 7 respectively however the fi median 1 39 and bix median 0 32 of cluster a were lower than 1 4 and 0 7 respectively the results of fi in the three clusters were in agreement with those of bix therefore microbially derived sources had a strong influence on the groundwater in clusters b and c whereas terrestrially derived sources dominated the dom of groundwater in cluster a huguet et al 2009 mcknight 2001 the eems of the groundwater samples are plotted in fig s1 the eems in cluster b had the highest maximum fluorescence intensity of 0 6 ru which was higher than that of cluster c 0 4 ru the maximum fluorescence intensity of eems in cluster a was 0 05 ru which was significantly lower than those of clusters b and c moreover the eem characteristics of clusters b and c were significantly different from those of cluster a the peak b and t excitation 270 280 nm emission 330 368 nm signals fellman et al 2010 of the eems were distinct in clusters b and c but very weak or not detected in cluster a this indicated that the groundwater in clusters b and c contained more tryptophan like substances than that in cluster a in terms of the eem parafac components fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 of cluster a were significantly lower than those of clusters b and c fig 5 a in particular abundant tryptophan like components were found in the groundwater of clusters b median 0 15 ru and c median 0 05 ru whereas almost none were detected in cluster a range 0 0 001 ru median 0 this further confirmed that the groundwater in cluster a was unpolluted the significant differences in the intensities of the tryptophan like components among clusters a b and c suggested that it is a sensitive indicator of groundwater quality fmax c1 fmax c2 and fmax c3 of cluster b were significantly higher than those of cluster c demonstrating that the groundwater in cluster b was more polluted than that in cluster c for the proportion of fluorescence components fig 5b the fmax c3 of cluster a was higher than those of cluster b and c while the fmax c2 of cluster a was lower than those in clusters b and c therefore the pollution from livestock farming increased the proportion of tryptophan like components in groundwater but decreased the proportion of humic like components according to the content and optical characteristics of dom in groundwater the three clusters can be classified as follows cluster a unpolluted cluster b highly polluted cluster c moderately polluted according to a previous report livestock waste had a higher ratio of tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity baker 2002 which ranged from 2 5 for cattle and pig slurries and 0 5 4 0 for sheep barn waste we used the ratio of fmax c3 to fmax c1 fmax c3 c1 as a proxy for the ratio of tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity as shown in fig 5c tryptophan fulvic like fluorescence intensity of clusters b median 0 35 and c median 0 25 was significantly lower than that of livestock waste baker 2002 in addition the ratio of tryptophan like to fulvic humic like fluorescence ti fi was used to identify livestock waste pollution livestock waste have been reported to have a relatively high ti fi 2 5 or higher while diluted manure runoff is less than 1 naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 the ratio of fmax c3 to the sum of fmax c1 and fmax c1 fmax c3 c1 c2 was used in our study as a proxy for ti fi as shown in fig 5c the ti fi of clusters b median 0 23 and c median 0 16 were similar to diluted manure runoff but significantly lower than that of livestock waste naden et al 2010 old et al 2012 in summary the ratio of tryptophan like substances significantly decreased during the transportation process from livestock waste into groundwater which could be because of biodegradation and or mineral adsorption singh et al 2014 although the ratio of tryptophan like substances in polluted groundwater was significantly lower than that in livestock waste it was sufficiently high to distinguish it from unpolluted groundwater fig 5c thus tryptophan like fluorescence could be a reliable indicator for identifying the influence of livestock farming pollution on groundwater nevertheless the interaction between biogeochemical processes and the fluorescent dom of livestock waste should be further investigated in the future as shown in fig 6 pca based on the fluorescence parameters explained 91 5 of the variance between the groundwater samples with the first two principal components pc1 and pc2 pc1 explained 73 8 of the variance which was positively correlated with fi bix fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c3 and negatively correlated with fmax c2 as the pollution from livestock farming enhanced the inputs of microbially derived dom fluorescence intensity and the proportion of tryptophan like components pc1 could be interpreted as the pollution degree of the groundwater moreover the groundwater samples were in the order of the pollution degree along axis of pc1 further indicating that livestock farming pollution could significantly alter the content and composition of dom pc2 explained 17 7 of the variance which was positively correlated with fmax c1 but negatively correlated with fmax c1 fmax c2 fmax c3 and fmax c2 generally both biodegradation and mineral adsorption can reduce the fluorescence in water for biodegradation the tryptophan like component has high bioavailability while the humic like and fulvic like components are refractory dom zheng et al 2020 microorganisms preferentially consume tryptophan like components lee et al 2018 in this study the axis of pc2 was almost perpendicular to fmax c3 therefore biodegradation did not significantly correlate with pc2 moreover the humic like component exhibited a longer ex em which could be regarded as a red shift of the fulvic acid like component therefore the molecular weight of the humic like component is larger than that of fulvic acid like component fellman et al 2010 ignatev and tuhkanen 2019 dom with a high molecular weight is more readily adsorbed on mineral surfaces inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2015 ohno et al 2007 leading to a decrease in fmax c2 therefore pc2 might be associated with mineral adsorption on dom furthermore the groundwater samples of clusters a b and c did not overlap on the pca map and occupied different locations further validating the results of hca 3 3 hydrochemical characteristics and their implications for pollution identification in this study area no3 was ubiquitously observed in the groundwater previous studies have reported that nitrogen fertilizer and livestock waste are major sources of no3 pollution in groundwater in agricultural areas kim et al 2021 lazcano et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 however the area of cultivated land only accounted for less than 5 in the study area and organic manure from livestock waste is most commonly used to increase soil productivity in cultivated land furthermore the area of pasture land accounted for approximately 50 in the area and large amounts of livestock waste are randomly discharged in the pasture land thus livestock waste was a major source of no3 in the groundwater although there may be other sources of no3 such as inorganic fertilizers in the study area the range of no3 content was 0 73 191 80 mg l 1 table s1 as shown in fig 7 cluster a had the lowest no3 content with a range of 0 73 16 90 mg l 1 median 0 74 mg l 1 while cluster b had the highest no3 content with a range of 95 90 191 80 mg l 1 median 158 60 mg l 1 the no3 content of cluster c was between clusters a and b with a range of 24 50 122 00 mg l 1 median 43 30 mg l 1 in addition the no3 content exhibited a strong positive correlation with fmax c3 r2 0 77 as shown in fig 7 therefore the distribution of no3 was in agreement with the results of the fluorescence parameters validating the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy for identifying groundwater pollution caused by livestock farming in addition tryptophan like fluorescence could predict the no3 content of groundwater in livestock farming areas as indicated by the high correlation between no3 content and fmax c3 piper tri linear diagram were used to analyze the hydrochemical characteristics of groundwater as shown in fig 8 hco3 was the dominant anion in groundwater accounting for more than 50 61 2 54 8 and 73 6 for clusters a b and c respectively na was the dominant cation in cluster a while ca2 was the dominant cation in clusters b and c fig 8 therefore the hydrochemical type of cluster a was mainly na hco3 while those of clusters b and c was ca hco3 previous studies have reported that na hco3 type groundwater belongs to deep groundwater while the ca hco3 type belongs to shallow groundwater pan et al 2018 rao et al 2015 this indicated that the groundwater in cluster a originated from deep groundwater whereas those in clusters b and c originated from shallow groundwater therefore the effects of livestock farming were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area in addition cl has also been used as a tracer for identifying groundwater pollution caused by livestock farming kohn et al 2021 torres martinez et al 2021 in this study area the unpolluted groundwater cluster a had a wider range of cl content than the polluted groundwater clusters b and c due to various water rock interactions lyu et al 2019 hindering the indicator ability of cl therefore the interference of background values should be considered when using cl as an indicator to identify groundwater pollution 4 conclusions by utilizing the eem parafac coupled with hca and pca this study provides a potential method for identifying monitoring and assessing groundwater pollution from livestock farming which is rapid low cost and sensitive the main conclusions are as follows pollution from livestock farming significantly enhanced doc content microbially derived dom degree of aromaticity fluorescence intensity and the proportion of the tryptophan like component in the groundwater but decreased the proportion of the humic like component and molecular weight of dom these effects were mainly observed in shallow groundwater in the study area hca based on the fluorescence parameters split the groundwater samples into three clusters with significantly different pollution degrees providing valuable information for the assessment of groundwater pollution pca explained 91 5 of the variance of the fluorescence parameters with the first two principal components and revealed that the degree of pollution dominated the fluorescence characteristics in the study area tryptophan like fluorescence was abundant in the polluted groundwater but almost none was detected in the unpolluted groundwater in the study area indicating that it might be a tracer for groundwater pollution from livestock farming large amounts of no3 which primarily originated from livestock waste in the study area leached into the shallow groundwater clusters b and c while the deep groundwater cluster a had low no3 content further validating the analysis results of the fluorescence characteristics considering the variation in hydrogeological setting land use livestock density and other site conditions between different livestock farming areas further research on this topic in other livestock farming areas would help to enhance and expand the results and
