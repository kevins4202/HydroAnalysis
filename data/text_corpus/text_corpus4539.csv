22695,this study investigates performance and load shedding capabilities of an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec that utilizes adjustable geometry to control hydrodynamic coefficients the body consists of a bottom hinged rectangular paddle in which the frame holds five horizontal flaps spanning the interior of the frame each flap can rotate independently about its center of rotation to alter hydrodynamic coefficients a 1 14 scale model was built for wave tank tests where the oswec s natural response to regular waves was measured tests with the paddle fixed vertically were conducted to measure the moment induced by incident waves results were compared to numerical simulations which determined that flap orientation significantly affected wave energy transmission past the device numerical simulations with the addition of a linear rotational damper power take off pto suggested that with flaps open the resistive moment was reduced by up to 47 the surge force on the foundation up to 55 and the capture width up to 72 over a range of wave periods and pto damping values the experimental nondimensional excitation moments and reflection coefficients were reduced by up to 54 overall the flaps provide mechanical means to reduce loads thus improving the design life of a wec system keywords oscillating surge wave energy converter wave energy converter load shedding variable geometry 1 introduction in this paper we study the performance and load shedding characteristics of a bottom hinged oscillating paddle with variable geometry this concept was labeled as an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec that had been proposed in tom et al 2016 coastal and nearshore wave energy converters wecs similar to the one proposed here have been the subject of recent research with concepts like the oyster whittaker and folley 2012 waveroller lucas et al 2012 and the surge wec ramudu 2011 wave structure interaction studies on similar flap type wecs have been performed looking at the viscous effects wei et al 2015 and slamming wei et al 2016 henry et al 2013 as with all marine structures the survivability of wecs in extreme environmental conditions becomes a driving factor not only in the structural design but pto components as well economics usually determine the power rating of any given wec based on site specific design waves so incident wave energy beyond the rated threshold does not result in more power output this often requires a shutdown mechanism to be in place to save the structure from failure and damage when incident wave energy exceeds the design threshold cameron and doherty 2010 the uniqueness of the present concept is the ability to vary geometrical features to either optimize the power generation or shed hydrodynamic loads subject to different field locations and environmental conditions fig 1 shows a concept of the oswec studied in this work while table 1 defines the variables associated with fig 1 the main body is a plate or a paddle with non negligible thickness which is hinged near the seafloor and extends up to the mean water level and is subject to the wave field incident normal to its surface the main response of the plate is an oscillatory rotation ϕ about its hinge and for still water conditions the paddle surface does not pierce the free surface which contrasts with other similar studies e g gomes et al 2015 and crooks et al 2016 the flaps located in the lower part of the plate can in principle be adjusted to any angle φ about their axis of rotation both ends of each flap can be capped with circular mounting plates for simple adjustment of angle φ in theory this concept parallels modern wind turbine designs which give the ability to feather the blades to maintain rated power for the purposes of this study the flap orientation was limited to the closed 0 and open 90 configurations only this change in flap orientation leads to the greatest change in the device s hydrodynamic properties and hence its performance as a wave energy extractor the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 builds the oswec frequency domain pitch equation of motion while describing the various moments that are summed about the paddle hinge sections 3 and 4 describe the experimental model and the setup respectively section 5 gives a brief overview of the numerical setup as the work has been explained well in a previous work tom et al 2016 section 6 compares the results from both experiments and numerical simulations however more effort is devoted to using the complementary features of these two sets of results to understand the device performance the final section concludes with the authors suggestions on future work 2 oswec frequency domain pitch equation of motion the equation of motion of the oswec paddle can be determined from first principles the summation of moments about the paddle hinge are given by a hydrostatic restoring moment m h which is the balance between the effects of gravity and buoyancy fig 1 and for small rotation angles is given by m h ρ g z b w z g ϕ here ρ is the water density g is acceleration due to gravity is the submerged volume of the device and w is its weight z b and z g denote the vertical positions of the centers of buoyancy and gravity from the origin of reference respectively b hydrodynamic radiation moment m r is comprised of an added inertia term and a wave damping term the added inertia is represented by an added moment of inertia coefficient a 55 and arises from the additional torque from the fluid acting on the structure the radiation damping arises from wave generation as a result of paddle movement hydrodynamic moment has been the subject of considerable discussion in ramudu 2011 the linear hydrodynamic radiation moment can be written as m r a 55 ϕ b 55 ϕ where b 55 is the wave radiation damping coefficient c incident wave induced moment m w is a combination of the incident wave induced pressure acting on the surface of the paddle and wave scattering effect the wave induced forces and moments are generally calculated from a boundary element method solver as described later in section 4 for small amplitude waves the moment is normally written as a linear function of the wave amplitude a d mechanical damping m s is a result of any friction in the bearings at the bottom hinge of the paddle these effects are usually expressed as the product of a damping coefficient b s and the paddle angular velocity and quantified by free decay tests in air e power take off pto moment m p t o caused by the power take off system working to absorb and convert energy from the oscillating paddle is normally written as the product of a damping coefficient b p t o and the paddle velocity it should be noted that a common practice for marine applications is to include a viscous drag term in the equation of motion of a body however a study by wei et al 2015 used cfd simulations to examine the viscous effect on a similar bottom hinged wec wei et al concluded that the viscous effects are negligible as the radiation and diffraction effects are dominant on paddle motion for this reason viscous drag terms were not considered for the present study by combining these moments the equation of motion amenable for frequency domain analysis can be written as 1 ω 2 j a 55 ω i ω b 55 ω b s b p t o ρ g z b w z g ϕ 0 m w ω where j represents the device s pitch mass moment of inertia this equation is a linearized version of the complete nonlinear formulation of the problem refer to the work of gomes et al 2015 for a comprehensive treatment of the latter herein it is assumed that the far field incident wave and the paddle motion response are sinusoidal with frequency ω and with amplitudes a and ϕ 0 respectively a nondimensional response amplitude operator rao can be expressed as 2 r a o ϕ 0 k a where k is the wave number corresponding to the linear dispersion relation of plane progressive waves and can be computed from the wave frequency and water depth power capture efficiency provides important information regarding the performance of the oswec this concept is explored in this paper using the relative capture width c w which is a ratio of the time averaged power absorbed by the pto p t a p to the time averaged power per unit width contained in the incident wave p w from linear wave theory p w is obtained from wehausen and laitone 1960 3 p w 1 4 ρ g a 2 g k tanh k d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where d is the water depth the capture width is nondimensionalized by dividing by the width of the device w 4 c w p t a p w p w and referred to as the capture width ratio 3 model description the main paddle of the model under investigation was constructed at approximately a 1 14 scale from sheets of high density polyethylene that were heat welded at the joints to create watertight upper and lower hollow chambers connected by solid side plates both the upper and lower chambers contained pvc pipes that span the width of the device to act as ballast ports for future studies these ports were empty and sealed with threaded caps for the current experiments the main paddle body incorporated a window that housed the variable pitch flaps the five variable pitch elliptical flap cross sections were printed in three dimensions in sections of polylactic acid plastic the individual sections of each flap were joined with two continuous wooden dowels through the interior of each section spanning the width of the window and reinforcing strips of fiberglass on each broad side of the ellipse a final coat of epoxy was applied to protect each flap from leaks the minor axis dimension of each ellipse is identical for all flaps at 21 mm whereas the major axis dimension is different for each flap as shown in fig 2 the high density polyethylene body was mounted to a steel bearing plate at its bottom surface and utilized corrosion resistant bearings with integrated shaft clamps at the locations shown in fig 2 greater detail of the entire device is shown in fig 3 the oswec was mounted in the wave tank by a rigid frame made of ¼ in by 3 in steel flat bar that was clamped to the wave tank structure and hugged the tank walls and floor to create as little obstruction as possible finally a 1 inch diameter steel shaft connected the oswec model to the frame through the bearings the oswec was free to oscillate about its axis of rotation ϕ and each flap can rotate about its respective axis of rotation φ this convention is shown in fig 1 4 experimental methodology the oswec model was tested in an 8 m long 1 m wide wave tank that supports a water depth of 0 7 m waves were generated by a vertically actuated wedge of 45 at one end of the tank and a porous beach at the other end to reduce the amplitude of reflected waves the wave maker and tank can produce regular waves with periods ranging from 0 6 s to 2 0 s and wave amplitudes of 0 0033 0 0897 m the width of the oswec model was chosen specifically to span the width of the tank to simplify the analysis to two dimensions assuming water particle motion would be limited to the x z plane see fig 4 prior to installing the oswec in the wave tank wave heights were recorded in the open tank at a sample rate of 1 khz the relatively short length of the tank resulted in small wave reflections from the back wall and beach the interaction between the reflected waves and the motion of the wave maker resulted in small nonlinearities and multiple harmonics in the measured wave elevation therefore a fast fourier transform fft was used to isolate the wave amplitude of the first harmonic in the data for each set of wave maker inputs due to the high sampling rate used in the data acquisition no special windowing was needed as the position of the maximum value of the amplitude spectrum correlated with the wave frequency very well this amplitude is designated as the incident wave amplitude corresponding to the data set and used as inputs for the numerical simulations of the first experiment described below two opposing string potentiometers each with a 1 m stroke were used to measure the model oswec response in waves the string potentiometers were mounted to the top tank rail support while the free ends of each string were attached to a vertical steel stanchion that was bolted to the side of the oswec a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 and a photo of the oswec and string potentiometers is shown in fig 5 although the potentiometers measured a linear displacement the height of the potentiometers above the axis of rotation h was considered constant due to a small angle assumption of the paddle motion for the wave conditions tested therefore the rotational displacement ϕ of the device was calculated as ϕ tan 1 δ x h next the paddle was fixed vertically to measure the moment about the shaft induced by incident waves in both flap configurations a rigid vertical stanchion was added at the center of the paddle s width extending up to the height of the top tank rails a rigid beam was clamped across the top tank rails and a load cell was bolted between the stanchion and beam holding the paddle fixed vertically maintaining the pinned connection at the shaft the total moment induced by waves could be measured from the horizontal force recorded at the load cell and the given geometry comparing the results between open and closed flap cases in this arrangement provided some insight into the load shedding capabilities of the flaps the reflection coefficient was also calculated in this configuration to show how energy is reflected or transmitted past the device fig 6 shows the setup for this experiment since the fixed paddle resembled a vertical wall spanning the width of the tank partial standing waves were observed between the paddle and wave maker which warranted further investigation on the incident wave characteristics the presence of standing waves contaminated the wave field and wavemaker interaction therefore it was important to separate the incident and reflected waves for calculation of the nondimensionalized wave induced moment on the paddle the composite wave was separated into incident a i and reflected a r amplitude components using the wave record from two fixed probes on the wavemaker side of the paddle nallayarasu et al 1995 dean and dalrymple 1991 such that 5a a i 1 2 sin δ 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 2 a 1 a 2 cos δ 2 δ 2 5b a r 1 2 sin δ 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 2 a 1 a 2 cos δ 2 δ 2 a 1 and a 2 represent the composite wave amplitude at the first and second wave probes respectively δ 2 represents the distance between the two probes and δ 2 k δ 2 where k is calculated using linear wave theory and the prescribed wavemaker period data was collected for approximately 60 s in each run of the fixed paddle experiments a 1 and a 2 were determined by separating each dataset into bins of ten wave cycles each where a fast fourier transform of the time history revealed the amplitude at the dominant frequency this dominant amplitude in each bin was averaged across all bins in each run and considered as the composite amplitude since three probes were installed on the wavemaker side of the paddle the dominant mode amplitude for each of two pairs was averaged for further consideration wp0 wp1 and wp1 wp2 refer to fig 6 special care was taken where δ 2 was equal to an integer multiple of half a wavelength a condition where this method fails the horizontal force at the load cell was measured using the same method of averaging fft on bins of ten cycles each in the previous experiment described above where the paddle was free to oscillate in the generated wave field the same reflection analysis described here showed that the waves reflected off the paddle interacting with the cyclical motion of the wave maker had negligible impact on the incident wave characteristics when compared to the calibration runs in the open tank reflection analysis of the fixed paddle experiments however showed that with most wave cases tested the differences between calculated incident wave amplitudes and those wave amplitudes recorded in the calibration runs were no longer negligible for this reason the incident wave amplitudes after reflection analysis were considered to be the input waves for corresponding numerical comparisons the wave induced moment about the shaft was calculated simply by multiplying the horizontal force at the load cell by the moment arm of 0 955 m this moment was nondimensionalized by τ m the moment due to hydrostatic pressure on one side of the paddle 6 τ m 1 6 ρ g w d 2 a i here w is the width of the paddle finally the reflection coefficient r c was calculated as 7 r c a r a i 5 numerical simulations the program selected to predict the oswec angular displacement during model tests was wec sim ruehl et al 2014 wec sim is an open source wave energy converter simulation tool that is built on the matlab simulink framework and arose out of a collaboration between the national renewable energy laboratory and sandia national laboratories simulations are performed in the time domain by solving the wec equations of motion in all 6 degrees of freedom before wec sim could be run it was necessary to obtain the mass and hydrodynamic properties of the oswec the translational mass center of gravity and mass moment of inertia see table 1 were obtained from dry tests at the university of maine s advanced structures composites center a static angle test was used to find the center of gravity where the device was hung by a single cable at one attachment point the projection of the static vertical cable was recorded through the device the device was then hung by two additional attachment points separately again recording the projected vertical line through the device the intersection of the three projected lines determined the location of the center of gravity the mass moment of inertia was calculated by a simple swing test in which the oswec s shaft was rigidly secured at both ends allowing the paddle to hang upside down and oscillate freely when given an initial displacement using an initial offset of approximately 20 from vertical the paddle was released and the natural period of oscillation was recorded given the measured mass center of gravity distance to the axis of rotation and natural period the moment of inertia was calculated about the axis of rotation the parallel axis theorem was then used to calculate the moment of inertia about the center of gravity as required by wec sim the hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained from wamit v7 2 wamit version 7 2 user manual 2017 which now includes the option to analyze bodies in channels with parallel walls the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated at a spacing of 0 1 rad s for wave frequencies between 2 0 rad s and 11 0 rad s for the 0 and 90 flap orientations the amplitude and frequency of the first harmonic of the wave motion measured during the open tank tests were used as the environmental inputs to wec sim simulations were run for 40 wave periods 40t with a time step of t 100 a ramp time of 10 wave periods 10t and using a 4th order runge kutta fixed time step solver wec sim has two options to calculate the linear hydrodynamic radiation moment 1 the sinusoidal steady state response which assumes that the added moment of inertia and the wave damping are constant at the simulated wave frequency and 2 with the full wave radiation convolution integral however wamit currently does not calculate the infinite frequency added moment of inertia when using the channel option which prevents simulation using option 2 as a result option 1 was selected for initial comparisons the wec sim simulations relied on the linear hydrodynamic forces and no linear or quadratic viscous drag terms were modeled a rotational constraint was used in wec sim to model the connection between the oswec and the rigid frame shaft the rotational constraint is required because wec sim requires the mass and hydrodynamic properties to be defined about the center of gravity of each body it was assumed in the simulations that linear wave theory is applicable and no additional modeling features were used in wec sim fig 7 shows the surge hydrodynamic coefficients from simulations which have the greatest effect on the pitch motion of the paddle about the rotational shaft the nondimensional wave angular frequency is defined as 6 results and discussion free decay experiments were performed to identify the damped natural period of the device five tests at each flap orientation were recorded and showed sufficient repeatability in response the string potentiometers used to measure paddle displacement consisted of a fixed case that contains a rotational transducer with an extendable stainless steel wire rope that attaches to the moving paddle an internal torsional spring maintains a constant tension on the wire rope throughout its stroke and acts as the retraction mechanism a lubricated dust wiper makes contact with the wire rope as it extends and retracts in and out of the case creating low friction on the paddle while the string potentiometers impose a slight mechanical damping force to the paddle in experiments the operational device would be absent of this force and was low enough to be neglected for these experiments as shown in fig 8 the 0 flap orientation exhibits an irregular decay curve this irregular decay is likely due to the oswec device spanning the width of the tank and hence causing a damming effect the motion of the displaced water and its reflection on either side wall can thus result in a non sinusoidal reaction force imposed on the paddle however when the flaps are open there is sufficient water movement from one side of the paddle to the other and hence the curve follows the familiar decay pattern the damped natural period between the second and third peaks of the 0 flap case was t d 6 73 s and t d 4 11 s in the 90 case because the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and pitch mass moment of inertia are constant with flap rotation the reduction in the damped natural period confirms that the added moment of inertia has been reduced in the 90 case after scaling up from the 1 14 model results the full scale damped natural periods are equivalent to t d 25 18 s and t d 15 38 s respectively note that the wave maker used in the current experiments is limited to wave periods of 2 s or less so the device s response was not examined in waves with periods near these damped natural periods much like the wave data collected prior to device installation the oswec s response to incident waves exhibited multiple harmonics in the angular displacement time history to be consistent with the method used to characterize the incident wave amplitude a fast fourier transform analysis was also performed on the angular displacement time history collected in each run the amplitude of the first harmonic was considered as the oswec s angular displacement amplitude and used to determine the pitch rao the experimental pitch rao calculations are compared to the wec sim results in fig 9 and fig 10 shows a sample fft analysis of the paddle s response the agreement between experiments and simulations are quite apparent in fig 9 for the range of frequencies tested the numerically derived hydrodynamic coefficients shown in fig 7 and the experimental free decay test shown in fig 8 suggest that hydrodynamic properties and the resonant pitch frequency can be adjusted by changing flap orientation therefore the response at each flap orientation was expected to show differences however fig 9 shows that the flap orientations investigated do not significantly influence the natural no pto oswec s pitch response in the environment studied the experimental wave frequencies tested were likely high enough such that the hydrodynamic wave pressure did not penetrate to the depth of the flaps in this configuration the pitch displacement magnitude response however shows good agreement between the numerical and experimental results which provides confidence in the hydrodynamics while the natural pitch response in waves did not show significant changes between the 0 and 90 flap cases the differences in free decay response and hydrodynamic coefficients calculated in wamit warranted further investigation of the device s ability to extract energy and shed loads a linear rotational damper pto was added to the wec sim model and simulations were performed for wave periods of 0 7 1 0 1 3 1 6 and 1 9 s and pto damping coefficients ranging between 25 and 425 kg m2 s 1 the wec sim results for the resistive torque applied by the rotational pto as a function of the pto damping coefficient are shown in fig 11 another factor that becomes increasingly important as the device approaches full scale deployment is the load on its foundation the surge foundation force was examined in wec sim runs with the incorporated rotational pto based on previous numerical studies of the oswec s performance tom et al 2016 it can be shown that the foundation reaction force results from both the wave excitation force and the motion of the paddle the resulting nondimensional surge force on the supporting frame is shown in fig 12 finally wec sim was used to estimate the relative capture efficiency of the oswec at both the 0 and 90 flap orientations over the same range of pto damping coefficients with results plotted in fig 13 the results from wec sim shown in figs 11 13 demonstrate the ability of the adjustable flap orientation to control pto and foundation loads the wave energy absorption was investigated further using data collected in the experiments previously described fig 14 and fig 15 show time histories of the wave field upstream and downstream of the device along with the oswec s pitch response ϕ for wave periods of 1 0 s and 1 6 s nondimensional wave frequencies of ω 1 68 and ω 1 05 respectively the pitch response was converted to a length dimension to compare to wave amplitude by ϕ z h tan ϕ where z h is the height of the paddle the time t was nondimensionalized by the wave period and labeled t the oswec was located at x 0 m and the upstream and downstream wave probes were located at x 0 53 m and x 0 60 m respectively the horizontal dashed lines represent the intended wave elevation at the paddle location had the device not been installed the wave elevation at the upstream probe in each 0 case was greater than the 90 case for the same wave environment this outcome was expected as the 90 case would allow some of the wave energy to pass through the openings in the flap window which indicates that the device reflects more energy back in the 0 case given this information it would be expected that the 0 flap orientation would radiate a greater amount of energy in the downstream direction however the wave elevation at the downstream probe for each wave period does not appear to change between the 0 and 90 flap orientations a high speed camera was used during the experiments to capture nonlinear wave structure interactions that would help identify differences between the experimental and numerical results fig 16 shows a series of snapshots that highlight an overtopping sequence over one half period of oswec oscillation recorded with the flaps open in a wave period of 1 2 s and a wave amplitude of 0 07 m as the wave passes the oswec the wave field radiated and diffracted on both sides of the paddle can be seen in fig 16 as the wave appears to split over the device some of the transmitted wave energy is dissipated as the elevated water on each side of the paddle finally collides and projects vertically as shown in fig 16 this vertical projection of the wave surface is a possible explanation for the similarity in transmitted energy between the two flap orientations at the downstream probe in fig 14 another explanation may be that the waves investigated may have been of sufficiently high frequency in which the wave pressure may not penetrate below the solid upper panel resulting in radiated wave energy that is greater than the energy transmitted forced oscillation tests in still water would help to determine the energy in the radiated waves and will be performed in future work the resulting nondimensional wave induced moment m w on the vertically fixed paddle is presented in fig 17 the experimental results show that the open flap configuration can reduce the pitch wave excitation moment between 15 and 55 in the range of waves tested in this experiment the load shedding capabilities of the flaps became increasingly significant as the angular frequency of the waves decreased which agrees with the numerical results storm conditions often lead to waves with longer periods so this characteristic may result in the oswec being capable of operating during more extreme sea states than similar designs without the means of geometrical load shedding capabilities the greater load shedding at longer wave periods is in part because of the solid upper panel height above the flap window since the dynamic wave pressure associated with the longer wavelengths of the lower frequency waves decay more slowly with depth and hence can penetrate below the solid panel and through the flap window the experimental results for 90 flaps agree well with the simulation and the 0 flaps for nondimensional frequencies over 1 2 for frequencies at or below 1 2 there is significant deviation from the simulation this can be potentially is attributable to a cancellation effect arising from the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves refer to fig 18 the phase difference caused during reflection is a function of the frequency as well as localized effects such as the significant vortex shedding observed at the water surface as no dye or other flow visualization techniques were applied when water passed the small space between the oswec and tank walls in the 0 flap case such effects were not significantly observed for the open flap condition lastly the numerical simulations do not consider the dynamics above z 0 in reality waves overtop the device and this effect is more drastic at lower frequency waves in the closed flap case any energy that is not reflected must flow over the top of the device which will not contribute to the wave induced moment on the paddle in the open flap case some of the incoming energy that is not reflected flows through the flap window and the remainder flows over the top which will be less significant than the closed flap case in other words if energy can pass through the open flap window the there will be less overtopping which is not accounted for in the numerical simulation fig 18 shows the results for the reflection coefficient obtained from the experiments the same logic applies that the dynamic wave pressure from the longer waves penetrates below the solid upper panel where the higher frequency waves do not a clear separation is seen in the plot at ω 1 53 where frequencies at or above this point show no significant difference in reflection between flap orientations and frequencies below this point show a reduction in reflection up to 53 in the open flap configuration this point is represented by dashed vertical lines in figs 17 and 18 this point is likely where the wave pressure begins to penetrate the flap window in the fixed case fig 17 also shows significance at this frequency where the moments from waves below this point begin to separate further between the two flap orientations this highlights the load shedding capabilities further by suggesting that more energy is transmitted past the device in the open flap configuration as touched upon in the results from fig 14 above 7 conclusions this paper investigated the performance and load shedding capabilities of an oscillating surge wave energy converter utilizing adjustable flaps as a means of controlling the hydrodynamic loads the pitch response to waves was measured experimentally for flap orientations of 0 closed and 90 open the experimental conditions were modeled numerically using wamit and wec sim and a good agreement was found between the simulations and experiments flap orientation did not have a significant effect on angular displacement of the device in the absence of a pto so further numerical simulations were performed to estimate the effect of flap orientation on structural loads and power capture the numerical results suggest that when partnered with traditional pto damping control strategies the adjustable geometry adds another layer of control and tuning capabilities that warrant further optimization studies by fixing the paddle in the vertical position the wave induced moments on the paddle and reflection coefficients were measured with confidence these results confirmed the flap orientation can significantly control the loads and energy transfer from waves overall the flaps provide a mechanical means to reduce the loads on the foundation and can be designed to shed loads in case of exceedance of pre determined thresholds improving the design life of a wec system future updates for this conceptual device include testing in a much larger wave basin in the absence of wall effects and with the ability to generate longer wave periods it is of interest to observe the model s response to wave periods on both sides of its resonant pitch period and the effect of flap orientation to a wider range of environmental conditions repeating free decay tests in an open basin in the absence of wall effects will allow for a simpler identification of the pitch resonant period and damping ratio in both flap orientations testing in a large basin may also assist in identifying the discrepancies between experimental and numerical results seen in fig 17 another option that could be explored is shifting the pitch resonant period by either applying external linear springs to the device or by changing the center of gravity for continued experiments in the wave tank updates to the model itself may also investigate the size and location of the flap window and adjusting the mass properties using the ballast ports already constructed the goal will be to tune the device s hydrodynamics to shift its resonant pitch frequency to match the wave excitation frequency for maximum power extraction in operational sea states and shed loads in extreme conditions options for testing combinations of the adjustable geometry control discussed in this paper with a model pto system are currently being explored declarations of interest none acknowledgements the first author

22695,this study investigates performance and load shedding capabilities of an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec that utilizes adjustable geometry to control hydrodynamic coefficients the body consists of a bottom hinged rectangular paddle in which the frame holds five horizontal flaps spanning the interior of the frame each flap can rotate independently about its center of rotation to alter hydrodynamic coefficients a 1 14 scale model was built for wave tank tests where the oswec s natural response to regular waves was measured tests with the paddle fixed vertically were conducted to measure the moment induced by incident waves results were compared to numerical simulations which determined that flap orientation significantly affected wave energy transmission past the device numerical simulations with the addition of a linear rotational damper power take off pto suggested that with flaps open the resistive moment was reduced by up to 47 the surge force on the foundation up to 55 and the capture width up to 72 over a range of wave periods and pto damping values the experimental nondimensional excitation moments and reflection coefficients were reduced by up to 54 overall the flaps provide mechanical means to reduce loads thus improving the design life of a wec system keywords oscillating surge wave energy converter wave energy converter load shedding variable geometry 1 introduction in this paper we study the performance and load shedding characteristics of a bottom hinged oscillating paddle with variable geometry this concept was labeled as an oscillating surge wave energy converter oswec that had been proposed in tom et al 2016 coastal and nearshore wave energy converters wecs similar to the one proposed here have been the subject of recent research with concepts like the oyster whittaker and folley 2012 waveroller lucas et al 2012 and the surge wec ramudu 2011 wave structure interaction studies on similar flap type wecs have been performed looking at the viscous effects wei et al 2015 and slamming wei et al 2016 henry et al 2013 as with all marine structures the survivability of wecs in extreme environmental conditions becomes a driving factor not only in the structural design but pto components as well economics usually determine the power rating of any given wec based on site specific design waves so incident wave energy beyond the rated threshold does not result in more power output this often requires a shutdown mechanism to be in place to save the structure from failure and damage when incident wave energy exceeds the design threshold cameron and doherty 2010 the uniqueness of the present concept is the ability to vary geometrical features to either optimize the power generation or shed hydrodynamic loads subject to different field locations and environmental conditions fig 1 shows a concept of the oswec studied in this work while table 1 defines the variables associated with fig 1 the main body is a plate or a paddle with non negligible thickness which is hinged near the seafloor and extends up to the mean water level and is subject to the wave field incident normal to its surface the main response of the plate is an oscillatory rotation ϕ about its hinge and for still water conditions the paddle surface does not pierce the free surface which contrasts with other similar studies e g gomes et al 2015 and crooks et al 2016 the flaps located in the lower part of the plate can in principle be adjusted to any angle φ about their axis of rotation both ends of each flap can be capped with circular mounting plates for simple adjustment of angle φ in theory this concept parallels modern wind turbine designs which give the ability to feather the blades to maintain rated power for the purposes of this study the flap orientation was limited to the closed 0 and open 90 configurations only this change in flap orientation leads to the greatest change in the device s hydrodynamic properties and hence its performance as a wave energy extractor the remainder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 builds the oswec frequency domain pitch equation of motion while describing the various

motion of the oswec paddle can be determined from first principles the summation of moments about the paddle hinge are given by a hydrostatic restoring moment m h which is the balance between the effects of gravity and buoyancy fig 1 and for small rotation angles is given by m h ρ g z b w z g ϕ here ρ is the water density g is acceleration due to gravity is the submerged volume of the device and w is its weight z b and z g denote the vertical positions of the centers of buoyancy and gravity from the origin of reference respectively b hydrodynamic radiation moment m r is comprised of an added inertia term and a wave damping term the added inertia is represented by an added moment of inertia coefficient a 55 and arises from the additional torque from the fluid acting on the structure the radiation damping arises from wave generation as a result of paddle movement hydrodynamic moment has been the subject of considerable discussion in ramudu 2011 the linear hydrodynamic radiation moment can be written as m r a 55 ϕ b 55 ϕ where b 55 is the wave radiation damping coefficient c incident wave induced moment m w is a combination of the incident wave induced pressure acting on the surface of the paddle and wave scattering effect the wave induced forces and moments are generally calculated from a boundary element method solver as described later in section 4 for small amplitude waves the moment is normally written as a linear function of the wave amplitude a d mechanical damping m s is a result of any friction in the bearings at the bottom hinge of the paddle these effects are usually expressed as the product of a damping coefficient b s and the paddle angular velocity and quantified by free decay tests in air e power take off pto moment m p t o caused by the power take off system working to absorb and convert energy from the oscillating paddle is normally written as the product of a damping coefficient b p t o and the paddle velocity it should be noted that a common practice for marine applications is to include a viscous drag term in the equation of motion of a body however a study by wei et al 2015 used cfd simulations to examine the viscous effect on a similar bottom hinged wec wei et al concluded that the viscous effects are negligible as the radiation and diffraction effects are dominant on paddle motion for this reason viscous drag terms were not considered for the present study by combining these moments the equation of motion amenable for frequency domain analysis can be written as 1 ω 2 j a 55 ω i ω b 55 ω b s b p t o ρ g z b w z g ϕ 0 m w ω where j represents the device s pitch mass moment of inertia this equation is a linearized version of the complete nonlinear formulation of the problem refer to the work of gomes et al 2015 for a comprehensive treatment of the latter herein it is assumed that the far field incident wave and the paddle motion response are sinusoidal with frequency ω and with amplitudes a and ϕ 0 respectively a nondimensional response amplitude operator rao can be expressed as 2 r a o ϕ 0 k a where k is the wave number corresponding to the linear dispersion relation of plane progressive waves and can be computed from the wave frequency and water depth power capture efficiency provides important information regarding the performance of the oswec this concept is explored in this paper using the relative capture width c w which is a ratio of the time averaged power absorbed by the pto p t a p to the time averaged power per unit width contained in the incident wave p w from linear wave theory p w is obtained from wehausen and laitone 1960 3 p w 1 4 ρ g a 2 g k tanh k d 1 2 k d sinh 2 k d where d is the water depth the capture width is nondimensionalized by dividing by the width of the device w 4 c w p t a p w p w and referred to as the capture width ratio 3 model description the main paddle of the model under investigation was constructed at approximately a 1 14 scale from sheets of high density polyethylene that were heat welded at the joints to create watertight upper and lower hollow chambers connected by solid side plates both the upper and lower chambers contained pvc pipes that span the width of the device to act as ballast ports for future studies these ports were empty and sealed with threaded caps for the current experiments the main paddle body incorporated a window that housed the variable pitch flaps the five variable pitch elliptical flap cross sections were printed in three dimensions in sections of polylactic acid plastic the individual sections of each flap were joined with two continuous wooden dowels through the interior of each section spanning the width of the window and reinforcing strips of fiberglass on each broad side of the ellipse a final coat of epoxy was applied to protect each flap from leaks the minor axis dimension of each ellipse is identical for all flaps at 21 mm whereas the major axis dimension is different for each flap as shown in fig 2 the high density polyethylene body was mounted to a steel bearing plate at its bottom surface and utilized corrosion resistant bearings with integrated shaft clamps at the locations shown in fig 2 greater detail of the entire device is shown in fig 3 the oswec was mounted in the wave tank by a rigid frame made of ¼ in by 3 in steel flat bar that was clamped to the wave tank structure and hugged the tank walls and floor to create as little obstruction as possible finally a 1 inch diameter steel shaft connected the oswec model to the frame through the bearings the oswec was free to oscillate about its axis of rotation ϕ and each flap can rotate about its respective axis of rotation φ this convention is shown in fig 1 4 experimental methodology the oswec model was tested in an 8 m long 1 m wide wave tank that supports a water depth of 0 7 m waves were generated by a vertically actuated wedge of 45 at one end of the tank and a porous beach at the other end to reduce the amplitude of reflected waves the wave maker and tank can produce regular waves with periods ranging from 0 6 s to 2 0 s and wave amplitudes of 0 0033 0 0897 m the width of the oswec model was chosen specifically to span the width of the tank to simplify the analysis to two dimensions assuming water particle motion would be limited to the x z plane see fig 4 prior to installing the oswec in the wave tank wave heights were recorded in the open tank at a sample rate of 1 khz the relatively short length of the tank resulted in small wave reflections from the back wall and beach the interaction between the reflected waves and the motion of the wave maker resulted in small nonlinearities and multiple harmonics in the measured wave elevation therefore a fast fourier transform fft was used to isolate the wave amplitude of the first harmonic in the data for each set of wave maker inputs due to the high sampling rate used in the data acquisition no special windowing was needed as the position of the maximum value of the amplitude spectrum correlated with the wave frequency very well this amplitude is designated as the incident wave amplitude corresponding to the data set and used as inputs for the numerical simulations of the first experiment described below two opposing string potentiometers each with a 1 m stroke were used to measure the model oswec response in waves the string potentiometers were mounted to the top tank rail support while the free ends of each string were attached to a vertical steel stanchion that was bolted to the side of the oswec a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig 4 and a photo of the oswec and string potentiometers is shown in fig 5 although the potentiometers measured a linear displacement the height of the potentiometers above the axis of rotation h was considered constant due to a small angle assumption of the paddle motion for the wave conditions tested therefore the rotational displacement ϕ of the device was calculated as ϕ tan 1 δ x h next the paddle was fixed vertically to measure the moment about the shaft induced by incident waves in both flap configurations a rigid vertical stanchion was added at the center of the paddle s width extending up to the height of the top tank rails a rigid beam was clamped across the top tank rails and a load cell was bolted between the stanchion and beam holding the paddle fixed vertically maintaining the pinned connection at the shaft the total moment induced by waves could be measured from the horizontal force recorded at the load cell and the given geometry comparing the results between open and closed flap cases in this arrangement provided some insight into the load shedding capabilities of the flaps the reflection coefficient was also calculated in this configuration to show how energy is reflected or transmitted past the device fig 6 shows the setup for this experiment since the fixed paddle resembled a vertical wall spanning the width of the tank partial standing waves were observed between the paddle and wave maker which warranted further investigation on the incident wave characteristics the presence of standing waves contaminated the wave field and wavemaker interaction therefore it was important to separate the incident and reflected waves for calculation of the nondimensionalized wave induced moment on the paddle the composite wave was separated into incident a i and reflected a r amplitude components using the wave record from two fixed probes on the wavemaker side of the paddle nallayarasu et al 1995 dean and dalrymple 1991 such that 5a a i 1 2 sin δ 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 2 a 1 a 2 cos δ 2 δ 2 5b a r 1 2 sin δ 2 a 1 2 a 2 2 2 a 1 a 2 cos δ 2 δ 2 a 1 and a 2 represent the composite wave amplitude at the first and second wave probes respectively δ 2 represents the distance between the two probes and δ 2 k δ 2 where k is calculated using linear wave theory and the prescribed wavemaker period data was collected for approximately 60 s in each run of the fixed paddle experiments a 1 and a 2 were determined by separating each dataset into bins of ten wave cycles each where a fast fourier transform of the time history revealed the amplitude at the dominant frequency this dominant amplitude in each bin was averaged across all bins in each run and considered as the composite amplitude since three probes were installed on the wavemaker side of the paddle the dominant mode amplitude for each of two pairs was averaged for further consideration wp0 wp1 and wp1 wp2 refer to fig 6 special care was taken where δ 2 was equal to an integer multiple of half a wavelength a condition where this method fails the horizontal force at the load cell was measured using the same method of averaging fft on bins of ten cycles each in the previous experiment described above where the paddle was free to oscillate in the generated wave field the same reflection analysis described here showed that the waves reflected off the paddle interacting with the cyclical motion of the wave maker had negligible impact on the incident wave characteristics when compared to the calibration runs in the open tank reflection analysis of the fixed paddle experiments however showed that with most wave cases tested the differences between calculated incident wave amplitudes and those wave amplitudes recorded in the calibration runs were no longer negligible for this reason the incident wave amplitudes after reflection analysis were considered to be the input waves for corresponding numerical comparisons the wave induced moment about the shaft was calculated simply by multiplying the horizontal force at the load cell by the moment arm of 0 955 m this moment was nondimensionalized by τ m the moment due to hydrostatic pressure on one side of the paddle 6 τ m 1 6 ρ g w d 2 a i here w is the width of the paddle finally the reflection coefficient r c was calculated as 7 r c a r a i 5 numerical simulations the program selected to predict the oswec angular displacement during model tests was wec sim ruehl et al 2014 wec sim is an open source wave energy converter simulation tool that is built on the matlab simulink framework and arose out of a collaboration between the national renewable energy laboratory and sandia national laboratories simulations are performed in the time domain by solving the wec equations of motion in all 6 degrees of freedom before wec sim could be run it was necessary to obtain the mass and hydrodynamic properties of the oswec the translational mass center of gravity and mass moment of inertia see table 1 were obtained from dry tests at the university of maine s advanced structures composites center a static angle test was used to find the center of gravity where the device was hung by a single cable at one attachment point the projection of the static vertical cable was recorded through the device the device was then hung by two additional attachment points separately again recording the projected vertical line through the device the intersection of the three projected lines determined the location of the center of gravity the mass moment of inertia was calculated by a simple swing test in which the oswec s shaft was rigidly secured at both ends allowing the paddle to hang upside down and oscillate freely when given an initial displacement using an initial offset of approximately 20 from vertical the paddle was released and the natural period of oscillation was recorded given the measured mass center of gravity distance to the axis of rotation and natural period the moment of inertia was calculated about the axis of rotation the parallel axis theorem was then used to calculate the moment of inertia about the center of gravity as required by wec sim the hydrodynamic coefficients were obtained from wamit v7 2 wamit version 7 2 user manual 2017 which now includes the option to analyze bodies in channels with parallel walls the hydrodynamic coefficients were calculated at a spacing of 0 1 rad s for wave frequencies between 2 0 rad s and 11 0 rad s for the 0 and 90 flap orientations the amplitude and frequency of the first harmonic of the wave motion measured during the open tank tests were used as the environmental inputs to wec sim simulations were run for 40 wave periods 40t with a time step of t 100 a ramp time of 10 wave periods 10t and using a 4th order runge kutta fixed time step solver wec sim has two options to calculate the linear hydrodynamic radiation moment 1 the sinusoidal steady state response which assumes that the added moment of inertia and the wave damping are constant at the simulated wave frequency and 2 with the full wave radiation convolution integral however wamit currently does not calculate the infinite frequency added moment of inertia when using the channel option which prevents simulation using option 2 as a result option 1 was selected for initial comparisons the wec sim simulations relied on the linear hydrodynamic forces and no linear or quadratic viscous drag terms were modeled a rotational constraint was used in wec sim to model the connection between the oswec and the rigid frame shaft the rotational constraint is required because wec sim requires the mass and hydrodynamic properties to be defined about the center of gravity of each body it was assumed in the simulations that linear wave theory is applicable and no additional modeling features were used in wec sim fig 7 shows the surge hydrodynamic coefficients from simulations which have the greatest effect on the pitch motion of the paddle about the rotational shaft the nondimensional wave angular frequency is defined as 6 results and discussion free decay experiments were performed to identify the damped natural period of the device five tests at each flap orientation were recorded and showed sufficient repeatability in response the string potentiometers used to measure paddle displacement consisted of a fixed case that contains a rotational transducer with an extendable stainless steel wire rope that attaches to the moving paddle an internal torsional spring maintains a constant tension on the wire rope throughout its stroke and acts as the retraction mechanism a lubricated dust wiper makes contact with the wire rope as it extends and retracts in and out of the case creating low friction on the paddle while the string potentiometers impose a slight mechanical damping force to the paddle in experiments the operational device would be absent of this force and was low enough to be neglected for these experiments as shown in fig 8 the 0 flap orientation exhibits an irregular decay curve this irregular decay is likely due to the oswec device spanning the width of the tank and hence causing a damming effect the motion of the displaced water and its reflection on either side wall can thus result in a non sinusoidal reaction force imposed on the paddle however when the flaps are open there is sufficient water movement from one side of the paddle to the other and hence the curve follows the familiar decay pattern the damped natural period between the second and third peaks of the 0 flap case was t d 6 73 s and t d 4 11 s in the 90 case because the hydrostatic restoring coefficient and pitch mass moment of inertia are constant with flap rotation the reduction in the damped natural period confirms that the added moment of inertia has been reduced in the 90 case after scaling up from the 1 14 model results the full scale damped natural periods are equivalent to t d 25 18 s and t d 15 38 s respectively note that the wave maker used in the current experiments is limited to wave periods of 2 s or less so the device s response was not examined in waves with periods near these damped natural periods much like the wave data collected prior to device installation the oswec s response to incident waves exhibited multiple harmonics in the angular displacement time history to be consistent with the method used to characterize the incident wave amplitude a fast fourier transform analysis was also performed on the angular displacement time history collected in each run the amplitude of the first harmonic was considered as the oswec s angular displacement amplitude and used to determine the pitch rao the experimental pitch rao calculations are compared to the wec sim results in fig 9 and fig 10 shows a sample fft analysis of the paddle s response the agreement between experiments and simulations are quite apparent in fig 9 for the range of frequencies tested the numerically derived hydrodynamic coefficients shown in fig 7 and the experimental free decay test shown in fig 8 suggest that hydrodynamic properties and the resonant pitch frequency can be adjusted by changing flap orientation therefore the response at each flap orientation was expected to show differences however fig 9 shows that the flap orientations investigated do not significantly influence the natural no pto oswec s pitch response in the environment studied the experimental wave frequencies tested were likely high enough such that the hydrodynamic wave pressure did not penetrate to the depth of the flaps in this configuration the pitch displacement magnitude response however shows good agreement between the numerical and experimental results which provides confidence in the hydrodynamics while the natural pitch response in waves did not show significant changes between the 0 and 90 flap cases the differences in free decay response and hydrodynamic coefficients calculated in wamit warranted further investigation of the device s ability to extract energy and shed loads a linear rotational damper pto was added to the wec sim model and simulations were performed for wave periods of 0 7 1 0 1 3 1 6 and 1 9 s and pto damping coefficients ranging between 25 and 425 kg m2 s 1 the wec sim results for the resistive torque applied by the rotational pto as a function of the pto damping coefficient are shown in fig 11 another factor that becomes increasingly important as the device approaches full scale deployment is the load on its foundation the surge foundation force was examined in wec sim runs with the incorporated rotational pto based on previous numerical studies of the oswec s performance tom et al 2016 it can be shown that the foundation reaction force results from both the wave excitation force and the motion of the paddle the resulting nondimensional surge force on the supporting frame is shown in fig 12 finally wec sim was used to estimate the relative capture efficiency of the oswec at both the 0 and 90 flap orientations over the same range of pto damping coefficients with results plotted in fig 13 the results from wec sim shown in figs 11 13 demonstrate the ability of the adjustable flap orientation to control pto and foundation loads the wave energy absorption was investigated further using data collected in the experiments previously described fig 14 and fig 15 show time histories of the wave field upstream and downstream of the device along with the oswec s pitch response ϕ for wave periods of 1 0 s and 1 6 s nondimensional wave frequencies of ω 1 68 and ω 1 05 respectively the pitch response was converted to a length dimension to compare to wave amplitude by ϕ z h tan ϕ where z h is the height of the paddle the time t was nondimensionalized by the wave period and labeled t the oswec was located at x 0 m and the upstream and downstream wave probes were located at x 0 53 m and x 0 60 m respectively the horizontal dashed lines represent the intended wave elevation at the paddle location had the device not been installed the wave elevation at the upstream probe in each 0 case was greater than the 90 case for the same wave environment this outcome was expected as the 90 case would allow some of the wave energy to pass through the openings in the flap window which indicates that the device reflects more energy back in the 0 case given this information it would be expected that the 0 flap orientation would radiate a greater amount of energy in the downstream direction however the wave elevation at the downstream probe for each wave period does not appear to change between the 0 and 90 flap orientations a high speed camera was used during the experiments to capture nonlinear wave structure interactions that would help identify differences between the experimental and numerical results fig 16 shows a series of snapshots that highlight an overtopping sequence over one half period of oswec oscillation recorded with the flaps open in a wave period of 1 2 s and a wave amplitude of 0 07 m as the wave passes the oswec the wave field radiated and diffracted on both sides of the paddle can be seen in fig 16 as the wave appears to split over the device some of the transmitted wave energy is dissipated as the elevated water on each side of the paddle finally collides and projects vertically as shown in fig 16 this vertical projection of the wave surface is a possible explanation for the similarity in transmitted energy between the two flap orientations at the downstream probe in fig 14 another explanation may be that the waves investigated may have been of sufficiently high frequency in which the wave pressure may not penetrate below the solid upper panel resulting in radiated wave energy that is greater than the energy transmitted forced oscillation tests in still water would help to determine the energy in the radiated waves and will be performed in future work the resulting nondimensional wave induced moment m w on the vertically fixed paddle is presented in fig 17 the experimental results show that the open flap configuration can reduce the pitch wave excitation moment between 15 and 55 in the range of waves tested in this experiment the load shedding capabilities of the flaps became increasingly significant as the angular frequency of the waves decreased which agrees with the numerical results storm conditions often lead to waves with longer periods so this characteristic may result in the oswec being capable of operating during more extreme sea states than similar designs without the means of geometrical load shedding capabilities the greater load shedding at longer wave periods is in part because of the solid upper panel height above the flap window since the dynamic wave pressure associated with the longer wavelengths of the lower frequency waves decay more slowly with depth and hence can penetrate below the solid panel and through the flap window the experimental results for 90 flaps agree well with the simulation and the 0 flaps for nondimensional frequencies over 1 2 for frequencies at or below 1 2 there is significant deviation from the simulation this can be potentially is attributable to a cancellation effect arising from the phase difference between the incident and reflected waves refer to fig 18 the phase difference caused during reflection is a function of the frequency as well as localized effects such as the significant vortex shedding observed at the water surface as no dye or other flow visualization techniques were applied when water passed the small space between the oswec and tank walls in the 0 flap case such effects were not significantly observed for the open flap condition lastly the numerical simulations do not consider the dynamics above z 0 in reality waves overtop the device and this effect is more drastic at lower frequency waves in the closed flap case any energy that is not reflected must flow over the top of the device which will not contribute to the wave induced moment on the paddle in the open flap case some of the incoming energy that is not reflected flows through the flap window and the remainder flows over the top which will be less significant than the closed flap case in other words if energy can pass through the open flap window the there will be less overtopping which is not accounted for in the numerical simulation fig 18 shows the results for the reflection coefficient obtained from the experiments the same logic applies that the dynamic wave pressure from the longer waves penetrates below the solid upper panel where the higher frequency waves do not a clear separation is seen in the plot at ω 1 53 where frequencies at or above this point show no significant difference in reflection between flap orientations and frequencies below this point show a reduction in reflection up to 53 in the open flap configuration this point is represented by dashed vertical lines in figs 17 and 18 this point is likely where the wave pressure begins to penetrate the flap window in the fixed case fig 17 also shows significance at this frequency where the moments from waves below this point begin to separate further between the two flap orientations this highlights the load shedding capabilities further by suggesting that more energy is transmitted past the device in the open flap configuration as touched upon in the results from fig 14 above 7 conclusions this paper investigated the performance and load shedding capabilities of an oscillating surge wave energy converter utilizing adjustable flaps as a means of controlling the hydrodynamic loads the pitch response to waves was measured experimentally for flap orientations of 0 closed and 90 open the experimental conditions were modeled numerically using wamit and wec sim and a good agreement was found between the simulations and experiments flap orientation did not have a significant effect on angular displacement of the device in the absence of a pto so further numerical simulations were performed to estimate the effect of flap orientation on structural loads and power capture the numerical results suggest that when partnered with traditional pto damping control strategies the adjustable geometry adds another layer of control and tuning capabilities that warrant further optimization studies by fixing the paddle in the vertical position the wave induced moments on the paddle and reflection coefficients were measured with confidence these results confirmed the flap orientation can significantly control the loads and energy transfer from waves overall the flaps provide a mechanical means to reduce the loads on the foundation and can be designed to shed loads in case of exceedance of pre determined thresholds improving the design life of a wec system future updates for this conceptual device include testing in a much larger wave basin in the absence of wall effects and with the ability to generate longer wave periods it is of interest to observe the model s response to wave periods on both sides of its resonant pitch period and the effect of flap orientation to a wider range of environmental conditions repeating free decay tests in an open basin in the absence of wall effects will allow for a simpler identification of the pitch resonant period and damping ratio in both flap orientations testing in a large basin may also assist in identifying the discrepancies between experimental and numerical results seen in fig 17 another option that could be explored is shifting the pitch resonant period by either applying external linear springs to the device or by changing the center of gravity for continued experiments in the wave tank updates to the model itself may also investigate the size and location of the flap window and adjusting the mass properties using the ballast ports already constructed the goal will be to tune the device s hydrodynamics to shift its resonant pitch frequency to match the wave excitation frequency for maximum power extraction in operational sea states and shed loads in extreme conditions options for testing combinations of the adjustable geometry control discussed in this paper with a model pto system are currently being explored declarations of interest none acknowledgements the first author

22696,uplift resistance provided by soil cover is a key aspect in the design of a buried offshore pipeline the capacity must be sufficient to avoid upheaval buckling but prediction of the uplift resistance is complicated by disturbance of the soil structure during installation previous numerical investigations of pipeline uplift capacity in undrained clays have employed simple elasto plastic models and consider a homogeneous clay these simplifications neglect critical features of soil pipeline interaction and may not describe the real mechanical behaviour in this paper an advanced kinematic hardening model implemented in a finite element code is used to capture the degradation of structure as a pipeline buried in a natural clay is lifted upwards the spatial variability of clay structure is represented by a random field and monte carlo simulation used to characterise the response this novel framework shows that clay structure has a significant effect on the failure mechanism and uplift capacity of a buried pipeline the probabilistic approach accounts for the uncertainty in the condition of the clay backfill and reveals that the spatial distribution of intact and remoulded material can change the mode of failure emphasising the importance of considering clay disturbance in design keywords offshore pipeline uplift resistance clay structure spatial variability finite element analysis 1 introduction pipelines perform a vital role in offshore energy developments transporting hydrocarbons and other fluids from production wells to onshore and offshore processing facilities frequently pipelines are buried in backfilled trenches for protection from wave and current induced scour bayraktar et al 2016 or from heavy fishing gear a particular concern in intensively fished areas such as the north sea maconochie et al 2015 high pressure and high temperature hydrocarbon flows cause thermal expansion of the pipeline which is opposed by axial soil resistance the lateral component of soil resistance exceeds that in the upwards direction and upheaval buckling where the pipeline buckles in the vertical plane and may protrude out of the trench is a critical design issue palmer et al 1999 although pipe integrity may not be affected upheaval buckling is considered an ultimate limit state failure in the current recommended practice dnv rp f110 2007 widely adopted in industry prediction of the uplift capacity is necessary in order to specify the required depth of cover and the need for any remedial rock dump both of which have implications for project cost however disturbance of the soil during trenching and backfilling operations complicates the estimation of soil resistance as strength profiles established prior to installation of the pipeline may no longer be relevant in clay the backfill can in general be said to consist of intact lumps surrounded by unconsolidated softened clay randolph and gouvernec 2011 the backfill matrix consolidates over time eventually having a minimum undrained shear strength equal to a normally consolidated clay the lumps of intact clay have the effect of increasing the undrained shear strength the trenching method affects the composition of the backfill matrix with jetting resulting in a more homogeneous material due to consolidation of an initial water clay suspension dnv rp f110 2007 while after ploughing the lumps of intact clay tend to be larger with a macro structure that can include cracks and voids physical modelling of the uplift capacity of buried pipelines in clay has been undertaken by schaminee et al 1990 who conducted full scale tests in remoulded material and bransby et al 2002 who considered a fully liquefied clay representing an extreme post jetting scenario more recently attempts have been made to explicitly account for the lumpy nature of clay backfill centrifuge tests have been carried out by cheuk et al 2007 wang et al 2009 and brennan et al 2017 where the backfill consisted of artificially shaped cuboidal or spherical clay lumps these studies show that an understanding of the disturbed condition of clay backfill is vital for prediction of uplift resistance numerical analyses have generally considered an idealised clay with uniform or linearly increasing shear strength e g martin and white 2012 ballard et al 2015 the idealisation of clay as a linear elastic or rigid perfectly plastic material may not allow important physical characteristics to be captured natural clays possess inter particle bonding or structure which can significantly affect soil response under load leroueil and vaughan 1990 but cannot be simulated by simple elasto plastic models furthermore spatial variability is an inherent feature of soil deposits and probabilistic studies using a random field representation have shown that the mechanical behaviour and bearing capacity of offshore foundation types such as skirted foundations charlton and rouainia 2017 and spudcans li et al 2016 in undrained clay can differ from deterministic predictions this paper presents finite element fe analysis of the uplift resistance of a buried pipeline in undrained clay using an advanced critical state constitutive model formulated within a framework of kinematic hardening to capture the degradation of clay structure as the pipeline is lifted upwards the disturbed clay backfill is modelled as a random field representing the spatial variability of clay structure around the pipeline statistics of the uplift capacity are computed by monte carlo simulation and a parametric study is undertaken to identify the effect of the variability of clay structure and the size of zones of disturbed and intact structure on uplift resistance 2 constitutive model the rate independent kinematic hardening structure model khsm developed by rouainia and muir wood 2000 is used to describe the effect of clay structure on pipeline uplift capacity in this study the model is implemented into an fe code plaxis 2012 the khsm extends the conventional modified cam clay mcc model by including an initial amount of structure that is progressively destroyed until a fully remoulded state is reached represented by the reference mcc yield surface the khsm introduces a kinematic hardening bubble and an outer structure surface to describe the state and effect of soil structure the bubble reference and structure surface have the same elliptical shape in the mean effective stress deviatoric stress p q plane the shape of the surfaces in the deviatoric plane is affected by the slope of the critical state line m θ which is a function of the lode s angle θ sheng et al 2000 1 m θ m 2 ψ 4 1 ψ 4 1 ψ 4 sin 3 θ 1 4 where m is the slope of the critical state line for triaxial compression θ 30 o and ψ is defined using the friction angle at critical state φ as follows 2 ψ 3 sin φ 3 sin φ such that the surfaces coincide with the vertices of the mohr coulomb hexagon in the deviatoric plane the essential feature of the khsm is the degradation of structure in the soil as plastic strain accumulates the degree of structure is firstly specified by the parameter r 0 which controls the initial size of the structure surface in relation to the reference surface r 0 1 the degradation of this initial structure is modelled by the following damage law 3 r 1 r 0 1 exp k ε d λ κ where r is the current structure in the soil the damage law is a monotonically decreasing function of a damage strain ε d and the minimum value of r is 1 when structure and reference surfaces coincide the parameter k controls the rate of structure degradation while λ and κ are respectively the slope of the normal compression line and swelling line in a logarithmic specific volume logarithmic mean stress plot damage strain is calculated from the volumetric ε v p and shear ε q p components of plastic strain by a relationship between the strain rates 4 ε d 1 a ε v p 2 a ε q p 2 1 2 where a is a dimensionless parameter that determines how ε v p and ε q p contribute to the damage strain and the degradation of structure in the soil 3 norrköping clay the khsm parameters are calibrated to triaxial test results from norrköping clay an inorganic clay of low sensitivity the calibration procedure was undertaken and reported by rouainia and muir wood 2000 where further details of the model parameters may be found the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 an effective unit weight of γ 8 kn m3 is considered throughout and the initial stress conditions are generated by k 0 consolidation with k 0 1 sin φ where the friction angle is calculated from m the clay is normally consolidated as this is typical of seabed sediments and represents the conditions relevant in the reconsolidated backfill material in a pipeline trench 4 representation of spatial variability 4 1 statistical characterisation of clay structure the spatial variability of clay structure is considered by modelling the khsm parameter r 0 as a random field the choice of probability density function pdf and autocorrelation structure of r 0 is not straightforward as there is limited information available in the literature about the statistics of clay structure for the analysis of the undrained capacity of a buried pipeline the effect of clay structure can be understood by its influence on the undrained shear strength s u in this paper the pipeline is modelled in plane strain and so it is the undrained strength under these boundary conditions that is relevant fig 1 shows the results of simulated undrained plane strain compression tests on k 0 consolidated samples of norrköping clay at 1 m depth the effect of increasing r 0 is to increase the peak value of s u post peak softening occurs as structure is degraded due to the development of plastic strains ultimately the structured clay r 0 1 reduces to the remoulded material simulated by setting r 0 1 when all structure is destroyed it should be noted that a small degree of softening occurs in the remoulded clay due to the evolution of lode s angle which affects the value of m θ during a plane strain compression test the sensitivity of the clay is also greater with increasing levels of initial structure as r 0 does not affect the size of the mcc yield surface and so the remoulded s u remains the same the monotonic relationship between r 0 and s u indicates that basing the statistics of r 0 on those of the undrained shear strength is a reasonable choice by considering the intrinsic mcc parameters of the clay as deterministic the uplift resistance in remoulded clay provides a useful reference against which the pipeline capacity in clay with spatially variable structure can be compared lacasse and nadim 1996 found that a lognormal distribution is appropriate for modelling s u and ching and phoon 2012 also observed that several properties of structured clays including peak and remoulded s u could be satisfactorily represented by a lognormal distribution however the minimum value for r 0 is 1 so a shifted lognormal distribution is considered here r 0 ln n α β 2 δ the cumulative distribution function cdf f of the shifted lognormal distribution is 5 f r 0 α β δ φ ln r 0 δ α β where φ is the gaussian cdf with zero mean and unit variance the first two distribution fitting parameters α and α are respectively the mean and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of r 0 and are computed by 6 β ln 1 σ r 0 2 μ r 0 δ 2 1 2 7 α ln μ r 0 δ 0 5 β 2 where μ r 0 is the mean of r 0 and σ r 0 is the standard deviation of r 0 in the shifted lognormal distribution a third parameter d is introduced in order to move the lower bound of the distribution δ is taken to be 1 so that r 0 cannot take values inadmissible in the khsm the calibrated value of r 0 is considered to be the mean value μ r 0 1 75 this reflects the fact that the spatial variability of structure is inherent to the intact clay as well as the backfilled material keaveny et al 1989 found that the autocorrelation ρ of s u can be represented by either an exponential or square exponential function in this study a square exponential function is chosen 8 ρ r 0 x y x y exp x x θ x 2 y y θ y 2 where θ x and θ y are the autocorrelation distances in horizontal x and vertical y directions respectively and x y and x y are two arbitrary spatial positions the autocorrelation distance will be used to assess the effect of the size and interaction of areas of high structure i e less disturbed or intact clay and low structure which represents zones of disturbed clay that has been remoulded to some extent 4 2 random field generation the shifted lognormal random field of r 0 can be generated as follows 9 r 0 x y δ exp α β g x y where g x y is a correlated gaussian random field of zero mean and unit variance and is discretised on a rectangular grid using the expansion optimal linear estimation eole method li and der kiureghian 1993 the rectangular grid is referred to as the stochastic mesh to indicate its independence from the deterministic finite element model details of which are given in the following section if the nodal coordinates of the stochastic mesh are stored in a vector χ the target autocorrelation matrix of r 0 x y is denoted σ χ χ r 0 and can be constructed using eq 8 the size of σ χ χ r 0 is p q p q if there are p grid points in the x direction and q in the y direction eq 9 is a nataf type transformation liu and der kiureghian 1986 where the i j th element of r 0 x y is computed by r 0 i j f 1 φ ξ i j with ξ i j a standard gaussian random variable the mapping from a gaussian to non gaussian marginal distribution can distort the autocorrelation structure particularly if the target marginal distribution is strongly non gaussian fig 2 a plots the shifted lognormal distribution of the case cov r 0 0 5 with r 0 ln n 1 75 0 766 1 and the normal distribution of equivalent mean and variance as evident in fig 2 b the correlation is significantly distorted the distortion of a non shifted lognormal distribution r 0 ln n 1 75 0 766 is plotted for comparison the shift can be seen to greatly affect the autocorrelation structure in the nataf model the terms ρ g i j of the autocorrelation matrix of the underlying gaussian field σ χ χ g can be computed by solving the following equation 10 ρ r 0 i j r 0 i μ r 0 i σ r 0 i r 0 j μ r 0 j σ r 0 j ϕ ξ i ξ j ρ g i j d ξ i d ξ j where ϕ is the bivariate standard gaussian pdf in the general case eq 10 must be solved numerically for ρ g i j but for the shifted lognormal distribution an analytical solution exists taking advantage of the statistical homogeneity of the random field the autocorrelation in the gaussian space is 11 ρ g i j 1 β 2 ln 1 ρ r 0 i j e β 2 1 a difficulty of the translation approach is that the autocorrelation matrix of the underlying gaussian random field may not be positive semi definite psd ferrante et al 2005 the existence of negative eigenvalues can introduce serious errors into the correlation and statistical properties of the non gaussian random field kim and shileds 2015 this may occur if the target random field is strongly non gaussian and it was observed that the shifted lognormal distribution used for r 0 in this study resulted in σ χ χ g to be non psd in all analysis cases considered to overcome this issue the nearest correlation matrix to σ χ χ g was found using the quadratically convergent newton method proposed by qi and sun 2006 kim and shileds 2015 developed a strategy based on iteratively updating the autocorrelation matrix and computing the nearest correlation matrix at each step the large size of the autocorrelation matrix used in this study 8500 8500 requires a significant computing time to obtain a psd correlation matrix and so a direct method was applied the elements of σ χ χ g are computed first by eq 11 and then the nearest correlation matrix to this is obtained by the method of qi and sun 2006 an example is presented in fig 3 where the horizontal autocorrelation is shown across a section of a random field of r 0 with grid size δ x 0 025 m the non gaussian distribution is again the shifted lognormal of the case cov r 0 0 5 and the target autocorrelation function is square exponential with θ x 1 m the figure shows that the target correlation is well matched with a relative error of 0 19 once the psd autocorrelation matrix σ χ χ g is constructed the discretised standard gaussian random field can be written 12 g ˆ x y μ g σ g i 1 m p q ξ i λ i ϕ i t σ g x y χ g where μ g 0 and σ g 1 λ i and ϕ i are respectively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of σ χ χ g and σ g x y χ g is the correlation between the point x y and χ the expansion is truncated to include m random variables chosen here such that 90 of the variance is captured 5 finite element model the layout of the problem is shown in fig 4 a pipeline of diameter d is embedded at a depth h in a seabed with a horizontal surface the total uplift resistance q u is a combination of pipeline self weight q u p and the resistance of the backfilled soil in the trench r as follows 13 q u q u p r q u p q u s q u γ where r is divided into components of unit weight q u γ and shear strength q u s superposition of resistance components from shear strength and unit weight has been shown to be applicable in the uplift capacity of pipelines ballard et al 2015 in this paper we are concerned with the contribution of soil shear strength and so the self weight of the pipeline is considered equal to the weight of the displaced soil meaning that no net force acts on the pipeline due to its weight or an upwards buoyancy force i e q u q u s a plane strain fe model plaxis 2012 is used to compute the uplift capacity of a pipeline of diameter d 0 2 5 m buried at a depth h 0 875 m the dimensionless embedment ratio h d 3 5 this is chosen as being representative of a typical pipeline diameter and embedment ratio e g bransby et al 2002 cheuk et al 2007 the fe mesh is shown in fig 5 and consists of 539 15 noded triangular elements with the mesh refined in the region around the pipeline for numerical expediency only the bonded interface condition is considered meaning the pipe and soil are attached with an infinite tensile capacity the stochastic mesh consists of bilinear quadrilateral elements it is separate from the fe mesh and values of r 0 are generated at the nodes according to the procedure detailed in section 4 2 the stochastic mesh is extended 0 5 m beyond the fe mesh in all directions as the random field discretisation error increases substantially at the boundaries of the domain sudret and der kiureghian 2000 to transfer information from the stochastic to the fe mesh an interpolation procedure is used each gauss point in the fe mesh is located as belonging to an element of the stochastic mesh and then shape functions are used to map the value of the random field at the nodes of the stochastic element to the gauss point the size of the elements in the stochastic mesh is related to the autocorrelation distance denoted θ c here for brevity sudret and der kiureghian 2000 showed that for a square exponential autocorrelation function the size of element in the stochastic mesh should be less than θ c 2 this criterion is adopted as a maximum value so that the interpolation to the fe gauss point maintains the autocorrelation structure 6 results and discussion 6 1 deterministic analysis fig 6 a shows the load displacement curves for a homogeneous r 0 total displacement d is normalised by the pipeline diameter for structured clay r 0 1 75 a peak resistance is reached before softening occurs as plastic strains develop and structure is degraded in contrast in remoulded clay r 0 1 the load continues to increase until an ultimate value is reached this ultimate load is equal to that of the structured clay at large displacements due to complete remoulding of the clay along the failure planes the peak occurs at a total displacement of 0 25d and 0 35d for structured and remoulded clay respectively this is rather greater than the 0 01 0 03d reported by dnv rp f110 2007 for remoulded homogeneous material but the document also reports that values up to 0 15d have been observed and both cheuk et al 2007 and brennan et al 2017 recorded displacements in the region of 0 4 d in lumpy clays the failure mechanisms are shown in fig 6 b and in both cases a deep flow around failure occurs in dnv rp f110 the uplift resistance in the flow around or local mechanism is given as 14 r n c η s u d where n c is a capacity factor and η is an empirical strength reduction term the value of n c is computed by 15 n c 2 π 1 1 3 tan 1 h d 2 d 1 r g which gives a value of 11 84 with the current embedment and a rough surface r g 1 an exact solution has been derived for the flow around mechanism with n c q u d s u 11 94 randolph and houlsby 1984 table 2 presents the capacity factors for both structured and remoulded clay the reference undrained shear strength s u r e f is taken at the centre of the pipe i e at 1 m depth and calculated by simulating a plane strain compression test using the in situ stress conditions see fig 2 a good match is observed in the remoulded clay with the value of n c within 2 of the plasticity solution in structured clay the capacity factor is predicted to be 25 less than the exact value and the dnv expression however neither solution takes into account the degradation of structure which reduces the capacity factor due to a progressive failure as plastic strains develop fig 7 shows the degradation of structure around the pipeline at failure d 0 6 d the loss of structure is concentrated in the area around the pipeline planes of structure degradation also extend towards the surface these form before the mechanism becomes fully localised at peak resistance and suggest that at this embedment the location of the seabed may still influence uplift behaviour the strength reduction factor η is intended to account for strain softening effects alongside other factors such as strain rate and viscosity dnv rp f110 2007 however there has been much discussion in the literature on the meaning of η martin and white 2012 and ballard et al 2015 state that it may result from mistaking soil buoyancy for a strength effect while brennan et al 2017 discuss the parameter in terms of the strength reduction due to the disturbance of clay backfill during trenching taking r q u and n c from eq 12 η in structured norrköping clay is calculated as 0 745 after rearranging eq 11 this sits in the suggested range for the parameter 0 55 0 85 and slightly above the best estimate value of 0 65 6 2 effect of coefficient of variation of clay structure a parametric study was undertaken with cov r 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 to cover the typical range of variability of s u phoon and kulhawy 1999 for these analyses θ x and θ y are fixed at 6 d 1 5 m and 1 d 0 25 m respectively the horizontal autocorrelation distance is chosen to be similar to the width of a typical steep sided pipeline trench dnv rp f110 2007 while the shorter vertical distance follows from the deposition of the clay load displacement plots from 500 simulations for each value of cov r 0 are presented in fig 8 fig 8 a shows that when cov r 0 is low the load displacement responses are very similar to the deterministic analysis with a homogeneous structure r 0 μ r 0 1 75 in each case a peak load is reached before softening occurs and the load reduces to the remoulded value it can be inferred that a flow around mechanism governs the response however as evident in fig 8 b and c as cov r 0 increases there is a much wider range of load displacement responses after the end of the elastic range importantly the spatial distribution of clay structure can be seen to influence the type of failure fig 9 a shows a random field of clay structure from a simulation with cov r 0 0 5 the corresponding load displacement response of the pipeline is indicated in fig 8 c a zone of relatively weaker soil overlies a stronger area at the level of the pipeline and the degradation of structure shown in fig 9 b has a different form compared to the homogeneous case the highly structured clay around the pipeline increases the lateral restraint and prevents a flow around failure instead a reverse bearing capacity mechanism occurs as illustrated in fig 9 c this involves a block of soil being lifted upwards with the pipe and is described as a global mechanism in dnv rp f110 although suction beneath the pipeline is ignored in the design code rather than post peak softening behaviour the load displacement curve shows an increase to a constant ultimate load that in this realisation is higher than the peak force observed with r 0 1 75 the pdfs of q u are presented in fig 10 for each value of cov r 0 the figure shows that the shape of the pdf becomes more irregular with increasing variability of r 0 as a result of the different failure modes that can occur the uplift resistance also has an approximate lower bound of the remoulded capacity in the current modelling framework 7 42 kpa see table 2 for cov r 0 0 1 and 0 3 the probability of the lower bound occurring is negligible but for cov r 0 0 5 there is a non zero probability that the pipeline will fail in effectively fully remoulded clay the effect of cov r 0 on the mean uplift resistance μ q u is shown in fig 11 a confidence intervals are computed by 10 000 bootstrap samples when the variability of r 0 is low μ q u is close to the deterministic analysis with a homogeneous r 0 further investigation is required to determine whether the higher μ q u at cov r 0 0 1 relative to the homogeneous capacity is a result of a physical mechanism or model non linearity or can be attributed to statistical error the effect of increasing cov r 0 is to reduce μ q u the extreme peak loads and corresponding longer tailed distribution contribute to the increase in the cov of resistance with cov r 0 as shown in fig 11 b 6 3 effect of autocorrelation distance a further parametric study was carried out to identify the effect of the autocorrelation distance which controls the size of areas of high and low structure on pipeline uplift capacity although autocorrelation of soil parameters is generally anisotropic with the correlation length in the horizontal plane often an order of magnitude greater than in the vertical direction the correlation structure is likely to be disturbed during pipeline installation both isotropic and anisotropic autocorrelations are therefore investigated the default value of c o v r 0 is 0 3 and 500 simulations were run to characterise the response for all cases 6 3 1 isotropic autocorrelation in the isotropic case the spatial distribution of clay structure is representative of a backfill where small lumps of clay are randomly arranged fig 12 shows two realisations for isotropic autocorrelation distances of 0 25 d and 0 75 d the range considered in this study is θ x θ y 0 25 d 0 5 d 0 75 d 1 d 2 d which is comparable to the lump sizes considered by cheuk et al 2007 and brennan et al 2017 fig 13 presents the load displacement curves for isotropic autocorrelations of 0 25 d 0 75 d and 2 d with increasing θ x θ y a greater spread in the response is observed as plastic shear strains develop after 0 05 d the isotropic autocorrelation creates regular zones of low and high structure rather than the layered pattern that occurs when θ x θ y in the range considered here failure is therefore governed by the flow around mechanism as the localisation of the shear planes is not prevented by extensive zones of highly structured clay at the sides of the pipeline with weaker material above the effect of the autocorrelation distance on the failure characteristics of the pipeline can be further assessed by considering the displacement at which the peak resistance occurs denoted d p e a k in fig 14 a the mean of d p e a k μ d p e a k is shown as the isotropic autocorrelation distance is increased from 0 25 d to 2 d a clear trend is evident with the mean displacement at peak load decreasing rapidly with increasing θ x θ y until a steady value is reached at 1 d this trend is evidence that the development of the failure mechanism is influenced by frequently occurring zones of stronger and weaker material the full localisation of the mechanism around the pipeline associated with the peak resistance and subsequent softening is delayed by weak paths extending to the surface and d p e a k moves towards that observed in fully remoulded clay the variability of d p e a k shown in fig 14 b is greatest for intermediate autocorrelation distances 0 5 0 75 d suggesting that a mixture of the dominant behaviours at shorter 0 25 d and longer 1 d autocorrelations occur fig 15 presents the statistics of the uplift capacity it is interesting to note that μ q u is at a minimum for intermediate autocorrelation distances 0 5 0 75 d but increases at 0 25 d such a finding has been observed in previous spatial variability analyses of s u such as the undrained capacity of strip footings griffiths and fenton 2001 and attributed to the shear planes eventually cutting through zones of high strength soil as the weak paths become increasingly circuitous and inefficient as θ x θ y 0 at the other extreme θ x θ y the clay tends towards a homogeneous structure and μ q u converges on the deterministic uplift capacity fig 15 b shows that c o v q u also tends to increase with θ x θ y but the relationship is complicated by the combination of behaviours at intermediate autocorrelation distances 6 3 2 isotropic autocorrelation to assess the influence of autocorrelation distance in the horizontal and vertical directions separately θ x and θ y were also altered in turn the parameter ranges investigated are θ x 1 d 3 d 6 d 10 d and θ y 0 5 d 1 d 2 d 4 d the default autocorrelation distances are θ x 6 d and θ y d important effects were observed on the mechanical behaviour and these are summarised by the statistics of d p e a k presented in fig 16 with a longer autocorrelation distance in the x direction the reverse bearing capacity mechanism became increasingly common due to the more frequent occurrence of zones of highly structured clay at both sides of the pipeline this is evident in the increase in μ d p e a k with θ x shown in fig 16 a on the other hand fig 16 b shows that when θ y increases μ d p e a k quickly reduces when θ y 2 d the load displacement curves show that the flow around failure becomes the sole mechanism the clay tends towards a homogeneous structure in the vicinity of the pipeline as θ y this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that as shown in fig 16 d the cov of d p e a k decreases with longer θ y implying that the response is increasingly governed by one type of failure mechanism in contrast fig 16 c shows that a longer θ x results in higher c o v d p e a k suggesting a range of possible failure modes involving flow around of the clay or lifting of a block of soil with the pipe 7 conclusions a study of pipeline uplift resistance in an undrained clay with spatially variable structure has been conducted the effect of clay structure on mechanical behaviour was described using the khsm an advanced critical state constitutive model the model was implemented in a finite element code and coupled with a random field representation of the parameter r 0 which describes the initial degree of structure in a deterministic analysis with a homogeneous clay structure a flow around failure mechanism formed and the load displacement curve in structured clay showed a peak resistance before softening while the uplift resistance in remoulded clay could be validated against published solutions the effect of structure degradation was to reduce the capacity factor in norrköping clay it was found that the strength reduction term η as included in current design guidelines was 0 745 which fits within the recommended limits the failure mechanism was unaffected if the spatial variability of r 0 was low but for higher variability a different mechanism could form involving the lifting of a block of soil with the pipe this emphasises the importance of checking both types of failure in design as the mechanism is not solely dependent on embedment depth or soil properties but is also influenced by the spatial distribution of intact and remoulded clay the size of zones of intact clay high structure and remoulded clay low structure was investigated by changing the autocorrelation distance it was found that with a short isotropic autocorrelation distance where lumps of high and low structure are rather small the full development of the flow around failure mechanism was delayed leading to a greater displacement at peak resistance the mean uplift capacity also increased as the shear planes sought efficient paths through zones of high structure varying the horizontal and vertical autocorrelation distances in turn longer horizontal autocorrelation led to more frequent occurrence of the global failure due to zones of high strength clay preventing lateral propagation of the shear planes around the pipeline a longer vertical autocorrelation favoured formation of the flow around mechanism this study is the first attempt to model many important aspects of the uplift resistance of buried pipelines in a comprehensive numerical framework the probabilistic approach reflects the uncertainty associated with the condition of the backfilled clay and allows a much wider range of potential behaviours to be captured the study demonstrates that the spatial variability of clay structure has a significant effect on uplift resistance it is important to note that the results only apply to the specific clay considered further validation of the ability of the presented approach to simulate pipeline behaviour in clay backfill could be undertaken by a programme of full scale or centrifuge testing acknowledgments the first author would like to thank the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and atkins for funding this research 
22696,uplift resistance provided by soil cover is a key aspect in the design of a buried offshore pipeline the capacity must be sufficient to avoid upheaval buckling but prediction of the uplift resistance is complicated by disturbance of the soil structure during installation previous numerical investigations of pipeline uplift capacity in undrained clays have employed simple elasto plastic models and consider a homogeneous clay these simplifications neglect critical features of soil pipeline interaction and may not describe the real mechanical behaviour in this paper an advanced kinematic hardening model implemented in a finite element code is used to capture the degradation of structure as a pipeline buried in a natural clay is lifted upwards the spatial variability of clay structure is represented by a random field and monte carlo simulation used to characterise the response this novel framework shows that clay structure has a significant effect on the failure mechanism and uplift capacity of a buried pipeline the probabilistic approach accounts for the uncertainty in the condition of the clay backfill and reveals that the spatial distribution of intact and remoulded material can change the mode of failure emphasising the importance of considering clay disturbance in design keywords offshore pipeline uplift resistance clay structure spatial variability finite element analysis 1 introduction pipelines perform a vital role in offshore energy developments transporting hydrocarbons and other fluids from production wells to onshore and offshore processing facilities frequently pipelines are buried in backfilled trenches for protection from wave and current induced scour bayraktar et al 2016 or from heavy fishing gear a particular concern in intensively fished areas such as the north sea maconochie et al 2015 high pressure and high temperature hydrocarbon flows cause thermal expansion of the pipeline which is opposed by axial soil resistance the lateral component of soil resistance exceeds that in the upwards direction and upheaval buckling where the pipeline buckles in the vertical plane and may protrude out of the trench is a critical design issue palmer et al 1999 although pipe integrity may not be affected upheaval buckling is considered an ultimate limit state failure in the current recommended practice dnv rp f110 2007 widely adopted in industry prediction of the uplift capacity is necessary in order to specify the required depth of cover and the need for any remedial rock dump both of which have implications for project cost however disturbance of the soil during trenching and backfilling operations complicates the estimation of soil resistance as strength profiles established prior to installation of the pipeline may no longer be relevant in clay the backfill can in general be said to consist of intact lumps surrounded by unconsolidated softened clay randolph and gouvernec 2011 the backfill matrix consolidates over time eventually having a minimum undrained shear strength equal to a normally consolidated clay the lumps of intact clay have the effect of increasing the undrained shear strength the trenching method affects the composition of the backfill matrix with jetting resulting in a more homogeneous material due to consolidation of an initial water clay suspension dnv rp f110 2007 while after ploughing the lumps of intact clay tend to be larger with a macro structure that can include cracks and voids physical modelling of the uplift capacity of buried pipelines in clay has been undertaken by schaminee et al 1990 who conducted full scale tests in remoulded material and bransby et al 2002 who considered a fully liquefied clay representing an extreme post jetting scenario more recently attempts have been made to explicitly account for the lumpy nature of clay backfill centrifuge tests have been carried out by cheuk et al 2007 wang et al 2009 and brennan et al 2017 where the backfill consisted of artificially shaped cuboidal or spherical clay lumps these studies show that an understanding of the disturbed condition of clay backfill is vital for prediction of uplift resistance numerical analyses have generally considered an idealised clay with uniform or linearly increasing shear strength e g martin and white 2012 ballard et al 2015 the idealisation of clay as a linear elastic or rigid perfectly plastic material may not allow important physical characteristics to be captured natural clays possess inter particle bonding or structure which can significantly affect soil response under load leroueil and vaughan 1990 but cannot be simulated by simple elasto plastic models furthermore spatial variability is an inherent feature of soil deposits and probabilistic studies using a random field representation have shown that the mechanical behaviour and bearing capacity of offshore foundation types such as skirted foundations charlton and rouainia 2017 and spudcans li et al 2016 in undrained clay can differ from deterministic predictions this paper presents finite element fe analysis of the uplift resistance of a buried pipeline in undrained clay using an advanced critical state constitutive model formulated within a framework of kinematic hardening to capture the degradation of clay structure as the pipeline is lifted upwards the disturbed clay backfill is modelled as a random field representing the spatial variability of clay structure around the pipeline statistics of the uplift capacity are computed by monte carlo simulation and a parametric study is undertaken to identify the effect of the variability of clay structure and the size of zones of disturbed and intact structure on uplift resistance 2 constitutive model the rate independent kinematic hardening structure model khsm developed by rouainia and muir wood 2000 is used to describe the effect of clay structure on pipeline uplift capacity in this study the model is implemented into an fe code plaxis 2012 the khsm extends the conventional modified cam clay mcc model by including an initial amount of structure that is progressively destroyed until a fully remoulded state is reached represented by the reference mcc yield surface the khsm introduces a kinematic hardening bubble and an outer structure surface to describe the state and effect of soil structure the bubble reference and structure surface have the same elliptical shape in the mean effective stress deviatoric stress p q plane the shape of the surfaces in the deviatoric plane is affected by the slope of the critical state line m θ which is a function of the lode s angle θ sheng et al 2000 1 m θ m 2 ψ 4 1 ψ 4 1 ψ 4 sin 3 θ 1 4 where m is the slope of the critical state line for triaxial compression θ 30 o and ψ is defined using the friction angle at critical state φ as follows 2 ψ 3 sin φ 3 sin φ such that the surfaces coincide with the vertices of the mohr coulomb hexagon in the deviatoric plane the essential feature of the khsm is the degradation of structure in the soil as plastic strain accumulates the degree of structure is firstly specified by the parameter r 0 which controls the initial size of the structure surface in relation to the reference surface r 0 1 the degradation of this initial structure is modelled by the following damage law 3 r 1 r 0 1 exp k ε d λ κ where r is the current structure in the soil the damage law is a monotonically decreasing function of a damage strain ε d and the minimum value of r is 1 when structure and reference surfaces coincide the parameter k controls the rate of structure degradation while λ and κ are respectively the slope of the normal compression line and swelling line in a logarithmic specific volume logarithmic mean stress plot damage strain is calculated from the volumetric ε v p and shear ε q p components of plastic strain by a relationship between the strain rates 4 ε d 1 a ε v p 2 a ε q p 2 1 2 where a is a dimensionless parameter that determines how ε v p and ε q p contribute to the damage strain and the degradation of structure in the soil 3 norrköping clay the khsm parameters are calibrated to triaxial test results from norrköping clay an inorganic clay of low sensitivity the calibration procedure was undertaken and reported by rouainia and muir wood 2000 where further details of the model parameters may be found the calibrated parameters are given in table 1 an effective unit weight of γ 8 kn m3 is considered throughout and the initial stress conditions are generated by k 0 consolidation with k 0 1 sin φ where the friction angle is calculated from m the clay is normally consolidated as this is typical of seabed sediments and represents the conditions relevant in the reconsolidated backfill material in a pipeline trench 4 representation of spatial variability 4 1 statistical characterisation of clay structure the spatial variability of clay structure is considered by modelling the khsm parameter r 0 as a random field the choice of probability density function pdf and autocorrelation structure of r 0 is not straightforward as there is limited information available in the literature about the statistics of clay structure for the analysis of the undrained capacity of a buried pipeline the effect of clay structure can be understood by its influence on the undrained shear strength s u in this paper the pipeline is modelled in plane strain and so it is the undrained strength under these boundary conditions that is relevant fig 1 shows the results of simulated undrained plane strain compression tests on k 0 consolidated samples of norrköping clay at 1 m depth the effect of increasing r 0 is to increase the peak value of s u post peak softening occurs as structure is degraded due to the development of plastic strains ultimately the structured clay r 0 1 reduces to the remoulded material simulated by setting r 0 1 when all structure is destroyed it should be noted that a small degree of softening occurs in the remoulded clay due to the evolution of lode s angle which affects the value of m θ during a plane strain compression test the sensitivity of the clay is also greater with increasing levels of initial structure as r 0 does not affect the size of the mcc yield surface and so the remoulded s u remains the same the monotonic relationship between r 0 and s u indicates that basing the statistics of r 0 on those of the undrained shear strength is a reasonable choice by considering the intrinsic mcc parameters of the clay as deterministic the uplift resistance in remoulded clay provides a useful reference against which the pipeline capacity in clay with spatially variable structure can be compared lacasse and nadim 1996 found that a lognormal distribution is appropriate for modelling s u and ching and phoon 2012 also observed that several properties of structured clays including peak and remoulded s u could be satisfactorily represented by a lognormal distribution however the minimum value for r 0 is 1 so a shifted lognormal distribution is considered here r 0 ln n α β 2 δ the cumulative distribution function cdf f of the shifted lognormal distribution is 5 f r 0 α β δ φ ln r 0 δ α β where φ is the gaussian cdf with zero mean and unit variance the first two distribution fitting parameters α and α are respectively the mean and standard deviation of the natural logarithm of r 0 and are computed by 6 β ln 1 σ r 0 2 μ r 0 δ 2 1 2 7 α ln μ r 0 δ 0 5 β 2 where μ r 0 is the mean of r 0 and σ r 0 is the standard deviation of r 0 in the shifted lognormal distribution a third parameter d is introduced in order to move the lower bound of the distribution δ is taken to be 1 so that r 0 cannot take values inadmissible in the khsm the calibrated value of r 0 is considered to be the mean value μ r 0 1 75 this reflects the fact that the spatial variability of structure is inherent to the intact clay as well as the backfilled material keaveny et al 1989 found that the autocorrelation ρ of s u can be represented by either an exponential or square exponential function in this study a square exponential function is chosen 8 ρ r 0 x y x y exp x x θ x 2 y y θ y 2 where θ x and θ y are the autocorrelation distances in horizontal x and vertical y directions respectively and x y and x y are two arbitrary spatial positions the autocorrelation distance will be used to assess the effect of the size and interaction of areas of high structure i e less disturbed or intact clay and low structure which represents zones of disturbed clay that has been remoulded to some extent 4 2 random field generation the shifted lognormal random field of r 0 can be generated as follows 9 r 0 x y δ exp α β g x y where g x y is a correlated gaussian random field of zero mean and unit variance and is discretised on a rectangular grid using the expansion optimal linear estimation eole method li and der kiureghian 1993 the rectangular grid is referred to as the stochastic mesh to indicate its independence from the deterministic finite element model details of which are given in the following section if the nodal coordinates of the stochastic mesh are stored in a vector χ the target autocorrelation matrix of r 0 x y is denoted σ χ χ r 0 and can be constructed using eq 8 the size of σ χ χ r 0 is p q p q if there are p grid points in the x direction and q in the y direction eq 9 is a nataf type transformation liu and der kiureghian 1986 where the i j th element of r 0 x y is computed by r 0 i j f 1 φ ξ i j with ξ i j a standard gaussian random variable the mapping from a gaussian to non gaussian marginal distribution can distort the autocorrelation structure particularly if the target marginal distribution is strongly non gaussian fig 2 a plots the shifted lognormal distribution of the case cov r 0 0 5 with r 0 ln n 1 75 0 766 1 and the normal distribution of equivalent mean and variance as evident in fig 2 b the correlation is significantly distorted the distortion of a non shifted lognormal distribution r 0 ln n 1 75 0 766 is plotted for comparison the shift can be seen to greatly affect the autocorrelation structure in the nataf model the terms ρ g i j of the autocorrelation matrix of the underlying gaussian field σ χ χ g can be computed by solving the following equation 10 ρ r 0 i j r 0 i μ r 0 i σ r 0 i r 0 j μ r 0 j σ r 0 j ϕ ξ i ξ j ρ g i j d ξ i d ξ j where ϕ is the bivariate standard gaussian pdf in the general case eq 10 must be solved numerically for ρ g i j but for the shifted lognormal distribution an analytical solution exists taking advantage of the statistical homogeneity of the random field the autocorrelation in the gaussian space is 11 ρ g i j 1 β 2 ln 1 ρ r 0 i j e β 2 1 a difficulty of the translation approach is that the autocorrelation matrix of the underlying gaussian random field may not be positive semi definite psd ferrante et al 2005 the existence of negative eigenvalues can introduce serious errors into the correlation and statistical properties of the non gaussian random field kim and shileds 2015 this may occur if the target random field is strongly non gaussian and it was observed that the shifted lognormal distribution used for r 0 in this study resulted in σ χ χ g to be non psd in all analysis cases considered to overcome this issue the nearest correlation matrix to σ χ χ g was found using the quadratically convergent newton method proposed by qi and sun 2006 kim and shileds 2015 developed a strategy based on iteratively updating the autocorrelation matrix and computing the nearest correlation matrix at each step the large size of the autocorrelation matrix used in this study 8500 8500 requires a significant computing time to obtain a psd correlation matrix and so a direct method was applied the elements of σ χ χ g are computed first by eq 11 and then the nearest correlation matrix to this is obtained by the method of qi and sun 2006 an example is presented in fig 3 where the horizontal autocorrelation is shown across a section of a random field of r 0 with grid size δ x 0 025 m the non gaussian distribution is again the shifted lognormal of the case cov r 0 0 5 and the target autocorrelation function is square exponential with θ x 1 m the figure shows that the target correlation is well matched with a relative error of 0 19 once the psd autocorrelation matrix σ χ χ g is constructed the discretised standard gaussian random field can be written 12 g ˆ x y μ g σ g i 1 m p q ξ i λ i ϕ i t σ g x y χ g where μ g 0 and σ g 1 λ i and ϕ i are respectively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of σ χ χ g and σ g x y χ g is the correlation between the point x y and χ the expansion is truncated to include m random variables chosen here such that 90 of the variance is captured 5 finite element model the layout of the problem is shown in fig 4 a pipeline of diameter d is embedded at a depth h in a seabed with a horizontal surface the total uplift resistance q u is a combination of pipeline self weight q u p and the resistance of the backfilled soil in the trench r as follows 13 q u q u p r q u p q u s q u γ where r is divided into components of unit weight q u γ and shear strength q u s superposition of resistance components from shear strength and unit weight has been shown to be applicable in the uplift capacity of pipelines ballard et al 2015 in this paper we are concerned with the contribution of soil shear strength and so the self weight of the pipeline is considered equal to the weight of the displaced soil meaning that no net force acts on the pipeline due to its weight or an upwards buoyancy force i e q u q u s a plane strain fe model plaxis 2012 is used to compute the uplift capacity of a pipeline of diameter d 0 2 5 m buried at a depth h 0 875 m the dimensionless embedment ratio h d 3 5 this is chosen as being representative of a typical pipeline diameter and embedment ratio e g bransby et al 2002 cheuk et al 2007 the fe mesh is shown in fig 5 and consists of 539 15 noded triangular elements with the mesh refined in the region around the pipeline for numerical expediency only the bonded interface condition is considered meaning the pipe and soil are attached with an infinite tensile capacity the stochastic mesh consists of bilinear quadrilateral elements it is separate from the fe mesh and values of r 0 are generated at the nodes according to the procedure detailed in section 4 2 the stochastic mesh is extended 0 5 m beyond the fe mesh in all directions as the random field discretisation error increases substantially at the boundaries of the domain sudret and der kiureghian 2000 to transfer information from the stochastic to the fe mesh an interpolation procedure is used each gauss point in the fe mesh is located as belonging to an element of the stochastic mesh and then shape functions are used to map the value of the random field at the nodes of the stochastic element to the gauss point the size of the elements in the stochastic mesh is related to the autocorrelation distance denoted θ c here for brevity sudret and der kiureghian 2000 showed that for a square exponential autocorrelation function the size of element in the stochastic mesh should be less than θ c 2 this criterion is adopted as a maximum value so that the interpolation to the fe gauss point maintains the autocorrelation structure 6 results and discussion 6 1 deterministic analysis fig 6 a shows the load displacement curves for a homogeneous r 0 total displacement d is normalised by the pipeline diameter for structured clay r 0 1 75 a peak resistance is reached before softening occurs as plastic strains develop and structure is degraded in contrast in remoulded clay r 0 1 the load continues to increase until an ultimate value is reached this ultimate load is equal to that of the structured clay at large displacements due to complete remoulding of the clay along the failure planes the peak occurs at a total displacement of 0 25d and 0 35d for structured and remoulded clay respectively this is rather greater than the 0 01 0 03d reported by dnv rp f110 2007 for remoulded homogeneous material but the document also reports that values up to 0 15d have been observed and both cheuk et al 2007 and brennan et al 2017 recorded displacements in the region of 0 4 d in lumpy clays the failure mechanisms are shown in fig 6 b and in both cases a deep flow around failure occurs in dnv rp f110 the uplift resistance in the flow around or local mechanism is given as 14 r n c η s u d where n c is a capacity factor and η is an empirical strength reduction term the value of n c is computed by 15 n c 2 π 1 1 3 tan 1 h d 2 d 1 r g which gives a value of 11 84 with the current embedment and a rough surface r g 1 an exact solution has been derived for the flow around mechanism with n c q u d s u 11 94 randolph and houlsby 1984 table 2 presents the capacity factors for both structured and remoulded clay the reference undrained shear strength s u r e f is taken at the centre of the pipe i e at 1 m depth and calculated by simulating a plane strain compression test using the in situ stress conditions see fig 2 a good match is observed in the remoulded clay with the value of n c within 2 of the plasticity solution in structured clay the capacity factor is predicted to be 25 less than the exact value and the dnv expression however neither solution takes into account the degradation of structure which reduces the capacity factor due to a progressive failure as plastic strains develop fig 7 shows the degradation of structure around the pipeline at failure d 0 6 d the loss of structure is concentrated in the area around the pipeline planes of structure degradation also extend towards the surface these form before the mechanism becomes fully localised at peak resistance and suggest that at this embedment the location of the seabed may still influence uplift behaviour the strength reduction factor η is intended to account for strain softening effects alongside other factors such as strain rate and viscosity dnv rp f110 2007 however there has been much discussion in the literature on the meaning of η martin and white 2012 and ballard et al 2015 state that it may result from mistaking soil buoyancy for a strength effect while brennan et al 2017 discuss the parameter in terms of the strength reduction due to the disturbance of clay backfill during trenching taking r q u and n c from eq 12 η in structured norrköping clay is calculated as 0 745 after rearranging eq 11 this sits in the suggested range for the parameter 0 55 0 85 and slightly above the best estimate value of 0 65 6 2 effect of coefficient of variation of clay structure a parametric study was undertaken with cov r 0 0 1 0 3 0 5 to cover the typical range of variability of s u phoon and kulhawy 1999 for these analyses θ x and θ y are fixed at 6 d 1 5 m and 1 d 0 25 m respectively the horizontal autocorrelation distance is chosen to be similar to the width of a typical steep sided pipeline trench dnv rp f110 2007 while the shorter vertical distance follows from the deposition of the clay load displacement plots from 500 simulations for each value of cov r 0 are presented in fig 8 fig 8 a shows that when cov r 0 is low the load displacement responses are very similar to the deterministic analysis with a homogeneous structure r 0 μ r 0 1 75 in each case a peak load is reached before softening occurs and the load reduces to the remoulded value it can be inferred that a flow around mechanism governs the response however as evident in fig 8 b and c as cov r 0 increases there is a much wider range of load displacement responses after the end of the elastic range importantly the spatial distribution of clay structure can be seen to influence the type of failure fig 9 a shows a random field of clay structure from a simulation with cov r 0 0 5 the corresponding load displacement response of the pipeline is indicated in fig 8 c a zone of relatively weaker soil overlies a stronger area at the level of the pipeline and the degradation of structure shown in fig 9 b has a different form compared to the homogeneous case the highly structured clay around the pipeline increases the lateral restraint and prevents a flow around failure instead a reverse bearing capacity mechanism occurs as illustrated in fig 9 c this involves a block of soil being lifted upwards with the pipe and is described as a global mechanism in dnv rp f110 although suction beneath the pipeline is ignored in the design code rather than post peak softening behaviour the load displacement curve shows an increase to a constant ultimate load that in this realisation is higher than the peak force observed with r 0 1 75 the pdfs of q u are presented in fig 10 for each value of cov r 0 the figure shows that the shape of the pdf becomes more irregular with increasing variability of r 0 as a result of the different failure modes that can occur the uplift resistance also has an approximate lower bound of the remoulded capacity in the current modelling framework 7 42 kpa see table 2 for cov r 0 0 1 and 0 3 the probability of the lower bound occurring is negligible but for cov r 0 0 5 there is a non zero probability that the pipeline will fail in effectively fully remoulded clay the effect of cov r 0 on the mean uplift resistance μ q u is shown in fig 11 a confidence intervals are computed by 10 000 bootstrap samples when the variability of r 0 is low μ q u is close to the deterministic analysis with a homogeneous r 0 further investigation is required to determine whether the higher μ q u at cov r 0 0 1 relative to the homogeneous capacity is a result of a physical mechanism or model non linearity or can be attributed to statistical error the effect of increasing cov r 0 is to reduce μ q u the extreme peak loads and corresponding longer tailed distribution contribute to the increase in the cov of resistance with cov r 0 as shown in fig 11 b 6 3 effect of autocorrelation distance a further parametric study was carried out to identify the effect of the autocorrelation distance which controls the size of areas of high and low structure on pipeline uplift capacity although autocorrelation of soil parameters is generally anisotropic with the correlation length in the horizontal plane often an order of magnitude greater than in the vertical direction the correlation structure is likely to be disturbed during pipeline installation both isotropic and anisotropic autocorrelations are therefore investigated the default value of c o v r 0 is 0 3 and 500 simulations were run to characterise the response for all cases 6 3 1 isotropic autocorrelation in the isotropic case the spatial distribution of clay structure is representative of a backfill where small lumps of clay are randomly arranged fig 12 shows two realisations for isotropic autocorrelation distances of 0 25 d and 0 75 d the range considered in this study is θ x θ y 0 25 d 0 5 d 0 75 d 1 d 2 d which is comparable to the lump sizes considered by cheuk et al 2007 and brennan et al 2017 fig 13 presents the load displacement curves for isotropic autocorrelations of 0 25 d 0 75 d and 2 d with increasing θ x θ y a greater spread in the response is observed as plastic shear strains develop after 0 05 d the isotropic autocorrelation creates regular zones of low and high structure rather than the layered pattern that occurs when θ x θ y in the range considered here failure is therefore governed by the flow around mechanism as the localisation of the shear planes is not prevented by extensive zones of highly structured clay at the sides of the pipeline with weaker material above the effect of the autocorrelation distance on the failure characteristics of the pipeline can be further assessed by considering the displacement at which the peak resistance occurs denoted d p e a k in fig 14 a the mean of d p e a k μ d p e a k is shown as the isotropic autocorrelation distance is increased from 0 25 d to 2 d a clear trend is evident with the mean displacement at peak load decreasing rapidly with increasing θ x θ y until a steady value is reached at 1 d this trend is evidence that the development of the failure mechanism is influenced by frequently occurring zones of stronger and weaker material the full localisation of the mechanism around the pipeline associated with the peak resistance and subsequent softening is delayed by weak paths extending to the surface and d p e a k moves towards that observed in fully remoulded clay the variability of d p e a k shown in fig 14 b is greatest for intermediate autocorrelation distances 0 5 0 75 d suggesting that a mixture of the dominant behaviours at shorter 0 25 d and longer 1 d autocorrelations occur fig 15 presents the statistics of the uplift capacity it is interesting to note that μ q u is at a minimum for intermediate autocorrelation distances 0 5 0 75 d but increases at 0 25 d such a finding has been observed in previous spatial variability analyses of s u such as the undrained capacity of strip footings griffiths and fenton 2001 and attributed to the shear planes eventually cutting through zones of high strength soil as the weak paths become increasingly circuitous and inefficient as θ x θ y 0 at the other extreme θ x θ y the clay tends towards a homogeneous structure and μ q u converges on the deterministic uplift capacity fig 15 b shows that c o v q u also tends to increase with θ x θ y but the relationship is complicated by the combination of behaviours at intermediate autocorrelation distances 6 3 2 isotropic autocorrelation to assess the influence of autocorrelation distance in the horizontal and vertical directions separately θ x and θ y were also altered in turn the parameter ranges investigated are θ x 1 d 3 d 6 d 10 d and θ y 0 5 d 1 d 2 d 4 d the default autocorrelation distances are θ x 6 d and θ y d important effects were observed on the mechanical behaviour and these are summarised by the statistics of d p e a k presented in fig 16 with a longer autocorrelation distance in the x direction the reverse bearing capacity mechanism became increasingly common due to the more frequent occurrence of zones of highly structured clay at both sides of the pipeline this is evident in the increase in μ d p e a k with θ x shown in fig 16 a on the other hand fig 16 b shows that when θ y increases μ d p e a k quickly reduces when θ y 2 d the load displacement curves show that the flow around failure becomes the sole mechanism the clay tends towards a homogeneous structure in the vicinity of the pipeline as θ y this conclusion is strengthened by the fact that as shown in fig 16 d the cov of d p e a k decreases with longer θ y implying that the response is increasingly governed by one type of failure mechanism in contrast fig 16 c shows that a longer θ x results in higher c o v d p e a k suggesting a range of possible failure modes involving flow around of the clay or lifting of a block of soil with the pipe 7 conclusions a study of pipeline uplift resistance in an undrained clay with spatially variable structure has been conducted the effect of clay structure on mechanical behaviour was described using the khsm an advanced critical state constitutive model the model was implemented in a finite element code and coupled with a random field representation of the parameter r 0 which describes the initial degree of structure in a deterministic analysis with a homogeneous clay structure a flow around failure mechanism formed and the load displacement curve in structured clay showed a peak resistance before softening while the uplift resistance in remoulded clay could be validated against published solutions the effect of structure degradation was to reduce the capacity factor in norrköping clay it was found that the strength reduction term η as included in current design guidelines was 0 745 which fits within the recommended limits the failure mechanism was unaffected if the spatial variability of r 0 was low but for higher variability a different mechanism could form involving the lifting of a block of soil with the pipe this emphasises the importance of checking both types of failure in design as the mechanism is not solely dependent on embedment depth or soil properties but is also influenced by the spatial distribution of intact and remoulded clay the size of zones of intact clay high structure and remoulded clay low structure was investigated by changing the autocorrelation distance it was found that with a short isotropic autocorrelation distance where lumps of high and low structure are rather small the full development of the flow around failure mechanism was delayed leading to a greater displacement at peak resistance the mean uplift capacity also increased as the shear planes sought efficient paths through zones of high structure varying the horizontal and vertical autocorrelation distances in turn longer horizontal autocorrelation led to more frequent occurrence of the global failure due to zones of high strength clay preventing lateral propagation of the shear planes around the pipeline a longer vertical autocorrelation favoured formation of the flow around mechanism this study is the first attempt to model many important aspects of the uplift resistance of buried pipelines in a comprehensive numerical framework the probabilistic approach reflects the uncertainty associated with the condition of the backfilled clay and allows a much wider range of potential behaviours to be captured the study demonstrates that the spatial variability of clay structure has a significant effect on uplift resistance it is important to note that the results only apply to the specific clay considered further validation of the ability of the presented approach to simulate pipeline behaviour in clay backfill could be undertaken by a programme of full scale or centrifuge testing acknowledgments the first author would like to thank the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and atkins for funding this research 
22697,solid bulk cargo liquefaction has been prominent on the agenda for shipping in recent years which resulted in a cargo shift and loss of stability causing the loss of many lives when the cargo is subject to cyclic forces such as the rolling movement of the ship the cargo shift will contribute an extra moment on the ship hold and may result in ship capsizes in the paper a scaled model of a handy size vessel is used to identify the key parameters that trigger cargo instability and calibrate the model parameter a liquefaction model is presented to model the simple shear cyclic shear character and the liquefaction during sloshing of the cargo this numerical approach can provide a means to predict the ship stability and evaluate the potential safety hazards during marine transport of solid bulk cargo keywords solid bulk cargo cargo instability liquefaction ship capsizes 1 introduction awareness was recently raised due to a large amount of ship capsizes by the liquefaction of solid bulk cargo e g iron ore nickel ore during the transportation gard 2014 in the few years more than ten ships capsized and sank due to a loss of stability attributed to the cargo liquefaction especially stellar daisy from south korea and emerald star from hong kong capsized in 2017 ju et al 2018 the cargo can hold some moisture in the interstellar spaces due to the internal moisture in the process of mining rainfall or the moisture migration during the voyage generally the solid bulk cargo is usually loaded into the vessels under the unsaturated condition wang et al 2016 which contains moisture air and solid skeletons before loading the cargoes may look dry however the ship motion will compact the cargoes and rearrange resulting in the increase of degree of saturation and gradually the loss of water holding ability and the coming up of seepage higher degree of saturation will lubricate the particles and decrease the friction between particles meantime the seepage of water in the interstellar spaces will increase the flowability of cargoes causing major displacement of cargo termed cargo liquefaction see fig 1 the whole process of ship loss due to cargo liquefaction is displayed in fig 2 to reveal the mechanism of the granular material liquefaction experimental works have been conducted the influence of water content on the liquefaction of sand was investigated and indicated that decreasing the moisture content will increase the liquefaction resistance arab et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 the liquefaction duration related to the intensity of excitation on a rectangular container was also studied containing different moisture contents of the cargo koromila et al 2013 specifically at small dynamic stress with sufficient periods of vibration the cargo still can liquefy and reach failure unno et al 2006 effective stress model is commonly used in the liquefaction prediction which describes the stress strain behavior for saturated soils in soil dynamics terzaghi 1936 biot 1941 nurand and byerlee 1971 the effective stress model also can extend the application to the unsaturated granular materials bishop 1959 such as ubcsand model puebla et al 1997 beaty and byrne 1998 ju et al 2016 however this lacks the study of discrete characteristics of cargo shift for solving the interaction between ship motion and cargo shift the dem discrete element method modeling approach is more applicable to this specific problem zhou et al 2009 dabeet et al 2012 xue et al 2014 to study ship response in waves due to cargo shift a molecular dynamics method was developed to predict cargo shift and ship response in a holistic way spandonidis and spyrou 2013 2016 ju et al 2017 the cargo shift and interaction with the ship hold need to be solved in a holistic way which cannot be separated with this in mind the dem model combined with the liquefaction model was developed to focus on both the discrete character and liquefaction character simultaneously this approach will provide a better understanding of the cargo liquefaction mechanism which could possibly support a suitable regulatory framework for assessing the ship stability due to cargo shift so that decision making during the design loading and transport could be effective to avoid the ship capsize and casualties 2 numerical models in this part a 3d dem liquefaction model was developed the numerical model includes two parts cargo movement and cargo liquefaction 2 1 cargo movement rolling resistance linear model was used to study cargo stability pfc help manual 2016 it is an ideal tool to simulate the motion of the granular particles which incorporates a rolling torque to resist the rolling motion which can be seen frequently in the granular particles the contact force f c includes a linear force f l and a dashpot force f d both forces are resolved into normal and shear forces f c f l f d f l f n l f s l f d f n d f s d m r μ r r f n l where f c the contact force f l the linear force f d the dashpot force m r the rolling resistance moment r the contact effective radius μ r the rolling resistance coefficient 2 2 cargo liquefaction before using the dem liquefaction model three assumptions were assigned ju et al 2018 1 each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles including solid particles water and air the porosity of the particles is also a hypothetical porosity when the unsaturated state becomes saturated the volume of air expels and becomes nil the water will attach the specific solid particles permanently 2 the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain to change the size at the end of every time step according to the stress on the particles based on the ubcsand model 3 various friction coefficients can be used to represent various moisture contents in the assumptions each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles therefore the dynamic stress of the assemblies including the contact forces and the inertia effects was shown as follows fortin et al 2003 and françois nicot et al 2013 σ i j 1 v c 1 n c f i c l j c 1 3 v p v ε i j k m k p 1 3 v p v j p ω p 2 δ i j ω i p ω j p where v the

for particle p j p the moment of inertia for particle p ω p the angular velocity for particle p the elastic plastic model is used in the paper based on ubcsand model petalas and galavi 2013 the relationship between strain stress is shown as follows the elastic behavior will occur in the yield surface which is controlled by elastic bulk modulus k b e and elastic shear modulus k g e as shown below k b e k b e p a p p a m e k g e k g e p a p p a n e where p the mean effective stress p a the reference stress usually equal to 100 kpa k b e the bulk modulus numbers k g e the shear modulus

the peak friction angle of the soil ϕ mob the mobilized friction angle during hardening swcc is a critical curve to describe the hydraulic characteristic of unsaturated soils in the paper swcc is used to calculate the initial pore water pressure in unsaturated soils van genuchten function is used in the paper α n and m are empirical parameters cuomo et al 2016 θ s θ r 1 α s 1 α s n m s p a p w where θ r the residual water content θ s the saturated water content s the suction p a pore air pressure p a 0 connect to the atmosphere p w pore water pressure based on the assumptions above the calculation procedure is 4 dem is used to simulate the motions and collision between particles 5 according to the publication by fortin et al 2003 and françois nicot et al 2013 the dynamic stress tensors is calculated with the ubcsand liquefaction model the elastic plastic strain is obtained 6 at every end of the time step we scale the radius of the particle according to the strain the elastic strain can be recovered during unloading the plastic strain cannot be recovered which will discharge the air volume internal water will attach the solid particles permanently accordingly the updated saturation of degree is calculated 7 the increments of pore water pressure can be computed in the following equation d p w k w n d ε v where k w is the bulk modulus of water n is the porosity dε v is volumetric strain of the fluid therefore the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model capturing the cargo shift and cargo liquefaction the movement of the particle will be updated by the contact model the liquefaction behavior will be simulated by ubcsand liquefaction model therefore the cargo shift and liquefaction will be solved simultaneously the model input parameters include three parts deformation parameters hydraulic parameters and contact model parameters as shown in table 1 deformation parameters derive from ubcsand liquefaction model and contact model parameters can be obtained from the calibration results from experiments hydraulic parameters are the initial condition which describes the relation between moisture content and suction which can be obtained by experiment 3 cargo instability 3 1 static incline the static incline laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the behavior of nickel ore classnk 2011 the container was statically up to the maximum angle of 50 fig 3 solid bulk cargoes such as nickel ore normally contain some moisture within the particles the cargo flowability will increase with high moisture content at present the dem model cannot simulate the existence of the water inside how to consider the moisture in the particles is critical in the paper we use the friction coefficient to present the influence of moisture with the quantitative comparison of numerical results with experimental data by changing the friction coefficient the behavior of the cargo inside the container is compared with the experimental data to identify the relationship between the friction coefficient and mc as shown in table 2 it can be seen in fig 4 that the movement of the particles shows some errors in high moisture content with the experimental data as the experiment conducted by classnk has really water between particles fitting equations can be obtained to describe the relationship between the friction coefficient and mc fric

rolling friction coefficient 3 2 angle of repose based on the relationship between friction coefficient and the moisture content the angle of repose was simulated by the dem model as shown in fig 5 it is evident that a higher angle of repose is obtained when decreasing the moisture content this can be explained that under the force of gravity the power chain between particles will formulate by compression to transmit gravity oriented in the direction of stress direction the slight deformation at the contact point between two particles can resist the shear force which direction could have a certain angle with respect to axis when the friction coefficient is small the shear stress increases and the power chain ruptures the particle at the end of power chain on the surface of pile firstly happens to slide meantime new power chain constantly forms until the shear force becomes less than the critical value this can be seen in fig 6 that when the moisture exceeds a critical value the angle of repose or the shear strength decreases greatly in this simulation when the mc exceeds 36 the angle of repose decreases drastically 3 3 shaking table test a mid container of a solid bulk ship of 57500t by a scale ratio of 1 45 is selected in a prescribed rolling oscillation along the x axis as shown in fig 7 the length width and height of the container is 0 656 m 0 717 m and 0 414 m respectively the contact parameter of particles is shown in table 3 in the experiment the water content of the cargoes is 35 and the loading capacity is 48 of the total volume of the container guan et al 2014 the rotational axis is 0 12 m at the z direction during the simulation the radius and the density of particles are 0 02 m and 2500 kg m 3 which yield a total number of 1853 mono sized spheres the ratio of the length of box to particle radius and the time step size is 32 8 and 0 0005s respectively the same rolling period of 2 2s and rolling amplitude of 5 10 15 and 20 are applied respectively the moment on the container at different rolling angle is shown in fig 8 comparison with the experimental data though the amplitude of the moment almost coincides with the experimental data however great errors arise as the existence of the water between the particle is neglected 4 cargo liquefaction 4 1 simple shear test the simple shear test gives the shear stress strain curve for the sample which demonstrates the shear strength of the cargo the shearing strain γ can be measured in the simple shear test as γ δ x h 0 where δ x the distance in horizontal movement between the top and the bottom of the sample h 0 the initial height of the sample the shear stress τ is measured as the shear force divided by the cross sectional area of the sample in the paper a specimen filled with balls is considered as the granular particles consolidation of the specimen is performed to achieve a desired vertical effective stress σ v for example the value of 100 kpa cuomo et al 2016 conducted simple shear tests on the unsaturated soil and saturated soil with the soil specific gravity of 2 55 table 4 and the samples in pfc3d are prepared fig 9 the model parameters used in the simulation are given in table 5 fig 10 shows the relationship between matric suction and water content it is indicated in fig 11 the liquefaction model can simulate the simple shear behavior comparison with experimental data 4 2 cyclic shear test fig 12 presents the typical stress path and stress strain response for a simulation with cyclic stress ratio csr shear stress vertical effective stress of 0 08 and vertical effective stress of 100 kpa the model parameters used in cyclic shear test are given in table 5a gradual drop of vertical effective stress is observed from an initial value of 100 kpa with the application of cyclic shear until it reaches σ v c a value of about 30 kpa followed by a sudden overall drop of σ v c during the last several cycles at the last several cycles the deformation of cargoes is obvious due to the decrease of bulk modulus and shear modulus the liquefaction model can show the drop of effective stress at some extent however compared to the experimental results this model needs further improvement 4 3 liquefaction during sloshing cargo shift due to liquefaction will contribute an extra moment on the ship motion therefore the dem liquefaction model is used to simulate the whole process of liquefaction in a 3d container in this part the model in section 3 3 is adopted and the model parameter is the same as the simple shear test on unsaturated soil from fig 13 at the beginning the cargo before liquefaction has low flowability and rolls along with the container after liquefaction the radius of the cargo scaled due to compaction and the cargo has large space to flow and behaves like a fluid we define the 100 degree of saturation of every hypothetical assembler of particles as the liquefaction criteria from fig 14 shown below the liquefied percentage reaches almost 90 at 25s the moment on the container as shown in fig 15 decreased accordingly which means the pressure distribution on the container resists the moment this model used in the paper can fully describe the liquefaction phenomenon from the initial state to liquefied state 5 concluding remarks a 3d dem liquefaction model combined with the ubcsabnd model was developed and can effectively capture the cyclic shear behavior liquefaction phenomena and discrete characteristics of granular materials some remarks can be concluded as follows 1 as the granular material was considered here as dry the friction coefficients in the dem model was used to describe the moisture in the interstellar spaces with this assumption dem can effectively simulate the flow characteristic of the moist bulk cargo to a certain extent 2 static incline angle of repose and shaking table simulation was conducted compared with the experimental data the dem can simulate the flowability of cargoes at different moisture content 3 dem liquefaction model can model the drop of effective stress at some extent as there is no water in the interstellar spaces it shows some errors in the simulation results comparison with the experimental data however we can combine the moment due to cargo shift with the sig degree freedom equation to assess the ship stability the assumptions are the novel features of this new approach but they need to be further validated by more laboratory experiments based on the work in the paper it will provide a better understanding of the cargo stability and liquefaction phenomenon of solid bulk cargo especially for the interaction between cargo shift and ship motion acknowledgements this work is supported financially by the national key r d program

22697,solid bulk cargo liquefaction has been prominent on the agenda for shipping in recent years which resulted in a cargo shift and loss of stability causing the loss of many lives when the cargo is subject to cyclic forces such as the rolling movement of the ship the cargo shift will contribute an extra moment on the ship hold and may result in ship capsizes in the paper a scaled model of a handy size vessel is used to identify the key parameters that trigger cargo instability and calibrate the model parameter a liquefaction model is presented to model the simple shear cyclic shear character and the liquefaction during sloshing of the cargo this numerical approach can provide a means to predict the ship stability and evaluate the potential safety hazards during marine transport of solid bulk cargo keywords solid bulk cargo cargo instability liquefaction ship capsizes 1 introduction awareness was recently raised due to a large amount of ship capsizes by the liquefaction of solid bulk cargo e g iron ore nickel ore during the transportation gard 2014 in the few years more than ten ships capsized and sank due to a loss of stability attributed to the cargo liquefaction especially stellar daisy from south korea and emerald star from hong kong capsized in 2017 ju et al 2018 the cargo can hold some moisture in the interstellar spaces due to the internal moisture in the process of mining rainfall or the moisture migration during the voyage generally the solid bulk cargo is usually loaded into the vessels under the unsaturated condition wang et al 2016 which contains moisture air and solid skeletons before loading the cargoes may look dry however the ship motion will compact the cargoes and rearrange resulting in the increase of degree of saturation and gradually the loss of water holding ability and the coming up of seepage higher degree of saturation will lubricate the particles and decrease the friction between particles meantime the seepage of water in the interstellar spaces will increase the flowability of cargoes causing major displacement of cargo termed cargo liquefaction see fig 1 the whole process of ship loss due to cargo liquefaction is displayed in fig 2 to reveal the mechanism of the granular material liquefaction experimental works have been conducted the influence of water content on the liquefaction of sand was investigated and indicated that decreasing the moisture content will increase the liquefaction resistance arab et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 the liquefaction duration related to the intensity of excitation on a rectangular container was also studied containing different moisture contents of the cargo koromila et al 2013 specifically at small dynamic stress with sufficient periods of vibration the cargo still can liquefy and reach failure unno et al 2006 effective stress model is commonly used in the liquefaction prediction which describes the stress strain behavior for saturated soils in soil dynamics terzaghi 1936 biot 1941 nurand and byerlee 1971 the effective stress model also can extend the application to the unsaturated granular materials bishop 1959 such as ubcsand model puebla et al 1997 beaty and byrne 1998 ju et al 2016 however this lacks the study of discrete characteristics of cargo shift for solving the interaction between ship motion and cargo shift the dem discrete element method modeling approach is more applicable to this specific problem zhou et al 2009 dabeet et al 2012 xue et al 2014 to study ship response in waves due to cargo shift a molecular dynamics method was developed to predict cargo shift and ship response in a holistic way spandonidis and spyrou 2013 2016 ju et al 2017 the cargo shift and interaction with the ship hold need to be solved in a holistic way which cannot be separated with this in mind the dem model combined with the liquefaction model was developed to focus on both the discrete character and liquefaction character simultaneously this approach will provide a better understanding of the cargo liquefaction mechanism which could possibly support a suitable regulatory framework for assessing the ship stability due to cargo shift so that decision making during the design loading and transport could be effective to avoid the ship capsize and casualties 2 numerical models in this part a 3d dem liquefaction model was developed the numerical model includes two parts cargo movement and cargo liquefaction 2 1 cargo movement rolling resistance linear model was used to study cargo stability pfc help manual 2016 it is an ideal tool to simulate the motion of the granular particles which incorporates a rolling torque to resist the rolling motion which can be seen frequently in the granular particles the contact force f c includes a linear force f l and a dashpot force f d both forces are resolved into normal and shear forces f c f l f d f l f n l f s l f d f n d f s d m r μ r r f n l where f c the contact force f l the linear force f d the dashpot force m r the rolling resistance moment r the contact effective radius μ r the rolling resistance coefficient 2 2 cargo liquefaction before using the dem liquefaction model three assumptions were assigned ju et al 2018 1 each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles including solid particles water and air the porosity of the particles is also a hypothetical porosity when the unsaturated state becomes saturated the volume of air expels and becomes nil the water will attach the specific solid particles permanently 2 the radius of the particle can be scaled with the elastic plastic strain to change the size at the end of every time step according to the stress on the particles based on the ubcsand model 3 various friction coefficients can be used to represent various moisture contents in the assumptions each sphere is regarded as a hypothetical assembler of particles therefore the dynamic stress of the assemblies including the contact forces and the inertia effects was shown as follows fortin et al 2003 and françois nicot et al 2013 σ i j 1 v c 1 n c f i c l j c 1 3 v p v ε i j k m k p 1 3 v p v j p ω p 2 δ i j ω i p ω j p where v the representative elementary volume rev f i c the contact reaction force l j c the branch vector joining the centre of the particles in contact ε i j k the levi civita symbol m k p the moment imbalance for particle p j p the moment of inertia for particle p ω p the angular velocity for particle p the elastic plastic model is used in the paper based on ubcsand model petalas and galavi 2013 the relationship between strain stress is shown as follows the elastic behavior will occur in the yield surface which is controlled by elastic bulk modulus k b e and elastic shear modulus k g e as shown below k b e k b e p a p p a m e k g e k g e p a p p a n e where p the mean effective stress p a the reference stress usually equal to 100 kpa k b e the bulk modulus numbers k g e the shear modulus numbers m e the elastic exponent define the rate dependency of stiffness n e the shear exponent define the rate dependency of stiffness the plastic behavior which occurs outside the yield surface is controlled by the hardening rule given as d s i n ϕ m o b 1 5 k g p p p a n p p a p m 1 s i n ϕ m o b s i n ϕ p e a k r f 2 d λ p m σ m a x σ m i n 2 where p the mean effective stress p m the mean

modulus exponent ϕ m o b mobilized friction angle which is defined by the stress ratio ϕ p e a k the peak friction angle r f the failure ratio n f n u l t ranging from 0 5 to 1 0 the critical yield surface is as follows f m σ m a x σ m i n 2 σ m a x σ m i n 2 c c o t ϕ p s i n ϕ m o b where σ max the maximum principal stresses σ min the minimum principal stresses c the cohesion of the soil ϕ p the peak friction angle of the soil ϕ mob the mobilized friction angle during hardening swcc is a critical curve to describe the hydraulic characteristic of unsaturated soils in the paper swcc is used to calculate the initial pore water pressure in unsaturated soils van genuchten function is used in the paper α n and m are empirical parameters cuomo et al 2016 θ s θ r 1 α s 1 α s n m s p a p w where θ r the residual water content θ s the saturated water content s the suction p a pore air pressure p a 0 connect to the atmosphere p w pore water pressure based on the assumptions above the calculation procedure is 4 dem is used to simulate the motions and collision between particles 5 according to the publication by fortin et al 2003 and françois nicot et al 2013 the dynamic stress tensors is calculated with the ubcsand liquefaction model the elastic plastic strain is obtained 6 at every end of the time step we scale the radius of the particle according to the strain the elastic strain can be recovered during unloading the plastic strain cannot be recovered which will discharge the air volume internal water will attach the solid particles permanently accordingly the updated saturation of degree is calculated 7 the increments of pore water pressure can be computed in the following equation d p w k w n d ε v where k w is the bulk modulus of water n is the porosity dε v is volumetric strain of the fluid therefore the whole liquefaction process can be addressed by this model capturing the cargo shift and cargo liquefaction the movement of the particle will be updated by the contact model the liquefaction behavior will be simulated by ubcsand liquefaction model therefore the cargo shift and liquefaction will be solved simultaneously the model input parameters include three parts deformation parameters hydraulic parameters and contact model parameters as shown in table 1 deformation parameters derive from ubcsand liquefaction model and contact model parameters can be obtained from the calibration results from experiments hydraulic parameters are the initial condition which describes the relation between moisture content and suction which can be obtained by experiment 3 cargo instability 3 1 static incline the static incline laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the behavior of nickel ore classnk 2011 the container was statically up to the maximum angle of 50 fig 3 solid bulk cargoes such as nickel ore normally contain some moisture within the particles the cargo flowability will increase with high moisture content at present the dem model cannot simulate the existence of the water inside how to consider the moisture in the particles is critical in the paper we use the friction coefficient to present the influence of moisture with the quantitative comparison of numerical results with experimental data by changing the friction coefficient the behavior of the cargo inside the container is compared with the experimental data to identify the relationship between the friction coefficient and mc as shown in table 2 it can be seen in fig 4 that the movement of the particles shows some errors in high moisture content with the experimental data as the experiment conducted by classnk has really water between particles fitting equations can be obtained to describe the relationship between the friction coefficient and mc fric 0 9 m c 24 20 m c 2 12 6 m c 2 772 24 m c 34 599320 6345 e ˆ 38 665 m c 34 m c 50 rfric 0 6 m c 35 16 5 m c 6 45 35 m c 39 0 02 39 m c 50 where mc moisture content fric friction coefficient rfric rolling friction coefficient 3 2 angle of repose based on the relationship between friction coefficient and the moisture content the angle of repose was simulated by the dem model as shown in fig 5 it is evident that a higher angle of repose is obtained when decreasing the moisture content this can be explained that under the force of gravity the power chain between particles will formulate by compression to transmit gravity oriented in the direction of stress direction the slight deformation at the contact point between two particles can resist the shear force which direction could have a certain angle with respect to axis when the friction coefficient is small the shear stress increases and the power chain ruptures the particle at the end of power chain on the surface of pile firstly happens to slide meantime new power chain constantly forms until the shear force becomes less than the critical value this can be seen in fig 6 that when the moisture exceeds a critical value the angle of repose or the shear strength decreases greatly in this simulation when the mc exceeds 36 the angle of repose decreases drastically 3 3 shaking table test a mid container of a solid bulk ship of 57500t by a scale ratio of 1 45 is selected in a prescribed rolling oscillation along the x axis as shown in fig 7 the length width and height of the container is 0 656 m 0 717 m and 0 414 m respectively the contact parameter of particles is shown in table 3 in the experiment the water content of the cargoes is 35 and the loading capacity is 48 of the total volume of the container guan et al 2014 the rotational axis is 0 12 m at the z direction during the simulation the radius and the density of particles are 0 02 m and 2500 kg m 3 which yield a total number of 1853 mono sized spheres the ratio of the length of box to particle radius and the time step size is 32 8 and 0 0005s respectively the same rolling period of 2 2s and rolling amplitude of 5 10 15 and 20 are applied respectively the moment on the container at different rolling angle is shown in fig 8 comparison with the experimental data though the amplitude of the moment almost coincides with the experimental data however great errors arise as the existence of the water between the particle is neglected 4 cargo liquefaction 4 1 simple shear test the simple shear test gives the shear stress strain curve for the sample which demonstrates the shear strength of the cargo the shearing strain γ can be measured in the simple shear test as γ δ x h 0 where δ x the distance in horizontal movement between the top and the bottom of the sample h 0 the initial height of the sample the shear stress τ is measured as the shear force divided by the cross sectional area of the sample in the paper a specimen filled with balls is considered as the granular particles consolidation of the specimen is performed to achieve a desired vertical effective stress σ v for example the value of 100 kpa cuomo et al 2016 conducted simple shear tests on the unsaturated soil and saturated soil with the soil specific gravity of 2 55 table 4 and the samples in pfc3d are prepared fig 9 the model parameters used in the simulation are given in table 5 fig 10 shows the relationship between matric suction and water content it is indicated in fig 11 the liquefaction model can simulate the simple shear behavior

22698,operations with intervention autonomous underwater vehicle i auv can not only realize automatic and accurate missions but also save the pilots endeavors and reduce their fatigues however the performance of a small sized i auv is easily affected by its own restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects a novel small sized single body and streamlined i auv has been developed for autonomous cruising and manipulation through the schemes comparisons and analysis on the restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance in order to investigate i auv manipulation hydrodynamic performance during manipulation water channel experiments and computation fluid dynamics cfd have been made on various operation postures moreover cfd simulations and analysis have been expanded from water channel domain to infinite domain to obtain i auv manipulation hydrodynamic performance during forward cruising keywords underwater vehicle underwater vehicle manipulator system underwater manipulation manipulation hydrodynamics 1 introduction for the time being underwater vehicles have been more and more widely applied for submarine operations among these vehicles the remotely operated vehicles rovs play important roles in a number of applied missions such as salvages marine science explorations oil and gas extraction f bruno et al 2015 they are usually equipped with one or two manipulators with the advantages in placing the pilots with direct views of manipulation jin zhang et al 2017 however working class rovs usually operate with specialized mother ship and heavy crane the tether disturbances limit the rov s operation range and flexibility moreover operations on precise and complex tasks with tens of dofs degree of freedoms of the vehicle and manipulators combination usually take a few hours and cause the pilots fatigue prats et al 2011 and j c garcía et al 2010 since the autonomous underwater vehicles auvs can operate accurately and automatically without tether disturbance the intervention auv i auv provides a new field and prospect for light weight submarine operations pere ridao et al 2015 the first typical i auv was tested from alive project by cybernetics evans j et al 2001 the alive is a 3 5 tons vehicle equipped with two 7 dofs manipulators the interventions of alive are realized through docked manipulation another 6 tons sauvim with a 65 kg manipulator developed by the autonomous system laboratory of university of hawaii was the first developed i auv to realize autonomous floating manipulation task in the oceanic environment giacomo marani et al 2009 since these auvs are much greater than their manipulators the coupled interactions between auvs the main bodies and their manipulators can be neglected currently i auvs are still at their early stage not only because their autonomy and intelligence require improvements but also because their mechanics and hydrodynamics should be designed helpful for autonomous manipulation in compare with rovs the design of i auvs requires the consideration with autonomous cruising and manipulation at the same time with the development of i auv small sized auv and manipulator system has been developed and researched an important contribution to the development of the i auv is the trident project simetti e et al 2014 lasting for 3 years and started from 2010 the trident project is proposed to perform autonomous underwater recovery of a black box in a harbor environment the european union eu project pandora focused on the issue of persistent autonomy lane d m et al 2012 through reducing the frequency of assistance requests furthermore the italian maris casalino g et al 2014 project had further developed the autonomous of i auv in underwater operations and transportation tasks recently an on going horizon project called dexrov augusto d l p et al 2016 focuses on increasing the autonomy of rov operations this project allows a supervised teleoperation from remote sites different from the same sized rovs small sized i auvs are usually developed with streamlined configuration in order to reduce cruising resistance and improve endurance range however when the weight of manipulator is bigger than one fiftieth of the vehicle the coupled interactions between the vehicle and its manipulator can not be ignored jonghui han et al 2014 the interactions include restoring forces caused by changes of the mass center and the buoyancy center during operation coupling motion interactions from momentum conservation and hydrodynamic effects hai huang et al 2017 the university of girona has invented a reconfigurable i auv named after girona 500 girona 500 is composed of a light weight 4 dof manipulator and an aluminum frame with three torpedo shaped hulls with overall length of 1 5 m and less than 200 kg weight the two upper hulls contain floating foams and electronics capsules while the lower one contains heavy payloads david ribas et al 2015 in the purpose of developing an autonomous sampling underwater vehicle whoi woods hole oceanographic institute designed a two variant body of auv with a six dofs manipulator craig lewandowski et al 2008 korea atomic energy research institute has developed a three body auv with a five joints manipulator jonghui han et al 2011 in compare with a single body i auv the multi body i auv is easy for arrangement and manipulation stability but it increases the cruising resistance and hydrodynamic effects reduces rising speed cruising speed and endurance as one of the most important research field of auv hydrodynamic performance plays significant roles in the design motion control cruising and operation maneuverability performance s j xu et al 2014 for the i auv submarine floating operations the effects from hydrodynamics can not be neglected moreover different manipulator operation postures can involve different hydrodynamic effects during forward cruising oblique cruising in the horizontal or vertical planes pitch motion and then obtain different groups of hydrodynamic coefficients experimental evaluation with planar motion mechanism pmm or wind cave pablo et al 2011 and numerical calculation e a de barros et al 2012 pablo et al 2011 are the two most important methods to analyze hydrodynamic effects for underwater vehicles the numerical calculation method on the basis of empirical formulas sh mansoorzadeh et al 2014 or finite element method software thomas battista et al 2016 is one of the most practical and convenient ways to obtain hydrodynamic forces and moments but one has to precisely construct the model generate the mesh set boundary conditions and analyze parameters according to auv mechanism and experimental environment on the other hand experimental evaluation with pmm has been regarded as one of the most practical and reliable hydrodynamic measurement instruments the experiments are usually realized in the tank with supporting bars fixed on the force sensor inside the vehicle hull in the literature many reduced or equal sized underwater vehicle models have been made to undertake the pmm experiments p jagadeesh et al 2009 has presented a cruising experiment with a 1 2 auv hull model in the tank the author presented guidance experiments on the auv to study normal drag lift and pitching moment coefficients n m nouri et al 2016 developed a new apparatus and estimated hydrodynamic derivatives in the pmm experiments of water tunnel these experiments presented the relationship between regulation parameters and estimate hydrodynamic derivatives they can also provide references on the experimental evaluation for i auv hydrodynamics although rov has been widely applied for submarine operation hydrodynamics experiments are usually carried out with a full scale rov but these experiments take no consideration with the manipulators ettore a de barros et al 2008 however for a small sized i auv the change of manipulator postures can also result in the change of flow meeting area and therefore cause different hydrodynamic effects during i auv operation procedures on the other hand computation fluid dynamics cfd simulations can not only avoid the effect of tank domain boundary and supporting bars but also enumerate various operation postures this paper will investigate the mechanical design and the hydrodynamic performance of a small sized i auv manipulation during cruising since the i auv manipulation process is usually at low speed the article will mainly analyse the stationary conditions and then further discuss the dynamic conditions for the difference the contributions are described as follows 1 a novel small sized single body and streamlined i auv heu tris i auv has been developed for the autonomous cruising and manipulation analysis and comparisons have been proposed on restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance between the designed single body scheme and a multiple body scheme in order to obtain the superior design with synthetically better operational stability and hydrodynamic performance 2 hydrodynamic experiments have been made on various manipulation postures of heu tris i auv the experiments include forward cruising oblique cruising in horizontal and vertical plane forced pure pitching movement experiments varied groups of hydrodynamic coefficients and performances are obtained and analyzed for manipulation operation 3 on the basis of hydrodynamic experiments cfd simulations on i auv manipulation have expanded the analysis from water channel domain to infinite domain moreover hydrodynamic performance on forward cruising operations has been analyzed through cfd simulations the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 will describe the mechanical design process of heu tris i auv experiments and simulations on hydrodynamic performance will be issued in section 3 and section 4 respectively conclusions will be given in section 5 to close this paper 2 mechanical design 2 1 overall design concept i auv is usually composed of an auv carrier and a multi dof manipulator it can be regarded as a multibody system including vehicle fixed node sets and manipulator node sets with independent dofs see fig 1 in comparison with exploring type auv i auv requires the designer to consider more on metacenter height hydrodynamic performance and arrangements of key instruments since the underwater operations are currently carried out with relative low speed restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects are major effects compared with coupling interactions from the conservation of moment momentum moreover a well designed auv must possess good performance in the forward cruising oblique cruising in the horizontal and vertical plane in order to reduce sailing resistance and realize great range cruising the auv is often designed with one or more streamlined hulls therefore the following design concept will take restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects into consideration for the design of a small sized streamlined i auv one should not only take stability into consideration but pay attention to reasonable installation and layout of operation and maintenance fig 2 describes the general layout and design of heu tris i auv heu tris i auv is 2 38 m in length 0 536 m in width 0 382 m in height and 170 kg in weight with 300 m as maximum operation depth its designed cruising speed is 3 knots with manipulator folding in the auv hull the full spread length of the 4 dof manipulator is 0 78 m and 18 kg in weight the manipulator is composed of 2 pitch joints at the shoulder and elbow joint 2 revolving joints at main arm and forearm each joint is designed with closed type and modular structure and actuated with a harmonic ac servo actuator the manipulator is folded in the auv hull during cruising state and spread when manipulation see fig 3 heu tris i auv is equipped with two main thrusters of 10 kg thrust for long range cruising a lateral channel thruster of 7 kg and four vertical channel thrusters of 5 kg for low speed maneuvering operation heu tris i auv is composed of autonomous cruising main body autonomous operation control system and autonomous operation mechanism system the autonomous cruising main body includes the vehicle hull support frame buoyancy modules streamlined hull two main thrusters and forward looking camera supported by the vehicle hull support frame the streamlined hull is designed to reduce cruising resistance and cruising performance the two main thrusters are responsible for forward cruising and heading control the forward looking camera is purposed to detect and recognize operation target online the autonomous operation mechanism system is composed of a manipulator 1 lateral channel thruster 4 vertical channel thrusters lithium batteries buoyancy modules and the tail wing the 4 dof manipulator is composed of 2 pitch joints at the shoulder and elbow joint 2 revolving joints at main arm and forearm from fig 3 cruising state and manipulation state are set respectively in fig 3 for the effectiveness of cruising and operation lithium batteries and buoyancy modules are used to descend heu tris i auv metacenter height in order to improve operation stability during the manipulation process heu tris i auv can approach the target along with the closest direction in the horizontal plane with the coordination of a lateral channel thruster and two main thrusters moreover four vertical channel thrusters with the tail wing can maintain heu tris i auv operation posture and diving depth reduce its rolling and pitching caused by the manipulator operation and realize stable operation 2 2 design schemes discussion on restoring forces in order to analyze restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance during manipulation denavit hartenberg dh expression and conversion see table 1 have been used to illustrate the posture of heu tris i auv manipulation in table 1 α i represents the ith link torsion angle of the manipulator a i represents the length of the ith link d i represents the distance between the ith and the i 1st links θ i is the angle between the ith and the i 1st links the second scheme can be seen in fig 4 to maintain heu tris i auv a streamlined body for small sized i auv restoring forces are one of the major effects on the operation process takashi yatoh et al 2008 not only because the weight of manipulator can not be neglected but also because the equilibrium of the gravity and buoyancy centers shift during operation in order to reduce restoring forces effects two design schemes are considered the first scheme can be seen in fig 5 in this scheme the two battery capsules are arranged below the main body to constitute a three body i auv each battery capsule is 30 kg in weight they can improve the stability center height with buoyancy module at top table 2 illustrates restoring forces and stability center height of the two schemes furthermore the lifting up of two main thrusters and the tailed stable wings can improve the cruising performance at specified depth restoring forces are obtained from the calculation of gravitation and buoyancy forces on the center of gravity and center of buoyancy gianluca antonelli 2014 1 g η f g v f b v i f g i f b i r g v f g v r b v f b v i r g i f g i r b i f b i where g η is the vector of restoring forces f g v is the vehicle gravity force f b v is the buoyancy force f g i is the gravity force of the manipulator ith link f b i is the buoyancy force of the manipulator ith link r g v is the position vector of gravity center of the vehicle relative to the auv geometric center r b v is the position vector of buoyancy center of the vehicle relative to the auv geometric center r b i and r g i are the position vectors of buoyancy and gravity center of the manipulator ith link relative to the auv geometric center respectively table 2 illustrate the height of metacenter distance between gravity center and buoyancy center of the above two schemes apparently the greater the metacenter height the more stable for the manipulation process 2 3 design schemes discussion on hydrodynamic performance for the cfd simulations of auv water channel experiments the cutting body meshes have been adopted for the background domain while polyhedron elements have been adopted for the auv subdomain are set on the basis of overlapping grids see fig 6 multiple layered prismatic meshes are set with the boundary domain of the vehicle in order to simulate the vehicle ambient flow field and reflect the boundary flow non dimensional wall distance y y ρ τ w μ is applied to measure the first layer mesh quality where y 30 200 ρ is the fluid density μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity y is the mesh node distance to wall τ w is the wall shear stress 2 y l y 80 re 13 14 where r e is the reynolds number l r e ρ v l μ v is the flow velocity is the characteristic length δ is the boundary layer thickness δ 0 035 l r e 1 7 for the small sized i auv cruising maneuverability is also one of the major performances to be considered numerical computation on these two schemes has been carried out through the computational fluid dynamics software star ccm in fig 6 in this section hydrodynamic performance analysis has been made on the comparisons between the two design schemes i e battery capsules inner positioned in fig 2 and battery capsules extra positioned in fig 5 in order to make comparison on different schemes the direct cruising pressure contour schemes are combined described in fig 7 on the basis of sst k omega turbulence model from the pressure contours of the flow around the vehicle disorder turbulence distribute on the shape with violent change locations since the extra positioned scheme includes complex streamline hydrodynamic coefficients of the two schemes are issued in table 3 from table 3 the extra positioned scheme not only increases flow meeting area but also causes disorder streamline close to the battery capsules thus the resistance coefficients x uu yawing coefficients y v and yawing moment n v increase greatly moreover the great change of y v and n v v are also resulted from the position change of hydrodynamics effect center from the discussions above the multibody scheme can improve manipulation stability but effects greatly on manoeuvrability and cruising although manipulation stability is not as good single body scheme has advantages in manoeuvrability and cruising moreover one can improve the metacenter height through arrangement optimization therefore the single body scheme has been selected for the final manufacture 3 hydrodynamic experiments on heu tris i auv 3 1 experimental setup the hydrodynamic experiments have been carried out in the circulation water channel of harbin engineering university the circulation water channel is 1 5 m wide 1 7 m high and 7 0 m long with experimental flow rate at 0 3 2 0 m s in the experiments heu tris i auv model including heu tris i auv hull and the manipulator is fixed on planar motion mechanism pmm through six component force sensor pmm is composed of oscillating mechanism data acquisition system driving motor reducer and control unit etc see fig 8 the six component force sensor on the planar balancing mounting frame of heu tris i auv is fixed to the oscillating mechanism through straight bar through the six component force sensor one can obtain forces on the heu tris i auv model in all the directions the heaving pitching oblique cruising and dragging of heu tris i auv model are realized through pmm the current speed in the water channel can be set from 0 3 m s to 2 0 m s the range of pmm oscillation frequency is 0 2 1 0 hz with the maximum amplitude as 0 04 m in the experiments the uncertainties are caused by current speed errors 1 homogeneity error of flow field 5 10 sensor error 0 1 moreover the uncertainties from gyroscopic and pitching moment are greater than longitudinal lateral and vertical forces for more information see references thor i fossen 2011 in the hydrodynamic experiments the forward cruising oblique cruising oblique cruising in the vertical plane and pitching have been carried out with heu tris i auv model at different manipulator joints posture from dh conversion six different manipulator joints postures are arranged in fig 9 b f respectively for the hydrodynamic experiments in the water channel assumption during the manipulation process the vehicle and the manipulator is cruising less than 0 6 m s and operating less than 30 s for each independent joint according to this assumption the cruising speed range is set from 0 3 m s to 0 6 m s during operation all the hydrodynamic coefficients of each manipulator postures are obtained at the time when each joint stay every posture at a steady state for example the postures are shoulder main arm elbow 90 0 90 50 0 20 50 90 30 40 90 160 10 0 70 respectively see fig 9 3 2 experiments of manipulation during forward cruising in the experiments of forward cruising longitudinal forces corresponding to different current speed can be obtained from six component force sensor according to the dynamic manoeuvring equation of underwater vehicle one obtains the exerted longitudinal force on the vehicle during forward cruising experiments 3 x u x q q q 2 x r r r 2 x r p r p x u u x v r v r x w q w q x u u u 2 x v v v 2 x w w w 2 x a where x q q x r r x r r x r p x v r x w q x u u x v v and x w w are the

auv model is fixed to the pmm through straight bar the current speed is set from 0 3 m s to 1 0 m s the relationship between current speed and cruising resistance is issued in fig 10 from the experiments the resistance is minimum at cruising state while the resistance is maximum at the posture of 10 0 70 among all these operation postures the more flow meeting area of the operation posture the more cruising resistance heu tris i auv model is confronted moreover the state 50 0 20 embodies the same flow meeting area as the state 50 90 30 from fig 10 the longitudinal resistance is greater than lateral resistance during the manipulator spread operation during the forward cruising experiments the speed of v ω r q p and the active forces are approximately zero thus the exerted longitudinal force can be simplified as renilson martin 2015 4 x u x u u u 2 therefore one obtains the viscous resistance coefficients x u u from the least squares see table 4 3 3 experiments of

oblique cruising experiments the range of drifting angle is set from 10 10 the relationship between the lateral force or the oblique cruising moment and lateral speed is issued in fig 11 a and b respectively since the speed of ω r q p and the active forces and moments are approximately zero thus the exerted lateral force and yawing moment can be simplified as renilson martin 2015 6 y v y 0 y

or pitching moment and drifting speed is issued in fig 12 a and b respectively since the speed of v r q p and the active forces are approximately zero u is the current speed in the experiments thus the exerted lateral force and yawing moment can be simplified as renilson martin 2015 therefore one obtains the coefficients z w w z w m w w and m w from the least squares see table 6 3 4 forced pure pitching movement experiments in the pure pitching movement experiments the current direction is tangent to the model central trajectory with the speed as uc 0 6 m s the frequency of harmonic

relative to front straight bar ε 2 a r c t a n w l 0 u c x 0 0 therefore one obtains the coefficients of table 7 4 hydrodynamic numerical analysis on the heu tris i auv 4 1 hydrodynamic numerical simulation setup from table 7 the increment and change of hydrodynamic coefficients are not as great as forward cruising and oblique cruising in order to simulate the pmm experiment and expand the manipulation analysis into infinite domain the cfd numerical simulations in star ccm include the following three stages 1 simulate the experimental conditions with the constraints of support straight bar connector water channel domain and free surface domain the validation and dependability of the cfd analysis can be verified through the comparisons between experiments and simulations 2 simulate the heu tris i auv cruising in the infinite domain without constraints and free surface which is the same like its usual manipulation experimental environment 3 expand the simulations to analyse the heu tris i auv manipulation process and manoeuvrability with different manipulator postures see fig 15 4 2 simulation verifications from the experiments fig 16 illustrates the results comparisons of pressure contour profiles between the water channel computation domain and the infinite domain from the following equation one can obtain non gravity pressure distributions for the flow field 10 p v p g γ h where p g is the pressure with gravity p v is the pressure without gravity γ ρ g from fig 16 the pressure on the vehicle bow changes greatly with the free surface in fig 17 comparisons results have been made between the experiments and cfd simulation on the different computation domains from the results of fig 17 the channel experiments can be restored through cfd simulations the analysis results also verified that the vehicle resistance could be reduced without the constraints such as the support straight bar and free surface 4 3 forward cruising with manipulator at static state on the basis of the simulations above heu tris i auv manipulation during forward cruising within infinite domain will be simulated with different manipulator postures in the simulations cruising speed is set as u 0 57 m s in compare with cruising state the asymmetry contour of heu tris i auv manipulation states affects its forward cruising stability fig 18 reflects vortices changes during the manipulation spread process in the cruising state only a few vortices have been created on the vehicle head and tail while in the manipulation state great vortices have been generated on the manipulator back and vehicle manipulator joint moreover the manipulation process also leads to the change of pressure distribution around the vehicle although little vortices changes have been created on the vehicle body on the other hand the manipulation process also generates the changes of heu tris i auv resistance x lateral force y heave force z pitch moment m and yawing moment n see fig 19 the resistance x increases greatly with the spread of manipulator while the increase of lateral force y and yawing moment n not only destroys the vehicle direct stability but also causes the horizontal and three dimensional movements the lateral force y and yawing moment n increase caused from manipulation state asymmetry generates head control difficulties but the pressure reduces with the manipulator operation away from central longitudinal section if the manipulator spread only with shoulder and elbow swing in the central longitudinal section the values of yawing moment y and lateral force n do not change much in fig 19 b m and n have the same trend but m has a larger range of changes the influence of the manipulator on the vertical plane motion stability of heu tris i auv is greater 4 4 forward cruising with manipulator at dynamic state since the manipulation process is dynamic state comparisons have been made on i auv cruising with stationary posture 40 0 30 and the movement state at 25deg s in fig 20 the resistance of i auv with dynamic process below is 19 8179n while the resistance the static one is 16 2569n the vortices pressures for the dynamic state are also greater therefore the hydrodynamics for manipulator continuous motions during forward cruising has been researched on the basis of overset mesh each joint movement includes steady and unsteady movement respectively steady or unsteady movement could lead to great difference in joint velocities and accelerations fig 21 shows the motion law of the manipulator of heu tris i auv fig 22 describes the vortices of manipulation in the dynamic state figss 23 27 illustrate hydrodynamic forces and moments exerted on heu tris i auv with a rotating arm x has a large fluctuation relative to other forces but the change of x does not directly change the attitude of the vehicle m is mostly negative and there is a tendency for the vehicle to tilt n fluctuates around zero which causes similar fluctuations in the yaw angle the result shows that the movement of manipulator has greatest influence on the resistance x 5 conclusions this study has developed a novel heu tris i auv for underwater autonomous manipulation in the designation process restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance have been evaluated and compared on the two schemes between battery capsule arranged inside and outside hydrodynamic experiments have been made on various manipulation postures of heu tris i auv on the basis of hydrodynamic experiments cfd simulations on i auv manipulation have expanded the analysis from water channel domain to infinite domain moreover hydrodynamic performance on manipulations during forward cruising have been analysed through cfd simulations in order to analyse obtain heu tris i auv hydrodynamics from the experimental and cfd analysis different hydrodynamic coefficients with manipulators at different postures have been obtained for accurate manipulation control and motion plan for the conditions of object grasp this article only considered that the object was small enough to be contained in the hand so that it would not lead to extra hydrodynamic effects for the manipulation object of different shapes and sizes one can take the object as an extra part of the manipulator end and obtain the hydrodynamic effects from the simulation settlement methodology of this

22698,operations with intervention autonomous underwater vehicle i auv can not only realize automatic and accurate missions but also save the pilots endeavors and reduce their fatigues however the performance of a small sized i auv is easily affected by its own restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects a novel small sized single body and streamlined i auv has been developed for autonomous cruising and manipulation through the schemes comparisons and analysis on the restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance in order to investigate i auv manipulation hydrodynamic performance during manipulation water channel experiments and computation fluid dynamics cfd have been made on various operation postures moreover cfd simulations and analysis have been expanded from water channel domain to infinite domain to obtain i auv manipulation hydrodynamic performance during forward cruising keywords underwater vehicle underwater vehicle manipulator system underwater manipulation manipulation hydrodynamics 1 introduction for the time being underwater vehicles have been more and more widely applied for submarine operations among these vehicles the remotely operated vehicles rovs play important roles in a number of applied missions such as salvages marine science explorations oil and gas extraction f bruno et al 2015 they are usually equipped with one or two manipulators with the advantages in placing the pilots with direct views of manipulation jin zhang et al 2017 however working class rovs usually operate with specialized mother ship and heavy crane the tether disturbances limit the rov s operation range and flexibility moreover operations on precise and complex tasks with tens of dofs degree of freedoms of the vehicle and manipulators combination usually take a few hours and cause the pilots fatigue prats et al 2011 and j c garcía et al 2010 since the autonomous underwater vehicles auvs can operate accurately and automatically without tether disturbance the intervention auv i auv provides a new field and prospect for light weight submarine operations pere ridao et al 2015 the first typical i auv was tested from alive project by cybernetics evans j et al 2001 the alive is a 3 5 tons vehicle equipped with two 7 dofs manipulators the interventions of alive are realized through docked manipulation another 6 tons sauvim with a 65 kg manipulator developed by the autonomous system laboratory of university of hawaii was the first developed i auv to realize autonomous floating manipulation task in the oceanic environment giacomo marani et al 2009 since these auvs are much greater than their manipulators the coupled interactions between auvs the main bodies and their manipulators can be neglected currently i auvs are still at their early stage not only because their autonomy and intelligence require improvements but also because their mechanics and hydrodynamics should be designed helpful for autonomous manipulation in compare with rovs the design of i auvs requires the consideration with autonomous cruising and manipulation at the same time with the development of i auv small sized auv and manipulator system has been developed and researched an important contribution to the development of the i auv is the trident project simetti e et al 2014 lasting for 3 years and started from 2010 the trident project is proposed to perform autonomous underwater recovery of a black box in a harbor environment the european union eu project pandora focused on the issue of persistent autonomy lane d m et al 2012 through reducing the frequency of assistance requests furthermore the italian maris casalino g et al 2014 project had further developed the autonomous of i auv in underwater operations and transportation tasks recently an on going horizon project called dexrov augusto d l p et al 2016 focuses on increasing the autonomy of rov operations this project allows a supervised teleoperation from remote sites different from the same sized rovs small sized i auvs are usually developed with streamlined configuration in order to reduce cruising resistance and improve endurance range however when the weight of manipulator is bigger than one fiftieth of the vehicle the coupled interactions between the vehicle and its manipulator can not be ignored jonghui han et al 2014 the interactions include restoring forces caused by changes of the mass center and the buoyancy center during operation coupling motion interactions from momentum conservation and hydrodynamic effects hai huang et al 2017 the university of girona has invented a reconfigurable i auv named after girona 500 girona 500 is composed of a light weight 4 dof manipulator and an aluminum frame with three torpedo shaped hulls with overall length of 1 5 m and less than 200 kg weight the two upper hulls contain floating foams and electronics capsules while the lower one contains heavy payloads david ribas et al 2015 in the purpose of developing an autonomous sampling underwater vehicle whoi woods hole oceanographic institute designed a two variant body of auv with a six dofs manipulator craig lewandowski et al 2008 korea atomic energy research institute has developed a three body auv with a five joints manipulator jonghui han et al 2011 in compare with a single body i auv the multi body i auv is easy for arrangement and manipulation stability but it increases the cruising resistance and hydrodynamic effects reduces rising speed cruising speed and endurance as one of the most important research field of auv hydrodynamic performance plays significant roles in the design motion control cruising and operation maneuverability performance s j xu et al 2014 for the i auv submarine floating operations the effects from hydrodynamics can not be neglected moreover different manipulator operation postures can involve different hydrodynamic effects during forward cruising oblique cruising in the horizontal or vertical planes pitch motion and then obtain different groups of hydrodynamic coefficients experimental evaluation with planar motion mechanism pmm or wind cave pablo et al 2011 and numerical calculation e a de barros et al 2012 pablo et al 2011 are the two most important methods to analyze hydrodynamic effects for underwater vehicles the numerical calculation method on the basis of empirical formulas sh mansoorzadeh et al 2014 or finite element method software thomas battista et al 2016 is one of the most practical and convenient ways to obtain hydrodynamic forces and moments but one has to precisely construct the model generate the mesh set boundary conditions and analyze parameters according to auv mechanism and experimental environment on the other hand experimental evaluation with pmm has been regarded as one of the most practical and reliable hydrodynamic measurement instruments the experiments are usually realized in the tank with supporting bars fixed on the force sensor inside the vehicle hull in the literature many reduced or equal sized underwater vehicle models have been made to undertake the pmm experiments p jagadeesh et al 2009 has presented a cruising experiment with a 1 2 auv hull model in the tank the author presented guidance experiments on the auv to study normal drag lift and pitching moment coefficients n m nouri et al 2016 developed a new apparatus and estimated hydrodynamic derivatives in the pmm experiments of water tunnel these experiments presented the relationship between regulation parameters and estimate hydrodynamic derivatives they can also provide references on the experimental evaluation for i auv hydrodynamics although rov has been widely applied for submarine operation hydrodynamics experiments are usually carried out with a full scale rov but these experiments take no consideration with the manipulators ettore a de barros et al 2008 however for a small sized i auv the change of manipulator postures can also result in the change of flow meeting area and therefore cause different hydrodynamic effects during i auv operation procedures on the other hand computation fluid dynamics cfd simulations can not only avoid the effect of tank domain boundary and supporting bars but also enumerate various operation postures this paper will investigate the mechanical design and the hydrodynamic performance of a small sized i auv manipulation during cruising since the i auv manipulation process is usually at low speed the article will mainly analyse the stationary conditions and then further discuss the dynamic conditions for the difference the contributions are described as follows 1 a novel small sized single body and streamlined i auv heu tris i auv has been developed for the autonomous cruising and manipulation analysis and comparisons have been proposed on restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance between the designed single body scheme and a multiple body scheme in order to obtain the superior design with synthetically better operational stability and hydrodynamic performance 2 hydrodynamic experiments have been made on various manipulation postures of heu tris i auv the experiments include forward cruising oblique cruising in horizontal and vertical plane forced pure pitching movement experiments varied groups of hydrodynamic coefficients and performances are obtained and analyzed for manipulation operation 3 on the basis of hydrodynamic experiments cfd simulations on i auv manipulation have expanded the analysis from water channel domain to infinite domain moreover hydrodynamic performance on forward cruising operations has been analyzed through cfd simulations the rest of this study is organized as follows section 2 will describe the mechanical design process of heu tris i auv experiments and simulations on hydrodynamic performance will be issued in section 3 and section 4 respectively conclusions will be given in section 5 to close this paper 2 mechanical design 2 1 overall design concept i auv is usually composed of an auv carrier and a multi dof manipulator it can be regarded as a multibody system including vehicle fixed node sets and manipulator node sets with independent dofs see fig 1 in comparison with exploring type auv i auv requires the designer to consider more on metacenter height hydrodynamic performance and arrangements of key instruments since the underwater operations are currently carried out with relative low speed restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects are major effects compared with coupling interactions from the conservation of moment momentum moreover a well designed auv must possess good performance in the forward cruising oblique cruising in the horizontal and vertical plane in order to reduce sailing resistance and realize great range cruising the auv is often designed with one or more streamlined hulls therefore the following design concept will take restoring forces and hydrodynamic effects into consideration for the design of a small sized streamlined i auv one should not only take stability into consideration but pay attention to reasonable installation and layout of operation and maintenance fig 2 describes the general layout and design of heu tris i auv heu tris i auv is 2 38 m in length 0 536 m in width 0 382 m in height and 170 kg in weight with 300 m as maximum operation depth its designed cruising speed is 3 knots with manipulator folding in the auv hull the full spread length of the 4 dof manipulator is 0 78 m and 18 kg in weight the manipulator is composed of 2 pitch joints at the shoulder and elbow joint 2 revolving joints at main arm and forearm each joint is designed with closed type and modular structure and actuated with a harmonic ac servo actuator the manipulator is folded in the auv hull during cruising state and spread when manipulation see fig 3 heu tris i auv is equipped with two main thrusters of 10 kg thrust for long range cruising a lateral channel thruster of 7 kg and four vertical channel thrusters of 5 kg for low speed maneuvering operation heu tris i auv is composed of autonomous cruising main body autonomous operation control system and autonomous operation mechanism system the autonomous cruising main body includes the vehicle hull support frame buoyancy modules streamlined hull two main thrusters and forward looking camera supported by the vehicle hull support frame the streamlined hull is designed to reduce cruising resistance and cruising performance the two main thrusters are responsible for forward cruising and heading control the forward looking camera is purposed to detect and recognize operation target online the autonomous operation mechanism system is composed of a manipulator 1 lateral channel thruster 4 vertical channel thrusters lithium batteries buoyancy modules and the tail wing the 4 dof manipulator is composed of 2 pitch joints at the shoulder and elbow joint 2 revolving joints at main arm and forearm from fig 3 cruising state and manipulation state are set respectively in fig 3 for the effectiveness of cruising and operation lithium batteries and buoyancy modules are used to descend heu tris i auv metacenter height in order to improve operation stability during the manipulation process heu tris i auv can approach the target along with the closest direction in the horizontal plane with the coordination of a lateral channel thruster and two main thrusters moreover four vertical channel thrusters with the tail wing can maintain heu tris i auv operation posture and diving depth reduce its rolling and pitching caused by the manipulator operation and realize stable operation 2 2 design schemes discussion on restoring forces in order to analyze restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance during manipulation denavit hartenberg dh expression and conversion see table 1 have been used to illustrate the posture of heu tris i auv manipulation in table 1 α i represents the ith link torsion angle of the manipulator a i represents the length of the ith link d i represents the distance between the ith and the i 1st links θ i is the angle between the ith and the i 1st links the second scheme can be seen in fig 4 to maintain heu tris i auv a streamlined body for small sized i auv restoring forces are one of the major effects on the operation process takashi yatoh et al 2008 not only because the weight of manipulator can not be neglected but also because the equilibrium of the gravity and buoyancy centers shift during operation in order to reduce restoring forces effects two design schemes are considered the first scheme can be seen in fig 5 in this scheme the two battery capsules are arranged below the main body to constitute a three body i auv each battery capsule is 30 kg in weight they can improve the stability center height with buoyancy module at top table 2 illustrates restoring forces and stability center height of the two schemes furthermore the lifting up of two main thrusters and the tailed stable wings can improve the cruising performance at specified depth restoring forces are obtained from the calculation of gravitation and buoyancy forces on the center of gravity and center of buoyancy gianluca antonelli 2014 1 g η f g v f b v i f g i f b i r g v f g v r b v f b v i r g i f g i r b i f

manipulator ith link r g v is the position vector of gravity center of the vehicle relative to the auv geometric center r b v is the position vector of buoyancy center of the vehicle relative to the auv geometric center r b i and r g i are the position vectors of buoyancy and gravity center of the manipulator ith link relative to the auv geometric center respectively table 2 illustrate the height of metacenter distance between gravity center and buoyancy center of the above two schemes apparently the greater the metacenter height the more stable for the manipulation process 2 3 design schemes discussion on hydrodynamic performance for the cfd simulations of auv water channel experiments the cutting body meshes have been adopted for the background domain while polyhedron elements have been adopted for the auv subdomain are set on the basis of overlapping grids see fig 6 multiple layered prismatic meshes are set with the boundary domain of the vehicle in order to simulate the vehicle ambient flow field and reflect the boundary flow non dimensional wall distance y y ρ τ w μ is applied to measure the first layer mesh quality where y 30 200 ρ is the fluid density μ is the fluid dynamic viscosity y is the mesh node distance to wall τ w is the wall shear stress 2 y l y 80 re 13 14 where r e is the reynolds number l r e ρ v l μ v is the flow velocity is the characteristic length δ is the boundary layer thickness δ 0 035 l r e 1 7 for the small sized i auv cruising maneuverability is also one of the major performances to be considered numerical computation on these two schemes has been carried out through the computational fluid dynamics software star ccm in fig 6 in this section hydrodynamic performance analysis has been made on the comparisons between the two design schemes i e battery capsules inner positioned in fig 2 and battery capsules extra positioned in fig 5 in order to make comparison on different schemes the direct cruising pressure contour schemes are combined described in fig 7 on the basis of sst k omega turbulence model from the pressure contours of the flow around the vehicle disorder turbulence distribute on the shape with violent change locations since the extra positioned scheme includes complex streamline hydrodynamic coefficients of the two schemes are issued in table 3 from table 3 the extra positioned scheme not only increases flow meeting area but also causes disorder streamline close to the battery capsules thus the resistance coefficients x uu yawing coefficients y v and yawing moment n v increase greatly moreover the great change of y v and n v v are also resulted from the position change of hydrodynamics effect center from the discussions above the multibody scheme can improve manipulation stability but effects greatly on manoeuvrability and cruising although manipulation stability is not as good single body scheme has advantages in manoeuvrability and cruising moreover one can improve the metacenter height through arrangement optimization therefore the single body scheme has been selected for the final manufacture 3 hydrodynamic experiments on heu tris i auv 3 1 experimental setup the hydrodynamic experiments have been carried out in the circulation water channel of harbin engineering university the circulation water channel is 1 5 m wide 1 7 m high and 7 0 m long with experimental flow rate at 0 3 2 0 m s in the experiments heu tris i auv model including heu tris i auv hull and the manipulator is fixed on planar motion mechanism pmm through six component force sensor pmm is composed of oscillating mechanism data acquisition system driving motor reducer and control unit etc see fig 8 the six component force sensor on the planar balancing mounting frame of heu tris i auv is fixed to the oscillating mechanism through straight bar through the six component force sensor one can obtain forces on the heu tris i auv model in all the directions the heaving pitching oblique cruising and dragging of heu tris i auv model are realized through pmm the current speed in the water channel can be set from 0 3 m s to 2 0 m s the range of pmm oscillation frequency is 0 2 1 0 hz with the maximum amplitude as 0 04 m in the experiments the uncertainties are caused by current speed errors 1 homogeneity error of flow field 5 10 sensor error 0 1 moreover the uncertainties from gyroscopic and pitching moment are greater than longitudinal lateral and vertical forces for more information see references thor i fossen 2011 in the hydrodynamic experiments the forward cruising oblique cruising oblique cruising in the vertical plane and pitching have been carried out with heu tris i auv model at different manipulator joints posture from dh conversion six different manipulator joints postures are arranged in fig 9 b f respectively for the hydrodynamic experiments in the water channel assumption during the manipulation process the vehicle and the manipulator is cruising less than 0 6 m s and operating less than 30 s for each independent joint according to this assumption the cruising speed range is set from 0 3 m s to 0 6 m s during operation all the hydrodynamic coefficients of each manipulator postures are obtained at the time when each joint stay every posture at a steady state for example the postures are shoulder main arm elbow 90 0 90 50 0 20 50 90 30 40 90 160 10 0 70 respectively see fig 9 3 2 experiments of manipulation during forward cruising in the experiments of forward cruising longitudinal forces corresponding to different current speed can be obtained from six component force sensor according to the dynamic manoeuvring equation of underwater vehicle one obtains the exerted longitudinal force on the vehicle during forward cruising experiments 3 x u x q q q 2 x r r r 2 x r p r p x u u x v r v r x w q w q x u u u 2 x v v v 2 x w w w 2 x a where x q q x r r x r r x r p x v r x w q x u u x v v and x w w are the

auv model is fixed to the pmm through straight bar the current speed is set from 0 3 m s to 1 0 m s the relationship between current speed and cruising resistance is issued in fig 10 from the experiments the resistance is minimum at cruising state while the resistance is maximum at the posture of 10 0 70 among all these operation postures the more flow meeting area of the operation posture the more cruising resistance heu tris i auv model is confronted moreover the state 50 0 20 embodies the same flow meeting area as the state 50 90 30 from fig 10 the longitudinal resistance is greater than lateral resistance during the manipulator spread operation during the forward cruising experiments the speed of v ω r q p and the active forces are approximately zero thus the exerted

oblique cruising experiments the range of drifting angle is set from 10 10 the relationship between the lateral force or the oblique cruising moment and lateral speed is issued in fig 11 a and b respectively since the speed of ω r q p and the active forces and moments are approximately zero thus the exerted lateral force and yawing moment can be simplified as renilson martin 2015 6 y v y 0 y

the exerted lateral force and yawing moment can be simplified as renilson martin 2015 therefore one obtains the coefficients z w w z w m w w and m w from the least squares see table 6 3 4 forced pure

relative to front straight bar ε 2 a r c t a n w l 0 u c x 0 0 therefore one obtains the coefficients of table 7 4 hydrodynamic numerical analysis on the heu tris i auv 4 1 hydrodynamic numerical simulation setup from table 7 the increment and change of hydrodynamic coefficients are not as great as forward cruising and oblique cruising in order to simulate the pmm experiment and expand the manipulation analysis into infinite domain the cfd numerical simulations in star ccm include the following three stages 1 simulate the experimental conditions with the constraints of support straight bar connector water channel domain and free surface domain the validation and dependability of the cfd analysis can be verified through the comparisons between experiments and simulations 2 simulate the heu tris i auv cruising in the infinite domain without constraints and free surface which is the same like its usual manipulation experimental environment 3 expand the simulations to analyse the heu tris i auv manipulation process and manoeuvrability with different manipulator postures see fig 15 4 2 simulation verifications from the experiments fig 16 illustrates the results comparisons of pressure contour profiles between the water channel computation domain and the infinite domain from the following equation one can obtain non gravity pressure distributions for the flow field 10 p v p g γ h where p g is the pressure with gravity p v is the pressure without gravity γ ρ g from fig 16 the pressure on the vehicle bow changes greatly with the free surface in fig 17 comparisons results have been made between the experiments and cfd simulation on the different computation domains from the results of fig 17 the channel experiments can be restored through cfd simulations the analysis results also verified that the vehicle resistance could be reduced without the constraints such as the support straight bar and free surface 4 3 forward cruising with manipulator at static state on the basis of the simulations above heu tris i auv manipulation during forward cruising within infinite domain will be simulated with different manipulator postures in the simulations cruising speed is set as u 0 57 m s in compare with cruising state the asymmetry contour of heu tris i auv manipulation states affects its forward cruising stability fig 18 reflects vortices changes during the manipulation spread process in the cruising state only a few vortices have been created on the vehicle head and tail while in the manipulation state great vortices have been generated on the manipulator back and vehicle manipulator joint moreover the manipulation process also leads to the change of pressure distribution around the vehicle although little vortices changes have been created on the vehicle body on the other hand the manipulation process also generates the changes of heu tris i auv resistance x lateral force y heave force z pitch moment m and yawing moment n see fig 19 the resistance x increases greatly with the spread of manipulator while the increase of lateral force y and yawing moment n not only destroys the vehicle direct stability but also causes the horizontal and three dimensional movements the lateral force y and yawing moment n increase caused from manipulation state asymmetry generates head control difficulties but the pressure reduces with the manipulator operation away from central longitudinal section if the manipulator spread only with shoulder and elbow swing in the central longitudinal section the values of yawing moment y and lateral force n do not change much in fig 19 b m and n have the same trend but m has a larger range of changes the influence of the manipulator on the vertical plane motion stability of heu tris i auv is greater 4 4 forward cruising with manipulator at dynamic state since the manipulation process is dynamic state comparisons have been made on i auv cruising with stationary posture 40 0 30 and the movement state at 25deg s in fig 20 the resistance of i auv with dynamic process below is 19 8179n while the resistance the static one is 16 2569n the vortices pressures for the dynamic state are also greater therefore the hydrodynamics for manipulator continuous motions during forward cruising has been researched on the basis of overset mesh each joint movement includes steady and unsteady movement respectively steady or unsteady movement could lead to great difference in joint velocities and accelerations fig 21 shows the motion law of the manipulator of heu tris i auv fig 22 describes the vortices of manipulation in the dynamic state figss 23 27 illustrate hydrodynamic forces and moments exerted on heu tris i auv with a rotating arm x has a large fluctuation relative to other forces but the change of x does not directly change the attitude of the vehicle m is mostly negative and there is a tendency for the vehicle to tilt n fluctuates around zero which causes similar fluctuations in the yaw angle the result shows that the movement of manipulator has greatest influence on the resistance x 5 conclusions this study has developed a novel heu tris i auv for underwater autonomous manipulation in the designation process restoring forces and hydrodynamic performance have been evaluated and compared on the two schemes between battery capsule arranged inside and outside hydrodynamic experiments have been made on various manipulation postures of heu tris i auv on the basis of hydrodynamic experiments cfd simulations on i auv manipulation have expanded the analysis from water channel domain to infinite domain moreover hydrodynamic performance on manipulations during forward cruising have been analysed through cfd simulations in order to analyse obtain heu tris i auv hydrodynamics from the experimental and cfd analysis different hydrodynamic coefficients with manipulators at different postures have been obtained for accurate manipulation control and motion plan for the conditions of object grasp this article only considered that the object was small enough to be contained in the hand so that it would not lead to extra hydrodynamic effects for the manipulation object of different shapes and sizes one can take the object as an extra part of the manipulator end and obtain the hydrodynamic effects from the simulation settlement methodology of this

22699,this study presented an experimental investigation of tsunami forces on a shielded building by the nearby buildings termed macroroughness three nominal wave conditions with non overtopping and overtopping cases were tested to study its effects in combination with each macroroughness setup in a 1 100 scaled experiment the tsunami induced loadings at the building model s front and back faces were measured and compared with the baseline no macroroughenss case the experimental results showed that the seaward macroroughness had a significant effect on the front and back face pressures sheltering effect by the seaward macroroughness was the greatest during a low nominal wave showing a reduction in maximum front face pressure up to 38 relative to the baseline however the sheltering effect was dependent on the seaward macroroughness setup for the case where the seaward macroroughness is not located directly in front of the building model the maximum front face pressure even exceeded the baseline value by about 13 during the overtopping case the seaward macroroughness was also effective in reducing the maximum back face pressure approximately 30 for the overtopping case regardless the macroroughness setup with the presence of the landward macroroughness the maximum back face pressure increased relative to the baseline keywords tsunami building macroroughness wave pressure 1 introduction tsunamis have received increased worldwide awareness since the occurrence of a tsunami on 26th december 2004 in consequence of a giant earthquake hit the west coast of sumatra as reported by rossetto et al 2007 12 countries in the indian ocean have suffered various extents of structural damage and loss of millions of lives in this devastating disaster another recent major tsunami is the 2011 tohoku tsunami which has affected almost all the northeast coast of japan causing around 20000 fatalities lekkas et al 2011 tsunamis have damaged the engineered reinforced concrete and steel buildings and non engineered buildings wooden buildings to different extents complete destruction has been observed for those non engineered buildings whereas the engineered structures behaved better when subjected to tsunami wave force yet there are major and minor damages to the engineered buildings the common tsunami induced building failure mechanisms include the out of plan failure of wall tilting by scouring or collapse overturning and large residual deformation chock et al 2013 these two devastating events have prompted extensive research from all over the world on the determination of tsunami loads on structures such as buildings bridges and walls due to the complexity of wave propagation associated with the shore situation physical modelling has been adopted to investigate the tsunami induced forces on coastal as well as onshore structures hitherto tsunami modelling has remained a fastidious concern among the researchers among the structures of major concern in tsunami modelling onshore building has been investigated extensively by numerous researchers such as asakura et al 2000 lukkunaprasit et al 2008 wilson et al 2009 manawasekara et al 2016 foster et al 2017 and others over the past decades a great deal of efforts has been dedicated to a single model experiment in fact the effect of nearby obstacles must be taken into the consideration when determining the tsunami loads on a building according to thomas et al 2014 the obstacles termed macroroughness can be in the form of shore protection structures or buildings which affect the tsunami flow as it travels across the inundation zone the interaction of bores with macroroughness is an important engineering problem in the evaluation of the tsunami flows and loads on structures camfied 1994 arnason et al 2009 as observed by dalrymple and kriebel 2005 the damage induced by the 2004 tsunami was greater for those infrastructure located directly behind the openings in coastal seawalls in phuket thailand conversely a group of wooden houses in yuriage japan located behind a reinforced concrete apartment house had a minor damage during the 2011 tsunami nilim and bri 2011 several findings have also revealed that the tsunami wave flow is significantly altered by the seawall and building rahman et al 2014 arimitsu et al 2016 tomiczek et al 2017 umeda et al 2018 however there is no consideration of the effect of macroroughness elements in most of the guidelines of designing tsunami resistant structures dames and moore 1980 cch 2000 icc 2009 fema p646 2012 in 2012 japanese design method by national institute for land and infrastructure management 2012 has proposed the value of water depth coefficient a in consideration of a shelter in the inundation zone therefore it is essential to understand the influence of nearby macroroughness for the safe and economic design of buildings to withstand tsunamis currently few studies on tsunami force with the presence of macroroughness have been conducted to investigate the fundamental relationship between the structure and the nearby macroroughness simamora et al 2007 conducted a series of hydraulic experiments to study the relationship between the multiple structures houses and seawall and tsunami wave force the force reduction on the inland building fronted by building or seawall has been demonstrated through their study especially when the interval between the two buildings located in front of the inland building is small results in decreasing the inundation depth and velocity also the distance of building from the shorelines has a significant effect on the reduction of tsunami force similar series of experiments have been re simulated numerically by nakamura et al 2011 in 2011 bridges et al 2011 also simulated eight different setups of macroroughness in term of the spacing of elements and the distance between the elements and instrumented specimen notably the simulated wave conditions in their study did not overtop the macroroughness elements results revealed that the maximum force occurred at a greater distance from the specimen as the spacing between the elements increased from the work done by thomas et al 2014 multiple symmetric configurations of two macroroughness elements were placed systematically in front of the specimen and a new measure so called the wake clearance angle was developed to determine the amplification factor on the tsunami forces regardless the distance between the macroroughness elements and also the distance between the macroroughness elements and the specimen of interest the force increased approximately 40 relative to the baseline no macroroughness case at the worst wake angle of 20 35 besides the effect of obstruction in the path of the incoming wave was studied by revanth et al 2016 compound wall with height same as the wave height was simulated as macroroughness in their study the compound wall was found to cause the wave to rise with a residual velocity subsequently hitting the top part of the inland structure causing the structure to deflect at the top and collapse another recent study was demonstrated by tomiczek et al 2016 where the direct shielding by shoreward structures can significantly lessen the effects of incoming waves with a peak pressure reduction of 40 70 depends on the spacing between the buildings last but not least yang et al 2018 studied the tsunami force mitigation of the rear house protected by the front house in a 3d numerical flume and presented a chart of mitigation index taking into account the influencing parameters α relative clear distance between the front and rear houses and β relative bay width of the front house in fact the effect of macroroughness on the wave flow and the induced pressure is inadequately discussed in the previous studies as they neglected some aspects regarding the interaction between the heights of the building and the wave also the macroroughness at the back of the building is yet to be explored continuing in this vein this paper presents an experimental study on the tsunami force estimation for a simplified building model with the presence of macroroughness which represents the surrounding buildings that are either located in front or at the back of the building model the effect of macroroughness on the tsunami flow and induced loading is compared with the baseline condition without any macroroughness at the front and back of the building model 2 wave flume experiment 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 illustrates the setup of the experimental study the hydraulic experiment was conducted in a wave flume of 40 m long with 1 m by 1 m in cross section as shown in fig 1 continuous plane slopes of 1 200 and 1 125 were chosen to represent the typical coast profile in malaysia notably the bed of the shore was assumed to be rigid and without friction as sediment transport was not concerned in this study the 1 4 sloping platform in the flume represented the embankment on the beach the flume consisted of concrete walls at both sides and a rigid bed which was constructed from painted steel plates supported by the structural steel frames the physical model in this study was downscaled with the length scale of 1 100 based on froude number similitude law as the inertial and gravitational forces were dominant in tsunami flow based on the froude number similarity adopted in this study the results presented in the following sections for the length time velocity pressure and force are at the scale of 1 100 1 10 1 10 1 100 and 1 1000000 respectively in the experiment a solitary like wave was generated by a sudden release of the water stored in the tank located at the upstream of the flume with the help of a dam break mechanism prior to the tsunami simulation a still water depth of 470 mm was filled up in the flume representing the offshore region by varying the water volume in the storage tank tsunami simulated waves with the desired flow characteristics were produced upon release of the gate the generated wave was first regulated by a wave baffle assembled from the interlocking plastic structural modules soon when a solitary wave shoaled at the 1 4 sloping platform the wavefront became almost vertical and eventually broke as a plunging type breaker transforming into a bore the turbulent bore then streamed across the wave flume sections and ran up the dry shore in the form of surge striking the building model which was located at the downstream end of the flume at the end the traveling wave overflowed into a sump at the downstream end of the flume three nominal wave conditions were performed in this study actual wave scenario of 4 6 and 8 m nominal heights respectively represent the documented maximum inundation depth of 2004 indian ocean tsunami striking malaysia as well as the possible tsunami wave from the future events with maximum inundation depth similar to 1 5 2 0 times that of the 2004 tsunami here the nominal wave conditon h is defined as the maximum height of the wavefront at the location of the building model h2 during the free flow simulation without building model notably only tsunami runup was simulated whereas the tsunami drawdown was not considered in this study 2 2 building model and macroroughness setup to quantify the effect of the macroroughness elements on tsunami force on the building a 1 100 scaled building model of interest was rigidly installed at the horizontal dry bed section at a horizontal distance of 3225 mm and a vertical height of 25 mm from the shoreline as shown in fig 1 the building model and the macroroughness elements were identical and simplified as rigid rectangular block models made from clear acrylic plates to ensure the rigidity the dimension of each building model was 100 mm by 100 mm in plan view with 66 mm high representing a typical two story building in malaysia five different layouts with macroroughness elements tested in this study are illustrated in fig 2 baseline condition case 1 was first tested and used as reference data for comparison for the rest of the other cases cases 2 and 3 each case was set up with two configurations the seaward at the front of the instrumented model and landward at the back of the instrumented model macroroughness elements were respectively denoted by f and b in total of four setups for both cases for case 2 the number of the seaward or landward macroroughness elements was fixed at two whereas the number of elements is increased by one for case 3 the interval distance between the building models was fixed at 100 mm which was similar to the building model s width as the effect of the interval distance is not studied in the present work each case tested was subjected to the incident waves with nominal heights of 40 60 and 80 mm therefore a total combination of 15 unique experimental sets was conducted in this study table 1 during the tsunami runup process the macroroughness elements were not washed away but remaining stationary throughout the tsunami modelling fig 3 shows the macroroughness layout in the wave flume case 2f 2 3 instrumentation in the experiment the water surface elevation and flow velocity at the offshore h1 and onshore h2 locations were measured by using the capacitance type wave gauges at a sampling rate of 50 hz in order to measure the velocity on land accurately an electromagnetic type current meter was installed at v2 with the half tip of the current meter was soaked in a 10 cm long 10 cm wide and 2 cm deep pit as shown in fig 4 during the free flow condition without building model the water surface elevation of the upstream flow at the location h1 was recorded in order to obtain the correlation with the nominal height and its corresponding peak velocity of the flow at the vicinity of the building model during the wave impingement on the building model the pit was covered and both measurements at h2 and v2 were not recorded to avoid the instruments interference to the wave flow in the vicinity of the building model the values at h2 and v2 were then determined from the previously established correlations with the water surface elevation at h1 in the experiment the pressure measurement with sampling rate of 50 hz was synchronized with the wave gauge to measure the pulsating pressure on the front and back faces of a building model diaphragm type pressure gauges with the diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 3 mm were used to measure the pressure time histories at each point of interest on the instrumented building model the pressure gauges were placed in line from bottom to top at a distance of 18 7 mm along the centerline of the building model s front and back faces as displayed in fig 5 a 5 point moving average method was used to filter the noise of the recorded data the filtered data was checked so that the filtered and unfiltered peak recordings were differed by less than 5 besides the video recorders and cameras were synchronized with the instrumentation to record the wave attacking the building model prior to the tests all the instruments were carefully calibrated more details on the instrumentation can be further obtained in moon et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured time histories of water surface elevation flow velocity horizontal force typical water surface elevation and flow velocity time histories for 60 mm nominal wave condition at the onshore location h2 and v2 without the presence of the building model are shown in fig 6 also plotted in the same graph is the horizontal force fx on the front face of the instrumented building model in the baseline condition the instant when the wave first hits building model is denoted as t 0 s it is notable in fig 6 that the leading edge of the generated tsunami wave has a shallow height but attaining the highest flow velocity the maximum height and the velocity of the wave do not occur concurrently as the wave increases in height the velocity of the corresponding wave presents a tendency of linear decrement and becomes fairly uniform after 2 s as shown in fig 6 it is interesting to note that there is a sudden jump in the water surface elevation at about 2 5 s this is due to the incoming wave which is in the bore form namely the nominal wave with higher height than the surge during the 60 mm nominal wave the wave is found to achieve its peak of around 60 mm at the time of about 3 s after the wave first reaches the location of the building model in the present hydraulic experiment the maximum flow velocity of 1 2 m s 1 7 m s and 2 2 m s are achieved by the flow for the incident 40 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively the three nominal wave conditions tested in this experiment produce bores with froude number fr values that range from 1 to 1 23 here fr is the froude number at the time when the wave achieves its maximum height which equals to u gh 0 5 where g is the gravitational acceleration h and u respectively represent the nominal height and its corresponding velocity of the wave as described by asakura et al 2000 in this study the front slopes of 4 05 4 29 and 4 92 were computed for 40 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively as expected the incident wave with the higher nominal height has the steeper slope of the leading tongue similar nominal wave conditions were reported in a previous paper by lau et al 2015 noted that in this study fx discussed here indicates the horizontal force on the building model s front face calculated from the pressure integration method this method has been used previously by thusyanthan and madabhushi 2008 and shafiei et al 2016 where the building model s front surface in this study is divided horizontally into four strips assuming the pressure to be the same along the strip s height and width as displayed in fig 6 there is a sudden rise in fx following the impingement of the leading tongue on the instrumented model this initial rise in fx namely surge force is due to the change in momentum which causes the wave to splash up a similar phenomenon also has been pointed out by ramsden 1996 and nouri et al 2010 a slight drop in force is observed in a short period as a result of the wave is reflected due to being blocked by the building model the reflected wave then interferes with the incoming wave at the front vicinity of the building model when the water surface elevation increases gradually with time the load on the building model also increases until it reaches the maximum value which occurs at the instant when nominal height is finally achieved by the incident wave at the moment the flow velocity is yet to decline to an insignificant value thus the maximum fx occurs during a high water surface elevation together with a high velocity head where the momentum flux is the greatest at this time domain after the nominal height is attained the force acting on the structure decreases gradually until it reaches quasi steady state at this time domain the fx remains relatively significant as the hydrostatic force is dominant 3 2 wave attack on building model fig 7 illustrates the sequence of the simulated wave h 60 mm attacking the building models notably the nominal wave in the 60 mm nominal wave condition is almost as high as the model s height in the baseline condition as displayed in fig 7 a as the leading edge with a relatively small depth but high velocity approaches the instrumented building model marked as dotted lines the obstructed wave quickly rises upward along the face of the building model the remaining wave divides sideway and flows around the building model soon the wave which piles up in height eventually collapses downward causing a certain amount of water to fall on the top of the building model at the back of the building model the accumulation of water is low as the inundation depth climbs up faintly slower since the wave takes time to flow around the building model except for some overtopping waves fall at the back of the building model the building model is then hit by the incoming wave of around 60 mm high which causes the highest horizontal force on the building model and submerged completely underwater until the wave is in the quasi steady state as for the cases with the seaward macroroughness elements fig 7 b and 7 d the leading edge first strikes the seaward macroroughness elements and flows in between and around the elements the wave subsequently hits the front face of the building model after 0 16 s and 0 2 s for cases 2f and 3f respectively as depicted in fig 7 d the seaward macroroughness in case 3f acts as shielding structure to block the leading edge of wave from directly hitting the instrumented model as the seaward macroroughness is located just in front of the instrumented model at this moment the inundation depth in front of the seaward elements remains high while the inundation depth is lower at the front of the instrumented model however when the incoming wave with a nominal height of 60 mm gushes over the seaward macroroughness elements the elements cause the wave to ascend with a residual velocity and eventually striking the top part of the instrumented model this phenomenon is in agreement with the work done by revanth et al 2016 on the contrary the shielding effect exhibited by the macroroughness elements in case 2f is less significant as the leading edge is still able to hit the instrumented model directly together with the deflected wave in virtue of the wave divides sideway after hitting the seaward macroroughness elements nevertheless there is less overtopping wave fig 7 b as compared to the baseline condition because the flow velocity might be affected when the wave passes through the interval between two elements as described by simamora et al 2007 consequently the accumulation of water at the back of the building model at the initial stage is lower than that in the baseline case therefore the effectiveness of the seaward macroroughness elements as sheltering structures to reduce the water surface elevation and flow velocity is dependent on the direction of wave flow and the position of the elements as shown in fig 7 c and 6 e similar wave attack on the building model is observed as compared to case 1 except there is a difference in the inundation depth at the back of the instrumented building model the inundation depth simultaneously increases at the back of the building model and the level is much higher than that in the baseline condition this is due to the landward macroroughness elements block the flow and deflect the wave back to the building model thus when the wave gushes over the building model the water in between the building model and landward elements is accumulated for both cases 2b and 3b more photos regarding the wave attack on the building model subjected to 40 mm nominal wave condition can be obtained from the earlier paper by moon et al 2015 3 3 pressure time histories on building model figs 8 and 9 display the representative recorded pressure time histories of all cases for 40 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively the overtopping effect occurred on the macroroughness elements is exhibited by the 80 mm nominal wave condition overtopping case whereas the incident wave with a nominal height of 40 mm just slightly overtops the macroroughess elements which is considered as the non overtopping case in this study these two nominal wave conditions show different flow characteristics causing the different nature of wave attack on the building model as it depends largely on the relationship between the heights of the building model and the nominal wave the pressure values shown in figs 8 and 9 are the normalized pressures where each recorded pressure p at the point of interest is normalized by the hydrostatic pressure ρgh for all cases tested in this study the maximum pressure occurs at the bottommost of the front face of the building model therefore the pressures acting on the bottom of the building model s front face p1 and p2 and back face p5 and p6 are discussed here in the baseline condition as presented in fig 8 a and 9 a the moment at the occurrence of maximum pressure approximately two times the hydrostatic pressure almost coincides with the instant when the nominal height of the wave at quasi steady state is achieved by the flow for both non overtopping and overtopping cases after achieving the peak the pressure time histories at the front face of the building model behave a decreasing trend followed by a long section of quasi static state at around 22 s as for the back face pressures p5 and p6 the maximum pressure for the non overtopping case 40 mm nominal wave condition is slightly slower than the hydrostatic pressure occurring when the wave is in the quasi steady state conversely the peak of around 1 2 times the hydrostatic pressure comes early in the record with the incoming wave with a nominal height of 80 mm for the overtopping case this is due to the overtopped wave falls at the back of the building model leading to a massive wave impact with a combination of gravitational force 3 3 1 effect of seaward macroroughness elements the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements on tsunami loads exerted on the building model s front face is dependent on the configuration of elements fig 8 a and 9 a for case 2f a noticeable increase in front face pressure is found upon the impingement of wave on the building model it is mentioned in the earlier section that the first peak is not only caused by the leading edge but also due to water deflected and splashed from the seaward macroroughness elements however the second peak which is induced by the nominal incoming wave is still higher than the first peak for 40 mm nominal wave condition fig 8 a and 8 b as displayed in fig 8 a the maximum front face pressure in case 2f slightly reduces relative to the baseline as the nominal wave condition increases from 40 mm to 80 mm the first peak overshoots the second peak induced by the nominal wave causing the maximum front face pressure to be higher than that in the baseline condition as comparing the force amplification factor suggested by thomas et al 2014 a wake clearance angle of 14 for the macroroughness configuration in our study results in an amplification factor of 0 95 which is in a good agreement with our experimental results only for 40 mm nominal wave condition therefore the relationship proposed by thomas and his co researchers is only valid for the non overtopping case for case 3f the maximum wave pressure exerted on the building model s front face with the presence of seaward macroroughness elements is found to be substantially lessened relative to the baseline for the non overtopping case as shown in fig 8 a and 8 b this is because that the seaward macroroughness elements in case 3f play an important role as shielding structures to prevent the wave from directly impacting the building model for the overtopping case as shown in fig 9 a although the magnitude of the maximum front face pressure is almost identical as that in the baseline condition the presence of the seaward elements in case 3f still has the advantage to reduce the wave pressure at the initial impact and later stage the initial peak in the pressure time histories seems to be eliminated as the leading edge is blocked by the shielding structure as displayed in fig 9 a and 9 b there is a perceptible peak which is the maximum pressure arriving at the instant slightly later than the baseline case after the peak the pressure time histories drop off gently and the trends are identical for all cases after a considerable amount of time apart from the front face pressure the back face pressure acting on the building model is also affected by the presence of seaward macroroughness especially when the wave is overtopping the elements for the overtopping case tested in this study the magnitude of the maximum back face pressure is reduced to approximately 0 8 times the hydrostatic pressure which occurs at the later stage instead of the early stage fig 9 c for the non overtopping case as illustrated in fig 8 c the seaward macroroughness elements in cases 2f and 3f do not contribute much to reduce the maximum back face pressure due to maximum pressure occurs at the later stage when the wave is in the quasi steady state however a reduction in pressure is found at around 3 s because of the seaward macroroughness elements reduce the wave overtopping the building model simultaneously reducing the tsunami impact at the back of the building model with the presence of seaward macroroughness elements the back face pressures in cases 2f and 3f pick up earlier as compared to the baseline condition this is related to the propagation velocity of the wave which is reduced by the seaward elements causing the inundation of tsunami wave builds up faster at the back of the building model 3 3 2 comparison of front face force with previous study the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements on tsunami loads exerted on the building model s front face has been demonstrated by the previous study of thomas et al 2014 and yang et al 2018 however their findings are based on the non overtopping wave condition in this section the experimental results in the present study for overtopping and non overtopping cases are compared with the findings of thomas et al 2014 and yang et al 2018 for the cases of 2f and 3f respectively for case 2f thomas et al 2014 developed a wake clearance angle to correlate the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements to the tsunami force on a building model in the present study the configuration of the macroroughness in case 2f corresponds to a wake clearance angle of approximately 14 by using the proposed force amplification factor by thomas et al 2014 the computed fx is compared with the measured maximum fx in this study as presented in fig 10 a based on fig 10 a the computed fx is in a good agreement with the measured fx for 40 mm nominal wave condition however for the wave overtopping case h 60 and 80 mm the computed fx underestimates the measured data in this study this is due to the presence of the seaward macroroughness elements demonstrates an increased force on the building model for a higher nominal wave condition with the wave overtopping case on the other hand for case 3f yang et al 2018 proposed a mitigation index based on the influencing parameters α and β as the width and interval distance between the building model is set to 100 mm the value of 1 is computed for α and β by using the proposed mitigation index by yang et al 2018 the computed fx is compared with the measured maximum fx in this study as presented in fig 10 b as shown in fig 10 b the computed fx much underestimates the measured fx especially for the wave overtopping case 3 3 3 effect of landward macroroughness elements the presence of the landward macroroughness elements in cases 2b and 3b do not have any effect on the front face pressure as the landward macroroughness elements only affect the back face pressure acting on the building model as shown in fig 8 c and 9 c one can observe that the landward elements cause the back face pressures to rise extremely at the initial stage until it reaches the maximum value at the instant which almost coincides with the time when the wave achieves its nominal height as mentioned previously the inundation depth at the back of the building model increases due to the accumulation of the water in between the building model and the landward elements in addition a wake is formed by the flow in between the elements which may induce an impact on the building model as shown in fig 8 c and 8 d both cases 2b and 3b have the similar trend of pressure time histories but the maximum pressures are not of the same magnitude for both cases it is visible in the figures that the effect of the landward macroroughness configuration in case 2b is more pronounced in increasing the tsunami impact at the back of the building model for the non overtopping case this may be attributed to the different characteristics of the wake formed due to the arrangement of landward macroroughness elements in case 2b causing more water to divert towards the back face of the building model however for the overtopping case fig 9 c and 9 d both cases 2b and 3b are having almost the same pressure values throughout the whole pressure time histories regardless the configuration of the landward macroroughness elements after attaining the peak the pressure in both cases 2b and 3b falls off gradually and remains relatively unchanged with the baseline condition when the wave is in the quasi steady state after 15 and 20 s for the non overtopping and overtopping cases respectively 3 4 variation in maximum pressure figs 11 and 12 respectively depict the variation of the average maximum normalized pressure exerted on the building model s front and back faces for each case plot against that in the baseline condition for case 2f as shown in fig 11 a the maximum front face pressure slightly decreases with a percentage reduction of 12 as compared to the baseline condition for 40 mm nominal wave condition when the incident wave has higher nominal height no reduction in maximum front face pressure is observed as the deflected wave from the seaward macroroughness elements comes together with the incoming wave hit the building model s front face as mentioned earlier for 60 mm nominal wave condition the magnitude of pressure becomes almost the same as that in the baseline condition whereas the pressure increases by 13 relative to the baseline for 80 mm nominal wave condition the pressure reduction due to seaward macroroughness elements is more apparent in case 3f where the reduction ratio is getting higher for the pressure at a higher location for the non overtopping case with 40 mm nominal wave almost similar to the findings by tomiczek et al 2016 the maximum front face pressure overall reduces by approximately 38 relative to the baseline for 40 mm nominal wave condition for the 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions it is interesting to notable in fig 11 b that the pressures at the topmost level p4 in both nominal wave conditions exhibit insignificant discrepancies relative to the baseline this can be explained that the seaward macroroughness elements are being overtopped by the wave with nominal heights of 60 and 80 mm after the splashed up wave collapses downward and falls freely on top of the elements the wave with a high velocity residual is then splashed on the top part of the building model which is located directly at the back of the seaward elements for both 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions the maximum front face pressures are reduced as much as 15 as compared to the baseline on the other hand as discussed in the earlier section the seaward macroroughness elements also significantly reduces the maximum back face pressure for the overtopping case with a nominal wave of 80 mm for both cases 2f and 3f as respectively presented in fig 12 a and 11 b a great decrease in the back face pressure of around 30 relative to baseline is caused by the seaward macroroughness elements with the presence of the landward macroroughness elements the maximum back face pressures substantially increase for all three nominal wave conditions tested in this study for 40 mm nominal wave condition there is no much variation in the topmost back face pressure p8 for both cases 2b and 3b as compared to the baseline condition fig 12 c and 12 d this is because that the pressure value is relatively small and insignificant at the top of the building model s back face when subjected to a low nominal wave as comparing fig 12 c and 12 d the different arrangement of landward macroroughness elements will have a slight difference in the effect on the maximum wave pressure impacting the back face of the building model as shown in fig 12 c the maximum back face pressure in case 2b overall raises up to 68 relative to the baseline for the incident wave with a nominal wave of 60 mm followed by a percentage increase of 45 and 27 for 40 and 80 mm nominal wave condition respectively for case 3b the back face pressure increases by 24 61 and 31 relative to the baseline for 40 60 and 80 nominal wave conditions respectively fig 12 d 4 conclusions in this study hydraulic experiments have been conducted to study the effect of the seaward and landward macroroughness in several configurations on the wave induced loadings on a building subjected to a tsunami wave the experimental results indicate that the seaward macroroughness has a substantial effect on the front as well as back face pressures whereas landward macroroughness mainly increases the back face pressure the nature of the wave attack on building model also depends on the relationship between the heights of the building model and the nominal wave based on the present study the following findings were obtained a with two configurations of seaward macroroughness tested in this study the sheltering effect is most pronounced in case 3f which substantially reduces the maximum front face pressure by 38 relative to baseline for the non overtopping case as the nominal wave height increases the percentage reduction reduces to 15 for case 2f the sheltering effect is dependent on the incoming wave where the maximum front face pressure even increases by 13 relative to baseline during the 80 mm nominal wave due to the leading edge of wave together with the deflected wave attacking the building model b the effect of the seaward macroroughness in reducing the back face pressure is also demonstrated especially for 80 mm nominal wave condition the maximum back face pressure is about 70 of the baseline due to less incoming waves overtop the building model as the seaward macroroughness reduces the water surface elevation and flow velocity in the vicinity of the building model c with the presence of the landward macroroughness the water accumulates in between the elements and the building model and subsequently inducing a higher pressure at the back face of the building model which exceeds the baseline value by 24 68 for both cases 2b and 3b in conclusion the macroroughness influences the tsunami flow and loads in the inundation zone it is notable that the effect of the interval distance between the building models is not in our consideration in the present study therefore the findings from this study are limited to the interval distance which is similar to the building model s width in future this work should be continued under a wider flume at larger scales and more data should be acquired to further improve the current findings acknowledgements the experimental facilities were supported by the ministry of science technology and innovation mosti malaysia through sciencefund

22699,this study presented an experimental investigation of tsunami forces on a shielded building by the nearby buildings termed macroroughness three nominal wave conditions with non overtopping and overtopping cases were tested to study its effects in combination with each macroroughness setup in a 1 100 scaled experiment the tsunami induced loadings at the building model s front and back faces were measured and compared with the baseline no macroroughenss case the experimental results showed that the seaward macroroughness had a significant effect on the front and back face pressures sheltering effect by the seaward macroroughness was the greatest during a low nominal wave showing a reduction in maximum front face pressure up to 38 relative to the baseline however the sheltering effect was dependent on the seaward macroroughness setup for the case where the seaward macroroughness is not located directly in front of the building model the maximum front face pressure even exceeded the baseline value by about 13 during the overtopping case the seaward macroroughness was also effective in reducing the maximum back face pressure approximately 30 for the overtopping case regardless the macroroughness setup with the presence of the landward macroroughness the maximum back face pressure increased relative to the baseline keywords tsunami building macroroughness wave pressure 1 introduction tsunamis have received increased worldwide awareness since the occurrence of a tsunami on 26th december 2004 in consequence of a giant earthquake hit the west coast of sumatra as reported by rossetto et al 2007 12 countries in the indian ocean have suffered various extents of structural damage and loss of millions of lives in this devastating disaster another recent major tsunami is the 2011 tohoku tsunami which has affected almost all the northeast coast of japan causing around 20000 fatalities lekkas et al 2011 tsunamis have damaged the engineered reinforced concrete and steel buildings and non engineered buildings wooden buildings to different extents complete destruction has been observed for those non engineered buildings whereas the engineered structures behaved better when subjected to tsunami wave force yet there are major and minor damages to the engineered buildings the common tsunami induced building failure mechanisms include the out of plan failure of wall tilting by scouring or collapse overturning and large residual deformation chock et al 2013 these two devastating events have prompted extensive research from all over the world on the determination of tsunami loads on structures such as buildings bridges and walls due to the complexity of wave propagation associated with the shore situation physical modelling has been adopted to investigate the tsunami induced forces on coastal as well as onshore structures hitherto tsunami modelling has remained a fastidious concern among the researchers among the structures of major concern in tsunami modelling onshore building has been investigated extensively by numerous researchers such as asakura et al 2000 lukkunaprasit et al 2008 wilson et al 2009 manawasekara et al 2016 foster et al 2017 and others over the past decades a great deal of efforts has been dedicated to a single model experiment in fact the effect of nearby obstacles must be taken into the consideration when determining the tsunami loads on a building according to thomas et al 2014 the obstacles termed macroroughness can be in the form of shore protection structures or buildings which affect the tsunami flow as it travels across the inundation zone the interaction of bores with macroroughness is an important engineering problem in the evaluation of the tsunami flows and loads on structures camfied 1994 arnason et al 2009 as observed by dalrymple and kriebel 2005 the damage induced by the 2004 tsunami was greater for those infrastructure located directly behind the openings in coastal seawalls in phuket thailand conversely a group of wooden houses in yuriage japan located behind a reinforced concrete apartment house had a minor damage during the 2011 tsunami nilim and bri 2011 several findings have also revealed that the tsunami wave flow is significantly altered by the seawall and building rahman et al 2014 arimitsu et al 2016 tomiczek et al 2017 umeda et al 2018 however there is no consideration of the effect of macroroughness elements in most of the guidelines of designing tsunami resistant structures dames and moore 1980 cch 2000 icc 2009 fema p646 2012 in 2012 japanese design method by national institute for land and infrastructure management 2012 has proposed the value of water depth coefficient a in consideration of a shelter in the inundation zone therefore it is essential to understand the influence of nearby macroroughness for the safe and economic design of buildings to withstand tsunamis currently few studies on tsunami force with the presence of macroroughness have been conducted to investigate the fundamental relationship between the structure and the nearby macroroughness simamora et al 2007 conducted a series of hydraulic experiments to study the relationship between the multiple structures houses and seawall and tsunami wave force the force reduction on the inland building fronted by building or seawall has been demonstrated through their study especially when the interval between the two buildings located in front of the inland building is small results in decreasing the inundation depth and velocity also the distance of building from the shorelines has a significant effect on the reduction of tsunami force similar series of experiments have been re simulated numerically by nakamura et al 2011 in 2011 bridges et al 2011 also simulated eight different setups of macroroughness in term of the spacing of elements and the distance between the elements and instrumented specimen notably the simulated wave conditions in their study did not overtop the macroroughness elements results revealed that the maximum force occurred at a greater distance from the specimen as the spacing between the elements increased from the work done by thomas et al 2014 multiple symmetric configurations of two macroroughness elements were placed systematically in front of the specimen and a new measure so called the wake clearance angle was developed to determine the amplification factor on the tsunami forces regardless the distance between the macroroughness elements and also the distance between the macroroughness elements and the specimen of interest the force increased approximately 40 relative to the baseline no macroroughness case at the worst wake angle of 20 35 besides the effect of obstruction in the path of the incoming wave was studied by revanth et al 2016 compound wall with height same as the wave height was simulated as macroroughness in their study the compound wall was found to cause the wave to rise with a residual velocity subsequently hitting the top part of the inland structure causing the structure to deflect at the top and collapse another recent study was demonstrated by tomiczek et al 2016 where the direct shielding by shoreward structures can significantly lessen the effects of incoming waves with a peak pressure reduction of 40 70 depends on the spacing between the buildings last but not least yang et al 2018 studied the tsunami force mitigation of the rear house protected by the front house in a 3d numerical flume and presented a chart of mitigation index taking into account the influencing parameters α relative clear distance between the front and rear houses and β relative bay width of the front house in fact the effect of macroroughness on the wave flow and the induced pressure is inadequately discussed in the previous studies as they neglected some aspects regarding the interaction between the heights of the building and the wave also the macroroughness at the back of the building is yet to be explored continuing in this vein this paper presents an experimental study on the tsunami force estimation for a simplified building model with the presence of macroroughness which represents the surrounding buildings that are either located in front or at the back of the building model the effect of macroroughness on the tsunami flow and induced loading is compared with the baseline condition without any macroroughness at the front and back of the building model 2 wave flume experiment 2 1 experimental setup fig 1 illustrates the setup of the experimental study the hydraulic experiment was conducted in a wave flume of 40 m long with 1 m by 1 m in cross section as shown in fig 1 continuous plane slopes of 1 200 and 1 125 were chosen to represent the typical coast profile in malaysia notably the bed of the shore was assumed to be rigid and without friction as sediment transport was not concerned in this study the 1 4 sloping platform in the flume represented the embankment on the beach the flume consisted of concrete walls at both sides and a rigid bed which was constructed from painted steel plates supported by the structural steel frames the physical model in this study was downscaled with the length scale of 1 100 based on froude number similitude law as the inertial and gravitational forces were dominant in tsunami flow based on the froude number similarity adopted in this study the results presented in the following sections for the length time velocity pressure and force are at the scale of 1 100 1 10 1 10 1 100 and 1 1000000 respectively in the experiment a solitary like wave was generated by a sudden release of the water stored in the tank located at the upstream of the flume with the help of a dam break mechanism prior to the tsunami simulation a still water depth of 470 mm was filled up in the flume representing the offshore region by varying the water volume in the storage tank tsunami simulated waves with the desired flow characteristics were produced upon release of the gate the generated wave was first regulated by a wave baffle assembled from the interlocking plastic structural modules soon when a solitary wave shoaled at the 1 4 sloping platform the wavefront became almost vertical and eventually broke as a plunging type breaker transforming into a bore the turbulent bore then streamed across the wave flume sections and ran up the dry shore in the form of surge striking the building model which was located at the downstream end of the flume at the end the traveling wave overflowed into a sump at the downstream end of the flume three nominal wave conditions were performed in this study actual wave scenario of 4 6 and 8 m nominal heights respectively represent the documented maximum inundation depth of 2004 indian ocean tsunami striking malaysia as well as the possible tsunami wave from the future events with maximum inundation depth similar to 1 5 2 0 times that of the 2004 tsunami here the nominal wave conditon h is defined as the maximum height of the wavefront at the location of the building model h2 during the free flow simulation without building model notably only tsunami runup was simulated whereas the tsunami drawdown was not considered in this study 2 2 building model and macroroughness setup to quantify the effect of the macroroughness elements on tsunami force on the building a 1 100 scaled building model of interest was rigidly installed at the horizontal dry bed section at a horizontal distance of 3225 mm and a vertical height of 25 mm from the shoreline as shown in fig 1 the building model and the macroroughness elements were identical and simplified as rigid rectangular block models made from clear acrylic plates to ensure the rigidity the dimension of each building model was 100 mm by 100 mm in plan view with 66 mm high representing a typical two story building in malaysia five different layouts with macroroughness elements tested in this study are illustrated in fig 2 baseline condition case 1 was first tested and used as reference data for comparison for the rest of the other cases cases 2 and 3 each case was set up with two configurations the seaward at the front of the instrumented model and landward at the back of the instrumented model macroroughness elements were respectively denoted by f and b in total of four setups for both cases for case 2 the number of the seaward or landward macroroughness elements was fixed at two whereas the number of elements is increased by one for case 3 the interval distance between the building models was fixed at 100 mm which was similar to the building model s width as the effect of the interval distance is not studied in the present work each case tested was subjected to the incident waves with nominal heights of 40 60 and 80 mm therefore a total combination of 15 unique experimental sets was conducted in this study table 1 during the tsunami runup process the macroroughness elements were not washed away but remaining stationary throughout the tsunami modelling fig 3 shows the macroroughness layout in the wave flume case 2f 2 3 instrumentation in the experiment the water surface elevation and flow velocity at the offshore h1 and onshore h2 locations were measured by using the capacitance type wave gauges at a sampling rate of 50 hz in order to measure the velocity on land accurately an electromagnetic type current meter was installed at v2 with the half tip of the current meter was soaked in a 10 cm long 10 cm wide and 2 cm deep pit as shown in fig 4 during the free flow condition without building model the water surface elevation of the upstream flow at the location h1 was recorded in order to obtain the correlation with the nominal height and its corresponding peak velocity of the flow at the vicinity of the building model during the wave impingement on the building model the pit was covered and both measurements at h2 and v2 were not recorded to avoid the instruments interference to the wave flow in the vicinity of the building model the values at h2 and v2 were then determined from the previously established correlations with the water surface elevation at h1 in the experiment the pressure measurement with sampling rate of 50 hz was synchronized with the wave gauge to measure the pulsating pressure on the front and back faces of a building model diaphragm type pressure gauges with the diameter of 10 mm and thickness of 3 mm were used to measure the pressure time histories at each point of interest on the instrumented building model the pressure gauges were placed in line from bottom to top at a distance of 18 7 mm along the centerline of the building model s front and back faces as displayed in fig 5 a 5 point moving average method was used to filter the noise of the recorded data the filtered data was checked so that the filtered and unfiltered peak recordings were differed by less than 5 besides the video recorders and cameras were synchronized with the instrumentation to record the wave attacking the building model prior to the tests all the instruments were carefully calibrated more details on the instrumentation can be further obtained in moon et al 2014 3 results and discussion 3 1 measured time histories of water surface elevation flow velocity horizontal force typical water surface elevation and flow velocity time histories for 60 mm nominal wave condition at the onshore location h2 and v2 without the presence of the building model are shown in fig 6 also plotted in the same graph is the horizontal force fx on the front face of the instrumented building model in the baseline condition the instant when the wave first hits building model is denoted as t 0 s it is notable in fig 6 that the leading edge of the generated tsunami wave has a shallow height but attaining the highest flow velocity the maximum height and the velocity of the wave do not occur concurrently as the wave increases in height the velocity of the corresponding wave presents a tendency of linear decrement and becomes fairly uniform after 2 s as shown in fig 6 it is interesting to note that there is a sudden jump in the water surface elevation at about 2 5 s this is due to the incoming wave which is in the bore form namely the nominal wave with higher height than the surge during the 60 mm nominal wave the wave is found to achieve its peak of around 60 mm at the time of about 3 s after the wave first reaches the location of the building model in the present hydraulic experiment the maximum flow velocity of 1 2 m s 1 7 m s and 2 2 m s are achieved by the flow for the incident 40 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively the three nominal wave conditions tested in this experiment produce bores with froude number fr values that range from 1 to 1 23 here fr is the froude number at the time when the wave achieves its maximum height which equals to u gh 0 5 where g is the gravitational acceleration h and u respectively represent the nominal height and its corresponding velocity of the wave as described by asakura et al 2000 in this study the front slopes of 4 05 4 29 and 4 92 were computed for 40 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively as expected the incident wave with the higher nominal height has the steeper slope of the leading tongue similar nominal wave conditions were reported in a previous paper by lau et al 2015 noted that in this study fx discussed here indicates the horizontal force on the building model s front face calculated from the pressure integration method this method has been used previously by thusyanthan and madabhushi 2008 and shafiei et al 2016 where the building model s front surface in this study is divided horizontally into four strips assuming the pressure to be the same along the strip s height and width as displayed in fig 6 there is a sudden rise in fx following the impingement of the leading tongue on the instrumented model this initial rise in fx namely surge force is due to the change in momentum which causes the wave to splash up a similar phenomenon also has been pointed out by ramsden 1996 and nouri et al 2010 a slight drop in force is observed in a short period as a result of the wave is reflected due to being blocked by the building model the reflected wave then interferes with the incoming wave at the front vicinity of the building model when the water surface elevation increases gradually with time the load on the building model also increases until it reaches the maximum value which occurs at the instant when nominal height is finally achieved by the incident wave at the moment the flow velocity is yet to decline to an insignificant value thus the maximum fx occurs during a high water surface elevation together with a high velocity head where the momentum flux is the greatest at this time domain after the nominal height is attained the force acting on the structure decreases gradually until it reaches quasi steady state at this time domain the fx remains relatively significant as the hydrostatic force is dominant 3 2 wave attack on building model fig 7 illustrates the sequence of the simulated wave h 60 mm attacking the building models notably the nominal wave in the 60 mm nominal wave condition is almost as high as the model s height in the baseline condition as displayed in fig 7 a as the leading edge with a relatively small depth but high velocity approaches the instrumented building model marked as dotted lines the obstructed wave quickly rises upward along the face of the building model the remaining wave divides sideway and flows around the building model soon the wave which piles up in height eventually collapses downward causing a certain amount of water to fall on the top of the building model at the back of the building model the accumulation of water is low as the inundation depth climbs up faintly slower since the wave takes time to flow around the building model except for some overtopping waves fall at the back of the building model the building model is then hit by the incoming wave of around 60 mm high which causes the highest horizontal force on the building model and submerged completely underwater until the wave is in the quasi steady state as for the cases with the seaward macroroughness elements fig 7 b and 7 d the leading edge first strikes the seaward macroroughness elements and flows in between and around the elements the wave subsequently hits the front face of the building model after 0 16 s and 0 2 s for cases 2f and 3f respectively as depicted in fig 7 d the seaward macroroughness in case 3f acts as shielding structure to block the leading edge of wave from directly hitting the instrumented model as the seaward macroroughness is located just in front of the instrumented model at this moment the inundation depth in front of the seaward elements remains high while the inundation depth is lower at the front of the instrumented model however when the incoming wave with a nominal height of 60 mm gushes over the seaward macroroughness elements the elements cause the wave to ascend with a residual velocity and eventually striking the top part of the instrumented model this phenomenon is in agreement with the work done by revanth et al 2016 on the contrary the shielding effect exhibited by the macroroughness elements in case 2f is less significant as the leading edge is still able to hit the instrumented model directly together with the deflected wave in virtue of the wave divides sideway after hitting the seaward macroroughness elements nevertheless there is less overtopping wave fig 7 b as compared to the baseline condition because the flow velocity might be affected when the wave passes through the interval between two elements as described by simamora et al 2007 consequently the accumulation of water at the back of the building model at the initial stage is lower than that in the baseline case therefore the effectiveness of the seaward macroroughness elements as sheltering structures to reduce the water surface elevation and flow velocity is dependent on the direction of wave flow and the position of the elements as shown in fig 7 c and 6 e similar wave attack on the building model is observed as compared to case 1 except there is a difference in the inundation depth at the back of the instrumented building model the inundation depth simultaneously increases at the back of the building model and the level is much higher than that in the baseline condition this is due to the landward macroroughness elements block the flow and deflect the wave back to the building model thus when the wave gushes over the building model the water in between the building model and landward elements is accumulated for both cases 2b and 3b more photos regarding the wave attack on the building model subjected to 40 mm nominal wave condition can be obtained from the earlier paper by moon et al 2015 3 3 pressure time histories on building model figs 8 and 9 display the representative recorded pressure time histories of all cases for 40 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions respectively the overtopping effect occurred on the macroroughness elements is exhibited by the 80 mm nominal wave condition overtopping case whereas the incident wave with a nominal height of 40 mm just slightly overtops the macroroughess elements which is considered as the non overtopping case in this study these two nominal wave conditions show different flow characteristics causing the different nature of wave attack on the building model as it depends largely on the relationship between the heights of the building model and the nominal wave the pressure values shown in figs 8 and 9 are the normalized pressures where each recorded pressure p at the point of interest is normalized by the hydrostatic pressure ρgh for all cases tested in this study the maximum pressure occurs at the bottommost of the front face of the building model therefore the pressures acting on the bottom of the building model s front face p1 and p2 and back face p5 and p6 are discussed here in the baseline condition as presented in fig 8 a and 9 a the moment at the occurrence of maximum pressure approximately two times the hydrostatic pressure almost coincides with the instant when the nominal height of the wave at quasi steady state is achieved by the flow for both non overtopping and overtopping cases after achieving the peak the pressure time histories at the front face of the building model behave a decreasing trend followed by a long section of quasi static state at around 22 s as for the back face pressures p5 and p6 the maximum pressure for the non overtopping case 40 mm nominal wave condition is slightly slower than the hydrostatic pressure occurring when the wave is in the quasi steady state conversely the peak of around 1 2 times the hydrostatic pressure comes early in the record with the incoming wave with a nominal height of 80 mm for the overtopping case this is due to the overtopped wave falls at the back of the building model leading to a massive wave impact with a combination of gravitational force 3 3 1 effect of seaward macroroughness elements the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements on tsunami loads exerted on the building model s front face is dependent on the configuration of elements fig 8 a and 9 a for case 2f a noticeable increase in front face pressure is found upon the impingement of wave on the building model it is mentioned in the earlier section that the first peak is not only caused by the leading edge but also due to water deflected and splashed from the seaward macroroughness elements however the second peak which is induced by the nominal incoming wave is still higher than the first peak for 40 mm nominal wave condition fig 8 a and 8 b as displayed in fig 8 a the maximum front face pressure in case 2f slightly reduces relative to the baseline as the nominal wave condition increases from 40 mm to 80 mm the first peak overshoots the second peak induced by the nominal wave causing the maximum front face pressure to be higher than that in the baseline condition as comparing the force amplification factor suggested by thomas et al 2014 a wake clearance angle of 14 for the macroroughness configuration in our study results in an amplification factor of 0 95 which is in a good agreement with our experimental results only for 40 mm nominal wave condition therefore the relationship proposed by thomas and his co researchers is only valid for the non overtopping case for case 3f the maximum wave pressure exerted on the building model s front face with the presence of seaward macroroughness elements is found to be substantially lessened relative to the baseline for the non overtopping case as shown in fig 8 a and 8 b this is because that the seaward macroroughness elements in case 3f play an important role as shielding structures to prevent the wave from directly impacting the building model for the overtopping case as shown in fig 9 a although the magnitude of the maximum front face pressure is almost identical as that in the baseline condition the presence of the seaward elements in case 3f still has the advantage to reduce the wave pressure at the initial impact and later stage the initial peak in the pressure time histories seems to be eliminated as the leading edge is blocked by the shielding structure as displayed in fig 9 a and 9 b there is a perceptible peak which is the maximum pressure arriving at the instant slightly later than the baseline case after the peak the pressure time histories drop off gently and the trends are identical for all cases after a considerable amount of time apart from the front face pressure the back face pressure acting on the building model is also affected by the presence of seaward macroroughness especially when the wave is overtopping the elements for the overtopping case tested in this study the magnitude of the maximum back face pressure is reduced to approximately 0 8 times the hydrostatic pressure which occurs at the later stage instead of the early stage fig 9 c for the non overtopping case as illustrated in fig 8 c the seaward macroroughness elements in cases 2f and 3f do not contribute much to reduce the maximum back face pressure due to maximum pressure occurs at the later stage when the wave is in the quasi steady state however a reduction in pressure is found at around 3 s because of the seaward macroroughness elements reduce the wave overtopping the building model simultaneously reducing the tsunami impact at the back of the building model with the presence of seaward macroroughness elements the back face pressures in cases 2f and 3f pick up earlier as compared to the baseline condition this is related to the propagation velocity of the wave which is reduced by the seaward elements causing the inundation of tsunami wave builds up faster at the back of the building model 3 3 2 comparison of front face force with previous study the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements on tsunami loads exerted on the building model s front face has been demonstrated by the previous study of thomas et al 2014 and yang et al 2018 however their findings are based on the non overtopping wave condition in this section the experimental results in the present study for overtopping and non overtopping cases are compared with the findings of thomas et al 2014 and yang et al 2018 for the cases of 2f and 3f respectively for case 2f thomas et al 2014 developed a wake clearance angle to correlate the effect of the seaward macroroughness elements to the tsunami force on a building model in the present study the configuration of the macroroughness in case 2f corresponds to a wake clearance angle of approximately 14 by using the proposed force amplification factor by thomas et al 2014 the computed fx is compared with the measured maximum fx in this study as presented in fig 10 a based on fig 10 a the computed fx is in a good agreement with the measured fx for 40 mm nominal wave condition however for the wave overtopping case h 60 and 80 mm the computed fx underestimates the measured data in this study this is due to the presence of the seaward macroroughness elements demonstrates an increased force on the building model for a higher nominal wave condition with the wave overtopping case on the other hand for case 3f yang et al 2018 proposed a mitigation index based on the influencing parameters α and β as the width and interval distance between the building model is set to 100 mm the value of 1 is computed for α and β by using the proposed mitigation index by yang et al 2018 the computed fx is compared with the measured maximum fx in this study as presented in fig 10 b as shown in fig 10 b the computed fx much underestimates the measured fx especially for the wave overtopping case 3 3 3 effect of landward macroroughness elements the presence of the landward macroroughness elements in cases 2b and 3b do not have any effect on the front face pressure as the landward macroroughness elements only affect the back face pressure acting on the building model as shown in fig 8 c and 9 c one can observe that the landward elements cause the back face pressures to rise extremely at the initial stage until it reaches the maximum value at the instant which almost coincides with the time when the wave achieves its nominal height as mentioned previously the inundation depth at the back of the building model increases due to the accumulation of the water in between the building model and the landward elements in addition a wake is formed by the flow in between the elements which may induce an impact on the building model as shown in fig 8 c and 8 d both cases 2b and 3b have the similar trend of pressure time histories but the maximum pressures are not of the same magnitude for both cases it is visible in the figures that the effect of the landward macroroughness configuration in case 2b is more pronounced in increasing the tsunami impact at the back of the building model for the non overtopping case this may be attributed to the different characteristics of the wake formed due to the arrangement of landward macroroughness elements in case 2b causing more water to divert towards the back face of the building model however for the overtopping case fig 9 c and 9 d both cases 2b and 3b are having almost the same pressure values throughout the whole pressure time histories regardless the configuration of the landward macroroughness elements after attaining the peak the pressure in both cases 2b and 3b falls off gradually and remains relatively unchanged with the baseline condition when the wave is in the quasi steady state after 15 and 20 s for the non overtopping and overtopping cases respectively 3 4 variation in maximum pressure figs 11 and 12 respectively depict the variation of the average maximum normalized pressure exerted on the building model s front and back faces for each case plot against that in the baseline condition for case 2f as shown in fig 11 a the maximum front face pressure slightly decreases with a percentage reduction of 12 as compared to the baseline condition for 40 mm nominal wave condition when the incident wave has higher nominal height no reduction in maximum front face pressure is observed as the deflected wave from the seaward macroroughness elements comes together with the incoming wave hit the building model s front face as mentioned earlier for 60 mm nominal wave condition the magnitude of pressure becomes almost the same as that in the baseline condition whereas the pressure increases by 13 relative to the baseline for 80 mm nominal wave condition the pressure reduction due to seaward macroroughness elements is more apparent in case 3f where the reduction ratio is getting higher for the pressure at a higher location for the non overtopping case with 40 mm nominal wave almost similar to the findings by tomiczek et al 2016 the maximum front face pressure overall reduces by approximately 38 relative to the baseline for 40 mm nominal wave condition for the 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions it is interesting to notable in fig 11 b that the pressures at the topmost level p4 in both nominal wave conditions exhibit insignificant discrepancies relative to the baseline this can be explained that the seaward macroroughness elements are being overtopped by the wave with nominal heights of 60 and 80 mm after the splashed up wave collapses downward and falls freely on top of the elements the wave with a high velocity residual is then splashed on the top part of the building model which is located directly at the back of the seaward elements for both 60 and 80 mm nominal wave conditions the maximum front face pressures are reduced as much as 15 as compared to the baseline on the other hand as discussed in the earlier section the seaward macroroughness elements also significantly reduces the maximum back face pressure for the overtopping case with a nominal wave of 80 mm for both cases 2f and 3f as respectively presented in fig 12 a and 11 b a great decrease in the back face pressure of around 30 relative to baseline is caused by the seaward macroroughness elements with the presence of the landward macroroughness elements the maximum back face pressures substantially increase for all three nominal wave conditions tested in this study for 40 mm nominal wave condition there is no much variation in the topmost back face pressure p8 for both cases 2b and 3b as compared to the baseline condition fig 12 c and 12 d this is because that the pressure value is relatively small and insignificant at the top of the building model s back face when subjected to a low nominal wave as comparing fig 12 c and 12 d the different arrangement of landward macroroughness elements will have a slight difference in the effect on the maximum wave pressure impacting the back face of the building model as shown in fig 12 c the maximum back face pressure in case 2b overall raises up to 68 relative to the baseline for the incident wave with a nominal wave of 60 mm followed by a percentage increase of 45 and 27 for 40 and 80 mm nominal wave condition respectively for case 3b the back face pressure increases by 24 61 and 31 relative to the baseline for 40 60 and 80 nominal wave conditions respectively fig 12 d 4 conclusions in this study hydraulic experiments have been conducted to study the effect of the seaward and landward macroroughness in several configurations on the wave induced loadings on a building subjected to a tsunami wave the experimental results indicate that the seaward macroroughness has a substantial effect on the front as well as back face pressures whereas landward macroroughness mainly increases the back face pressure the nature of the wave attack on building model also depends on the relationship between the heights of the building model and the nominal wave based on the present study the following findings were obtained a with two configurations of seaward macroroughness tested in this study the sheltering effect is most pronounced in case 3f which substantially reduces the maximum front face pressure by 38 relative to baseline for the non overtopping case as the nominal wave height increases the percentage reduction reduces to 15 for case 2f the sheltering effect is dependent on the incoming wave where the maximum front face pressure even increases by 13 relative to baseline during the 80 mm nominal wave due to the leading edge of wave together with the deflected wave attacking the building model b the effect of the seaward macroroughness in reducing the back face pressure is also demonstrated especially for 80 mm nominal wave condition the maximum back face pressure is about 70 of the baseline due to less incoming waves overtop the building model as the seaward macroroughness reduces the water surface elevation and flow velocity in the vicinity of the building model c with the presence of the landward macroroughness the water accumulates in between the elements and the building model and subsequently inducing a higher pressure at the back face of the building model which exceeds the baseline value by 24 68 for both cases 2b and 3b in conclusion the macroroughness influences the tsunami flow and loads in the inundation zone it is notable that the effect of the interval distance between the building models is not in our consideration in the present study therefore the findings from this study are limited to the interval distance which is similar to the building model s width in future this work should be continued under a wider flume at larger scales and more data should be acquired to further improve the current findings acknowledgements the experimental facilities were supported by the ministry of science technology and innovation mosti malaysia through sciencefund
