1645,a three dimensional coupled numerical model has been developed for incompressible density driven free surface and saturated porous media flows for free surface a time averaged navier stokes equation has been used whereas darcy s law has been utilized in porous media flow the algorithm has been based upon a staggered finite volume scheme on a cartesian grid that solves the 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equation in one step and complete 3d navier stokes equations in two major steps based on a projection method the 3d system is decomposed into a series of 2d vertical plane sub systems which have been solved individually by a direct matrix solver an iteration procedure can be deployed to achieve the fully 3d implicitness of the solution where high density gradients or sharp variation of free surface elevation is present an efficient simple and stable algorithm has been proposed to track the free surface elevation in a cartesian coordinate system within which the water surface position has not been restricted to a specific layer the model has been validated using five test cases to simulate integrated transient free surface and porous media flows where fluid density effects as well as the water surface gradient have a considerable effect on the velocity field two of the examples involve modeling free surface flow wave reflection test and a phreatic line prediction cone of depression test two other test cases involve significant contrasts in fluid density including 3d density driven flow in porous media and 3d lock exchange tests the final test of a salinity interface involved a complicated scenario consisting of a density contrast in both saturated porous media and free surface flow subjected to injection and pumping simulated simultaneously using an integrated domain close agreement between numerical results and experimental data demonstrates the capability of the model for the coupled simulation of 3d density driven flow in both integrated free surface and saturated porous media including freshwater recharge saltwater discharge hydrodynamic dispersion and turbulence effects keywords 3d non hydrostatic coupled model density driven flow free surface tracking time averaged navier stokes equation darcy law 1 introduction despite the fact that ground water and surface water are often hydraulically interconnected they are traditionally considered as two separate systems and are analyzed independently such a separation is partly due to the belief that groundwater movement has a much larger timescale than that of free surface water movement and partly due to the difficulties in measuring and modeling their interactions liang et al 2007 the interaction between these two cited flows has been studied by means of experimental and numerical simulation for a long time in the published related model reports simplified equations such as the diffusion and kinematic wave equations jobson and harbaugh 1999 panday and huyakorn 2004 gunduz and aral 2005 1 d saint venant equations swain and wexler 1996 or the 2 d shallow water equations jobson and harbaugh 1999 sparks 2004 liang et al 2007 have been employed to free surface flow simple models approximate the subsurface flow contribution by using an algebraic infiltration formula multi dimensional saturated or unsaturated of darcy or richards differential equations have been also considered to flow from porous media in complex models there are also other specific approaches to simulating these two flows simultaneously by many researchers in which identical equation used in two domains for this purpose various approximation of developed navier stokes equation such as 2d depth averaged formulation liang et al 2007 kong et al 2010 yuan et al 2012 and 2d vertically averaged van gent 1995 sakakiyama and kajima 1992 akbari and namin 2013 has been used these type of equations are widely used for wave modeling and its interaction with porous structure but it is rarely applied in groundwater flow modeling although various studies have been conducted to simulate free surface and saturated porous media flow interactions as mentioned above to the authors knowledge there is no 3d coupled modeling in presence of extreme free surface as well as flow density differences for example spanoudaki et al 2009 developed a 3 d integrated surface water groundwater model but the model unable to apply density driven flow in addition non hydrostatic conditions cannot be simulated a fully 3d hydrodynamic coupled model has been developed in the present study to simulate density of fluid effects as well as water surface gradient in simultaneous simulation of free surface and saturated porous media flows the surface and subsurface flow equations have been solved simultaneously within a common structure and therefore both the mass and momentum transfers between these two flow domains are fully considered for free surface 3d time averaged navier stokes equation nse has been used whereas darcy law utilized in porous media for the numerical solution of 3d system various methods have been proposed deploying alternative direction implicit adi method which is generally applied for 2dh shallow water models namin 2003 has developed an algorithm in which the 3d system has been decomposed into a series of 2dv problems for each of them a block tri diagonal system of equations with unknown horizontal velocity are solved a finite volume model for simultaneous simulation of free surface and saturated porous media flows has been presented in the current research which solves the complete form of 3d nse and 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equation to this end taking cross derivatives into account explicitly the whole 3d problem has been decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains the free surface boundary condition has been defined in term of the unknown upper cell pressure values therefore is solved simultaneously together with other unknowns the surface position has not been considered to remain in a specific layer so the number of cells in each column have been variably adjusted in accordance with the water surface elevation each 2dv sub systems can be solved by a direct matrix solver finally to have fully implicit method in 3d domain an iteration procedure has been used to take the cross derivative terms implicitly as well section 2 presents the governing equations boundary conditions are described in section 3 the numerical method is explained in section 4 in section 5 the model is validated by five tests including two examples about modeling free surface flow wave reflection test and phreatic line cone of depression test prediction the two others examples are performed for situation with significant difference in density of fluid comprising 3d density driven flow in porous and 3d lock exchange tests at last in the test of salinity interface a complicated situation consist of density difference in saturated porous media and free surface flow subjected to injection and pumping are simulated numerical results are validated against analytical solutions or experimental data 2 mathematical formulation we focus on flows with relatively small density differences for which the usual boussinesq approximation can be assumed to be valid that is all variations in density can be neglected except for the buoyancy term incorporating the boussinesq hypothesis to relate the reynolds stresses with the mean rate of strain tensor via an eddy viscosity 3d unsteady rans equations for incompressible stratified flow can be read as 1 u x v y w z 0 2 u t x u 2 y vu z wu 1 ρ p x x υ t u x y υ t u y z υ t u z 3 v t x uv y v 2 z wv 1 ρ p y x υ t v x y υ t v y z υ t v z 4 w t x uw y vw z w 2 1 ρ p z x υ t w x y υ t w y z υ t w z g where u v and w are velocity components in x y and z directions respectively p is pressure ρ is the fluid density g is acceleration due to gravity υ t turbulent or eddy viscosity and t is time according to darcy law pressure gradient is linearly related to mean velocity through porous media which called darcy velocity the groundwater flow model in the present research solves the 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equations that by applying incompressibility of water and porous media assumption and negligible density dependency of the fluid density can be expressed as 5 u k x g 1 ρ p x 6 v k y g 1 ρ p y 7 w k z g 1 ρ p z g where k is hydraulic conductivity of porous media and other parameters are similar to 2 1 section it should be noted some assumptions have been considered in the preparation of this model such as incompressibility of water and porous media negligible density dependency of the fluid density however such assumptions do not affect the main capabilities of the model since these capabilities can be achieved by adding various extensions the equation of mass conservation for salinity mass of dissolved matter per unit mass of the fluid can be derived as follow for free surface and saturated porous media flow 8 c t x uc x vc z wc x υ t c x y υ t c y z υ t c z c 0 t where c is the instantaneous salinity c 0t variation of salinity from sink or source terms and υ t turbulent diffusivity in the situation where the only effective factor that influences the density of the fluid is salinity density is assumed to be linearly related to the mean volumetric concentration through the equation of state as 9 ρ ρ 0 1 m c where constant m is called solutal expansivity and defined as ρ 0 1 dρ dc the eddy viscosity is modeled by sub grid scale stress smagorinsky 1963 turbulence model where the turbulence length scale l has been estimated as proportional to space resolution and turbulence velocity scale proportional to strain of large eddies namely shear of flow field as 10 ν t l 2 s l c s δ 2 s u i x j u j x i u i x j where s is shear of flow field c s 0 25 1 0 is smagorisky s non dimensional constant δ δx δy δz 1 2 δx δy and δz are the dimensions of computing grid in x y and z directions respectively the reynolds analogy for mass transport and momentum transport suggests that turbulent diffusivity of mass υ t varies linearly with respect to eddy viscosity as given by 11 υ t ν t σ t where σ t is turbulent schmidt number rodi 1984 molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion are combined in flowing ground water to define a parameter called hydrodynamic dispersion it is represented by following formulas fetter and fetter 1999 12a υ t ν α t ui α l α t u u u 12b α l a 0 u ν 1 ρ ρ 0 ρ where ν is molecular diffusion in porous media α l the longitudinal dispersivity α t the transverse dispersivity i the unit vector a 0 the constant coefficient u the real velocity and the others parameters have been defined in the previous sections 3 numerical method a finite volume approximation has been used to discretize the governing equations and boundary conditions cartesian in horizontal and z level in vertical coordinate systems have been employed respectively while staggered grid system has been selected for presenting the unknown positions in a selected co ordinates system computational space in x and y direction are divided to equidistant horizontal interval of δx and δy respectively whereas the number of vertical cells is changed in accordance with variation of free surface level at each time step the height of inner vertical cells are δz while this parameter for surface cells changes in accordance with variation of water surface elevation as demonstrated in fig 1 the pressure points have been considered to be placed on the cell center whereas the u v and w velocities are located at the cell faces as a staggered layout system 3 1 numerical techniques 3 1 1 numerical solution of free surface flow projection fractional step method proposed by chorin 1968 has been used as the main approach to solve the governing equations following namin 2003 the whole 3d domain has been decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains every 2dv sub domain yields a block tri diagonal matrix system with the unknown pressure which can directly be solved the calculated values are considered as temporary therefore iteration has to carry out to ensure the fully implicitness of the solution since the cross derivative terms are calculated explicitly it should be noted that the mentioned scheme could have been applied without any iteration however experiences show that considering a few number of iterations provides a better performance in some free surface test cases while in most porous media applications no iteration is needed for more detailed explanations consider the momentum equation in x direction described by eq 2 according to which the change of quantity u in time defined by u t is due to seven other terms contributed in the equation each having their own portion in u t to be equated numerically by δ u δ t therefore one can define δu δ i u in which δ i u is the change of u in time due to each of the mentioned seven terms as 13a δ 1 u δ t u 1 u n δ t u 2 x 13b δ 2 u δ t u 2 u 1 δ t uv y 13c δ 3 u δ t u 3 u 2 δ t uw z 13d δ 4 u δ t u 4 u 3 δ t x υ t u x 13e δ 5 u δ t u 5 u 4 δ t y υ t u y 13f δ 6 u δ t u 6 u 5 δ t z υ t u z 13g δ 7 u δ t u n 1 u 6 δ t 1 ρ p x f similar relations exist for y and z momentum equations not to be repeated for the sake of brevity f is an additional possible body force source term may be involved in the momentum term such as acceleration term in z momentum equation it can easily be verified that they are equivalent to the momentum eq 2 by a simple summation so to obtain the value of the quantity u in new time step n 1 six intermediate values are calculated by numerical solution of the corresponding term which considered as the initial condition of the next equation the above mentioned procedure makes possible to apply any specific and more suitable numerical scheme for each term having different physical behavior moreover it increase the efficiency of the computation in multi dimensional cases with irregular geometry since only a one dimensional solver is required to solve first six equations the above mentioned numerical technique consists of two major steps in the first step six first eqs 13a 13f covering all advection and diffusion transport terms in both momentum equations and in second step eq 13g for three momentum equations together with the continuity equation are solved simultaneously to include the pressure term on one hand and obtain the velocities in the final stage of the procedure that fulfills the continuity condition on the other hand so continuity eq 1 together with the momentum equations excluding advection and diffusion terms are solved as follows 14 u x n 1 v y n 1 w z n 1 0 15 u n 1 u 6 t 1 ρ n ψ p x n 1 1 ψ p x n 0 16 v n 1 v 6 t 1 ρ n ψ p y n 1 1 ψ p y n 0 17 w n 1 w 6 t 1 ρ n ψ p z n 1 1 ψ p z n g 0 where 0 ψ 1 is an implicitness weighting factor for the pressure gradient by discretizing the eqs 15 17 velocity components in x y and z directions can be written in term of the pressures located upstream and downstream of the mentioned velocities in the following form 18 u i δ j k n 1 ru i δ j k 1 p i δ 1 2 j k n 1 ru i δ k 2 p i δ 1 2 j k n 1 ru i δ j k 3 v i j δ k n 1 rv i j δ k 1 p i j δ 1 2 k n 1 rv i j δ k 2 p i j δ 1 2 k n 1 rv i j δ k 3 w

respectively by substituting eq 18 into continuity eq 14 the velocities can be eliminated to give a set of equations in terms of only pressure values solution of 3d domain in this step the whole 3d problem is decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains as proposed by namin 2003 taking cross derivatives into account explicitly derivatives orthogonal to the plane in these equations are calculated based on the known values from the old time shown with superscript n α solving the equations in vertical planes in these planes such as x z planes the derivatives of the u and w velocities of eq 14 are calculated based on the new time level n 1 whereas v derivative can be expressed by known values of the previous time step or iteration n α substituting velocity components from eq 18 into continuity eq 14 the velocities are eliminated giving an equation in term of the pressures as 22 a k k p i 1 j k n 1 b k k 1 p i j k 1 n 1 b k k p i j k n 1 b k k 1 p i j k 1 n 1 c k k p i 1 j k n 1 d

formulations expresses so far are valid for all inner control volumes i e the ones not located on the free surface for the cells containing free surface a special treatment is required to be implemented which has been proposed here to complete the formulations in this way an efficient simple and stable algorithm proposed by shokri et al 2018 for 2dv models to track the surface elevation has been extended for 3d domain and deployed in cartesian coordinate system to this end the number of cells in each column has been selected proportional to water surface elevation where a unique water surface elevation has been assumed it was found that this treatment enables the simulation of free surface elevation efficiently as would be seen in wave reflection and cone of depression in well tests it is noted that the number of cells in each column at each time step is determined in accordance with the water surface elevation employing the continuity equation of surface cells in x z planes for i th column gives 24 ξ t n 1 ud x n 1 vd y n α w n 1 assuming a hydrostatic pressure in last cells results in 25 ξ i j n 1 p i j nk i n 1 g ρ i j nk i n substituting the velocities u n 1 and w n 1 from eq 18 and water level from eq 25 into eq 24 the velocities are eliminated and the pressure equation of the surface cells is obtained therefore the coefficients of poisson s equation at surface cells are 26 a nk i nk i ru i 1 2 j nk i 1 d i 1 2 j n x b nk i nk i 1 rw i j nk i 1 2 1 b nk i nk i 1 tg ρ i j nk i n 1 x d i 1 2 j n ru i 1 2 j nk i 1 d i 1 2 j n ru i 1 2 j nk i 2 rw i j nk

layers form a tri diagonal block matrix system which can be solved by a direct matrix solver the details of this solution method have been described in ahmadi et al 2007 after the solution of unknown pressure horizontal flow velocity u vertical velocity w and free surface elevation are updated by back substitution in eqs 18 and 25 respectively a similar procedure is applied for the y z vertical planes 3 1 2 numerical solution of flow in porous media the procedure of numerical solution for flow equations in porous media is similar to those discussed in foregoing sections with an exception in the coefficients of discretization which are calculated differently darcy eqs 5 7 are lacking from transport terms therefore can be solved simultaneously with continuity eq 14 the values of velocity coefficient in eq 18 is then computed by discretizing eqs 5 7 as 27 ru i δ j k 1 k x ρ i δ j k n g 1 x ru i δ j k 2 k x ρ i δ j k n g 1 x ru i δ j k 3 0 28 rv i j δ k 1 k y ρ i j δ k n g 1 y rv i j δ

w where n v is soil porosity and other parameters are the same as described in foregoing sections discretizing the eq 30 and substituting the velocities from eq 18 would give the following equation coefficients for surface cells in x z planes where the porosity has been taken in account 31 a nk i nk i ru i 1 2 j nk i 1 d i 1 2 j n x b nk i nk i 1 rw i j nk i 1 2 1 b nk i nk i n v tg ρ i j nk i n

equations in porous domain it is worthy to mention that to achieved the fully 3d implicitness of the solution an iteration process can be deployed is some special cases where high density gradient or sharp variation of free surface elevation is presented for this purpose derivatives orthogonal to the planes are calculated based on the known values from the old time step or previous iteration this procedure is repeated until criterion for convergence achieved 3 1 3 salinity transport density calculation and turbulence treatment quantities such as the salinity fluid density and turbulence parameters in three dimensional hydrodynamic modeling have to be solved once the main hydrodynamic procedure is completed the three major mechanisms of the model eq 8 for the transport of a contaminant are advection i e transport by the velocity field diffusion and source terms each of mechanisms has its own numerical characteristics and difficulties and therefore the method of fractional steps yanenko 1971 is convenient to use this method makes it possible to deploy the most efficient numerical technique for each of the individual processes so in the proposed model after calculating the velocity components and pressure field in new time step the eddy viscosity and turbulent diffusivity in free surface are approximated using smagorinsky turbulence model eq 6 and eq 7 respectively whereas the hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media are estimated from eq 12 the transport equation for the salinity is solved accordingly using the fractional step algorithm applying fromm 1968 scheme together with ultimate algorithm leonard 1991 to maintain monotonicity in advection stage and deploying crank and nicolson 1947 implicit scheme for diffusion and eventually solving the source term process explicitly the density is ultimately calculated using state eq 9 4 model validations to verify the introduced numerical model the numerical results have been validated through a comparison with five experimental or analytical cases these cases are wave reflection test used by jankowski 1999 three dimensional lock exchange test conducted by lombardi 2012 cone of depression test in partially penetrating well located in unconfined aquifer three dimensional modeling of variable density flow in saturated porous media presented by oswald and kinzelbach 2004 and the last test is estimating steady state salinity interface in saturated porous structure subjected to freshwater injection and saltwater pumping carried out by shi et al 2011 4 1 3d wave reflection test the ability of 3d non hydrostatic model to reproduce short wave reflection in deep water is evaluated in the current section this technique has been used by jankowski 1999 and chegini 2013 in developing and validating a 3d hydrodynamic model a square basin with a side of 100 m and a depth of 10 m is filled with a non viscous fluid as can be seen in the fig 2 the initial shape of the free surface is a two dimensional cosine profile with a peak of height η 0 0 2 m and width of d 40 m located exactly in the middle of the basin x 0 y 0 50 m 50 m ξ x y η 0 1 cos 2 πr d r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 1 2 20 0 r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 1 2 20 it should be noted that the color label illustrated in the fig 2 and hereinafter indicates the water level similar to jankowski 1999 the computation domain has been divided into 50 50 horizontal cells and 20 vertical layers where a time interval of t 0 01 sec selected because of non viscous assumption the diffusion coefficients have been set to zero the resulting wave pattern for 5 and 6 s simulated by present numerical model together with results of jankowski 1999 have been presented in fig 3 the wave pattern for the present model at 5 s is perfectly symmetric which much better than the results from jankowski 1999 moreover present numerical results demonstrate a significant symmetry in the central regions it should be noted due to non viscous assumption considered in this test case wave propagation is expected to be symmetric however the insignificant amount of asymmetry in the current numerical results is probably due to the approximations used to calculate the water level in the free surface treatment subsection of 3 1 1 4 2 three dimensional lock exchange test complex gravity currents in lock exchange experiments are simulated to examine the performance of the present 3d coupled model in gravity current applications one of experimental results published in lombardi 2012 are compared to those of the numerical model a ketch of the channel as well as details of experimental procedure would be found from this reference a flume is filled with fresh water of depth h 13 5 cm and then a gate is placed in the channel at a distance l 117 2 cm from the left end household salt is added to the water behind the gate until a stable density of ρ 01 1008kg m3 has been obtained the gate is then suddenly removed for numerical simulation the grid spacing in x and y directions are taken as 0 02 m and in z direction z 0 005 m where a time interval of t 0 01 s selected moreover the solid boundary conditions have been applied to all walls as well as the bottom and the no flux for salinity in all boundaries the instantaneous position of the experimental current s front along the x axis direction in centerline of the tank has been forecasted by present numerical model and fig 4 shows the time histories of front position together with experimental and numerical results of lombardi 2012 it is noted that the salinity values equal to 0 5 g cm3 has been considered as instantaneous position of the front fig 5 shows a top view of the gravity current s front plotting both numerical and experimental results at different instants of times the model results consisting of the salinity distributions and current patterns together with the velocity vectors have been plotted in fig 6 for 6 s after removal of the gate and compared with experimental results of lombardi 2012 in order to quantitatively determine the differences between the numerical models and the experimental results the l2 error which is primarily an average error that highlights the model errors in predicting the instantaneous position of the current s front has been calculated by comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulations from present study and lombardi 2012 the resulting errors for the current project were obtained about 4 44 and 5 71 at 7 and 13 s respectively whilst corresponding values for the lombardi model were calculated about 9 2 and 7 72 the measured errors indicate that the proposed model has resulted in an appropriate prediction in the instantaneous position of the current s front 4 3 cone of depression test in partially penetrating well vertical components of flow are noticeable to partially penetrating wells thus essentially having three dimensional behavior accepting dupuit forchheimer assumptions distribution of hydraulic head of radiating flow to well can be analytically calculated as follow shoushtari 2010 32 h h 0 2 q kπ ln r 0 r 1 2 in which h is the piezometric head in radial distance r from the well and k is hydraulic conductivity one partially penetrating well with 15 lit s pumping rate in x 0 y 0 100 m 100 m has been simulated in this section and numerical results compared with analytical solution the porosity and the hydraulic conductivity of aquifer with 22 5 m height and 200 m length have been considered 8 64 m day and 0 2 respectively the grid spacing in x y and z directions has been taken as2 2 and 0 75 m whereas a time interval of t 10 min was taken into account in order to numerical simulation 15 lit s has been discharged from 90 cells i nx 2 1 nx 2 1 j ny 2 1 ny 2 1 k nz 15 nz 6 to simulate the rate of pumping from the well the source or sink has been treated as an eq 33 33 u x v y w z q n x y z in which q is pumping rate and n is the number of cells that q has been extracted from which the numerical results have been compared with analytical solution of eq 33 in plane and section in fig 7 that demonstrate close agreement it should be noted the water table elevation especially in regions near the borders are forcefully affected by the defined boundary conditions that s why the water level in close to boundaries has square shape asymmetric in the plane 4 4 variable density flow in saturated porous media test oswald and kinzelbach 2004 have performed a series of laboratory experiments with well defined experimental parameters that provide time dependent experimental data for a three dimensional density dependent flow problem especially suited for comparison with results from numerical modeling the proposed numerical code has been used in the current section for simulation of this situation in order to ensure its reliability detailed of setup geometry procedure experimental time and flow parameters and etc have been presented in oswald and kinzelbach 2004 reference cubic container has an inner side length of 200 mm the porosity 0 372 on average the hydraulic conductivity 9 325 mm s two experiments have been conducted with 1 and 10 salt mass fraction as initial salt concentration contrasts equivalent 1005 9 and 1072 2 kg m 3 density respectively the set up involved a stable layering of the saltwater below freshwater affected by recharge and discharge of water equal to 1 89 mlit s at the top the numerical parameters selected to this test case are x 1 cm z 0 5 cm and t 1 s similar to experiment in four cells in outlet i nx j ny 3 ny k nz constant water elevation and zero salinity flux has been forced whereas for 25 cells in inlet i 1 j 1 5 k nz 4 nz flow equal to 1 89 mlit s and no salinity flux has been considered in all other boundaries solid wall boundary condition and no flux have been applied comparison of experiment data and simulated breakthrough curves for two experiments 1 and 10 salt mass fraction in outlet has been presented in fig 8 as can be seen a very close agreement between experimental and current numerical outputs is observed for two those experiments for the 10 salt mass fraction experiment however the simulated breakthrough curve by feflow software differs much from the measured one but the present study results have a good agreement the experimental and numerical evolution of the relative concentrations in a vertical diagonal cross section including salinity distribution and stream line together with the velocity vectors have been plotted in fig 9 for 1 salt mass fraction that indicates the model s ability to predict the overall pattern of interface and flow dynamics in compared rightmost experimental results however the numerical interface is wider than the one from experimental data it seems the numerical approach deployed to solve transport equation has a significant impact on the mentioned results as explained in the section 3 1 3 deploying yanenko s fractional step method the second order upstream centered fromm scheme has been used to solve the advection parts whereas a crank nicolson implicit scheme applied for diffusion portions eq 8 the effect of numerical diffusion in the above cited equation in particular solving the advection parts can affect the accuracy of the numerical results refer to namin 2003 for further study in this area it should be noted that this problem does not fundamentally affect the application of the model in real world practical cases on a large scale to quantitatively determine the differences between the current numerical models and the results from johannsen 2002 and oswald and kinzelbach 2004 researches the l2 error has been calculated by comparing the salinity values in the outlet o3 the resulting errors for the present study were obtained about 5 6 and 7 6 for 1 and 10 salt mass fraction respectively whilst corresponding values for the oswald model were calculated about 2 15 and 129 6 and for johannsen 1 6 and 2 1 4 5 salinity interface in saturated porous media and free surface subjected to injection and pumping to evaluate the capability of the proposed model in simulating the resulted flows from density variation in porous media a series of experimental data on the hydrodynamic behavior of the saltwater intrusion in porous media reported by lei shi et al 2011 have been utilized a conceptual diagram of the setup as well as details of experimental procedure would be found from this reference the porous media section has been characterized by 43 cm length 18 cm height a porosity of 30 and hydraulic conductivity of 44 1 m day two partially penetrating wells f1 and f2 of 5 cm diameter have been used to discharge a flow rate of 3 mm min where the pumping rate adjusted to 7 mm min the concentration of saline water has been kept constant at 57 14 kg m3 equivalent to a density of 1040 kg m3 during the experiments in order to numerical simulation a flow reach of 60 cm length has been selected which included both saline water reservoir 17 cm and porous media section 43 cm time averaged navier stokes equations have been used in saltwater reservoir whereas darcy law applied in porous media section the grid spacing in x y and z directions have been taken as 1 cm 0 5 cm and 1 cm respectively where a time step δt 0 05 s has been selected to simulate the pumping and water injection a flow rate of 3 mlit min has been injected through two cells i 35 j 1 k 6 7 while a flow rate of 7 mlit min has been pumped from two cells of i 30 j 1 k 6 7 furthermore the concentration in the reservoir has been kept constant at 57 14 kg m3 to simulate the rate of injection and pumping from wells f1 and f2 the source or sink has been treated as an eq 33 while these elements i e c 0t have been re written in mass conservation equation as 34 φ 0 t q n c x y z where all parameters have been defined in previous sections similar to experiments a flow rate of 8 2 mlit min has been used as the upstream boundary condition where water level of 18 cm has been considered for the downstream at all boundaries zero flux boundary condition has been imposed for salinity the position of saline water front resulted from either injection or pumping at steady flow condition has been forecasted by the proposed model and shown in fig 10 together with the data of lei shi et al 2011 an appropriate agreement would be concluded between experimental and simulated results 5 conclusions a 3 d hydrodynamic coupled model has been developed to simulate simultaneously the flow and porous media under the change of fluid density and water surface gradient time averaged navier stokes equations have been used to flow modeling while darcy law was utilized in porous media finite volume method together with an implicit scheme in cartesian coordinates assures local and global mass conservation the surface and subsurface flow equations are solved simultaneously within a common structure and therefore the mass transfer between the two flow components are fully considered an efficient simple and stable algorithm proposed by shokri et al 2018 for 2dv models to track the surface elevation has been extended for 3d domain and deployed in cartesian coordinate system by which the water elevation in each computational column has been computed along with the other pressure unknowns simultaneously to this end the number of cells in each column has been selected proportional to water surface elevation where a unique water surface elevation has been assumed it was found that this treatment enables the simulation of free surface elevation efficiently as would be seen in wave reflection and cone of depression in well tests decomposition of 3 d problem into a series of 2dv sub domains and exclusion of nonlinear terms using time splitting approach reduced noticeably the size of the matrix system and computation time the mentioned scheme could be applied without any iteration however current research experiences show that some iterations would provide a better performance at some free surface tests while in most porous media applications no iterations are needed in modeling wave reflection test the results of free surface elevation are in close with jankowski 1999 results the ability of model in predicting the phreatic line within porous media has been examined by cone of depression test of partially penetrated well located in an unconfined aquifer which shows an acceptable agreement with analytical outcomes in the case of density differences in the free surface flow the model accurately predicts the time histories of front position salinity distributions and flow pattern satisfactory predictions of density current indicate the ability of the model in simulating consequent surface flows from density variation the time variation of relative concentration in the diagonal direction of a cube under two different concentrations and salinity rates at outlet has been well predicted by proposing model in simulating 3 d density current within the porous media the close agreement of the results with those of oswald and kinzelbach 2004 indicates to the capability of the model in simulating 3 d density current within a porous media close agreement between the numerical results and experimental data in the salinity interface test a complicated scenario including the density differences in flow and porous media subjected to injection and pumping supports the capability of the model for the simultaneous simulation of 3 d density driven flow and porous media

1645,a three dimensional coupled numerical model has been developed for incompressible density driven free surface and saturated porous media flows for free surface a time averaged navier stokes equation has been used whereas darcy s law has been utilized in porous media flow the algorithm has been based upon a staggered finite volume scheme on a cartesian grid that solves the 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equation in one step and complete 3d navier stokes equations in two major steps based on a projection method the 3d system is decomposed into a series of 2d vertical plane sub systems which have been solved individually by a direct matrix solver an iteration procedure can be deployed to achieve the fully 3d implicitness of the solution where high density gradients or sharp variation of free surface elevation is present an efficient simple and stable algorithm has been proposed to track the free surface elevation in a cartesian coordinate system within which the water surface position has not been restricted to a specific layer the model has been validated using five test cases to simulate integrated transient free surface and porous media flows where fluid density effects as well as the water surface gradient have a considerable effect on the velocity field two of the examples involve modeling free surface flow wave reflection test and a phreatic line prediction cone of depression test two other test cases involve significant contrasts in fluid density including 3d density driven flow in porous media and 3d lock exchange tests the final test of a salinity interface involved a complicated scenario consisting of a density contrast in both saturated porous media and free surface flow subjected to injection and pumping simulated simultaneously using an integrated domain close agreement between numerical results and experimental data demonstrates the capability of the model for the coupled simulation of 3d density driven flow in both integrated free surface and saturated porous media including freshwater recharge saltwater discharge hydrodynamic dispersion and turbulence effects keywords 3d non hydrostatic coupled model density driven flow free surface tracking time averaged navier stokes equation darcy law 1 introduction despite the fact that ground water and surface water are often hydraulically interconnected they are traditionally considered as two separate systems and are analyzed independently such a separation is partly due to the belief that groundwater movement has a much larger timescale than that of free surface water movement and partly due to the difficulties in measuring and modeling their interactions liang et al 2007 the interaction between these two cited flows has been studied by means of experimental and numerical simulation for a long time in the published related model reports simplified equations such as the diffusion and kinematic wave equations jobson and harbaugh 1999 panday and huyakorn 2004 gunduz and aral 2005 1 d saint venant equations swain and wexler 1996 or the 2 d shallow water equations jobson and harbaugh 1999 sparks 2004 liang et al 2007 have been employed to free surface flow simple models approximate the subsurface flow contribution by using an algebraic infiltration formula multi dimensional saturated or unsaturated of darcy or richards differential equations have been also considered to flow from porous media in complex models there are also other specific approaches to simulating these two flows simultaneously by many researchers in which identical equation used in two domains for this purpose various approximation of developed navier stokes equation such as 2d depth averaged formulation liang et al 2007 kong et al 2010 yuan et al 2012 and 2d vertically averaged van gent 1995 sakakiyama and kajima 1992 akbari and namin 2013 has been used these type of equations are widely used for wave modeling and its interaction with porous structure but it is rarely applied in groundwater flow modeling although various studies have been conducted to simulate free surface and saturated porous media flow interactions as mentioned above to the authors knowledge there is no 3d coupled modeling in presence of extreme free surface as well as flow density differences for example spanoudaki et al 2009 developed a 3 d integrated surface water groundwater model but the model unable to apply density driven flow in addition non hydrostatic conditions cannot be simulated a fully 3d hydrodynamic coupled model has been developed in the present study to simulate density of fluid effects as well as water surface gradient in simultaneous simulation of free surface and saturated porous media flows the surface and subsurface flow equations have been solved simultaneously within a common structure and therefore both the mass and momentum transfers between these two flow domains are fully considered for free surface 3d time averaged navier stokes equation nse has been used whereas darcy law utilized in porous media for the numerical solution of 3d system various methods have been proposed deploying alternative direction implicit adi method which is generally applied for 2dh shallow water models namin 2003 has developed an algorithm in which the 3d system has been decomposed into a series of 2dv problems for each of them a block tri diagonal system of equations with unknown horizontal velocity are solved a finite volume model for simultaneous simulation of free surface and saturated porous media flows has been presented in the current research which solves the complete form of 3d nse and 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equation to this end taking cross derivatives into account explicitly the whole 3d problem has been decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains the free surface boundary condition has been defined in term of the unknown upper cell pressure values therefore is solved simultaneously together with other unknowns the surface position has not been considered to remain in a specific layer so the number of cells in each column have been variably adjusted in accordance with the water surface elevation each 2dv sub systems can be solved by a direct matrix solver finally to have fully implicit method in 3d domain an iteration procedure has been used to take the cross derivative terms implicitly as well section 2 presents the governing equations boundary conditions are described in section 3 the numerical method is explained in section 4 in section 5 the model is validated by five tests including two examples about modeling free surface flow wave reflection test and phreatic line cone of depression test prediction the two others examples are performed for situation with significant difference in density of fluid comprising 3d density driven flow in porous and 3d lock exchange tests at last in the test of salinity interface a complicated situation consist of density difference in saturated porous media and free surface flow subjected to injection and pumping are simulated numerical results are validated against analytical solutions or experimental data 2 mathematical formulation we focus on flows with relatively small density differences for which the usual boussinesq approximation can be assumed to be valid that is all variations in density can be neglected except for the buoyancy term incorporating the boussinesq hypothesis to relate the reynolds stresses with the mean rate of strain tensor via an eddy viscosity 3d unsteady rans equations for incompressible stratified flow can be read as 1 u x v y w z 0 2 u t x u 2 y vu z wu 1 ρ p x x υ t u x y υ t u y z υ t u z 3 v t x uv y v 2 z wv 1 ρ p y x υ t v x y υ t v y z υ t v z 4 w t x uw y vw z

turbulent or eddy viscosity and t is time according to darcy law pressure gradient is linearly related to mean velocity through porous media which called darcy velocity the groundwater flow model in the present research solves the 3d non hydrostatic density dependent darcy equations that by applying incompressibility of water and porous media assumption and negligible density dependency of the fluid density can be expressed as 5 u k x g 1 ρ p x 6 v k y g 1 ρ p y 7 w k z g 1 ρ p z g where k is hydraulic conductivity of porous media and other parameters are similar to 2 1 section it should be noted some assumptions have been considered in the preparation of this model such as incompressibility of water and porous media negligible density dependency of the fluid density however such assumptions do not affect the main capabilities of the model since these capabilities can be achieved by adding various extensions the equation of mass conservation for salinity mass of dissolved matter per unit mass of the fluid can be derived as follow for free surface and saturated porous media flow 8 c t x uc x vc z wc x υ t c x y υ t c y z υ t c z c 0 t where c is the instantaneous salinity c 0t variation of salinity from sink or source terms and υ t turbulent diffusivity in the situation where the only effective factor that influences the density of the fluid is salinity density is assumed to be linearly related to the mean volumetric concentration through the equation of state as 9 ρ ρ 0 1 m c where constant m is called solutal expansivity and defined as ρ 0 1 dρ dc the eddy viscosity is modeled by sub grid scale stress smagorinsky 1963 turbulence model where the turbulence length scale l has been estimated as proportional to space resolution and turbulence velocity scale proportional to strain of large eddies namely shear of flow field as 10 ν t l 2 s l c s δ 2 s u i x j u j x i u i x j where s is shear of flow field c s 0 25 1 0 is smagorisky s non dimensional constant δ δx δy δz 1 2 δx δy and δz are the dimensions of computing grid in x y and z directions respectively the reynolds analogy for mass transport and momentum transport suggests that turbulent diffusivity of mass υ t varies linearly with respect to eddy viscosity as given by 11 υ t ν t σ t where σ t is turbulent schmidt number rodi 1984 molecular diffusion and mechanical dispersion are combined in flowing ground water to define a parameter called hydrodynamic dispersion it is represented by following formulas fetter and fetter 1999 12a υ t ν α t ui α l α t u u u 12b α

and the others parameters have been defined in the previous sections 3 numerical method a finite volume approximation has been used to discretize the governing equations and boundary conditions cartesian in horizontal and z level in vertical coordinate systems have been employed respectively while staggered grid system has been selected for presenting the unknown positions in a selected co ordinates system computational space in x and y direction are divided to equidistant horizontal interval of δx and δy respectively whereas the number of vertical cells is changed in accordance with variation of free surface level at each time step the height of inner vertical cells are δz while this parameter for surface cells changes in accordance with variation of water surface elevation as demonstrated in fig 1 the pressure points have been considered to be placed on the cell center whereas the u v and w velocities are located at the cell faces as a staggered layout system 3 1 numerical techniques 3 1 1 numerical solution of free surface flow projection fractional step method proposed by chorin 1968 has been used as the main approach to solve the governing equations following namin 2003 the whole 3d domain has been decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains every 2dv sub domain yields a block tri diagonal matrix system with the unknown pressure which can directly be solved the calculated values are considered as temporary therefore iteration has to carry out to ensure the fully implicitness of the solution since the cross derivative terms are calculated explicitly it should be noted that the mentioned scheme could have been applied without any iteration however experiences show that considering a few number of iterations provides a better performance in some free surface test cases while in most porous media applications no iteration is needed for more detailed explanations consider the momentum equation in x direction described by eq 2 according to which the change of quantity u in time defined by u t is due to seven other terms contributed in the equation each having their own portion in u t to be equated numerically by δ u δ t therefore one can define δu δ i u in which δ i u is the change of u in time due to each of the mentioned seven terms as 13a δ 1 u δ t u 1 u n δ t u 2 x 13b δ 2 u δ t u 2 u 1 δ t uv y 13c δ 3 u δ t u 3 u 2 δ t uw z 13d δ 4 u δ t u 4 u

for the sake of brevity f is an additional possible body force source term may be involved in the momentum term such as acceleration term in z momentum equation it can easily be verified that they are equivalent to the momentum eq 2 by a simple summation so to obtain the value of the quantity u in new time step n 1 six intermediate values are calculated by numerical solution of the corresponding term which considered as the initial condition of the next equation the above mentioned procedure makes possible to apply any specific and more suitable numerical scheme for each term having different physical behavior moreover it increase the efficiency of the computation in multi dimensional cases with irregular geometry since only a one dimensional solver is required to solve first six equations the above mentioned numerical technique consists of two major steps in the first step six first eqs 13a 13f covering all advection and diffusion transport terms in both momentum equations and in second step eq 13g for three momentum equations together with the continuity equation are solved simultaneously to include the pressure term on one hand and obtain the velocities in the final stage of the procedure that fulfills the continuity condition on the other hand so continuity eq 1 together with the momentum equations excluding advection and diffusion terms are solved as follows 14 u x n 1

the pressure gradient by discretizing the eqs 15 17 velocity components in x y and z directions can be written in term of the pressures located upstream and downstream of the mentioned velocities in

respectively by substituting eq 18 into continuity eq 14 the velocities can be eliminated to give a set of equations in terms of only pressure values solution of 3d domain in this step the whole 3d problem is decomposed into a series of 2dv sub domains as proposed by namin 2003 taking cross derivatives into account explicitly derivatives orthogonal to the plane in these equations are calculated based on the known values from the old time shown with superscript n α solving the equations in vertical planes in these planes such as x z planes the derivatives of the u and w velocities of eq 14 are calculated based on the new time level n 1 whereas v derivative can be expressed by known values of the previous time step or iteration n α substituting velocity components from eq 18 into continuity eq 14 the velocities are eliminated giving an equation in term of the pressures as 22 a k k p i 1 j k n 1 b k k 1 p i j k 1 n 1 b k k p i j k n 1 b k k 1 p i j k 1 n 1 c k k p i 1 j k n 1 d

formulations expresses so far are valid for all inner control volumes i e the ones not located on the free surface for the cells containing free surface a special treatment is required to be implemented which has been proposed here to complete the formulations in this way an efficient simple and stable algorithm proposed by shokri et al 2018 for 2dv models to track the surface elevation has been extended for 3d domain and deployed in cartesian coordinate system to this end the number of cells in each column has been selected proportional to water surface elevation where a unique water surface elevation has been assumed it was found that this treatment enables the simulation of free surface elevation efficiently as would be seen in wave reflection and cone of depression in well tests it is noted that the number of cells in each column at each time step is determined in accordance with the water surface elevation employing the continuity equation of surface cells in x z planes for i th column gives 24 ξ t n 1 ud x n 1 vd y n α w n 1 assuming a hydrostatic pressure in last cells results in 25 ξ i j n 1 p i j nk i n 1 g ρ i j nk i n substituting the velocities u n 1 and w n 1 from eq 18 and water level from eq 25 into eq 24 the velocities are eliminated and the pressure equation of the surface cells is obtained therefore the coefficients of poisson s equation at

layers form a tri diagonal block matrix system which can be solved by a direct matrix solver the details of this solution method have been described in ahmadi et al 2007 after the solution of unknown pressure horizontal flow velocity u vertical velocity w and free surface elevation are updated by back substitution in eqs 18 and 25 respectively a similar procedure is applied for the y z vertical planes 3 1 2 numerical solution of flow in porous media the procedure of numerical solution for flow equations in porous media is similar to those discussed in foregoing sections with an exception in the coefficients of discretization which are calculated differently darcy eqs 5 7 are lacking from transport terms therefore can be solved simultaneously with continuity eq 14 the values of velocity coefficient in eq 18 is then computed by discretizing eqs 5 7 as 27 ru i δ j k 1 k x ρ i δ j k n g 1 x ru i δ j k 2 k x ρ i δ j k n g 1 x ru i δ j k 3 0 28 rv i j δ k 1 k y ρ i j δ k n g 1 y rv i j δ

equations in porous domain it is worthy to mention that to achieved the fully 3d implicitness of the solution an iteration process can be deployed is some special cases where high density gradient or sharp variation of free surface elevation is presented for this purpose derivatives orthogonal to the planes are calculated based on the known values from the old time step or previous iteration this procedure is repeated until criterion for convergence achieved 3 1 3 salinity transport density calculation and turbulence treatment quantities such as the salinity fluid density and turbulence parameters in three dimensional hydrodynamic modeling have to be solved once the main hydrodynamic procedure is completed the three major mechanisms of the model eq 8 for the transport of a contaminant are advection i e transport by the velocity field diffusion and source terms each of mechanisms has its own numerical characteristics and difficulties and therefore the method of fractional steps yanenko 1971 is convenient to use this method makes it possible to deploy the most efficient numerical technique for each of the individual processes so in the proposed model after calculating the velocity components and pressure field in new time step the eddy viscosity and turbulent diffusivity in free surface are approximated using smagorinsky turbulence model eq 6 and eq 7 respectively whereas the hydrodynamic dispersion in porous media are estimated from eq 12 the transport equation for the salinity is solved accordingly using the fractional step algorithm applying fromm 1968 scheme together with ultimate algorithm leonard 1991 to maintain monotonicity in advection stage and deploying crank and nicolson 1947 implicit scheme for diffusion and eventually solving the source term process explicitly the density is ultimately calculated using state eq 9 4 model validations to verify the introduced numerical model the numerical results have been validated through a comparison with five experimental or analytical cases these cases are wave reflection test used by jankowski 1999 three dimensional lock exchange test conducted by lombardi 2012 cone of depression test in partially penetrating well located in unconfined aquifer three dimensional modeling of variable density flow in saturated porous media presented by oswald and kinzelbach 2004 and the last test is estimating steady state salinity interface in saturated porous structure subjected to freshwater injection and saltwater pumping carried out by shi et al 2011 4 1 3d wave reflection test the ability of 3d non hydrostatic model to reproduce short wave reflection in deep water is evaluated in the current section this technique has been used by jankowski 1999 and chegini 2013 in developing and validating a 3d hydrodynamic model a square basin with a side of 100 m and a depth of 10 m is filled with a non viscous fluid as can be seen in the fig 2 the initial shape of the free surface is a two dimensional cosine profile with a peak of height η 0 0 2 m and width of d 40 m located exactly in the middle of the basin x 0 y 0 50 m 50 m ξ x y η 0 1 cos 2 πr d r x x 0 2 y y 0 2 1 2 20 0 r x x

50 horizontal cells and 20 vertical layers where a time interval of t 0 01 sec selected because of non viscous assumption the diffusion coefficients have been set to zero the resulting wave pattern for 5 and 6 s simulated by present numerical model together with results of jankowski 1999 have been presented in fig 3 the wave pattern for the present model at 5 s is perfectly symmetric which much better than the results from jankowski 1999 moreover present numerical results demonstrate a significant symmetry in the central regions it should be noted due to non viscous assumption considered in this test case wave propagation is expected to be symmetric however the insignificant amount of asymmetry in the current numerical results is probably due to the approximations used to calculate the water level in the free surface treatment subsection of 3 1 1 4 2 three dimensional lock exchange test complex gravity currents in lock exchange experiments are simulated to examine the performance of the present 3d coupled model in gravity current applications one of experimental results published in lombardi 2012 are compared to those of the numerical model a ketch of the channel as well as details of experimental procedure would be found from this reference a flume is filled with fresh water of depth h 13 5 cm and then a gate is placed in the channel at a distance l 117 2 cm from the left end household salt is added to the water behind the gate until a stable density of ρ 01 1008kg m3 has been obtained the gate is then suddenly removed for numerical simulation the grid spacing in x and y directions are taken as 0 02 m and in z direction z 0 005 m where a time interval of t 0 01 s selected moreover the solid boundary conditions have been applied to all walls as well as the bottom and the no flux for salinity in all boundaries the instantaneous position of the experimental current s front along the x axis direction in centerline of the tank has been forecasted by present numerical model and fig 4 shows the time histories of front position together with experimental and numerical results of lombardi 2012 it is noted that the salinity values equal to 0 5 g cm3 has been considered as instantaneous position of the front fig 5 shows a top view of the gravity current s front plotting both numerical and experimental results at different instants of times the model results consisting of the salinity distributions and current patterns together with the velocity vectors have been plotted in fig 6 for 6 s after removal of the gate and compared with experimental results of lombardi 2012 in order to quantitatively determine the differences between the numerical models and the experimental results the l2 error which is primarily an average error that highlights the model errors in predicting the instantaneous position of the current s front has been calculated by comparing the experimental results with the numerical simulations from present study and lombardi 2012 the resulting errors for the current project were obtained about 4 44 and 5 71 at 7 and 13 s respectively whilst corresponding values for the lombardi model were calculated about 9 2 and 7 72 the measured errors indicate that the proposed model has resulted in an appropriate prediction in the instantaneous position of the current s front 4 3 cone of depression test in partially penetrating well vertical components of flow are noticeable to partially penetrating wells thus essentially having three dimensional behavior accepting dupuit forchheimer assumptions distribution of hydraulic head of radiating flow to well can be analytically calculated as follow shoushtari 2010 32 h h 0 2 q kπ ln r 0 r 1 2 in which h is the piezometric head in radial distance r from the well and

from which the numerical results have been compared with analytical solution of eq 33 in plane and section in fig 7 that demonstrate close agreement it should be noted the water table elevation especially in regions near the borders are forcefully affected by the defined boundary conditions that s why the water level in close to boundaries has square shape asymmetric in the plane 4 4 variable density flow in saturated porous media test oswald and kinzelbach 2004 have performed a series of laboratory experiments with well defined experimental parameters that provide time dependent experimental data for a three dimensional density dependent flow problem especially suited for comparison with results from numerical modeling the proposed numerical code has been used in the current section for simulation of this situation in order to ensure its reliability detailed of setup geometry procedure experimental time and flow parameters and etc have been presented in oswald and kinzelbach 2004 reference cubic container has an inner side length of 200 mm the porosity 0 372 on average the hydraulic conductivity 9 325 mm s two experiments have been conducted with 1 and 10 salt

has been presented in fig 8 as can be seen a very close agreement between experimental and current numerical outputs is observed for two those experiments for the 10 salt mass fraction experiment however the simulated breakthrough curve by feflow software differs much from the measured one but the present study results have a good agreement the experimental and numerical evolution of the relative concentrations in a vertical diagonal cross section including salinity distribution and stream line together with the velocity vectors have been plotted in fig 9 for 1 salt mass fraction that indicates the model s ability to predict the overall pattern of interface and flow dynamics in compared rightmost experimental results however the numerical interface is wider than the one from experimental data it seems the numerical approach deployed to solve transport equation has a significant impact on the mentioned results as explained in the section 3 1 3 deploying yanenko s fractional step method the second order upstream centered fromm scheme has been used to solve the advection parts whereas a crank nicolson implicit scheme applied for diffusion portions eq 8 the effect of numerical diffusion in the above cited equation in particular solving the advection parts can affect the accuracy of the numerical results refer to namin 2003 for further study in this area it should be noted that this problem does not fundamentally affect the application of the model in real world practical cases on a large scale to quantitatively determine the differences between the current numerical models and the results from johannsen 2002 and oswald and kinzelbach 2004 researches the l2 error has been calculated by comparing the salinity values in the outlet o3 the resulting errors for the present study were obtained about 5 6 and 7 6 for 1 and 10 salt mass fraction respectively whilst corresponding values for the oswald model were calculated about 2 15 and 129 6 and for johannsen 1 6 and 2 1 4 5 salinity interface in saturated porous media and free surface subjected to injection and pumping to evaluate the capability of the proposed model in simulating the resulted flows from density variation in porous media a series of experimental data on the hydrodynamic behavior of the saltwater intrusion in porous media reported by lei shi et al 2011 have been utilized a conceptual diagram of the setup as well as details of experimental procedure would be found from this reference the porous media section has been characterized by 43 cm length 18 cm height a porosity of 30 and hydraulic conductivity of 44 1 m day two partially penetrating wells f1 and f2 of 5 cm diameter have been used to discharge a flow rate of 3 mm min where the pumping rate adjusted to 7 mm min the concentration of saline water has been kept constant at 57 14 kg m3 equivalent to a density of 1040 kg m3 during the experiments in order to numerical simulation a flow reach of 60 cm length has been selected which included both saline water reservoir 17 cm and porous media section 43 cm time averaged navier stokes equations have been used in saltwater reservoir whereas darcy law applied in porous media section the grid spacing in x y and z directions have been taken as 1 cm 0 5 cm and 1 cm respectively where a time step δt 0 05 s has been selected to simulate the pumping and water injection a flow rate of 3 mlit min has been injected through two cells i 35 j 1 k 6 7 while a flow rate of 7 mlit min has been pumped from two cells of i 30 j 1 k 6 7 furthermore the concentration in the reservoir has been kept constant at 57 14 kg m3 to simulate the rate of injection and pumping from wells f1 and f2 the source or sink has been treated as an eq 33 while these elements i e c 0t have been re written in mass conservation equation as 34 φ 0 t q n c x y z where all parameters have been defined in previous sections similar to experiments a flow rate of 8 2 mlit min has been used as the upstream boundary condition where water level of 18 cm has been considered for the downstream at all boundaries zero flux boundary condition has been imposed for salinity the position of saline water front resulted from either injection or pumping at steady flow condition has been forecasted by the proposed model and shown in fig 10 together with the data of lei shi et al 2011 an appropriate agreement would be concluded between experimental and simulated results 5 conclusions a 3 d hydrodynamic coupled model has been developed to simulate simultaneously the flow and porous media under the change of fluid density and water surface gradient time averaged navier stokes equations have been used to flow modeling while darcy law was utilized in porous media finite volume method together with an implicit scheme in cartesian coordinates assures local and global mass conservation the surface and subsurface flow equations are solved simultaneously within a common structure and therefore the mass transfer between the two flow components are fully considered an efficient simple and stable algorithm proposed by shokri et al 2018 for 2dv models to track the surface elevation has been extended for 3d domain and deployed in cartesian coordinate system by which the water elevation in each computational column has been computed along with the other pressure unknowns simultaneously to this end the number of cells in each column has been selected proportional to water surface elevation where a unique water surface elevation has been assumed it was found that this treatment enables the simulation of free surface elevation efficiently as would be seen in wave reflection and cone of depression in well tests decomposition of 3 d problem into a series of 2dv sub domains and exclusion of nonlinear terms using time splitting approach reduced noticeably the size of the matrix system and computation time the mentioned scheme could be applied without any iteration however current research experiences show that some iterations would provide a better performance at some free surface tests while in most porous media applications no iterations are needed in modeling wave reflection test the results of free surface elevation are in close with jankowski 1999 results the ability of model in predicting the phreatic line within porous media has been examined by cone of depression test of partially penetrated well located in an unconfined aquifer which shows an acceptable agreement with analytical outcomes in the case of density differences in the free surface flow the model accurately predicts the time histories of front position salinity distributions and flow pattern satisfactory predictions of density current indicate the ability of the model in simulating consequent surface flows from density variation the time variation of relative concentration in the diagonal direction of a cube under two different concentrations and salinity rates at outlet has been well predicted by proposing model in simulating 3 d density current within the porous media the close agreement of the results with those of oswald and kinzelbach 2004 indicates to the capability of the model in simulating 3 d density current within a porous media close agreement between the numerical results and experimental data in the salinity interface test a complicated scenario including the density differences in flow and porous media subjected to injection and pumping supports the capability of the model for the simultaneous simulation of 3 d density driven flow and porous media

1646,groundwater reactive transport models that consider the coupling of hydraulic and biochemical processes are vital tools for predicting the fate of groundwater contaminants and effective groundwater management the models involve a large number of parameters whose specification greatly affects the model performance thus model parameters calibration is crucial to its successful application the bayesian inference framework implemented by markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling provides a comprehensive framework to estimate the model parameters however its application is hampered by the large computational requirements caused by repeated evaluations of the model in mcmc sampling this study develops an adaptive kriging based mcmc method to overcome the bottleneck of bayesian inference by replacing the simulation model with a computationally inexpensive kriging surrogate model in the adaptive kriging based mcmc method instead of constructing a globally accurate surrogate of the simulation model we sequentially build a locally accurate surrogate with an iterative refinement to the high probability regions the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a synthetic groundwater reactive transport model for describing sequential kinetic degradation of tetrachloroethene pce whose hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the results suggest that the adaptive kriging based mcmc method is able to achieve an accurate bayesian inference with a hundredfold reduction in the computational cost compared to the conventional mcmc method keywords reactive transport model joint parameter estimation kriging surrogate bayesian inference 1 introduction the groundwater biodegradation model that considers a reactive transport problem is an important tool in predicting the fate of chlorinated solvent contaminants in subsurface and facilitating science informed remediation decision making its performance depends on the specification of biochemical reaction rates and other related parameters that characterize the subsurface processes although the biochemical degradation rates have been well studied at the laboratory scale fennell et al 2001 haston and mccarty 1999 the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer properties can influence the biodegradation process thus they may not be applicable at the field site bauer et al 2006 brockman and murray 1997 mugunthan et al 2005 suna et al 2001 identification of reasonable values for field specific biochemical parameters for the bioremediation models becomes indispensable for successful implementation and management of bioremediation schemes two strategy are generally employed for parameter estimation one is the optimization algorithms aiming to find a parameter set that minimizes the mismatch between the simulated values and the observed data and the other is the bayesian methods that aim to integrate the full joint posterior parameter distribution based on the prior parameter information and available observation data carniato et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 the optimization algorithms are straightforward and have been widely employed in calibration of groundwater reactive transport models for example shawn matott and rabideau 2008 employed a nonlinear regression algorithm the particle swarm optimization algorithm and a hybrid algorithm that combines the particle swarm optimization with nonlinear regression to calibrate nitrate biodegradation models mugunthan et al 2005 evaluated and compared the performance of several optimization algorithms in calibration of biochemical parameters of groundwater bioremediation models suna et al 2001 also used the fmin algorithm to estimate the biochemical parameters of a groundwater bioremediation model nevertheless in the optimization based methods the inverse problems can often be ill posed in that the solution may not be unique or does not even exist lu et al 2017 o sullivan 1986 zeng et al 2012 recently the bayesian approaches are becoming increasingly popular for parameter estimation due to its ability to provide a comprehensive solution to handle the ill posed problem cui et al 2011 elsheikh et al 2014 vrugt et al 2009 zeng et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 in these methods the unknown parameters are treated as random variables and the markov monte carlo chain mcmc simulation is usually used to approximate the posterior parameter distribution however a well known challenge of the applications of mcmc approaches is that it is computationally demanding because a large number tens to hundreds of thousands of model evaluations is required to get stable solutions laloy et al 2013 vrugt 2016 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 as a result the application of bayesian approaches in inverse modeling of reactive transport problems is still limited to a few studies carniato et al 2014 reichert and schuwirth 2012 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 to overcome this problem one solution is to replace the simulation model by a sufficiently accurate but computationally cheap surrogate model and then evaluate the surrogate model in the mcmc sampling the surrogate models approximate the input output relationship of the computationally expensive simulation models by fitting over a set of evaluated training samples a variety of surrogate techniques have been developed such as gaussian process rasmussen and williams 2006 kriging sacks et al 1989 radial basis function buhmann 2003 polynomial chaos expansion sudret 2008 and sparse grid interpolation nobile et al 2008 reviews of surrogate modeling in water resources can be found in razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 due to its cheap to evaluate nature surrogate models have gained increasing popularity in bayesian inference in groundwater modeling to reduce the computational burden elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 zeng et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 for example zhang et al 2016 proposed a gaussian process based mcmc method for groundwater contaminant source identification zhang et al 2013 and zeng et al 2016 incorporated the sparse grid surrogate method in bayesian calibration of groundwater models to reduce the computational burden laloy et al 2013 and elsheikh et al 2014 also employed the surrogate method in bayesian inference of groundwater models but they used the polynomial chaos expansion method instead although the surrogate methods have been applied in bayesian inference for groundwater modeling and showed promising potential in alleviate the computational burden they have rarely been applied in reactive transport modeling e g zhang et al 2013 where fluid flow and solute transport problems were generally focused on elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 zeng et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 proposed an adaptive sparse grid surrogate method for bayesian inference in groundwater reactive transport modeling and achieved some computational savings compared to conventional mcmc method but this method needs to determine the high probability regions where the sparse grid surrogate is subsequently constructed by using a global optimization algorithm which however may take a large number of computational efforts in addition as the sparse grid is a mesh based method that the sample points regularly distribute as net shape over the entire parameter space it may not be appropriate for problems with irregular model response surfaces in this study we develop an adaptive kriging based mcmc method for effective and efficient bayesian inference in groundwater reactive transport modeling in this new method we employ the meshfree kriging method that can freely select training sample points in the parameter domain with any shape to construct the surrogate models in bayesian inference it is always the case that high probability regions are only a small part of the parameter space thus constructing globally accurate surrogates is unnecessary and a waste of computational efforts zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 inspired by this fact and the meshfree nature of kriging method we propose an adaptive scheme to sequentially refine the surrogate model in the high probability regions in this scheme new samples are adaptively selected from the posterior distribution of model parameters through integrating kriging surrogates with mcmc sampling based on a newly defined score function the score function is a combination of distance measure to avoid sample cluster with a likelihood measure promote to densify the high probability regions this surrogate update scheme results in locally accurate surrogate system over the high probability regions reducing the number of training samples i e actual model evaluations required for surrogate construction and thus further improving the computational efficiency of bayesian inference the adaptive kriging based mcmc method is applied to a synthetic groundwater reactive transport model that considers the chain biodegradation of tetrachloroethene pce and transport of chlorinated solvents in this example as the spatial variability of aquifer properties has an influence on the biodegradation process the hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the effectiveness and efficiency are discussed and evaluated by comparing with the conventional mcmc method to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the use of adaptive surrogate based mcmc approach for joint estimation of hydraulic and biochemical parameters in groundwater biodegradation problems the rest of paper is organized as follow in section 2 the kinetic sequential degradation of pce is presented in section 3 the adaptive kriging based mcmc method in introduced next the results of application cases are presented and discussed in section 4 and finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 kinetic sequential degradation of pce pce is a common chlorinated solvent contaminants detected in groundwater systems the biodegradation of pce is considered to be an effective way to remediate the pollution in this study we assume that in the biodegradation process a reactant produces a single product and the product become the reactant for the next stage producing another single product i e serial reaction sun et al 1999 suna et al 2001 assuming the first order kinetic a typical first order biodegradation chain of pce is 1 pce k 1 tce k 2 dce k 3 vc k 4 eth where k i denotes the first order reaction rate first pce reacts to produce trichloroethylene tce which in turns degrades into dichloroethyene dce then dce reacts to produce vinyl chloride vc vc further degrades into ethylene eth the governing equations of the simultaneous transport and degradation of the species in eq 1 in two dimensional domain can be written as 2 c i t d x 2 c i x 2 d y 2 c i y 2 v c i x k i c i b i 1 k i 1 c i 1 i 1 5 where c is the concentration d represents the constant dispersion coefficient v is the flow velocity and b is the stoichiometric yield factor that describes the production of species i from species i 1 the reactive transport is simulated using pht3d prommer and post 2002 2 2 bayesian inference consider the bayesian inference problem for a nonlinear model 3 d f θ ε where d is a vector of measurements θ is a vector of model parameters f θ are the predictions from the forward model and ε is the vector of measurement errors according to the bayes theorem box and tiao 2011 the posterior probability distribution function ppdf of the parameters θ has the form 4 p θ d p d θ p θ where p θ is the prior distribution p d θ is the likelihood function that measures the goodness of fit between the model predictions and the observations this study uses the commonly used gaussian likelihood function which assumes a multi gaussian distributed errors in the observations and has the form 5 p d θ exp 1 2 d f t 1 d f where is the covariance matrix of the errors and term d f t 1 d f represents the sum of squared weighted residuals sswr due to the nonlinearity of the models it is difficult to obtain the analytical form of p θ d mcmc methods are often used for estimating p θ d the differential evolution adaptive metropolis approach dream developed by vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 is one of the mostly used mcmc methods dream is a multi chain mcmc method that is able to automatically tune the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution in the randomized parameter subspaces during its global exploration it exhibits excellent sampling efficiencies on complex high dimensional and multimodal problems lu et al 2014 lu et al 2017 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2009 therefore the dream algorithm is chosen as the framework of bayesian inference in our study in mcmc sampling a large number of samples i e nonlinear model evaluations are required to get converged results if the nonlinear model is computationally intensive the computational cost would be unaffordable this necessitates the incorporation of cheap to evaluate surrogate models 2 3 kriging surrogate model the kriging model estimates the response value at an untried point θ as the sum of a regression model and a gaussian random process as following sacks et al 1989 6 f θ g θ t β z θ where g θ g 1 θ g p θ t is defined with a set of the regression basis functions and β β 1 β p t denotes the corresponding regression coefficients in general g θ t β is taken as either a constant or low order polynomials the random process z is assumed to have zero mean and covariance 7 cov z θ z θ σ 2 r θ θ between z θ and z θ where σ 2 is the process variance and r θ θ is the correlation function given a set of n design sites s θ 1 θ n and their corresponding responses f f θ 1 f θ n the kriging predictor can be written as 8 f θ g θ t β r θ t r 1 f g β where r θ r θ θ 1 r θ θ n t denotes the correlation vector β is the generalized least estimation of β and is formulated as 9 β g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 f where g is an n p matrix with g ij g j θ i r is an n n correlation matrix with r ij r θ i θ j the mean square error of the prediction at a new point θ is given by 10 mse θ σ 2 1 r θ t r 1 r θ g t r 1 r θ g θ t g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 r θ g θ where σ 2 1 n f g β t r 1 f g β in this study the dace toolbox developed by lophaven et al 2002 is used for construction of the kriging surrogate models and the second order polynomial regression model and the frequently used gaussian correlation function are chosen in the framework of the surrogate based bayesian inference the kriging models will be built for the state variables i e f in eq 3 to reduce the computational burden 2 4 procedure of adaptive kriging based mcmc sampling in bayesian inference as it is always the case that the high probability regions are only small areas in the prior parameter space it is a waste of computational effort to build globally accurate surrogate for the actual model building a locally accurate surrogate over the high probability regions is sufficient to have an accurate bayesian inference i e obtaining an accurate estimation of p θ d and computationally more efficient zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 kriging is a meshfree surrogate method and thus the training samples can be freely distributed in the parameter space therefore in our adaptive kriging based mcmc algorithm the kriging surrogate is sequentially updated by adaptively selecting new samples from the high probability regions this update scheme results in a locally accurate surrogate that yields accurate inference results to iteratively refine the surrogate model in the high probability regions we run the mcmc algorithm on the surrogate and the new samples are chosen from the posterior samples with the updating of the surrogate system the approximation accuracy of the surrogate models in the high probability regions increases then an accurate bayesian inference can be obtained as the evaluation of the surrogate model is very fast the computational cost of mcmc sampling is negligible the procedure of adaptive kriging based mcmc sampling is illustrated in fig 1 briefly speaking it includes the following six steps 1 initial experimental design a set of initial training samples θ i i 1 n are generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs and then evaluate the actual model at these initial samples to obtain the corresponding model outputs f θ i i 1 n 2 surrogate construction construct the kriging surrogate models for the model outputs based on the available samples θ i f θ i i 1 n 3 new samples selection run the mcmc algorithm on the kriging surrogate to achieve posterior parameter samples from which n new new samples θ new j j 1 n new are chosen based on a hybrid score function defined in eq 11 4 new samples evaluation evaluate the actual model at the new samples θ new j j 1 n new to achieve the corresponding model outputs f θ new j j 1 n new these new samples are then added to the training sample set to refine the surrogate models 5 repeat steps 2 4 to add new samples in the current sample set and update the surrogates till the maximum allowed number of actual model executions is reached 6 perform mcmc sampling on the resulted kriging surrogates to obtain the approximated ppdf p θ d of unknown parameters θ the new samples selected in step 3 are from the posterior samples refer to candidate point set γ through running the mcmc algorithm on the kriging surrogates instead of randomly selecting new samples that may lead to too many samples clustered in one area all candidate points θ c γ are evaluated by a score function and the one having the largest score value is selected as the new sample similar to the score function defined in regis and shoemaker 2007 for selection of new samples for their surrogate based optimization algorithm our score function is formulated as a combination of a distance measure to fill unsampled regions and a sswr measure to refine the high probability regions as represented by 11 s θ c d min θ c mi n θ c γ d min θ c max θ c γ d min θ c mi n θ c γ d min θ c max θ c γ s swr θ c s swr θ c max θ c γ s swr θ c mi n θ c γ s swr θ c where d min θ c is the minimum distance between the candidate θ c and the already evaluated samples s swr θ c is sswr value at θ c calculated from the surrogate models the combination of the two criteria guarantees the update focus on the high probability regions and simultaneously be capable of avoiding samples being clustering batch of samples can be added at one iteration to facilitate parallel computing when choosing more than one new samples to avoid sample clustered we treat those candidates that have been selected in current iteration as the existing samples and recalculate the distance measure for the remaining candidates before selecting the next new sample 3 numerical example the performance of the adaptive kriging based mcmc approach is tested and verified using a synthetic sequentially reactive transport model where the hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the synthetic observation data are generated by running the simulation model with assumed true parameter values to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the adaptive kriging based mcmc method the original mcmc simulation using the actual model is also conducted the computational efficiency of the surrogate method is then evaluated by comparing the number of actual model executions required by the adaptive kriging based mcmc and actual model based mcmc to obtain a similar estimation results 3 1 problem description the synthetic model which is revised after that of prommer and post 2002 considers the chain biodegradation of pce and transport of chlorinated solvents in a two dimensional domain with the dimension of 510 m in length and 310 m in width under a steady state groundwater flow condition the domain is discretized into equal size grids of 10 m 10 m as shown in fig 2 the upper and lower boundaries are no flow boundaries the left and right boundaries have constant heads of 100 m and 99 m respectively a pce source with known strength is released from a location at 155 m 155 m and an observation well is located in 175 m 155 m the concentrations of pce tce dce vc and eth are measured every 30 days from 210 to 360 days resulting in 30 measurements in total the synthetic measurement data is generated by feeding the model with a true parameter values and the obtained 30 concentrations are corrupted by adding 5 gaussian random noise in this case the four reaction rates of the chain reaction and the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field are jointly estimated other parameters such as porosity and dispersivities are assumed to be known to reduce the dimensionality of the high dimensional conductivity field it is parameterized using the karhunen loève kl expansion zhang and lu 2004 assume the log conductivity field y log k at two arbitrary spatial locations x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 have a separable exponential correlation 12 c y x 1 x 2 c y x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 σ y exp x 1 x 2 λ x y 1 y 2 λ y where σ y 1 is the variance λ x 350 m and λ y 200 m are the correlation lengths along x and y directions respectively then the kl expansion of y log k at can be written as 13 y x y x i 1 n kl ξ i λ i ϕ i x where y 1 is the mean ξ i n 0 1 are independent gaussian distributed kl expansion coefficients λ i and ϕ i are eigenvalues and eigenvectors of c y respectively n kl is the truncated number of kl terms in this case we keep the first five significant kl terms i e n kl 5 thus together with the four reaction rate parameters we estimate 13 unknown parameters the true parameter values used for generating the synthetic observation data and their corresponding prior distributions defined in the mcmc algorithm are shown in table 1 the prior distributions of the four reaction rate parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed within given ranges while the five kl expansion coefficients are standard gaussian distributions 3 2 results and discussions the kriging surrogate models are constructed for each output corresponding to the 30 observations that are used for calculation of the ppdf of the unknown parameters the initial surrogates are constructed using 300 random samples from lhs at each iteration 10 new samples selected from the posterior samples of mcmc sampling on the surrogates based on the score function in eq 10 are added to refine the surrogate models a total number of 500 samples i e 500 actual model evaluations are evaluated the trace plots of the 500 parameter samples along the sample number collected in the iterative process are shown in fig 3 where the red lines represent the true values it is observed that with the iterative surrogate refinement proceeds the newly added samples gradually approach the true values this is due to the meshfree nature of the kriging model that the training samples can be freely distributed in the space and the update scheme that new samples are chosen from posterior samples of the mcmc sampling on surrogate models as a result the kriging surrogate models will be very accurate within the high probability regions which is sufficient to achieve accurate ppdf estimations of the unknown parameters this is clearly illustrated in fig 4 which depicts the pair wise comparison of the predicted concentration values between the actual model and the surrogate models for the first 100 parameter samples in the burn in stage i e samples distributed over

1646,groundwater reactive transport models that consider the coupling of hydraulic and biochemical processes are vital tools for predicting the fate of groundwater contaminants and effective groundwater management the models involve a large number of parameters whose specification greatly affects the model performance thus model parameters calibration is crucial to its successful application the bayesian inference framework implemented by markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling provides a comprehensive framework to estimate the model parameters however its application is hampered by the large computational requirements caused by repeated evaluations of the model in mcmc sampling this study develops an adaptive kriging based mcmc method to overcome the bottleneck of bayesian inference by replacing the simulation model with a computationally inexpensive kriging surrogate model in the adaptive kriging based mcmc method instead of constructing a globally accurate surrogate of the simulation model we sequentially build a locally accurate surrogate with an iterative refinement to the high probability regions the performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using a synthetic groundwater reactive transport model for describing sequential kinetic degradation of tetrachloroethene pce whose hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the results suggest that the adaptive kriging based mcmc method is able to achieve an accurate bayesian inference with a hundredfold reduction in the computational cost compared to the conventional mcmc method keywords reactive transport model joint parameter estimation kriging surrogate bayesian inference 1 introduction the groundwater biodegradation model that considers a reactive transport problem is an important tool in predicting the fate of chlorinated solvent contaminants in subsurface and facilitating science informed remediation decision making its performance depends on the specification of biochemical reaction rates and other related parameters that characterize the subsurface processes although the biochemical degradation rates have been well studied at the laboratory scale fennell et al 2001 haston and mccarty 1999 the spatial heterogeneity of the aquifer properties can influence the biodegradation process thus they may not be applicable at the field site bauer et al 2006 brockman and murray 1997 mugunthan et al 2005 suna et al 2001 identification of reasonable values for field specific biochemical parameters for the bioremediation models becomes indispensable for successful implementation and management of bioremediation schemes two strategy are generally employed for parameter estimation one is the optimization algorithms aiming to find a parameter set that minimizes the mismatch between the simulated values and the observed data and the other is the bayesian methods that aim to integrate the full joint posterior parameter distribution based on the prior parameter information and available observation data carniato et al 2014 zhou et al 2014 the optimization algorithms are straightforward and have been widely employed in calibration of groundwater reactive transport models for example shawn matott and rabideau 2008 employed a nonlinear regression algorithm the particle swarm optimization algorithm and a hybrid algorithm that combines the particle swarm optimization with nonlinear regression to calibrate nitrate biodegradation models mugunthan et al 2005 evaluated and compared the performance of several optimization algorithms in calibration of biochemical parameters of groundwater bioremediation models suna et al 2001 also used the fmin algorithm to estimate the biochemical parameters of a groundwater bioremediation model nevertheless in the optimization based methods the inverse problems can often be ill posed in that the solution may not be unique or does not even exist lu et al 2017 o sullivan 1986 zeng et al 2012 recently the bayesian approaches are becoming increasingly popular for parameter estimation due to its ability to provide a comprehensive solution to handle the ill posed problem cui et al 2011 elsheikh et al 2014 vrugt et al 2009 zeng et al 2012 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2014 in these methods the unknown parameters are treated as random variables and the markov monte carlo chain mcmc simulation is usually used to approximate the posterior parameter distribution however a well known challenge of the applications of mcmc approaches is that it is computationally demanding because a large number tens to hundreds of thousands of model evaluations is required to get stable solutions laloy et al 2013 vrugt 2016 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhou et al 2014 as a result the application of bayesian approaches in inverse modeling of reactive transport problems is still limited to a few studies carniato et al 2014 reichert and schuwirth 2012 shi et al 2014 zhang et al 2013 to overcome this problem one solution is to replace the simulation model by a sufficiently accurate but computationally cheap surrogate model and then evaluate the surrogate model in the mcmc sampling the surrogate models approximate the input output relationship of the computationally expensive simulation models by fitting over a set of evaluated training samples a variety of surrogate techniques have been developed such as gaussian process rasmussen and williams 2006 kriging sacks et al 1989 radial basis function buhmann 2003 polynomial chaos expansion sudret 2008 and sparse grid interpolation nobile et al 2008 reviews of surrogate modeling in water resources can be found in razavi et al 2012 and asher et al 2015 due to its cheap to evaluate nature surrogate models have gained increasing popularity in bayesian inference in groundwater modeling to reduce the computational burden elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 zeng et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 for example zhang et al 2016 proposed a gaussian process based mcmc method for groundwater contaminant source identification zhang et al 2013 and zeng et al 2016 incorporated the sparse grid surrogate method in bayesian calibration of groundwater models to reduce the computational burden laloy et al 2013 and elsheikh et al 2014 also employed the surrogate method in bayesian inference of groundwater models but they used the polynomial chaos expansion method instead although the surrogate methods have been applied in bayesian inference for groundwater modeling and showed promising potential in alleviate the computational burden they have rarely been applied in reactive transport modeling e g zhang et al 2013 where fluid flow and solute transport problems were generally focused on elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 zeng et al 2012 zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2016 zhang et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 proposed an adaptive sparse grid surrogate method for bayesian inference in groundwater reactive transport modeling and achieved some computational savings compared to conventional mcmc method but this method needs to determine the high probability regions where the sparse grid surrogate is subsequently constructed by using a global optimization algorithm which however may take a large number of computational efforts in addition as the sparse grid is a mesh based method that the sample points regularly distribute as net shape over the entire parameter space it may not be appropriate for problems with irregular model response surfaces in this study we develop an adaptive kriging based mcmc method for effective and efficient bayesian inference in groundwater reactive transport modeling in this new method we employ the meshfree kriging method that can freely select training sample points in the parameter domain with any shape to construct the surrogate models in bayesian inference it is always the case that high probability regions are only a small part of the parameter space thus constructing globally accurate surrogates is unnecessary and a waste of computational efforts zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 inspired by this fact and the meshfree nature of kriging method we propose an adaptive scheme to sequentially refine the surrogate model in the high probability regions in this scheme new samples are adaptively selected from the posterior distribution of model parameters through integrating kriging surrogates with mcmc sampling based on a newly defined score function the score function is a combination of distance measure to avoid sample cluster with a likelihood measure promote to densify the high probability regions this surrogate update scheme results in locally accurate surrogate system over the high probability regions reducing the number of training samples i e actual model evaluations required for surrogate construction and thus further improving the computational efficiency of bayesian inference the adaptive kriging based mcmc method is applied to a synthetic groundwater reactive transport model that considers the chain biodegradation of tetrachloroethene pce and transport of chlorinated solvents in this example as the spatial variability of aquifer properties has an influence on the biodegradation process the hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the effectiveness and efficiency are discussed and evaluated by comparing with the conventional mcmc method to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first paper that addresses the use of adaptive surrogate based mcmc approach for joint estimation of hydraulic and biochemical parameters in groundwater biodegradation problems the rest of paper is organized as follow in section 2 the kinetic sequential degradation of pce is presented in section 3 the adaptive kriging based mcmc method in introduced next the results of application cases are presented and discussed in section 4 and finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 methodology 2 1 kinetic sequential degradation of pce pce is a common chlorinated solvent contaminants detected in groundwater systems the biodegradation of pce is considered to be an effective way to remediate the pollution in this study we assume that in the biodegradation process a reactant produces a single product and the product become the reactant for the next stage producing another single product i e serial reaction sun et al 1999 suna et al 2001 assuming the first order kinetic a typical first order biodegradation chain of pce is 1 pce k 1 tce k 2 dce k 3 vc k 4 eth where k i denotes the first order reaction rate first pce reacts to produce trichloroethylene tce which in turns degrades into dichloroethyene dce then dce reacts to produce vinyl chloride vc vc further degrades into ethylene eth the governing equations of the simultaneous transport and degradation of the species in eq 1 in two dimensional domain can be written as 2 c i t d x 2 c i x 2 d y 2 c i y 2 v c i x k i c i b i 1 k i 1 c i 1 i 1 5 where c is the concentration d represents the constant dispersion coefficient v is the flow velocity and b is the stoichiometric yield factor that describes the production of species i from species i 1 the reactive transport is simulated using pht3d prommer and post 2002 2 2 bayesian inference consider the bayesian inference problem for a nonlinear model 3 d f θ ε where d is a vector of measurements θ is a vector of model parameters f θ are the predictions from the forward model and ε is the vector of measurement errors according to the bayes theorem box and tiao 2011 the posterior probability distribution function ppdf of the parameters θ has the form 4 p θ d p d θ p θ where p θ is the prior distribution p d θ is the likelihood function that measures the goodness of fit between the model predictions and the observations this study uses the commonly used gaussian likelihood function which assumes a multi gaussian distributed errors in the observations and has the form 5 p d θ exp 1 2 d f t 1 d f where is the covariance matrix of the errors and term d f t 1 d f represents the sum of squared weighted residuals sswr due to the nonlinearity of the models it is difficult to obtain the analytical form of p θ d mcmc methods are often used for estimating p θ d the differential evolution adaptive metropolis approach dream developed by vrugt et al 2008 vrugt et al 2009 is one of the mostly used mcmc methods dream is a multi chain mcmc method that is able to automatically tune the scale and orientation of the proposal distribution in the randomized parameter subspaces during its global exploration it exhibits excellent sampling efficiencies on complex high dimensional and multimodal problems lu et al 2014 lu et al 2017 vrugt 2016 vrugt et al 2009 therefore the dream algorithm is chosen as the framework of bayesian inference in our study in mcmc sampling a large number of samples i e nonlinear model evaluations are required to get converged results if the nonlinear model is computationally intensive the computational cost would be unaffordable this necessitates the incorporation of cheap to evaluate surrogate models 2 3 kriging surrogate model the kriging model estimates the response value at an untried point θ as the sum of a regression model and a gaussian random process as following sacks et al 1989 6 f θ g θ t β z θ where g θ g 1 θ g p θ t is defined with a set of the regression basis functions and β β 1 β p t denotes the corresponding regression coefficients in general g θ t β is taken as either a constant or low order polynomials the random process z is assumed to have zero mean and covariance 7 cov z θ z θ σ 2 r θ θ between z θ and z θ where σ 2 is the process variance and r θ θ is the correlation function given a set of n design sites s θ 1 θ n and their corresponding responses f f θ 1 f θ n the kriging predictor can be written as 8 f θ g θ t β r θ t r 1 f g β where r θ r θ θ 1 r θ θ n t denotes the correlation vector β is the generalized least estimation of β and is formulated as 9 β g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 f where g is an n p matrix with g ij g j θ i r is an n n correlation matrix with r ij r θ i θ j the mean square error of the prediction at a new point θ is given by 10 mse θ σ 2 1 r θ t r 1 r θ g t r 1 r θ g θ t g t r 1 g 1 g t r 1 r θ g θ where σ 2 1 n f g β t r 1 f g β in this study the dace toolbox developed by lophaven et al 2002 is used for construction of the kriging surrogate models and the second order polynomial regression model and the frequently used gaussian correlation function are chosen in the framework of the surrogate based bayesian inference the kriging models will be built for the state variables i e f in eq 3 to reduce the computational burden 2 4 procedure of adaptive kriging based mcmc sampling in bayesian inference as it is always the case that the high probability regions are only small areas in the prior parameter space it is a waste of computational effort to build globally accurate surrogate for the actual model building a locally accurate surrogate over the high probability regions is sufficient to have an accurate bayesian inference i e obtaining an accurate estimation of p θ d and computationally more efficient zeng et al 2016 zhang et al 2013 zhang et al 2016 kriging is a meshfree surrogate method and thus the training samples can be freely distributed in the parameter space therefore in our adaptive kriging based mcmc algorithm the kriging surrogate is sequentially updated by adaptively selecting new samples from the high probability regions this update scheme results in a locally accurate surrogate that yields accurate inference results to iteratively refine the surrogate model in the high probability regions we run the mcmc algorithm on the surrogate and the new samples are chosen from the posterior samples with the updating of the surrogate system the approximation accuracy of the surrogate models in the high probability regions increases then an accurate bayesian inference can be obtained as the evaluation of the surrogate model is very fast the computational cost of mcmc sampling is negligible the procedure of adaptive kriging based mcmc sampling is illustrated in fig 1 briefly speaking it includes the following six steps 1 initial experimental design a set of initial training samples θ i i 1 n are generated using the latin hypercube sampling lhs and then evaluate the actual model at these initial samples to obtain the corresponding model outputs f θ i i 1 n 2 surrogate construction construct the kriging surrogate models for the model outputs based on the available samples θ i f θ i i 1 n 3 new samples selection run the mcmc algorithm on the kriging surrogate to achieve posterior parameter samples from which n new new samples θ new j j 1 n new are chosen based on a hybrid score function defined in eq 11 4 new samples evaluation evaluate the actual model at the new samples θ new j j 1 n new to achieve the corresponding model outputs f θ new j j 1 n new these new samples are then added to the training sample set to refine the surrogate models 5 repeat steps 2 4 to add new samples in the current sample set and update the surrogates till the maximum allowed number of actual model executions is reached 6 perform mcmc sampling on the resulted kriging surrogates to obtain the approximated ppdf p θ d of unknown parameters θ the new samples selected in step 3 are from the posterior samples refer to candidate point set γ through running the mcmc algorithm on the kriging surrogates instead of randomly selecting new samples that may lead to too many samples clustered in one area all candidate points θ c γ are evaluated by a score function and the one having the largest score value is selected as the new sample similar to the score function defined in regis and shoemaker 2007 for selection of new samples for their surrogate based optimization algorithm our score function is formulated as a combination of a distance measure to fill unsampled regions and a sswr measure to refine the high probability regions as represented by 11 s θ c d min θ c mi n θ c γ d min θ c max θ c γ d min θ c mi n θ c γ d min θ c max θ c γ s swr θ c s swr θ c max θ c γ s swr θ c mi n θ c γ s swr θ c where d min θ c is the minimum distance between the candidate θ c and the already evaluated samples s swr θ c is sswr value at θ c calculated from the surrogate models the combination of the two criteria guarantees the update focus on the high probability regions and simultaneously be capable of avoiding samples being clustering batch of samples can be added at one iteration to facilitate parallel computing when choosing more than one new samples to avoid sample clustered we treat those candidates that have been selected in current iteration as the existing samples and recalculate the distance measure for the remaining candidates before selecting the next new sample 3 numerical example the performance of the adaptive kriging based mcmc approach is tested and verified using a synthetic sequentially reactive transport model where the hydraulic and biochemical parameters are jointly estimated the synthetic observation data are generated by running the simulation model with assumed true parameter values to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the adaptive kriging based mcmc method the original mcmc simulation using the actual model is also conducted the computational efficiency of the surrogate method is then evaluated by comparing the number of actual model executions required by the adaptive kriging based mcmc and actual model based mcmc to obtain a similar estimation results 3 1 problem description the synthetic model which is revised after that of prommer and post 2002 considers the chain biodegradation of pce and transport of chlorinated solvents in a two dimensional domain with the dimension of 510 m in length and 310 m in width under a steady state groundwater flow condition the domain is discretized into equal size grids of 10 m 10 m as shown in fig 2 the upper and lower boundaries are no flow boundaries the left and right boundaries have constant heads of 100 m and 99 m respectively a pce source with known strength is released from a location at 155 m 155 m and an observation well is located in 175 m 155 m the concentrations of pce tce dce vc and eth are measured every 30 days from 210 to 360 days resulting in 30 measurements in total the synthetic measurement data is generated by feeding the model with a true parameter values and the obtained 30 concentrations are corrupted by adding 5 gaussian random noise in this case the four reaction rates of the chain reaction and the heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field are jointly estimated other parameters such as porosity and dispersivities are assumed to be known to reduce the dimensionality of the high dimensional conductivity field it is parameterized using the karhunen loève kl expansion zhang and lu 2004 assume the log conductivity field y log k at two arbitrary spatial locations x 1 y 1 and x 2 y 2 have a separable exponential correlation 12 c y x 1 x 2 c y x 1 y 1 x 2 y 2 σ y exp x 1 x 2 λ x y 1 y 2 λ y where σ y 1 is the variance λ x 350 m and λ y 200 m are the correlation lengths along x and y directions respectively then the kl expansion of y log k at can be written as 13 y x y x i 1 n kl ξ i λ i ϕ i x where y 1 is the mean ξ i n 0 1 are independent gaussian distributed kl expansion coefficients λ i and ϕ i are eigenvalues and eigenvectors of c y respectively n kl is the truncated number of kl terms in this case we keep the first five significant kl terms i e n kl 5 thus together with the four reaction rate parameters we estimate 13 unknown parameters the true parameter values used for generating the synthetic observation data and their corresponding prior distributions defined in the mcmc algorithm are shown in table 1 the prior distributions of the four reaction rate parameters are assumed to be uniformly distributed within given ranges while the five kl expansion coefficients are standard gaussian distributions 3 2 results and discussions the kriging surrogate models are constructed for each output corresponding to the 30 observations that are used for calculation of the ppdf of the unknown parameters the initial surrogates are constructed using 300 random samples from lhs at each iteration 10 new samples selected from the posterior samples of mcmc sampling on the surrogates based on the score function in eq 10 are added to refine the surrogate models a total number of 500 samples i e 500 actual model evaluations are evaluated the trace plots of the 500 parameter samples along the sample number collected in the iterative process are shown in fig 3 where the red lines represent the true values it is observed that with the iterative surrogate refinement proceeds the newly added samples gradually approach the true values this is due to the meshfree nature of the kriging model that the training samples can be freely distributed in the space and the update scheme that new samples are chosen from posterior samples of the mcmc sampling on surrogate models as a result the kriging surrogate models will be very accurate within the high probability regions which is sufficient to achieve accurate ppdf estimations of the unknown parameters this is clearly illustrated in fig 4 which depicts the pair wise comparison of the predicted concentration values between the actual model and the surrogate models for the first 100 parameter samples in the burn in stage i e samples distributed over the entire prior space and the last100 posterior parameter samples i e samples in the high probability regions of the original mcmc sampling it is observed that although the surrogate system has relatively large errors over the entire space it provides an excellent approximation in the high probability regions that the concentrations of the two models correspond to each other almost perfectly with a determination coefficient of 0 9999 the result suggests that the adaptive update scheme in the kriging based mcmc method is able to achieve locally accurate surrogate over the high probability regions without wasting too many samples in other regions of the prior space significantly improving the computational efficiency of surrogate construction with the kriging surrogates the ppdf of 9

markov chains each of which evolves 5000 iterations according to the gelman rubin r static gelman et al 1995 the markov chains converge after 3077 and 3654 iterations for the adaptive kriging based mcmc and actual model based mcmc respectively therefore the first 3654 iterations are discarded in both simulations and the remaining 5000 3654 9 12 114 samples are used to estimate the ppdf of parameters the marginal ppdfs of 9 parameters obtained by the adaptive kriging based mcmc blue dash lines and actual model based mcmc black solid lines are plotted in fig 5 where the red vertical lines represent the true parameter values listed in table 1 it is observed that the adaptive kriging based method achieves very similar results as the actual model based method however to obtain the

1647,the assessment of vulnerability in karst systems reveals to be extremely challenging since it varies significantly with time and highly depends on the identification of diffuse and concentrated infiltration from surface karst features the origin consumed loads and transport mode of selected micropollutants mps including two artificial sweeteners asws sucralose suc and acesulfame k ace k in addition to other less investigated pharmaceuticals such as the lipid regulator gemfibrozil gem and the contrast media iohexol iox were investigated in a karst system under dynamic conditions a detailed analysis of selected spring responses chemograph and hydrograph following a multi precipitation event shows that three of the tracked mps especially ace k and to the exception of iox can be used as specific indicators for point source domestic wastewater in karst systems they have revealed to be persistent source specific conservative and highly correlated with in situ parameters easily measurable at the spring chloride and turbidity even if the selected mps are found in the system during low flow periods they are mostly transported to the spring through fast flow pathways from flushed wastewater with surface water or flood rainwater the highest mass inflow of ace k iox and gem originated from a sinking stream while suc infiltrated exclusively through fast infiltration points dolines their breakthrough curves coincide with the arrival of new waters and turbidity peaks unlike iox the mass fluxes of asws and gem to a lesser extent can be linearly correlated with

investigated as wastewater indicators of domestic wastewater pollution in groundwater buerge et al 2009 foolad et al 2015 oppenheimer et al 2011 stempvoort et al 2011 stempvoort et al 2013 wolf et al 2012 and surface water liu et al 2014 nödler et al 2016 spoelstra et al 2013 tran et al 2014a b suc is highly soluble in water li et al 2010 its mineralization is reported to occur in soils lake sediments sewage and estuarine water labare and alexander 1993 additionally biodegradation of suc in water is not significant sharma et al 2014 for instance the breakdown of suc is unfinished and does not occur over a short time scale under natural conditions tollefsen et al 2012 a new study showed that ace k can be biodegraded in wwtps only under oxic and denitrifying conditions castronovo et al 2017 however it is not eliminated in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps brorström lundén et al 2007 buerge et al 2011 minten et al 2011 robertson et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 soh et al 2011 subedi and kannan 2014 torres et al 2011 furthermore ace k revealed to be poorly removed by biodegradation and adsorption processes under both oxic and anoxic conditions in saturated soil foolad et al 2015 in septic tanks suc was proven not to be a good marker for wastewater james et al 2016 oppenheimer et al 2011 because of its several years half life and its thermal stability and resistance to metabolism and decay scheurer et al 2009 it was suggested by oppenheimer et al 2011 that the evaluation of the environmental transport of suc and their concentration in groundwater and surface water is still needed gem is used as lipid regulator under various commercial names and has a high persistence in the natural environment araujo et al 2011 iox is a water soluble low chemotoxic and low osmolality contrast agent used for medical imaging drugs ca both iox and gem are not degraded by conventional wwtp processes ternes and hirsch 2000 putschew et al 2001 therefore they are considered indicators for domestic waste water or potentially hospital waste in the case of iox various studies have identified waste water indicators in karst groundwater for water quality monitoring purposes some pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine have revealed to be suitable waste water indicators clara et al 2009 doummar et al 2014 gasser et al 2010 for long term contamination or old stored waste water other investigated mps such as caffeine were considered as indicative of short term contamination because of their biodegradability potential hillebrand et al 2015 reh et al 2015 based on continuous monitoring of its concentrations in a karst spring ace k was reported to be persistent and a suitable waste water indicator zirlewagen et al 2016 in karst systems nevertheless there is an urgent need to investigate the occurrence and fate of other selected mps under specific hydrological conditions lim et al 2017 before assessing their suitability as waste water indicators in the environment especially in challenging karst systems especially in the case of the least investigated gem iox and suc in this work four mps suc ace k gem and iox are monitored in spring responses following rain events the occurrence of these mps is compared and contrasted to other easily in situ measured parameters at the spring such as chloride cl electrical conductivity ec and turbidity tu to test their efficiency as waste water indicators in karst systems under variable flow conditions 2 field site qachqouch spring located in the metn area in lebanon 18 km north from beirut is draining a catchment of about 50 km2 it originates from the jurassic karst aquifer at about 64 m above sea level asl fig 1 the jurassic formation is mainly formed of limestone with intertonguing dolostones in the lower parts of the formation because of diagenetic dolomitization nader et al 2007 the spring is highly polluted due to excessive non sorted solid waste and untreated waste water disposal on its urbanized catchment upstream during low flow periods the spring is used to complement water shortage in beirut and its surrounding areas the total yearly discharge of qachqouch spring reaches 60 mm3 based on high resolution monitoring of the spring 2014 2017 its flowrate is about 2 m3 s during high flow periods on average and recedes to 0 2 m3 s during recession with a maximum recorded value at 17 m3 s for a short period of time following flood events the total yearly precipitation is estimated at 1000 mm on average from one station deployed over the qachqouch catchment at 950 m asl 2014 2017 local high resolution monitoring raw wastewater is either directly discharged into the river system or stored onto the catchment in bottomless septic pits or abandoned boreholes as there are no effective wwtps on the studied catchment area a sample of waste water effluent discharged into the river collected on the groundwater catchment revealed concentrations of 210 000 ng l of ace k and 760 ng l of suc 3500 ng l of gem and 290 ng l iox in untreated waste water therefore in typical local wastewater samples the concentrations of mps increases in the following order iox suc gem ace k tracer experiments show that about 2 of river water infiltrates rapidly in one location on the highly polluted el kalb river and reaches the qachqouch spring with velocities varying between 0 02 and 0 04 m s according to the base level of the river 2 4 h 3 materials and methods 3 1 event monitoring a total of 20 samples from qachqouch spring were collected at varying time intervals 4 8 h following the beginning of three consecutive events between december 30th 2015 and january 9th 2016 two rain samples were collected on january 5th at 600 m and 900 m asl respectively for the estimation of calcium ca cl and stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope concentrations in rain water ec cl tu and water levels were monitored every 20 min in situ with a multi parameter probe installed at the spring mounted with a cl sensitive electrode based on a rating curve discharge rates were estimated from the water level data measured at the spring a total of sixteen additional samples were collected in 2015 and 2017 from the nahr el kalb river before and after the sinking stream to assess the concentrations of the tested micropollutants in the river under varying flow conditions doummar and aoun 2018 3 2 sample collection mp samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass vials and preserved in the field in a cooler with a 3 mg sodium omadine and 5 mg ascorbic acid oppenheimer et al 2011 the samples were then transported on ice and preserved in the fridge at temperature 6c until they were shipped to eaton eurofins laboratories in california in coolers a week after collection the analyses date is two weeks after collection both preservatives have been shown to be effective for stabilizing many pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps for 28 days or more under these conditions all sample containers were provided by the laboratory and sampling was performed with chain of custody documentation oppenheimer et al 2011 3 3 chemical analysis the 20 samples were further analyzed in the laboratories of eaton eurofins in california in the laboratory according to the method detailed in oppenheimer et al oppenheimer et al 2011 it consists of a standard operating procedure using an online spe coupled with a high performance liquid chromatographic separation with tandem mass spectrometric detection spe hplc ms ms for extraction oasis hlb cartridges 2 1 10 mm 25 μ were used and conditioned with 5 ml acetonitrile and 5 ml hplc grade water acidified to ph 3 oppenheimer et al 2011 solid phase extraction column spe allows complete extraction with good recoveries from aqueous matrices the investigated mps were analyzed in electrospray ionization esi negative mode where an xbridge c18 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size column waters milliford ma was used for this purpose oppenheimer et al 2011 the seven replicate of daily minimum reporting limits check mrl chk based on 2 5 ml of spiked solution by using an online enrichment and back flush column switching method the main analyzed mps include wastewater indicators such as asws lipid regulators stimulants analgesics antibiotics and anticonvulsants and anti inflammatory drugs in this work the two asws sucralose acesulfame k gemfibrozil and iohexol are of major interest for the interpretation the method quantification limit for suc ace k gem and iox were 100 ng l 20 ng l 5 ng l and 10 ng l respectively while the relative standard deviation for the compounds is 8 1 3 3 9 and 4 5 respectively ca was determined by means of ion chromatography ic a dionex lc 20 with suppressor and conductometric detection a dionex cs12a column and a 20 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent at a flow rate of 0 45 ml min were used for the cations analysis additionally prior to the analysis 125 μl methanesulfonic acid 99 were added to each of the samples and stirred in a shaker for 2 h the cl sensitive electrode was calibrated using three point calibration solutions in the field with a limit of detection of 1 mg l stable isotopes were analyzed using the high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea method for water analysis with a standard deviation of 0 2 for 2h and 18o 3 4 analytical methods 3 4 1 quantification of the volume of new waters the volume of new waters and percent of total discharge was estimated using a two end mixing model eq 1 based on both cl and ca concentrations it should be noted that the use of ca underestimates the amount of new waters because of the water rock interaction especially in three consecutive events the mass of cl originating from waste water in each event is considered negligible given the significant dilution 1 c n q n dt c b q b dt c m q m dt with q m q n q bwhere c is concentration of cl in rainwater c n in mixed spring water c m and pre event spring water c b q n is newly infiltrated waters q b is baseflow and q m is the mixed spring discharge water based on qn and qb calculated above the total mass of suc and ace k referred to as mmp was estimated using a three end mixing model as follows eq 2 2 m mp c n q n dt c b q b dt c m q m dt c mpm v m c mpn v n c mpb v b m mp m mp c mpm v m c mpb v m v n where c mp is the concentration of the artificial sweetener ace k and suc in the volume of mixed spring water v m volume of precipitated newly infiltrated water v n and pre event waters v b m mp is the new mass of artificial sweetener introduced to the spring the concentration of mp in precipitation water is considered nil moreover a mean transit time t m the time between the start of the rain event and the time where 50 of the mass flux had elapsed at the spring was calculated for each of the four mps and turbidity in events 1 and 2 the variance of the signals mass fluxes with respect to a mean transit time was estimated using eq 3 a low variance is indicative of a higher skewness of the breakthrough curve while a higher variance would imply a longer duration of the compound s breakthrough 3 σ 2 ti t m 2 ci t qi t c t q t dt where σ 2 is the variance t2 of the mass flux breakthrough curve with respect to a mean transit time t m t c i t q i t is the mass between time t i and t i 1 m c t q t dt is the total mass m the mass flux of the mps tu and cl were cross correlated to identify the relationship among spring signals using a cross correlation function ccf where a good correlation was implied when a correlation coefficient r 2 is between 0 7 and 1 and a lag correlation of 0 4 results concentrations of the four investigated mps in river water samples and one waste water sample table 1 doummar and aoun 2018 reveals a higher loading of ace k in the river 53 110 ng l and in waste water 210 000 ng l in addition to iox and gem found at varying concentrations in river and waste water sucralose was not detected in surface water despite its presence in waste water effluents 760 ng l following the four monitored precipitation events four spring responses with varying peak discharges were detected characteristics of the spring responses in the four events are summarized in table 2 and fig 2 the pre event flow rate was 0 29 m3 s during the events the maximum discharge at the spring varied between 2 0 and 11 m3 s with total discharged volumes ranging between 0 3 mm3 to 4 mm3 the higher the response time at the spring with respect to start of rain event the lower the percentage of newly infiltrated waters indicating a lower transit time of phreatic or diffuse waters newly infiltrated waters during the three events constituted between 3 0 and 24 from the total discharged volume in every spring response a turbidity peak is observed simultaneously with a decrease of cl concentrations indicating newly infiltrated waters arriving at the spring in the third event two turbidity peaks can be discerned a primary peak and a secondary peak attributed to a sinking river fig 2 river flood level exceeds baseline level depletion in deuterium 2δh and heavy oxygen 18δo accompanies the first turbidity peaks in all of the events whereas enrichment in the heavy stable isotopes is observed with the secondary turbidity peak out of the 27 tested mps only five were detected in all of the samples including gem iox suc ace k and the cleaning agent 4 nonylphenol possibly due to the high dilution effect it is worth mentioning that substances characterized by a relatively short half life such as diclofenac and ibuprofen were below detection limits 5 and 10 ng l respectively the four investigated mps suc and ace k gem and iox are found in the pre event waters at concentrations 120 78 0 6 10 and 19 0 ng l equivalent to mass fluxes of 0 035 0 023 0 002 0 003 10 3 g s respectively in the first three events three different breakthrough of the artificial sweeteners ace k suc gem and iox can be observed fig 2 maximum concentrations of suc varied in the three events between 290 and 320 ng l while that of ace k varied between 150 and 200 ng l the total mass of ace k and suc arriving at the spring in the three events is shown in table 2 reaching 316 and 430 g of ace k and suc respectively similarly three distinct breakthrough curves of iox and gem can be observed in the spring multi response fig 2 and table 2 the major increase of mass flux for gem and iox occurs during the third event along with the secondary turbidity peak while that of the asws occurs with the primary turbidity peaks in the three events about 10 32 g of suc and 7 15 g of ace k arrived with fast infiltrated waters with the primary turbidity peaks through fast pathways to the spring during event 3 an additional amount of 37 g of ace k was introduced by infiltration from the river while 0 g of suc out of a total of 55 g arrived to the spring with the secondary turbidity peak during the three events 1 0 24 g of gem and 0 5 15 g of iox were estimated at the spring not 1 5 g of iox and 3 5 g of gem arrived with the first three primary peaks the significant load of around 13 g of iox and gem coincided with the secondary turbidity peak in the third event concentrations of suc and ace k detected at the springs are not well synchronized in the observed breakthrough curves as shown in fig 2 moreover ec and cl concentrations do not correlate well with the asws gem or iox fig 3 nevertheless the breakthrough curves of mass fluxes qi ci of asws are very well correlated with primary turbidity peaks in each of the events except for the secondary turbidity a maximum correlation between asws and tu r2 0 99 for ace k and r2 0 97 for suc and asws and cl mass fluxes suc r2 0 99 to ace k r2 0 97 is observed a time lag 0 table 3 fig 4 however the other mps mass fluxes correlate with those of cl and tu with a lag time equals to 1 table 3 fig 4 a negative lag indicates that the predictand precedes the predictor by one lag equivalent to 4 8 h ace k and suc mass fluxes are less correlated with those of gem while they poorly relate to iox despite a lower ratio of ace k to suc in the waste water sample the ratio of ace k to suc consumption during the three events on the catchment is 0 77 fig 5 indicating higher loads of suc with respect to ace k and a possible similar origin of both compounds except when the origin is infiltrated surface water the relationship between of gem and iox mass loads at the spring during the different events can be described linearly by gem 0 86 iox 1 19 r2 0 97 fig 5 because iox can decrease to below detection limits in the spring furthermore a relationship was established between new masses of gem iox and ace k introduced to the spring and the total mass of each mp calculated in each event fig 6 the latter was less applicable in the case of suc the variance of mps breakthrough curves with respect to a mean transit time in events 1 and 2 was evaluated eq 3 fig 7 as a result the variance of ace k breakthrough curve with respect to a mean transit time is slightly higher σ2 0 71 and 0 16 h2 than that of suc σ2 0 68 0 16 h2 tu σ2 0 64 0 15 h2 gem σ2 0 57 0 09 h2 and iox σ2 0 31 0 07 h2 respectively fig 6 event 3 was excluded because of the secondary turbidity peak indicating a varying flux of asws from the river 5 discussion 5 1 origin and mass loads of the selected mps both asws as well as gem are found in the spring during baseline where no active recharge is occurring during the events and post events this indicates that despite the significant dilution the three mps are persistent in the fissured matrix epikarst at high concentrations e g suc 100 ng l corresponding to daily loads of 3 0 2 0 and 0 2 g of suc ace k and gem respectively despite the presence of suc gem and ace k in phreatic waters the mass of the four investigated mps increases substantially during the inflow of fast infiltrated flood waters in the three events varying percentages of newly infiltrated water between 3 0 and 24 from the total volume discharged were accompanied by varying mass loads of mps in the first and second events the fast flow pathways were saturated with highly mineralized pre event water that gets flushed away in the spring s first and second responses the latter can explain the relatively low percentage of new water reaching the spring in the first two events as fast flow pathways become less saturated with stored water a higher volume of flood water is able to infiltrate through sinkholes and dolines to reach the spring in the third event the depletion in stable isotopes e g deuterium observed with every spring response confirms that the origin of the fast flow is located on the dolines plateau on the highlands of the catchment between 1200 and 1500 m in the third event a significant enrichment in deuterium and heavy oxygen observed during the secondary turbidity peak implies an infiltration of additional new waters from a lower recharge area on the catchment 800 m corresponding to the river input via the sinking stream the correlation of turbidity and breakthrough of mps allows the identification of the waste water origin hospital and domestic and the mode of infiltration river versus dolines while suc is arriving mostly through dolines important mass loads of ace k gem and iox are also infiltrating along with surface water from a karst sinking stream along the kalb river the absence of suc in the sinking stream is due either to its absence in the wastewater effluent in the river to suc concentration falling below its relatively high detection limits in river water 100 ng l or to mineralization of suc in soils or river sediments labare and alexander 1993 it is worth mentioning that sucralose was found in the waste water effluent on the catchment area table 1 and in spring water table 2 indicating its high consumption on the catchment area therefore its presence in river samples infiltrating to the spring cannot be completely ruled out on the one hand it has been reported that suc is characterized by a lower likelihood for detection kokotou and thomaidis 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 especially in sludge material typical of non treated wastewater despite that fact oppenheimer et al 2011 considered suc as a very suitable wastewater indicator in septic tanks but suggested the evaluation of suc transport under natural conditions additionally the added asws mass loads event through direct rain infiltration except for the infiltrated surface water correlate linearly indicating that they have the same origin infiltrating from point source waste water with a definite ratio of suc to ace k and a rapid infiltration to the saturated zone in all of the events the persistence of asws more specifically ace k in the phreatic zone could also originate from slow continuous infiltration from the river into groundwater through bank filtrates which is enhanced during high flow periods engelhardt et al 2013 the correlation between mass fluxes of gem and iox may indicate a similar origin for the two mps as well 5 2 correlation of mps and in situ parameters measured at the spring since the asws mass fluxes and those of cl correlate to a high extent cl corrected for flow rate could allow the quantification of the mass flux concentrations of the two asws at the spring cl mass and tu fluxes correlate less with gem and almost at no time with iox indicating a less conservative behavior of iox with respect to the three other mps the short term breakthrough of the contrast media is most probably related to sporadic point source hospital effluents and its limited release on the catchment the comparison of the normalized breakthrough curves with respect to peak concentration and transit time for the first two events show that the breakthrough of turbidity ace k suc and gem are well synchronized the slightly higher variance of ace k breakthrough curve with respect to that of suc and turbidity could be reflective of a longer duration of breakthrough potentially attributed to varying transport processes e g dispersion moreover even if not detectable in the chemograph or hydrograph an additional input of mass flux from a point source contamination such as the river in the case of ace k could also explain the tailing effect observed in events 1 and 2 studies have shown that ace k showed no retardation in porous aquifers with respect to carbamazepine stempvoort et al 2013 or in karst aquifers with respect to another asw such as cyclamate and sodium fluorescein hillebrand et al 2015 however a higher sorption to suspended particulate matter of ace k was observed by subedi and kannan 2014 nevertheless since the breakthrough curve is resulting from convolved multiple peaks of asws mass fluxes transport parameters such as dispersion cannot be calculated for each of the mps iox appears to be poorly synchronized with the cl mass and turbidity fluxes therefore tu and cl could be considered less associated with the breakthrough of the contrast media especially with the observed lag time finally the secondary turbidity peak originating from the river input coincided solely with a breakthrough of ace k gem and iox showing that suc is a poor indicator of infiltrated river water in this case 5 3 suitability of the mps as waste water indicators a suitable waste water indicator is characterized by 1 its persistence against degradation and decay in an aquifer system and in treatment plants 2 its common usage for specific purposes and 3 its occurrence above detection limits clara et al 2009 based on spring baseline concentrations ace k gem and suc are persistent in the aquifer during baseflow and during the events moreover this study reveals that ace k can be considered a good domestic waste water indicator in the natural environment because its breakthrough is concordant with all the turbidity signals and the arrival of infiltrating waste water into the spring from both surface water and fast infiltration pathways after a precipitation event for the same reasons suc appears also to be a suitable waste water indicator except for surface water effluents due to its high detection limits additionally gem appears to be a suitable waste water indicator especially for transport of river water into groundwater in this particular case finally the breakthrough of iox is relatively short at the spring with respect to the other investigated mps indicating a rather limited release in waste water therefore it can be regarded as an indicator of hospital effluents for short term breakthrough events on the other hand ace k and suc correlate very well with cl mass and tu fluxes therefore the combination of easily monitored parameters at the spring such as cl and tu can be used to predict concentrations and duration of breakthrough of these asws as waste water indicators which is essential for contamination management purposes mass fluxes of gem and iox correlate less with cl and tu thus these two parameters cannot fully portray the breakthrough of the lipid regulator and contrast media as domestic or hospital waste water indicators 6 conclusions in this work the concentrations of the two artificial sweeteners suc and ace k along with a contrast media iox and lipid regulator gem were monitored following three consecutive rain events most of the investigated mps are persistent in the matrix during low flow periods they are further introduced with infiltrated flood waters through fast flow pathways e g dolines which explain the observed peaks of mps despite the relative high dilution an additional secondary peak of gem iox and ace k was observed in the third event indicating rapid infiltration of waste water from contaminated river water given that a suitable waste water indicator is defined by its persistence in groundwater storage and its particular origin such as hospital waste for iox therefore the four mps ace k suc gem and to a lesser extent iox can be envisaged as indicators of waste water originating from various sources autochthonous versus allochthonous sources however suc breakthrough curve fails to reflect the infiltration of contaminated river water into the spring either because suc falls below the detection limits or because of its controversial absence in surface water samples additionally a good waste water indicator is characterized by a high likelihood of detection because of its predominant usage on the catchment or high resolution of detection the analytical limits of each of gem ace k and iox are below 10 0 ng l while that of suc is 100 ng l thus decreasing its likelihood of detection unless present at relatively high concentrations high mass fluxes nevertheless suc is to become a promising indicator for fast infiltrated groundwater given its increasing usage on the gw catchment area over other artificial sweeteners the mps slightly varying transport behaviors consumption loads and potential origin are reflected in their breakthrough s concentrations peak concentrations and duration at the spring the mass flux of tu and cl are strongly correlated with those of the two asws and to a lesser extent with gem while iox appear to be less reliable because of its sporadic and short breakthrough additionally this correlation between asws and parameters that are easily measured in situ at the spring can be used to predict the breakthrough of suc and ace k as waste water indicators and thus be reflective of the specific variable spring vulnerability finally a long term monitoring of these selected mps and parameters such as chloride turbidity or bacteriological contamination can help validate the results under varying flow periods acknowledgement this work was funded by a usaid peer science project award number 102881 cycle 3 the authors would also like to thank fouad andari

establishment is highly appreciated 
1647,the assessment of vulnerability in karst systems reveals to be extremely challenging since it varies significantly with time and highly depends on the identification of diffuse and concentrated infiltration from surface karst features the origin consumed loads and transport mode of selected micropollutants mps including two artificial sweeteners asws sucralose suc and acesulfame k ace k in addition to other less investigated pharmaceuticals such as the lipid regulator gemfibrozil gem and the contrast media iohexol iox were investigated in a karst system under dynamic conditions a detailed analysis of selected spring responses chemograph and hydrograph following a multi precipitation event shows that three of the tracked mps especially ace k and to the exception of iox can be used as specific indicators for point source domestic wastewater in karst systems they have revealed to be persistent source specific conservative and highly correlated with in situ parameters easily measurable at the spring chloride and turbidity even if the selected mps are found in the system during low flow periods they are mostly transported to the spring through fast flow pathways from flushed wastewater with surface water or flood rainwater the highest mass inflow of ace k iox and gem originated from a sinking stream while suc infiltrated exclusively through fast infiltration points dolines their breakthrough curves coincide with the arrival of new waters and turbidity peaks unlike iox the mass fluxes of asws and gem to a lesser extent can be linearly correlated with chloride mass fluxes and turbidity flux moreover the variance of the normalized breakthrough curves of the mps with respect to a mean transit time increases in that order iox gem turbidity suc ace k indicating a higher restitution time for ace k with respect to other spring signals 1 introduction karst aquifers supply about 25 of the world population and in some european countries even 50 with drinking water ford and williams 2007 especially in mediterranean semi arid regions karst systems vulnerabilities are difficult to assess due to their duality of infiltration and flow they are recharged through concentrated infiltration in dolines and or dry valleys additionally diffuse recharge also occurs through soil and epikarst forming a relatively thick unsaturated zone geyer et al 2008 perrin et al 2003 a duality of flow is observed in the saturated zone where a conduit system is draining low permeability matrix storage doummar et al 2012 geyer et al 2007 király 2002 in the last few decades emerging organic mps on terrestrial and in aquatic environments are being investigated through continuous monitoring or grab sample analysis not only to determine their occurrence and fate in the environment daughton and ternes 1999 halling sørensen et al 1998 kümmerer 2009 schwarzenbach et al 2006 stan and linkerhagner 1992 stan et al 1994 but also to assess their transport characteristics in various hydrological systems burke et al 2013 einsiedl et al 2010 mps include among others 1 pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics anti inflammatory hormones contrast media 2 personal care products such as preservatives antimicrobials antibacterial and 3 food additives such as artificial sweeteners recent studies have documented the occurrence of artificial sweeteners sucralose suc and acesulfame k ace k in the aquatic environment brorström lundén et al 2008 buerge et al 2009 loos et al 2009 mead et al 2009 scheurer et al 2009 along with the lipid regulator gemfibrozil gem araujo et al 2011 bendz et al 2005 sanderson et al 2003 and the contrast media iohexol iox kormos et al 2011 putschew et al 2000 asws are ubiquitous in the human diet oppenheimer et al 2012 and are not extensively metabolized by humans roberts et al 2000 suc sold under the trade name splenda is a chlorinated form of sucrose it is approved for use as an additive in over 4000 food products in over 80 countries torres et al 2011 ace k is also a calorie free sweetener sold under different commercial names currently approved for use in the u s a and other countries fda 2006 they are excreted unchanged in urine flow into waste water treatment plants wwtp or untreated waste water and are discharged directly to environmental waters grice and goldsmith 2000 hoque et al 2014 labare and alexander 1993 roberts et al 2000 sang et al 2014 sims et al 2000 wood et al 2000 two percent 2 or less of the consumed gem is excreted unchanged zimetbaum et al 1991 whereas iox is released into urine largely unchanged after passing through the body kormos et al 2010 concentrations of ace k reach 780 and 730 ng l in surface water and groundwater respectively in singapore tran et al 2014a b base flow concentrations of ace k around 20 ng l were observed in a karst spring in germany and were reported to increase with untreated waste water disposal on the catchment zirlewagen et al 2016 loadings of suc into surface water in the us ranged between 120 and 10 000 ng l oppenheimer et al 2012 in singapore maximum concentrations of suc in surface water reach 530 ng l while they fall below detection limit in groundwater tran et al 2014a b in the us concentrations of suc in treated potable water ranged between 49 and 2400 ng l wolf et al 2012 mawhinney et al 2011 the ratio of ace k suc was estimated at about 40 in sampled waste water effluent in germany and at only 3 in a site in mediterranean country scheurer et al 2009 indicating varying usage of the asws in different regions on the other hand gem was detected in surface water in the us at concentrations varying between 13 and 130 ng l karnjanapiboonwong et al 2011 showed that its concentrations in groundwater in the us can reach up to 2550 ng l this lipid regulator was found in groundwater in spain at average concentrations of 165 ng l barnes et al 2008 fram and belitz 2011 according to a study in western greece by stamatis and konstantinou 2013 the concentration of gem in municipal waste water influents ranged between 470 and 1250 ng l while iox was found at higher concentrations reaching 960 ng l due to their documented occurrence and persistence in surface water mead et al 2009 perkola and sainio 2014 and groundwater suc mawhinney et al 2011 oppenheimer et al 2011 and ace k robertson et al 2013 have been investigated as wastewater indicators of domestic wastewater pollution in groundwater buerge et al 2009 foolad et al 2015 oppenheimer et al 2011 stempvoort et al 2011 stempvoort et al 2013 wolf et al

sediments sewage and estuarine water labare and alexander 1993 additionally biodegradation of suc in water is not significant sharma et al 2014 for instance the breakdown of suc is unfinished and does not occur over a short time scale under natural conditions tollefsen et al 2012 a new study showed that ace k can be biodegraded in wwtps only under oxic and denitrifying conditions castronovo et al 2017 however it is not eliminated in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps brorström lundén et al 2007 buerge et al 2011 minten et al 2011 robertson et al 2013 scheurer et al 2009 soh et al 2011 subedi and kannan 2014 torres et al 2011 furthermore ace k revealed to be poorly removed by biodegradation and adsorption processes under both oxic and anoxic conditions in saturated soil foolad et al 2015 in septic tanks suc was proven not to be a good marker for wastewater james et al 2016 oppenheimer et al 2011 because of its several years half life and its thermal stability and resistance to metabolism and decay scheurer et al 2009 it was suggested by oppenheimer et al 2011 that the evaluation of the environmental transport of suc and their concentration in groundwater and surface water is still needed gem is used as lipid regulator under various commercial names and has a high persistence in the natural environment araujo et al 2011 iox is a water soluble low chemotoxic and low osmolality contrast agent used for medical imaging drugs ca both iox and gem are not degraded by conventional wwtp processes ternes and hirsch 2000 putschew et al 2001 therefore they are considered indicators for domestic waste water or potentially hospital waste in the case of iox various studies have identified waste water indicators in karst groundwater for water quality monitoring purposes some pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine have revealed to be suitable waste water indicators clara et al 2009 doummar et al 2014 gasser et al 2010 for long term contamination or old stored waste water other investigated mps such as caffeine were considered as indicative of short term contamination because of their biodegradability potential hillebrand et al 2015 reh et al 2015 based on continuous monitoring of its concentrations in a karst spring ace k was reported to be persistent and a suitable waste water indicator zirlewagen et al 2016 in karst systems nevertheless there is an urgent need to investigate the occurrence and fate of other selected mps under specific hydrological conditions lim et al 2017 before assessing their suitability as waste water indicators in the environment especially in challenging karst systems especially in the case of the least investigated gem iox and suc in this work four mps suc ace k gem and iox are monitored in spring responses following rain events the occurrence of these mps is compared and contrasted to other easily in situ measured parameters at the spring such as chloride cl electrical conductivity ec and turbidity tu to test their efficiency as waste water indicators in karst systems under variable flow conditions 2 field site qachqouch spring located in the metn area in lebanon 18 km north from beirut is draining a catchment of about 50 km2 it originates from the jurassic karst aquifer at about 64 m above sea level asl fig 1 the jurassic formation is mainly formed of limestone with intertonguing dolostones in the lower parts of the formation because of diagenetic dolomitization nader et al 2007 the spring is highly polluted due to excessive non sorted solid waste and untreated waste water disposal on its urbanized catchment upstream during low flow periods the spring is used to complement water shortage in beirut and its surrounding areas the total yearly discharge of qachqouch spring reaches 60 mm3 based on high resolution monitoring of the spring 2014 2017 its flowrate is about 2 m3 s during high flow periods on average and recedes to 0 2 m3 s during recession with a maximum recorded value at 17 m3 s for a short period of time following flood events the total yearly precipitation is estimated at 1000 mm on average from one station deployed over the qachqouch catchment at 950 m asl 2014 2017 local high resolution monitoring raw wastewater is either directly discharged into the river system or stored onto the catchment in bottomless septic pits or abandoned boreholes as there are no effective wwtps on the studied catchment area a sample of waste water effluent discharged into the river collected on the groundwater catchment revealed concentrations of 210 000 ng l of ace k and 760 ng l of suc 3500 ng l of gem and 290 ng l iox in untreated waste water therefore in typical local wastewater samples the concentrations of mps increases in the following order iox suc gem ace k tracer experiments show that about 2 of river water infiltrates rapidly in one location on the highly polluted el kalb river and reaches the qachqouch spring with velocities varying between 0 02 and 0 04 m s according to the base level of the river 2 4 h 3 materials and methods 3 1 event monitoring a total of 20 samples from qachqouch spring were collected at varying time intervals 4 8 h following the beginning of three consecutive events between december 30th 2015 and january 9th 2016 two rain samples were collected on january 5th at 600 m and 900 m asl respectively for the estimation of calcium ca cl and stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope concentrations in rain water ec cl tu and water levels were monitored every 20 min in situ with a multi parameter probe installed at the spring mounted with a cl sensitive electrode based on a rating curve discharge rates were estimated from the water level data measured at the spring a total of sixteen additional samples were collected in 2015 and 2017 from the nahr el kalb river before and after the sinking stream to assess the concentrations of the tested micropollutants in the river under varying flow conditions doummar and aoun 2018 3 2 sample collection mp samples were collected in 40 ml amber glass vials and preserved in the field in a cooler with a 3 mg sodium omadine and 5 mg ascorbic acid oppenheimer et al 2011 the samples were then transported on ice and preserved in the fridge at temperature 6c until they were shipped to eaton eurofins laboratories in california in coolers a week after collection the analyses date is two

containers were provided by the laboratory and sampling was performed with chain of custody documentation oppenheimer et al 2011 3 3 chemical analysis the 20 samples were further analyzed in the laboratories of eaton eurofins in california in the laboratory according to the method detailed in oppenheimer et al oppenheimer et al 2011 it consists of a standard operating procedure using an online spe coupled with a high performance liquid chromatographic separation with tandem mass spectrometric detection spe hplc ms ms for extraction oasis hlb cartridges 2 1 10 mm 25 μ were used and conditioned with 5 ml acetonitrile and 5 ml hplc grade water acidified to ph 3 oppenheimer et al 2011 solid phase extraction column spe allows complete extraction with good recoveries from aqueous matrices the investigated mps were analyzed in electrospray ionization esi negative mode where an xbridge c18 2 1 150 mm 3 5 μm particle size column waters milliford ma was used for this purpose oppenheimer et al 2011 the seven replicate of daily minimum reporting limits check mrl chk based on 2 5 ml of spiked solution by using an online enrichment and back flush column switching method the main analyzed mps include wastewater indicators such as asws lipid regulators stimulants analgesics antibiotics and anticonvulsants and anti inflammatory drugs in this work the two asws sucralose acesulfame k gemfibrozil and iohexol are of major interest for the interpretation the method quantification limit for suc ace k gem and iox were 100 ng l 20 ng l 5 ng l and 10 ng l respectively while the relative standard deviation for the compounds is 8 1 3 3 9 and 4 5 respectively ca was determined by means of ion chromatography ic a dionex lc 20 with suppressor and conductometric detection a dionex cs12a column and a 20 mm methanesulfonic acid eluent at a flow rate of 0 45 ml min were used for the cations analysis additionally prior to the analysis 125 μl methanesulfonic acid 99 were added to each of the samples and stirred in a shaker for 2 h the cl sensitive electrode was calibrated using three point calibration solutions in the field with a limit of detection of 1 mg l stable isotopes were analyzed using the high temperature conversion elemental analyzer tc ea method for water analysis with a standard deviation of 0 2 for 2h and 18o 3 4 analytical methods 3 4 1 quantification of the volume of new waters the volume of new waters and percent of total discharge was estimated using a two end mixing model eq 1 based on both cl and ca concentrations it should be noted that the use of ca underestimates the amount of new waters because of the water rock interaction especially in three consecutive events the mass of cl originating from waste water in each event is considered negligible given the significant dilution 1 c n q n dt c b q b dt c m q m dt with q m q n q bwhere c is concentration of cl in rainwater c n in mixed spring water c m and pre event spring water c b q n is newly infiltrated waters q b is baseflow and q m is the mixed spring discharge water based on qn and qb calculated above the total mass of suc and ace k referred to as mmp was estimated using a three end mixing model as follows eq 2 2 m mp c n q n dt c b q b dt c m q m dt c mpm v m c mpn v n c mpb v b m mp m mp c mpm v m c mpb v m v n where c mp is the concentration of the artificial sweetener ace k and suc in the volume of mixed spring water v m volume of precipitated newly infiltrated water v n and pre event waters v b m mp is the new mass of artificial sweetener introduced to the spring the concentration of mp in precipitation water is considered nil moreover a mean transit time t m the time between the start of the rain event and the time where 50 of the mass flux had elapsed at the spring was calculated for each of the four mps and turbidity in events 1 and 2 the variance of the signals mass fluxes with respect to a mean transit time was estimated using eq 3 a low variance is indicative of a higher skewness of the breakthrough curve while a higher variance would imply a longer duration of the compound s breakthrough 3 σ 2 ti t m 2 ci t qi t c t

the mass flux of the mps tu and cl were cross correlated to identify the relationship among spring signals using a cross correlation function ccf where a good correlation was implied when a correlation coefficient r 2 is between 0 7 and 1 and a lag correlation of 0 4 results concentrations of the four investigated mps in river water samples and one waste water sample table 1 doummar and aoun 2018 reveals a higher loading of ace k in the river 53 110 ng l and in waste water 210 000 ng l in addition to iox and gem found at varying concentrations in river and waste water sucralose was not detected in surface water despite its presence in waste water effluents 760 ng l following the four monitored precipitation events four spring responses with varying peak discharges were detected characteristics of the spring responses in the four events are summarized in table 2 and fig 2 the pre event flow rate was 0 29 m3 s during the events the maximum discharge at the spring varied between 2 0 and 11 m3 s with total discharged volumes ranging between 0 3 mm3 to 4 mm3 the higher the response time at the spring with respect to start of rain event the lower the percentage of newly infiltrated waters indicating a lower transit time of phreatic or diffuse waters newly infiltrated waters during the three events constituted between 3 0 and 24 from the total discharged volume in every spring response a turbidity peak is observed simultaneously with a decrease of cl concentrations indicating newly infiltrated waters arriving at the spring in the third event two turbidity peaks can be discerned a primary peak and a secondary peak attributed to a sinking river fig 2 river flood level exceeds baseline level depletion in deuterium 2δh and heavy oxygen 18δo accompanies the first turbidity peaks in all of the events whereas enrichment in the heavy stable isotopes is observed with the secondary turbidity peak out of the 27 tested mps only five were detected in all of the samples including gem iox suc ace k and the cleaning agent 4 nonylphenol possibly due to the high dilution effect it is worth mentioning that substances characterized by a relatively short half life such as diclofenac and ibuprofen were below detection limits 5 and 10 ng l respectively the four investigated mps suc and ace k gem and iox are found in the pre event waters at concentrations 120 78 0 6 10 and 19 0 ng l equivalent to mass fluxes of 0 035 0 023 0 002 0 003 10 3 g s respectively in the first three events three different breakthrough of the artificial sweeteners ace k suc gem and iox can be observed fig 2 maximum concentrations of suc varied in the three events between 290 and 320 ng l while that of ace k varied between 150 and 200 ng l the total mass of ace k and suc arriving at the spring in the three events is shown in table 2 reaching 316 and 430 g of ace k and suc respectively similarly three distinct breakthrough curves of iox and gem can be observed in the spring multi response fig 2 and table 2 the major increase of mass flux for gem and iox occurs during the third event along with the secondary turbidity peak while that of the asws occurs with the primary turbidity peaks in the three events about 10 32 g of suc and 7 15 g of ace k arrived with fast infiltrated waters with the primary turbidity peaks through fast pathways to the spring during event 3 an additional amount of 37 g of ace k was introduced by infiltration from the river while 0 g of suc out of a total of 55 g arrived to the spring with the secondary turbidity peak during the three events 1 0 24 g of gem and 0 5 15 g of iox were estimated at the spring not 1 5 g of iox and 3 5 g of gem arrived with the first three primary peaks the significant load of around 13 g of iox and gem coincided with the secondary turbidity peak in the third event concentrations of suc and ace k detected at the springs are not well synchronized in the observed breakthrough curves as shown in fig 2 moreover ec and cl concentrations do not correlate well with the asws gem or iox fig 3 nevertheless the breakthrough curves of mass fluxes qi ci of asws are very well correlated with primary turbidity peaks in each of the events except for the secondary turbidity a maximum correlation between asws and tu r2 0 99 for ace k and r2 0 97 for suc and asws and cl mass fluxes suc r2 0 99 to ace k r2 0 97 is observed a time lag 0 table 3 fig 4 however the other mps mass fluxes correlate with those of cl and tu with a lag time equals to 1 table 3 fig 4 a negative lag indicates that the predictand precedes the predictor by one lag equivalent to 4 8 h ace k and suc mass fluxes are less correlated with those of gem while they poorly relate to iox despite a lower ratio of ace k to suc in the waste water sample the ratio of ace k to suc consumption during the three events on the catchment is 0 77 fig 5 indicating higher loads of suc with respect to ace k and a possible similar origin of both compounds except when the origin is infiltrated surface water the relationship between of gem and iox mass loads at the spring during the different events can be described linearly by gem 0 86 iox 1 19 r2 0 97 fig 5 because iox can decrease to below detection limits in the spring furthermore a relationship was established between new masses of gem iox and ace k introduced to the spring and the total mass of each mp calculated in each event fig 6 the latter was less applicable in the case of suc the variance of mps breakthrough curves with respect to a mean transit time in events 1 and 2 was evaluated eq 3 fig 7 as a result the variance of ace k breakthrough curve with respect to a mean transit time is slightly higher σ2 0 71 and 0 16 h2 than that of suc σ2 0 68 0 16 h2 tu σ2 0 64 0 15 h2 gem σ2 0 57 0 09 h2 and iox σ2 0 31 0 07 h2 respectively fig 6 event 3 was excluded because of the secondary turbidity peak indicating a varying flux of asws from the river 5 discussion 5 1 origin and mass loads of the selected mps both asws as well as gem are found in the spring during baseline where no active recharge is occurring during the events and post events this indicates that despite the significant dilution the three mps are persistent in the fissured matrix epikarst at high concentrations e g suc 100 ng l corresponding to daily loads of 3 0 2 0 and 0 2 g of suc ace k and gem respectively despite the presence of suc gem and ace k in phreatic waters the mass of the four investigated mps increases substantially during the inflow of fast infiltrated flood waters in the three events varying percentages of newly infiltrated water between 3 0 and 24 from the total volume discharged were accompanied by varying mass loads of mps in the first and second events the fast flow pathways were saturated with highly mineralized pre event water that gets flushed away in the spring s first and second responses the latter can explain the relatively low percentage of new water reaching the spring in the first two events as fast flow pathways become less saturated with stored water a higher volume of flood water is able to infiltrate through sinkholes and dolines to reach the spring in the third event the depletion in stable isotopes e g deuterium observed with every spring response confirms that the origin of the fast flow is located on the dolines plateau on the highlands of the catchment between 1200 and 1500 m in the third event a significant enrichment in deuterium and heavy oxygen observed during the secondary turbidity peak implies an infiltration of additional new waters from a lower recharge area on the catchment 800 m corresponding to the river input via the sinking stream the correlation of turbidity and breakthrough of mps allows the identification of the waste water origin hospital and domestic and the mode of infiltration river versus dolines while suc is arriving mostly through dolines important mass loads of ace k gem and iox are also infiltrating along with surface water from a karst sinking stream along the kalb river the absence of suc in the sinking stream is due either to its absence in the wastewater effluent in the river to suc concentration falling below its relatively high detection limits in river water 100 ng l or to mineralization of suc in soils or river sediments labare and alexander 1993 it is worth mentioning that sucralose was found in the waste water effluent on the catchment area table 1 and in spring water table 2 indicating its high consumption on the catchment area therefore its presence in river samples infiltrating to the spring cannot be completely ruled out on the one hand it has been reported that suc is characterized by a lower likelihood for detection kokotou and thomaidis 2013 subedi and kannan 2014 especially in sludge material typical of non treated wastewater despite that fact oppenheimer et al 2011 considered suc as a very suitable wastewater indicator in septic tanks but suggested the evaluation of suc transport under natural conditions additionally the added asws mass loads event through direct rain infiltration except for the infiltrated surface water correlate linearly indicating that they have the same origin infiltrating from point source waste water with a definite ratio of suc to ace k and a rapid infiltration to the saturated zone in all of the events the persistence of asws more specifically ace k in the phreatic zone could also originate from slow continuous infiltration from the river into groundwater through bank filtrates which is enhanced during high flow periods engelhardt et al 2013 the correlation between mass fluxes of gem and iox may indicate a similar origin for the two mps as well 5 2 correlation of mps and in situ parameters measured at the spring since the asws mass fluxes and those of cl correlate to a high extent cl corrected for flow rate could allow the quantification of the mass flux concentrations of the two asws at the spring cl mass and tu fluxes correlate less with gem and almost at no time with iox indicating a less conservative behavior of iox with respect to the three other mps the short term breakthrough of the contrast media is most probably related to sporadic point source hospital effluents and its limited release on the catchment the comparison of the normalized breakthrough curves with respect to peak concentration and transit time for the first two events show that the breakthrough of turbidity ace k suc and gem are well synchronized the slightly higher variance of ace k breakthrough curve with respect to that of suc and turbidity could be reflective of a longer duration of breakthrough potentially attributed to varying transport processes e g dispersion moreover even if not detectable in the chemograph or hydrograph an additional input of mass flux from a point source contamination such as the river in the case of ace k could also explain the tailing effect observed in events 1 and 2 studies have shown that ace k showed no retardation in porous aquifers with respect to carbamazepine stempvoort et al 2013 or in karst aquifers with respect to another asw such as cyclamate and sodium fluorescein hillebrand et al 2015 however a higher sorption to suspended particulate matter of ace k was observed by subedi and kannan 2014 nevertheless since the breakthrough curve is resulting from convolved multiple peaks of asws mass fluxes transport parameters such as dispersion cannot be calculated for each of the mps iox appears to be poorly synchronized with the cl mass and turbidity fluxes therefore tu and cl could be considered less associated with the breakthrough of the contrast media especially with the observed lag time finally the secondary turbidity peak originating from the river input coincided solely with a breakthrough of ace k gem and iox showing that suc is a poor indicator of infiltrated river water in this case 5 3 suitability of the mps as waste water indicators a suitable waste water indicator is characterized by 1 its persistence against degradation and decay in an aquifer system and in treatment plants 2 its common usage for specific purposes and 3 its occurrence above detection limits clara et al 2009 based on spring baseline concentrations ace k gem and suc are persistent in the aquifer during baseflow and during the events moreover this study reveals that ace k can be considered a good domestic waste water indicator in the natural environment because its breakthrough is concordant with all the turbidity signals and the arrival of infiltrating waste water into the spring from both surface water and fast infiltration pathways after a precipitation event for the same reasons suc appears also to be a suitable waste water indicator except for surface water effluents due to its high detection limits additionally gem appears to be a suitable waste water indicator especially for transport of river water into groundwater in this particular case finally the breakthrough of iox is relatively short at the spring with respect to the other investigated mps indicating a rather limited release in waste water therefore it can be regarded as an indicator of hospital effluents for short term breakthrough events on the other hand ace k and suc correlate very well with cl mass and tu fluxes therefore the combination of easily monitored parameters at the spring such as cl and tu can be used to predict concentrations and duration of breakthrough of these asws as waste water indicators which is essential for contamination management purposes mass fluxes of gem and iox correlate less with cl and tu thus these two parameters cannot fully portray the breakthrough of the lipid regulator and contrast media as domestic or hospital waste water indicators 6 conclusions in this work the concentrations of the two artificial sweeteners suc and ace k along with a contrast media iox and lipid regulator gem were monitored following three consecutive rain events most of the investigated mps are persistent in the matrix during low flow periods they are further introduced with infiltrated flood waters through fast flow pathways e g dolines which explain the observed peaks of mps despite the relative high dilution an additional secondary peak of gem iox and ace k was observed in the third event indicating rapid infiltration of waste water from contaminated river water given that a suitable waste water indicator is defined by its persistence in groundwater storage and its particular origin such as hospital waste for iox therefore the four mps ace k suc gem and to a lesser extent iox can be envisaged as indicators of waste water originating from various sources autochthonous versus allochthonous sources however suc breakthrough curve fails to reflect the infiltration of contaminated river water into the spring either because suc falls below the detection limits or because of its controversial absence in surface water samples additionally a good waste water indicator is characterized by a high likelihood of detection because of its predominant usage on the catchment or high resolution of detection the analytical limits of each of gem ace k and iox are below 10 0 ng l while that of suc is 100 ng l thus decreasing its likelihood of detection unless present at relatively high concentrations high mass fluxes nevertheless suc is to become a promising indicator for fast infiltrated groundwater given its increasing usage on the gw catchment area over other artificial sweeteners the mps slightly varying transport behaviors consumption loads and potential origin are reflected in their breakthrough s concentrations peak concentrations and duration at the spring the mass flux of tu and cl are strongly correlated with those of the two asws and to a lesser extent with gem while iox appear to be less reliable because of its sporadic and short breakthrough additionally this correlation between asws and parameters that are easily measured in situ at the spring can be used to predict the breakthrough of suc and ace k as waste water indicators and thus be reflective of the specific variable spring vulnerability finally a long term monitoring of these selected mps and parameters such as chloride turbidity or bacteriological contamination can help validate the results under varying flow periods acknowledgement this work was funded by a usaid peer science project award number 102881 cycle 3 the authors would also like to thank fouad andari

1648,the theory for modeling non equilibrium solute transport in porous media is still based on approximations to a model proposed by lapidus and amundson in 1952 that has not been updated this mobile immobile model mim is based on the definition of a mass transfer coefficient α which has been proven subject to some severe limitations measurements at both laboratory and field scales have demonstrated the scale dependency of α values this means that the mim theory fails in real applications since α is not constant as defined in the kinetic model theory but is a time residence or distance dependent coefficient multi rate mass transfer models have been proposed in recent literature to capture real world solute transport with a multiple mass transfer in this study we propose a novel model which implements the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion directly in the nonequilibrium advection dispersion equation of solute transport in porous media new model solutions properly fitted data collected during tracer tests carried out at the cnr irsa laboratory bari italy in a horizontal sandbox 2 m of length by using sodium chloride as the conservative tracer selected breakthrough curves at specific positions were used to validate the proposed model solution and estimate both conventional and proposed coefficients of mass transfer results have shown a decreasing trend of α from 0 09 to 0 04 h 1 after about 1 2 m of filtration for the investigated sand whereas new solutions provide two scale invariant tracer coefficients of rate of tracer mass transfer 0 004 0 005 h 1 and of tracer time delay 1 19 0 01 the proposed model performs very well since it provides a readily solved analytical solution with respect to the conventional mim results of the proposed mim are very similar to those provided by the conventional mim the new model solution can be implemented in particle tracking or random walk software in order to solve two dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport in groundwater keywords mobile immobile transport model fick s solution invariant mass transfer rate coefficient 1 introduction mass transfer by diffusion has significant impacts on the mobility of contaminants in groundwater and many laboratory investigations have been undertaken previously with the aim of studying the phenomenon under different conditions and constraints bouchard et al 1988 brusseau 1992 ptacek and gillham 1992 impressive field studies have also been carried out by goltz and roberts 1986 1988 in order to extend the known one dimensional analytical solution of the problem to three dimensional space which can be helpful in applying mim solutions to field conditions at a field scale pang and close 1999 observed a reduction of the mass transfer coefficient with increasing distance travelled by the tracer and related residence time contaminant diffusion from mobile to immobile water and vice versa has been studied by jaynes et al 1995 who developed an experimental method for measuring both the immobile and the mobile fractions of soil water content and the mass transfer coefficient α this latter study was based on a sequence of infiltration tests of conservative anionic tracers such as br pentalluorobenzoate 0 trifluoromethylbenzoate and 2 6 difluorobenzoate through a tension infiltrometer the measurements of the total solute concentrations in the core soil columns nicollet loam and clay loam positioned at the base of the soil column allowed the authors to estimate values of α ranging from 0 030 h 1 to 0 014 h 1 the aforementioned studies highlight limitations related to laboratory derived mass transfer coefficients especially when the conventional fickian mim is applied to non equilibrium problems of solute transport in a porous medium at a field scale in fact comparison of experimental results at both laboratory and field scales goltz and roberts 1986 brusseau et al 1991 ball and roberts 1991 quinodoz and valocchi 1993 maraqa et al 1999 has revealed an apparent scale effect on the estimation of mass transfer coefficients because the conventional non equilibrium model of solute transport uses an approximate semi empirical equation rao et al 1980 to explain the diffusive solute exchange between mobile and immobile water zones other authors have also demonstrated a correlation between pore water velocity and mobile immobile solute mass transfer rate during filtration e g maraqa 2001 rao et al 1980 proved that the mass transfer coefficient α is time residence or scale dependent by jointly applying the solution of the diffusion equation and the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion to porous ceramic spheres schumer et al 2003 highlighted that several field tests provided breakthrough curves characterized by power law tails that resulted from persistent very low concentrations consequently the latter authors proposed a new mim to describe this behavior based on the fractal retention time by applying a power law memory function to the distribution of rate coefficients that is scale invariant in time and leads to a fractional time derivative in the transport equation more recently benson and meerschaert 2009 extended the above fractal approach to simulate the general multi rate mass transfer mrmt equation where a memory function is identified as proportional to the probability that a solute particle remains in the immobile state for a period greater than an assigned time t this also defines the rate at which particles trapped in the immobile zone for a time greater than t become mobile in fractured media geiger et al 2010 suggested that classical dual porosity or mobile immobile approach in conjunction with an advection dispersion equation and macroscopic dispersivity was often inadequate whereas the continuous time random walk numerical model could take into account the mrmt between mobile and immobile regions some examples related to structured interacting continua were proposed by babey et al 2015 who introduced a spatial structure of immobile porosity varying from a simple line of dead end pores to more complex clusters of poorly connected fracture patterns and validated their numerical method which is equivalent to the mrmt model solutions the aforementioned considerations made us aware that some theoretical improvements of the semi empirical conventional mim are needed when simulating non equilibrium pollutant transport in saturated soils in order to consider the scale dependence of the pollutant or solute transfer between pore water mobile and stagnant water immobile porosity structure i e thickness in the present work a novel mim is presented and tested this model introduces a scale invariant coefficient of the mass transfer rate λ and a time delay coefficient td which is macroscopically representative of the dead end pore structure between the injection and the observation section tracer filtration tests were carried out with a saline tracer nacl in a horizontal column of river sand i e sandbox at the laboratories of the water research institute cnr irsa located in bari italy changes of the conventional mass transfer coefficient α with distance from the injection site were highlighted by the observed breakthrough curves btcs finally the resulting btcs from the step injection test were used to assess the new mim solutions and the value of the related mass transfer coefficient λ 2 theory the proposed mim considering a one dimensional mobile water flow along the horizontal x axis the mechanistic model derived from fick s second law of solute diffusion in a stagnant film along a perpendicular i e vertical direction z can be written as 1 c t d 2 c 2 z where c ml 3 is the dissolved solute concentration d l 2 t 1 is the diffusion coefficient and z is the distance of immobile water diffusion along the vertical axis into the stagnant film crank 1975 crank 1975 p 13 14 and coats and smith 1964 provided the analytical solution of the diffusion eq 1 by considering the diffusing concentration c 0 in an element of width z to be a line source of strength c 0 z by using the same solution for the flowing water from the source of the mobile solute mass transferred into the immobile water constant film of thickness z0 during time interval t we may state 1a c im c

to immobile water during time t while water is flowing horizontally in a porous medium in particular we suppose that during t the solute concentration will increase within the immobile water layer of thickness z 0 as 2 c im t t c m t t c 0 im t t erfc z 0 2 d t where c 0im t is the initial increase of the immobile water concentration which is a time dependent function c m and c im are the mobile

dependence of mass transfer by means of coefficient td which can be easily estimated from the position of the inflection point of btc furthermore eq 4 are easier to solve analytically than the conventional mim which requires modified bessel function abramowitz and stegun 1972 p 428 or complex numerical methods such as fractal time models to be applied the solution of eq 4 requires the definition of the initial increase of immobile water content c 0im due to mobile immobile solute mass transfer at each time step in order to overcome such a need we define the new coefficient of mass

it defines the proposed kinetic model 7 td 1 c 0 im t λ td c m after substituting eq 7 into eq 4 and rewriting the latter in lagrangian form we obtain 8 d c m x t dt λ c m x t which can also be rewritten as 9 d c m x t c m x t λdt eq 9 can easily be integrated to obtain 10 c m x t c m x 0 t exp λ t where at a given position x 0 t the maximum fraction c m x 0 t of injected solute concentration c 0 which arrives at the outlet section can be estimated from the probability density function of the moving particle pathways using the particle tracking technique masciopinto et al 2010 or the random walk method berkowitz et al 2008 however for one dimensional water flow the analytical solution van genuchten and alves 1982 can easily be applied to estimate c m x 0 t after which the effective velocity u td and the effective hydrodynamic dispersion coefficient dh td can be estimated finally by substituting solution 10 into eq 1a we may obtain the distribution of maximum i e

mim the coefficient of solute mass transfer can be easily determined by inverting eq 10 12 λ 1 t ln c m x t c m x 0 t where the solute concentration c m x t is derived from the btcs and the values of c m x 0 t are estimated by means of the analytical solution of the conventional one dimensional flow and transport equation van genuchten and alves 1982 as a function of the observed effective velocity and dispersion coefficient it should be noted that due to the lagrangian form of the eq 12 its application is valid for simulation times t t 1 where t 1 is the time required by the majority of the solute particles to arrive at the observation cross section x 0 3 2 conventional mim the conventional semi empirical mim rao et al 1980 usually adopted to describe the rate of solute transfer

respectively 13 θ im c im t α c m c im where α t 1 is the coefficient of mass transfer of kinetic rate eq 13 in this work we assume near equilibrium conditions by the following linear approximation 14

in porous media and for non zero k values it should be noted that eq 17 provides α when k 1 which indicates an instantaneous solute exchange between mobile and immobile water on the opposite when θ im 0 and k 0 it results in α 0 which indicates equilibrium without mass transfer as for eq 12 eq 17 can be applied to describe the non equilibrium transport of a conservative tracer nacl in a uniform horizontal column of saturated sand such as the one presented in this work by using conventional nonequilibrium solutions proposed by the scientific literature coats and smith 1964 van genuchten and wierenga 1976 4 experimental equipment a glass fiber reinforced plastic tank length 4 0 m cross section 0 5 0 5 m2 was used for the filtration tests the tank was equipped with a series of ½ inch plexiglas tubes at 0 25 m intervals for monitoring the piezometric heads fig 1 four cross sections were equipped with six thermal conductivity probes arranged appropriately along the arms of a cross in the mid section of the expected flow fig 2 the central part of the tank was successively filled with uniform layers of sand from the ticino river northern italy bed this sand characterized by a homogeneous granular size of about 2 0 mm was packed into the tank and left to consolidate for about six months under variable watering conditions a constant water gradient of 13 0 mm between the upstream and downstream reservoirs was assured by two peristaltic pumps that guaranteed identical inlet and outlet flows preliminary hydraulic tests were undertaken to determine the mean hydraulic conductivity k 4 66 10 3 m s 1 by inverting the flow equation under a constant tap water flow rate of 282 2 cm3 min 1 and a specific discharge q 0 182 cm min 1 or 262 cm d furthermore core samples of sand were also investigated to determine the total water content θ 40 5 and the fractions of immobile θ im 7 3 and mobile water θ m 33 3 of the considered sand it should be noticed that lumped parameters such as θ m and θ im estimated in sand cores represent constant averages at a laboratory scale of phenomena occurring at pore scale which can vary with the flow rate and structure of dead end pores in this work filtration tracer tests were performed using a low nacl concentration 1 g l of injectant solution in order to reduce density effects during the tests the injection of the tracer solution was conducted via a perforated ½ inch plexiglas pipe and produced in initial concentration of 0 5 g l into the water of pipe this was placed in a hole drilled at the center of the cross section 0 5 0 5 m2 distant 0 1 m from the upstream box wall to ensure a uniform distribution of the injected tracer throughout the whole vertical saturated flow cross section y z the filtration tests were performed at constant water temperature 20 c and the nacl water concentrations were determined by measuring the electrical conductivities of water over time with a detection limit of 25 mgl 1 the electrical conductivity or resistivity sensors were made by combining a single inexpensive 100 00 us pt100 temperature sensor 100 ω ad59 0 k type see minco usa or westeam italy coupled with two self made electrodes electric wires treated with a platinizing solution ysi 3139 kit these probes measured changes in water temperature and electrical conductivity at the pore scale and at given time step i e 6 7 min electric signals from the probes were recorded by a data logger hp3497a which converted each signal to a digital number by a multiplexer all data were stored on a personal computer each probe was calibrated before starting the tests to guarantee reliable data acquisition and transformation in sodium chloride concentrations fig 3 shows a three dimensional representation of the tracer plume during the step injection test at 1 and 11 h after the injection started 5 test results the kinetic model 13 was proposed by lapidus and amundson 1952 by assuming that solute mass transfer occurs only in dead end pores or immobile zones of the soil column van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in such zones the slow diffusion process allows continuous exchanges of the solute mass with water flowing in the mobile zone of the porous medium which means that eq 13 agrees well with the continuity equation during non equilibrium transport only for solute exchanges that are mainly attributable to diffusive processes i e when advection dispersion exchanges of solute concentrations are negligible fig 4 shows the btcs of nacl concentrations during a step tracer injection test and the sections of each btc that were used for estimating α by means of eq 17 by examining a btc of mobile tracer concentrations due to the step increase of 0 5 g l the injected tracer conservative concentration eq 17 was applied during time interval δt when the advective dispersive tracer exchanges were considered negligible with respect to diffusive transfer this particular condition can be assumed for a step tracer injection when the restitution curves reach a plateau similarly for a pulse tracer injection eq 17 can provide appropriate estimations of α only at the tail of the restitution curves we selected the probes positioned at the intersection of the cross arms at each of the four equipped sections figs 1 and 2 because they provided better measurements during the tests it should be noted that the water flow and tracer transport during filtration test occurred mainly in the x direction which is the prevalent inflow direction fig 4 also shows an undesired effect that became evident about 8 h after the beginning of the test at this time the plateau of the btcs started growing slightly again showing that a wall effect affects the solute transport within the box in fact due to the inability of the tracer to expand beyond the tank walls laterally and below the plateau of the btc is not steady over time due to this wall effect the btcs should be truncated about 8 9 h after the solute s first appearance at each cross section table 1 reports the α mean values related to the step injection test at each measurement section and the sequence of steps carried out to calculate them at succeeding δt once the resident time t r has been estimated at the inflection point of each btc the tracer residence time defined the effective velocity of the mobile tracer u eff x 0 t r and it allowed td estimation from the ratio of velocities td u u eff by imposing the constant water velocity u i e q θm 0 33 m h at each cross section in the sandbox table 1 in order to estimate α the value of dimensionless coefficient k of eq 14 has been previously calculated by means of the following equation table 2 18 k td 1 θ im θ m eq 18 leads us to affirm that the maximum value of td is achievable when k 1 and α 19 td max 1 θ im θ m which is equivalent to the value 1 21 derived from eq 4a for instantaneous mass transfer i e z 0 0 or λ the values of α in table 2 show the scale effect of such a coefficient since it decreases from 0 09 h 1 in the first cross section to a value of 0 03 0 04 h 1 at 1 0 1 4 m from the point of tracer injection however the wall effect mentioned above affected the value of α computed at the last cross section x 1 4 which was slightly larger than the expected the values of α have been interpolated with the following power function of residence times t r 20 α 0 05 t r 0 57 by means of the software application tablecurve 2d v 5 01 sistat software inc ca and it approaches the linear trend with mean value of 0 06 0 03 h 1 this coefficient is close to the values 0 030 to 0 014 h 1 determined by jaynes et al 1995 for loam and clay loam soils finally table 2 also reports the values of λ td and z 0 estimated by means of eq 12 at each of the four measurement cross sections of the step injection test 6 new mim solutions and discussion the aforementioned data of the step injection tracer test of sodium chloride have also been used to validate the performance of the new mim model in eq 4 a software application implemented in matlab the mathworks inc environment was used to obtain the best fit solution 10 of eq 4 to the experimental filtration test results fig 5 these solutions apply a residence time and scale invariant λ value of 0 005 h 1 as reported in table 2 it should be noted that td is a constant coefficient 1 19 0 01 and it might have a slightly variation due to the change of dead end pore structure i e the stagnant film thickness of the studied soil column in particular during the laboratory tests although such changes of dead end pore structure caused variations of up to 38 of the average z0 133 μm layer thickness only minimal changes 0 7 on average of the mean value of td see table 2 were observed in practice the observed variability of td is smaller than the intrinsic approximation related to the soil porosity measurements 3 5 on the contrary the estimated α values see table 2 show a decreasing trend with distance from 0 09 to 0 03 0 04 h 1 i e up to 67 which highlights the residence time or scale dependency of such a coefficient 6 1 comparison between conventional and new mim solutions fig 6 shows the influence of the coefficient of mass transfer on mobile solute transport by comparing the new solutions 10 with the conventional mim solutions given by coats and smith 1964 which simulate the step injection of nacl in apparent soil columns of 0 4 m of length with immobile porosity of 0 14 and effective porosity of 0 26 under a constant water flow of 38 46 cm d 1 the solutions of the proposed mim provided λ and td values suitable to obtain the curves that best approximate the coats and smith s solutions for the non equilibrium transport of the sodium chloride in the modeled soil columns the reader should consider that the above comparison which is similar to that proposed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 p 478 effectively shows how the changes in α or λ can affect the solutions of mim when other variables and parameters i e water velocity θ m and θ im are assumed to be invariant fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis on the immobile solute concentration estimation with respect to the change of the time step t from 0 01 h to 0 1 h at the selected simulation time t 3 5 h t as reported in fig 5 fig 7 shows that no changes of the solute immobile concentrations can be noted by changing t during the plateau of the mobile btcs whereas a c im maximum change of 6 7 has been noted on the ascending line of solute mobile concentration as in the section at x 0 9 m see fig 5 the solution of eq 4 can be also determined in heterogeneous porous media by applying eq 10 to a generic horizontal x y t flow pathway of the solute particle into flowing water in this case specific numerical methods such as particle tracking or the random walk geiger et al 2010 berkowitz et al 2008 are required to determine 2d flow pathways to which we may apply the non equilibrium solute transport solution 10 7 conclusions this study proposes an innovative mim capable of describing the impact of mobile immobile mass transfer on the transport of contaminants in porous media in non equilibrium conditions using a scale invariant mass transfer coefficient λ a horizontal permeameter was assembled to study the non equilibrium flow and transport of a conservative solute in a saturated porous medium the values of the mass transfer coefficient α defined by using the conventional mim are affected by a scale effect since α decreased by up to 67 of its initial value 0 09 h 1 for increasing distances from the injection in particular α values for ticino river sand approach a straight line with a mean value of 0 06 0 03 h 1 which is close to values from 0 03 to 0 014 h 1 determined by jaynes et al 1995 for loam and clay loam soils in order to overcome the above theoretical limitation of the conventional mim approach a new mim is proposed in this paper which includes the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion directly into the non equilibrium solute flow and transport equation the new mim positively fits the experimental btcs derived from laboratory tests by replacing the coefficient of mass transfer α with the new scale invariant rate of mass transfer λ and the new dimensionless coefficient td test results provided practically constant values of td 1 19 0 01 and λ 0 005 0004 in four observation cross sections although z 0 changed from 70 to 195 μm this is because z 0 variability into the sand horizontal column produced only smoothed changes in td since the θ im θ m ratio dominates td estimations the new mim also allows an impressive simplification of the governing advection dispersion equation and on its analytical solution making it very suitable for studying solute transport under non equilibrium conditions when considering one dimensional vertical water flow and non equilibrium chloride transport in simulated sand columns the new mim provides analytical solutions at assigned td and λ that well approximate more complex solutions of conventional mim for different α values that apply modified bessel functions the proposed mim one dimensional solution is very simple to apply it can be implemented in numerical techniques such as the particle tracking or random walk capable of solving two or three dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport problems along groundwater flow pathways using the lagrangian approach forthcoming studies will focus on field implementation of new mim to solve two dimensional vertical problems of solutes transport in unsaturated saturated fractures research data data collected during filtration tests carried out at the irsa bari laboratory can be requested from the authors by e mail 
1648,the theory for modeling non equilibrium solute transport in porous media is still based on approximations to a model proposed by lapidus and amundson in 1952 that has not been updated this mobile immobile model mim is based on the definition of a mass transfer coefficient α which has been proven subject to some severe limitations measurements at both laboratory and field scales have demonstrated the scale dependency of α values this means that the mim theory fails in real applications since α is not constant as defined in the kinetic model theory but is a time residence or distance dependent coefficient multi rate mass transfer models have been proposed in recent literature to capture real world solute transport with a multiple mass transfer in this study we propose a novel model which implements the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion directly in the nonequilibrium advection dispersion equation of solute transport in porous media new model solutions properly fitted data collected during tracer tests carried out at the cnr irsa laboratory bari italy in a horizontal sandbox 2 m of length by using sodium chloride as the conservative tracer selected breakthrough curves at specific positions were used to validate the proposed model solution and estimate both conventional and proposed coefficients of mass transfer results have shown a decreasing trend of α from 0 09 to 0 04 h 1 after about 1 2 m of filtration for the investigated sand whereas new solutions provide two scale invariant tracer coefficients of rate of tracer mass transfer 0 004 0 005 h 1 and of tracer time delay 1 19 0 01 the proposed model performs very well since it provides a readily solved analytical solution with respect to the conventional mim results of the proposed mim are very similar to those provided by the conventional mim the new model solution can be implemented in particle tracking or random walk software in order to solve two dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport in groundwater keywords mobile immobile transport model fick s solution invariant mass transfer rate coefficient 1 introduction mass transfer by diffusion has significant impacts on the mobility of contaminants in groundwater and many laboratory investigations have been undertaken previously with the aim of studying the phenomenon under different conditions and constraints bouchard et al 1988 brusseau 1992 ptacek and gillham 1992 impressive field studies have also been carried out by goltz and roberts 1986 1988 in order to extend the known one dimensional analytical solution of the problem to three dimensional space which can be helpful in applying mim solutions to field conditions at a field scale pang and close 1999 observed a reduction of the mass transfer coefficient with increasing distance travelled by the tracer and related residence time contaminant diffusion from mobile to immobile water and vice versa has been studied by jaynes et al 1995 who developed an experimental method for measuring both the immobile and the mobile fractions of soil water content and the mass transfer coefficient α this latter study was based on a sequence of infiltration tests of conservative anionic tracers such as br pentalluorobenzoate 0 trifluoromethylbenzoate and 2 6 difluorobenzoate through a tension infiltrometer the measurements of the total solute concentrations in the core soil columns nicollet loam and clay loam positioned at the base of the soil column allowed the authors to estimate values of α ranging from 0 030 h 1 to 0 014 h 1 the aforementioned studies highlight limitations related to laboratory derived mass transfer coefficients especially when the conventional fickian mim is applied to non equilibrium problems of solute transport in a porous medium at a field scale in fact comparison of experimental results at both laboratory and field scales goltz and roberts 1986 brusseau et al 1991 ball and roberts 1991 quinodoz and valocchi 1993 maraqa et al 1999 has revealed an apparent scale effect on the estimation of mass transfer coefficients because the conventional non equilibrium model of solute transport uses an approximate semi empirical equation rao et al 1980 to explain the diffusive solute exchange between mobile and immobile water zones other authors have also demonstrated a correlation between pore water velocity and mobile immobile solute mass transfer rate during filtration e g maraqa 2001 rao et al 1980 proved that the mass transfer coefficient α is time residence or scale dependent by jointly applying the solution of the diffusion equation and the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion to porous ceramic spheres schumer et al 2003 highlighted that several field tests provided breakthrough curves characterized by power law tails that resulted from persistent very low concentrations consequently the latter authors proposed a new mim to describe this behavior based on the fractal retention time by applying a power law memory function to the distribution of rate coefficients that is scale invariant in time and leads to a fractional time derivative in the transport equation more recently benson and meerschaert 2009 extended the above fractal approach to simulate the general multi rate mass transfer mrmt equation where a memory function is identified as proportional to the probability that a solute particle remains in the immobile state for a period greater than an assigned time t this also defines the rate at which particles trapped in the immobile zone for a time greater than t become mobile in fractured media geiger et al 2010 suggested that classical dual porosity or mobile immobile approach in conjunction with an advection dispersion equation and macroscopic dispersivity was often inadequate whereas the continuous time random walk numerical model could take into account the mrmt between mobile and immobile regions some examples related to structured interacting continua were proposed by babey et al 2015 who introduced a spatial structure of immobile porosity varying from a simple line of dead end pores to more complex clusters of poorly connected fracture patterns and validated their numerical method which is equivalent to the mrmt model solutions the aforementioned considerations made us aware that some theoretical improvements of the semi empirical conventional mim are needed when simulating non equilibrium pollutant transport in saturated soils in order to consider the scale dependence of the pollutant or solute transfer between pore water mobile and stagnant water immobile porosity structure i e thickness in the present work a novel mim is presented and tested this model introduces a scale invariant coefficient of the mass transfer rate λ and a time delay coefficient td which is macroscopically representative of the dead end pore structure between the injection and the observation section tracer filtration tests were carried out with a saline tracer nacl in a horizontal column of river sand i e sandbox at the laboratories of the water research institute cnr irsa located in bari italy changes of the conventional mass transfer coefficient α with distance from the injection site were highlighted by the observed breakthrough curves btcs finally the resulting btcs from the step injection test were used to assess the new mim solutions and the value of the related mass transfer coefficient λ 2 theory the proposed mim considering a one dimensional mobile water flow along the horizontal x axis the mechanistic model derived from fick s second law of solute diffusion in a stagnant film along a perpendicular i e vertical direction z can be written as 1 c t d 2 c 2 z where c ml 3 is the dissolved solute concentration d l 2 t 1 is the diffusion coefficient and z is the distance of immobile water diffusion along the vertical axis into the stagnant film crank 1975 crank 1975 p 13 14 and coats and smith 1964 provided the analytical solution of the diffusion eq 1 by considering the diffusing concentration c 0 in an element of width z to be a line source of strength c 0 z by using the same solution for the flowing water from the source of the mobile solute mass transferred into the immobile water constant film of thickness z0 during time interval t we may state 1a c im c

thickness z 0 as 2 c im t t c m t t c 0 im t t erfc z 0 2 d t where c 0im t is the initial increase of the immobile water concentration which is a time dependent function c m and c im are the mobile

sand were also investigated to determine the total water content θ 40 5 and the fractions of immobile θ im 7 3 and mobile water θ m 33 3 of the considered sand it should be noticed that lumped parameters such as θ m and θ im estimated in sand cores represent constant averages at a laboratory scale of phenomena occurring at pore scale which can vary with the flow rate and structure of dead end pores in this work filtration tracer tests were performed using a low nacl concentration 1 g l of injectant solution in order to reduce density effects during the tests the injection of the tracer solution was conducted via a perforated ½ inch plexiglas pipe and produced in initial concentration of 0 5 g l into the water of pipe this was placed in a hole drilled at the center of the cross section 0 5 0 5 m2 distant 0 1 m from the upstream box wall to ensure a uniform distribution of the injected tracer throughout the whole vertical saturated flow cross section y z the filtration tests were performed at constant water temperature 20 c and the nacl water concentrations were determined by measuring the electrical conductivities of water over time with a detection limit of 25 mgl 1 the electrical conductivity or resistivity sensors were made by combining a single inexpensive 100 00 us pt100 temperature sensor 100 ω ad59 0 k type see minco usa or westeam italy coupled with two self made electrodes electric wires treated with a platinizing solution ysi 3139 kit these probes measured changes in water temperature and electrical conductivity at the pore scale and at given time step i e 6 7 min electric signals from the probes were recorded by a data logger hp3497a which converted each signal to a digital number by a multiplexer all data were stored on a personal computer each probe was calibrated before starting the tests to guarantee reliable data acquisition and transformation in sodium chloride concentrations fig 3 shows a three dimensional representation of the tracer plume during the step injection test at 1 and 11 h after the injection started 5 test results the kinetic model 13 was proposed by lapidus and amundson 1952 by assuming that solute mass transfer occurs only in dead end pores or immobile zones of the soil column van genuchten and wierenga 1976 in such zones the slow diffusion process allows continuous exchanges of the solute mass with water flowing in the mobile zone of the porous medium which means that eq 13 agrees well with the continuity equation during non equilibrium transport only for solute exchanges that are mainly attributable to diffusive processes i e when advection dispersion exchanges of solute concentrations are negligible fig 4 shows the btcs of nacl concentrations during a step tracer injection test and the sections of each btc that were used for estimating α by means of eq 17 by examining a btc of mobile tracer concentrations due to the step increase of 0 5 g l the injected tracer conservative concentration eq 17 was applied during time interval δt when the advective dispersive tracer exchanges were considered negligible with respect to diffusive transfer this particular condition can be assumed for a step tracer injection when the restitution curves reach a plateau similarly for a pulse tracer injection eq 17 can provide appropriate estimations of α only at the tail of the restitution curves we selected the probes positioned at the intersection of the cross arms at each of the four equipped sections figs 1 and 2 because they provided better measurements during the tests it should be noted that the water flow and tracer transport during filtration test occurred mainly in the x direction which is the prevalent inflow direction fig 4 also shows an undesired effect that became evident about 8 h after the beginning of the test at this time the plateau of the btcs started growing slightly again showing that a wall effect affects the solute transport within the box in fact due to the inability of the tracer to expand beyond the tank walls laterally and below the plateau of the btc is not steady over time due to this wall effect the btcs should be truncated about 8 9 h after the solute s first appearance at each cross section table 1 reports the α mean values related to the step injection test at each measurement section and the sequence of steps carried out to calculate them at succeeding δt once the resident time t r has been estimated at the inflection point of each btc the tracer residence time defined the effective velocity of the mobile tracer u eff x 0 t r and it allowed td estimation from the ratio of velocities td u u eff by imposing the constant water velocity u i e q θm 0 33 m h at each cross section in the sandbox table 1 in order to estimate α the value of dimensionless coefficient k of eq 14 has been previously calculated by means of the following equation table 2 18 k td 1 θ im θ m eq 18 leads us to affirm that the maximum value of td is achievable when k 1 and α 19 td max 1 θ im θ m which is equivalent to the value 1 21 derived from eq 4a for instantaneous mass transfer i e z 0 0 or λ the values of α in table 2 show the scale effect of such a coefficient since it decreases from 0 09 h 1 in the first cross section to a value of 0 03 0 04 h 1 at 1 0 1 4 m from the point of tracer injection however the wall effect mentioned above affected the value of α computed at the last cross section x 1 4 which was slightly larger than the expected the values of α have been interpolated with the following power function of residence times t r 20 α 0 05 t r 0 57 by means of the software application tablecurve 2d v 5 01 sistat software inc ca and it approaches the linear trend with mean value of 0 06 0 03 h 1 this coefficient is close to the values 0 030 to 0 014 h 1 determined by jaynes et al 1995 for loam and clay loam soils finally table 2 also reports the values of λ td and z 0 estimated by means of eq 12 at each of the four measurement cross sections of the step injection test 6 new mim solutions and discussion the aforementioned data of the step injection tracer test of sodium chloride have also been used to validate the performance of the new mim model in eq 4 a software application implemented in matlab the mathworks inc environment was used to obtain the best fit solution 10 of eq 4 to the experimental filtration test results fig 5 these solutions apply a residence time and scale invariant λ value of 0 005 h 1 as reported in table 2 it should be noted that td is a constant coefficient 1 19 0 01 and it might have a slightly variation due to the change of dead end pore structure i e the stagnant film thickness of the studied soil column in particular during the laboratory tests although such changes of dead end pore structure caused variations of up to 38 of the average z0 133 μm layer thickness only minimal changes 0 7 on average of the mean value of td see table 2 were observed in practice the observed variability of td is smaller than the intrinsic approximation related to the soil porosity measurements 3 5 on the contrary the estimated α values see table 2 show a decreasing trend with distance from 0 09 to 0 03 0 04 h 1 i e up to 67 which highlights the residence time or scale dependency of such a coefficient 6 1 comparison between conventional and new mim solutions fig 6 shows the influence of the coefficient of mass transfer on mobile solute transport by comparing the new solutions 10 with the conventional mim solutions given by coats and smith 1964 which simulate the step injection of nacl in apparent soil columns of 0 4 m of length with immobile porosity of 0 14 and effective porosity of 0 26 under a constant water flow of 38 46 cm d 1 the solutions of the proposed mim provided λ and td values suitable to obtain the curves that best approximate the coats and smith s solutions for the non equilibrium transport of the sodium chloride in the modeled soil columns the reader should consider that the above comparison which is similar to that proposed by van genuchten and wierenga 1976 p 478 effectively shows how the changes in α or λ can affect the solutions of mim when other variables and parameters i e water velocity θ m and θ im are assumed to be invariant fig 7 shows the sensitivity analysis on the immobile solute concentration estimation with respect to the change of the time step t from 0 01 h to 0 1 h at the selected simulation time t 3 5 h t as reported in fig 5 fig 7 shows that no changes of the solute immobile concentrations can be noted by changing t during the plateau of the mobile btcs whereas a c im maximum change of 6 7 has been noted on the ascending line of solute mobile concentration as in the section at x 0 9 m see fig 5 the solution of eq 4 can be also determined in heterogeneous porous media by applying eq 10 to a generic horizontal x y t flow pathway of the solute particle into flowing water in this case specific numerical methods such as particle tracking or the random walk geiger et al 2010 berkowitz et al 2008 are required to determine 2d flow pathways to which we may apply the non equilibrium solute transport solution 10 7 conclusions this study proposes an innovative mim capable of describing the impact of mobile immobile mass transfer on the transport of contaminants in porous media in non equilibrium conditions using a scale invariant mass transfer coefficient λ a horizontal permeameter was assembled to study the non equilibrium flow and transport of a conservative solute in a saturated porous medium the values of the mass transfer coefficient α defined by using the conventional mim are affected by a scale effect since α decreased by up to 67 of its initial value 0 09 h 1 for increasing distances from the injection in particular α values for ticino river sand approach a straight line with a mean value of 0 06 0 03 h 1 which is close to values from 0 03 to 0 014 h 1 determined by jaynes et al 1995 for loam and clay loam soils in order to overcome the above theoretical limitation of the conventional mim approach a new mim is proposed in this paper which includes the analytical solution of fick s second law of diffusion directly into the non equilibrium solute flow and transport equation the new mim positively fits the experimental btcs derived from laboratory tests by replacing the coefficient of mass transfer α with the new scale invariant rate of mass transfer λ and the new dimensionless coefficient td test results provided practically constant values of td 1 19 0 01 and λ 0 005 0004 in four observation cross sections although z 0 changed from 70 to 195 μm this is because z 0 variability into the sand horizontal column produced only smoothed changes in td since the θ im θ m ratio dominates td estimations the new mim also allows an impressive simplification of the governing advection dispersion equation and on its analytical solution making it very suitable for studying solute transport under non equilibrium conditions when considering one dimensional vertical water flow and non equilibrium chloride transport in simulated sand columns the new mim provides analytical solutions at assigned td and λ that well approximate more complex solutions of conventional mim for different α values that apply modified bessel functions the proposed mim one dimensional solution is very simple to apply it can be implemented in numerical techniques such as the particle tracking or random walk capable of solving two or three dimensional nonequilibrium solute transport problems along groundwater flow pathways using the lagrangian approach forthcoming studies will focus on field implementation of new mim to solve two dimensional vertical problems of solutes transport in unsaturated saturated fractures research data data collected during filtration tests carried out at the irsa bari laboratory can be requested from the authors by e mail 
1649,groundwater is the major available water resources in harbin city china but rapid urbanization has adversely affected it in recent years and groundwater quality is deteriorating in this study the groundwater pollution indexes of groundwater monitoring wells were analyzed by using the projection pursuit dynamic clustering model and its spatial distribution was interpolated by using the modified local polynomial interpolation method the searchlight shape model was used to extract the types of land use within the scope of each monitoring well in order to evaluate the relationship between the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution and land use the correlation between the groundwater pollution indexes and land use was evaluated using kendall s tau b analysis the groundwater pollution index is generally high it has obvious spatial distribution characteristics and it mainly occurs in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district the results of kendall s tau b analysis show that the groundwater pollution indexes have a good correlation with land use residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area greatly influence the distribution of groundwater pollution moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 keywords urban land use ppdc model groundwater pollution index spatial distribution china 1 introduction according to the united nations bongaarts 2014 urban population accounted for 54 of the world s total population in 2014 with the rapid spread of urbanization in the world the issue of urban water supply has become the focus of attention parkinson and tayler 2003 navarro and carbonell 2007 a continuous good quality water supply is a key factor in providing a good quality of life to urban dwellers and is also important for environmental sustainability and economic growth in urban centers especially in most arid and semi arid areas where groundwater is the major available water resource bailey et al 2015 urbanization plays a very important role in the change of groundwater solute composition new urban landscape may change the original surface conditions and thus the groundwater circulation system which affected the dilution and transport of groundwater to solute barron et al 2013 moreover urbanization also adds new sources of pollution which may penetrate into aquifers and then pollute the groundwater thereby seriously limiting the development of a city rezvani et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 some studies have shown that in shanghai of china and baltimore of the united states increased levels of nitrate in groundwater are primarily caused by anthropogenic activities such as the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and animal manures the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage and the elevated atmospheric n deposition xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 gu et al 2012 at the same time punjab in pakistan and kharkiv city in the eastern ukraine are influenced by urban industrialization sulfate chloride and fluoride are obviously enriched in the shallow urban aquifer seriously polluting groundwater which is widely used as drinking water source for the urban population farooqi et al 2009 vystavna et al 2017 therefore the impact of urban land use on groundwater pollution has become a key issue of urban land use planning and urban water resource management and protection reddy et al 2012 chisala et al 2007 at present many research projects have examined the relationship among specific land use patterns corresponding pollutant emissions and resultant groundwater quality kellner and hubbart 2016 español et al 2016 koh et al 2017 the selection of groundwater quality assessment methods is the primary problem sarukkalige 2011 traditional methods such as the comprehensive pollution index method and the nemero index method can be calculated easily but ignore the weight factor zhang et al 2000 gray clustering and analytic hierarchy process can reflect uncertain characteristics but present a great subjectivity in determining the index yu et al 2008 in recent years the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc has been widely used in water quality assessment because of its automatic classification and simple and intuitive results it combines dynamic cluster rule with projection pursuit principle to modify the problem of parameters and projection index of the original projection pursuit clustering ppc model friedman and tukey 2006 wang and ni 2008 and takes into account the numerical distribution characteristics of various water quality grades for various factors in groundwater quality standards the optimal projection direction vector is obtained by the ppdc optimization and the size of its components is determined by the characteristics of high order data structure which reflects the sensitivity of the groundwater environment to the change of the single index of each pollution factor wei et al 2014 although this method has been widely used in the field of water science such as regional water resources zoning wang and ni 2008 surface water quality zhao et al 2012 and risk assessment zhao et al 2014 it has not been applied in the study of groundwater quality assessment the effect of urbanization on water quality is a concern in harbin city the capital of heilongjiang province china cai and shang 2009 gong et al 2015 which is the old industrial base of the typical heavy industry in the northeast city in recent years the rapid development of economy in harbin city has increased the demand for water resources thereby increasing groundwater production li et al 2013 with the rapid economic development the quantity and quality of the groundwater have been greatly affected by factories waste landfills groundwater exploitation and other factors which has seriously threatened the safety of groundwater supply zhang et al 2008 deng et al 2011 therefore the more accurate description of the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in urban and the analysis of the relationship between specific land use type and groundwater quality are essential for maintaining a suitable water supply for the city and achieving the sustainability of groundwater resources brink et al 2008 janniche et al 2012 the objectives of the paper are 1 to establish the groundwater pollution index model by using the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model 2 to determine the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution 3 to evaluate the relationship between land use and groundwater pollution 2 study area harbin city is located in the southeast of songnen plain which is the largest political economic and cultural center in the north of northeast china topographically it is very high in the southeast slightly higher in the south west and northwest lower in the middle and the east with an elevation of 114 638 m li et al 2013 this area presents a temperate continental monsoon climate with semi humid and semi arid characteristics the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 503 2 mm and 1411 19 mm respectively the temperature is high in summer cold in winter and there is a large difference in temperature during the year the average annual temperature is 3 4 c deng et al 2011 the main rivers in the area are the songhua river ash river and majiagou river the songhua river is the largest river system as a firstorder stream whereas the two remaining rivers are secondorder streams gong et al 2015 the study area is located in the urban area of harbin city covers an area of 592 72 km2 and is situated at a latitude between 45 38 17 and 45 51 50 and a longitude between 126 28 16 and 126 50 10 occupying 27 18 of the total area of harbin city the study area is divided into four districts including songbei district daoli district daow nang district and dongl xiangf district fig 1 there are three types of confined aquifers in the high plain confined aquifers in the first order terrace and aquifers in the floodplain in the area of which the latter two types of aquifers are the main exploitation layers of groundwater in the city the aquifers are alluvial sand medium coarse sand and gravel layers of modern rivers which contain large amounts of mud fig 2 li et al 2013 the groundwater recharge in the area mainly comes from underground runoff and atmospheric precipitation agricultural irrigation water domestic sewage and industrial wastewater infiltration gong et al 2015 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection to reflect the impacts of land use on groundwater pollution accurately and comprehensively the uniform distribution of sampling points was used as the main principle by considering the actual distribution of aquifers and the topography of geomorphology thus a total 77 groundwater wells with depths of 5 0 30 0 m were monitored and sampled from july to august 2015 in the urban area of harbin city fig 1 including 48 wells of the quaternary phreatic aquifer 29 wells of the quaternary confined aquifer and 25 specialized monitoring wells 52 civilian wells the collected samples were tested in the geology and hydrogeology environmental laboratory investigation institute of heilongjiang province the results of water samples testing showed that nitrogen salts and fluoride have a higher exceeding standard ratio so eight indicators such as sulfate chloride nitrate nitrite ammonia nitrogen fluoride total hardness total dissolved solids were selected as representative factors to reflect the water quality these indicators can objectively reflect the situation of water pollution the urban land use data of harbin city were provided by the provincial bureau of surveying and google earth mapping the urban areas are divided into residential and commercial areas industrial area public facilities area urban infrastructure facilities area agricultural area transportation facilities area grass land and managed green areas and water surface fig 3 table 1 shows the land use areas and their relative proportions 3 2 projection pursuit dynamic clustering projection pursuit a statistical method was developed to analyze high dimensional data based on projection hall 1989 pires and ribeiro 2017 this paper describes an issue of linear projection high dimensional data are projected onto one dimensional space and their characteristics are analyzed through the one dimensional space ni et al 2006 zhao et al 2014 if x0 ij i 1 n j 1 m n is the total number of samples m is the number of cluster factors of the samples is the initial value of the jth factor of the ith sample the steps of developing the ppdc model are described as follows 1 data standardization in order to eliminate the effect of different dimension and value range the initial sample will be standardized the standardization equation is 1 x ij x ij 0 x jmin 0 x jmax 0 x jmin 0 where x jmax 0 is the initial maximum of the jth factor and x jmin 0 is the initial minimum of the jth factor 2 linear projection linear projection is used to study the projection of high dimensional data into one dimensional linear space if a a 1 a 2 a j a m t is an m dimensional unit vector and z i is the projected characteristic value of x ij linear projection can be described as 2 zi j 1 m a j x ij where a is projection axis vector and it is also called projection direction vector z z 1 z 2 z i z n are defined as the projection eigenvalue vector set 3 projection index cluster analysis is a tool for exploratory data analysis that tries to find the intrinsic structure of data by organizing patterns into groups or clusters har even and brailovsky 1995 in the ppdc model a new projection index is generated on the basis of dynamic cluster principle first define s z i z k k 1 n as the absolute value of distance between the projected characteristic value z i and z k namely s z i z k z i z k let ω z 1 z 2 z n and the measure of dispersion between the samples is expressed as the degree of interspecific dispersion ss a where ss a can be defined as 3 ss a z i z k ω s z i z k where large ss a means high measures of dispersion within the sample then we assume that the all samples are classified as n 2 n n clusters θ h h 1 2 n is the projected characteristic value space of cluster h which contains all the projected characteristic value of cluster h and thus 4 θ h z i d a h z i d a t z i t 1 2 n t h where d a h z i z i a h and d a t z i z i a t a h and a t is the initial cluster core of both cluster hth and cluster tth respectively in practice we use the average projected characteristic value of clusters as new cluster core to conduct the iteration until the criterion is met wang and ni 2008 the proximity of intraclass samples is expressed by the degree of intraclass aggregation degree dd a where dd a can be defined as 5 dd a h 1 n d h a where dh a z i z k θ h s z i z k the small dd a means high aggregation degree of the intraclass sample finally the new projection index qq a in the ppdc model is as follow 6 qq a ss a dd a obviously when ss a is large and dd a is smalle that is when qq a obtains the maximum value the clustering objectives that the interclass samples are dispersed as far as possible and that the intraclass samples in are aggregated as far as possible are realized 4 model and optimization according to the above analysis the ppdc model can be designed as the following nonlinear optimization problems 7 max qq a a 1 in this study accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was used for calculation yu 2014 wang et al 2006 3 3 modified local polynomial partition interpolation to study the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater pollution in the study area the spatial interpolation should be carried out in accordance with the calculated values of the pollution index of the sampling points the distribution of groundwater solute concentration may show non stationary characteristics owing to the large differences in human activities in different regions given that the area of the songhua river bed deeply cuts the phreatic aquifer the variation in the groundwater pollution on the two sides of the river bed in the area is non continuous therefore the groundwater pollution index was interpolated using the modified local polynomial interpolation method the local polynomial method is a local weighted least squares fitting method using multiple polynomial interpolations hugger 1994 each polynomial is in a specific overlapping neighborhood that is the value of the grid node is specified by least squares fitting the data within the search ellipse centered on the grid node and given the length of long and short axis jana 2006 in this study a three order polynomial was used as the interpolation function and the circular search domain was selected for simplified processing considering the water sample distribution and the diffusion capacity of the ground water solute the search radius was r 8000 m specific calculation procedures were referred to literature fan and gijbels 1996 although the local polynomial interpolation method has a strong ability to determine small scale variations of spatial variables there is a problem that the valuation trend is smooth especially when the groundwater quality is easily affected by the point pollution source the local variation will be very large which will cause great local error kunis and potts 2007 radanović and bašić 2018 to solve this problem this study combines local polynomial trend surface equation with residual analysis to improve the accuracy of the original data interpolation zuppa 2004 ordinary kriging method was used to interpolate the residual which was the difference between the sampling point data and the interpolation result of the local polynomial method then the interpolation result of the local trend surface was added to the value of the residual estimate and the result was the value of the modified estimate at the same time the area of the songhua river was blanked and the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the north and south sides of the songhua river was partition interpolated and then the interpolation results were superposed and fused to obtain the overall interpolation results 3 4 establishment of slm and statistical analysis the key to studying the relationship between groundwater pollution and land use types is to determine the scope of monitoring wells that are expected to be contaminated by the land use types in many national water quality assessment nawqa studies the impact of land use on groundwater pollution is usually analyzed using a circular area with a radius of 500 m an et al 2005 singh et al 2013 gardner and vogel 2005 considered the terrain slope and proposed a wedge model wsm that used the monitoring well as the apex and followed the terrain slope to evaluate the impact of land use on groundwater pollution however wsm ignores the role of groundwater dynamics and considers only that of the vertical and downward seepages of pollutants in the circular range thereby limiting the application of this model nasrabadi and maedeh 2014 on this basis yan et al 2016 proposed a searchlight shape model slm that used the monitoring well as the center along the flow direction width of 500 m and radii of 50 250 500 750 and 1000 m he compared the impacts of urban land use on groundwater nitrate contamination and the results showed that the region at a radius of 500 m presents highest probability of contamination therefore the slm with a radius of 500 m and using monitoring wells as the center was used along the groundwater flow direction in this paper liu et al 2009 arcgis was used to extract the area of land use types in the radius area of each monitoring well fig 4 then the correlation between the percentage of urban land use and groundwater pollution was assessed using kendall s tau b and the main land type influencing the distribution of groundwater pollution in every district was assessed kendall s tau b is a robust rank based correlation test used extensively in water quality analyses and is especially well suited for skewed relationships or when data outliers may be present helsel and hirsch 2002 spss 16 0 spss inc chicago il was used for database setup and statistical analyses with a sequential bonferroni correction set at p 0 05 holm 1979 the calculation steps were as follows first the area and percentage of land use types near the monitoring wells were extracted by the slm second the groundwater pollution index of each monitoring well was calculated third the kendall rank correlation between land use type and groundwater pollution index was calculated by using spss 16 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal projection vector the evaluation criteria for this study were based on groundwater quality standards gb t14848 93 jie et al 2012 in accordance with the distribution of the measured data of sample an upper limit index was added to the class v of each index the upper limit of the measured water samples should not exceed this upper limit table 2 and the water of class iii needs to be treated before it can be used for drinking while the water of class iv and class v water cannot be used as a source of drinking water a total of 50 values were randomly generated in the vicinity of the lower limit of the standard lower limit of the 5 grades of the 8 evaluation indicators namely ρ so4 2 ρ cl ρ no3 ρ no2 ρ nh4 ρ f ρ caco3 and ρ tds as a result 50 standard water samples were formed finally the projection index function was constructed on the basis of the calculation procedure of the ppdc method accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was used to optimize the projection index function in which m 8 n 250 and n 5 and was programmed in matlab 7 01 and computed by computer after 15 iterations the optimal projection direction was obtained a 0 512 0 363 0 231 0 308 0 446 0 209 0 251 0 401 the measured standardized sample index vector was multiplied by the projection direction and 250 standard sample projection values were obtained accordingly the empirical projection values of each standard grade could be obtained z i i i ii v the average of the projected values of the 50 samples of the class then the relationship curve between the projection value and the water quality grade was established fig 5 that is the ppdc groundwater pollution index model the projection value of the midpoint of the two standard grades was the projection value for the water quality grade limit as shown in fig 5 the ppdc model presents high precision for water quality assessment and can be used to describe the relationship between water quality indexes and water quality grades given that r 2 0 9956 shao et al 2010 espezua et al 2015 moreover the projection value of z i is small and the water quality is good on the contrary large z i means poor water quality at the same time from the optimal projection direction we can determine the influence degree of each assessment index on the comprehensive assessment results their order from large to small is as follows so4 2 nh4 tds cl no2 caco3 no3 f the optimal projection direction was combined with the 77 measured water samples in the study area and the projection value was calculated the projection value of each water sample based on the optimal projection direction was substituted into the relationship curve of z i y i to evaluate the water quality grade table 3 then the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce gong and jin 2009 and matter element extension mee yingxue et al 2015 methods were used to evaluate the water quality grade of the collected water samples for comparative analysis table 3 the ppdc model is a method of data statistics based on data structure and feature the projection direction reflects the influence degree of each index on the assessment results the ppdc model is sensitive to the change in each index value and the size of projection value can reflect the advantages and disadvantages of each water sample given that the result is continuous we can assess the spatial variations in groundwater quality on the basis of the assessment results which cannot be achieved by traditional methods in addition the fce and mee methods are related to the weight weight coefficient determination the evaluation results are frequently subjective because weight coefficients are frequently determined manually the ppdc model solves the problem by machine simulation and thus avoids human oriented interference table 3 shows that the assessment results of the ppdc model are in good agreement with the results of the fce and mee methods however the assessment results of the fce and mee methods have a sudden change in the water of class i and class iii while the assessment results of the ppdc model show that the water of class ii accounts for 25 97 of the total and the distribution of all grades of water is relatively uniform the reason is that the class i and class ii standard intervals of nh4 are overlapping in the groundwater quality standards and the class i class ii and class iii standard intervals of f are overlapping the fce and mee methods both directly classify the value of these intervals to the water of class i and class iii and establish the membership function and the correlation function respectively the ppdc model normalizes the sample values and then the normalized data is projected and clustered so the results are continuous therefore the ppdc method is an effective and reliable water quality assessment method 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in accordance with the groundwater pollution index obtained by the ppdc method the spatial distribution map of groundwater pollution index was generated in addition the groundwater pollution line was drawn on the basis of the lower limit of pollution index of class iii z i 0 391 for groundwater quality standards fig 6 the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution index in the urban area of harbin city is shown in fig 6 the results show that the groundwater pollution in the study area presents obvious spatial distribution characteristics and exhibits many areas with a pollution index higher than the benchmark value z i 0 391 the high value areas of groundwater pollution index are concentrated in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district and the maximum groundwater pollution index is 1 806 the minimum is 0 091 and the average is 0 592 in daoli district groundwater pollution indexes are generally low with maximum and minimum values of 0 582 and 0 165 respectively the groundwater quality in the northeast and southwest regions of the district is the water of class iii and that of most of the remaining areas is lower than the benchmark value therefore the groundwater quality in daoli district is generally good however the groundwater pollution index in daow nang district is generally high with a maximum value of 1 806 except for the northeastern region the groundwater quality in most parts of the district is the water of class iii v so groundwater pollution is the most serious in dongl xiangf district the maximum value is 1 551 and the average pollution index is 0 715 in songbei district the maximum value is 0 975 and the average pollution index is 0 569 the combination of fig 6 and the land use areas maps in fig 3 shows that the land use types in the high value area of groundwater pollution index are mainly industrial area residential and commercial areas and agricultural area to further analyze the relationship between groundwater pollution and spatial distribution of land use in the urban area of harbin city the number of monitoring wells located in different land use types and the number of monitoring wells above the lower limit of pollution index of class iii z i 0 391 were analyzed by mathematical statistics table 4 from table 4 the groundwater pollution indexes of industrial area and agricultural area are found higher than those of the rest of the land use types in the urban area of harbin city with maximum values of 1 806 and 1 556 respectively and average values of 0 718 and 0 627 respectively according to the statistical data of monitoring wells above the benchmark value the ratio of the groundwater pollution in agricultural area is the highest and the groundwater pollution indexes of 19 of the 24 monitoring wells 79 17 are higher than the benchmark value the next highest is that of industrial area 78 57 followed by residential and commercial areas 66 67 transportation facilities area 66 67 and public facilities area 57 14 the land use giving the lowest ratios is in the grass land and managed green areas and the urban infrastructure facilities area the ratios of groundwater pollution in the industrial area the residential and commercial areas and agricultural area is higher indicating that the general causes of groundwater pollution may be related to particular land uses 4 3 analysis on groundwater pollution land use type according to the measured data of groundwater level in 77 groundwater wells from july to august 2015 in the urban area of harbin city the groundwater seepage field map in the study area shown in fig 7 can be obtained then on the basis of the percentages of land use in the range of 500 m for the slm and groundwater pollution indexes the kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the study area and each district and the main land use types impacting groundwater pollution were obtained the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 from table 5 positive correlations are found between residential and commercial areas industrial area agricultural area transportation facilities area and groundwater pollution indexes in the study area with kendall s tau b values of are 0 166 0 106 0 074 and 0 036 respectively the rest of the land use types and groundwater pollution indexes show a negative correlation therefore groundwater pollution presents a good correlation with land use types moreover the types of land use exert a significant impact on the distribution of groundwater pollution table 6 in addition according to the calculation formula of the groundwater pollution index z i the product of the pollution index of each pollution indicator and the corresponding sub vector of a is the contribution value to z i and the ratio of contribution value to z i is the pollution contribution rate of this sub vector the greater the contribution rate the greater the influence of this indicator on the groundwater environment therefore the contribution rate of each pollution indicator in different districts was calculated based on the collected water samples fig 8 songbei district is an important grain industry base in harbin city and has a large area of agricultural coverage furthermore the west side of the songhua river is a densely populated area therefore this district is impacted by agricultural irrigation wastewater and domestic sewage which cause serious pollution of groundwater as shown in fig 6 and table 6 the scope of groundwater pollution in songbei district is spread throughout the northern eastern of the region and coastal areas of the songhua river and the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution are mainly residential and commercial areas and agricultural area with kendall s tau b values of 0 429 and 0 345 respectively at the same time fig 8 shows that nh4 and no3 are the leading indicators of groundwater pollution in songbei district which again proves that there is a significant correlation between groundwater pollution and land use types in songbei district as the central area of harbin city daoli district has a relatively low level of groundwater pollution and it is known from fig 6 that the groundwater pollution is only in the northeast and southwest of the region in the northeastern part of the district as the center of the city due to the dense population the large amount of domestic sewage and the imperfect domestic sewage treatment measures the domestic sewage has leaked into and polluted the groundwater thus the groundwater in this region presents regional pollution however the western and southern parts of the district are new built urban areas where the environmental protection measures are relatively perfect so the groundwater quality in this region is good as a whole as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in daoli district are mainly industrial area and public facilities area with kendall s tau b values of 0 173 and 0 227 respectively daow nang district is an old city formed and developed in harbin city many traditional industrial and heavy industrial production bases are located in the central area of the district thus industrial wastewater discharging phenomenon is serious which results in serious groundwater pollution in this district fig 3 and fig 6 show that the scope of groundwater pollution is mainly concentrated in the industrial area which is in the center of the district as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in the district are mainly industrial area and grass land and managed green areas with kendall s tau b values of 0 221 and 0 333 respectively at the same time fig 8 shows that nh4 is the leading indicator of groundwater pollution in the district and the contribution rates of so4 2 and cl are relatively high therefore industrial area is the main type of land use that impacts groundwater pollution in daow nang district the north of dongl xiangf district is an emerging industrial area in harbin city and most of the southeastern parts are farming area therefore this district is impacted by industrial wastewater and agricultural wastewater which cause serious pollution of groundwater fig 6 shows that groundwater pollution is serious in the northern and southeastern areas of the district and the land use types mainly comprise industrial area and agricultural area as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in dongl xiangf district are mainly industrial area and transportation facilities area with kendall s tau b values of 0 345 and 0 290 respectively in addition fig 8 shows that no3 and caco3 are the leading indicators of groundwater pollution in the district which again proves that the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution is related to industrial area and agricultural area in summary the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city is impacted by land use types among which residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area are the main influencing factors moreover the degree and spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in each district are also related to the types of land use moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 due to the impact of land use types in this study only one sampling event was adopted and eight common water quality indicators were selected based on the results of water samples testing however the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution still needs more continuous work under complex hydrological conditions for example groundwater samples at different periods will be collected and tested and more pollutant indicators related to land use will be selected to study the relationship between land use types and spatio temporal evolution of groundwater pollution to overcome these limitations 5 summary and conclusions in this study we used gis technology and statistical method based on the ppdc method to analyze the correlation between groundwater pollution and land use using the data collected from the monitoring wells in the urban area of harbin city the analysis results can provide a new idea for the study of the impact of urban land use on groundwater pollution and provide a basis for the protection of urban water sources and the management and utilization of groundwater resources from the results the following conclusions were drawn the groundwater pollution index model based on the ppdc method is a good groundwater quality assessment approach for reflecting the groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city in addition the modified local polynomial interpolation method can effectively solve the problem of large local variation in groundwater pollution and non continuous of groundwater pollution the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city on the two sides of the songhua river is interpolated using the partition interpolation method the groundwater pollution indexes in the urban area are generally high with serious groundwater pollution and the groundwater pollution presents obvious spatial distribution characteristics the areas with serious groundwater pollution are concentrated in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district based on the statistical results of the slm the kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the whole study area and each district the test results show that the tau b values of the correlation between groundwater pollution and land use types include positive and negative numbers which suggests that not all land types could be causing the increase in groundwater pollution the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city has a good correlation with the types of land use among which residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area are the main influencing factors of groundwater quality and the degree and spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in each district are also related to the types of land use moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 due to the impact of land use types conflict of

spatial distribution of groundwater pollution and land use the correlation between the groundwater pollution indexes and land use was evaluated using kendall s tau b analysis the groundwater pollution index is generally high it has obvious spatial distribution characteristics and it mainly occurs in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district the results of kendall s tau b analysis show that the groundwater pollution indexes have a good correlation with land use residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area greatly influence the distribution of groundwater pollution moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 keywords urban land use ppdc model groundwater pollution index spatial distribution china 1 introduction according to the united nations bongaarts 2014 urban population accounted for 54 of the world s total population in 2014 with the rapid spread of urbanization in the world the issue of urban water supply has become the focus of attention parkinson and tayler 2003 navarro and carbonell 2007 a continuous good quality water supply is a key factor in providing a good quality of life to urban dwellers and is also important for environmental sustainability and economic growth in urban centers especially in most arid and semi arid areas where groundwater is the major available water resource bailey et al 2015 urbanization plays a very important role in the change of groundwater solute composition new urban landscape may change the original surface conditions and thus the groundwater circulation system which affected the dilution and transport of groundwater to solute barron et al 2013 moreover urbanization also adds new sources of pollution which may penetrate into aquifers and then pollute the groundwater thereby seriously limiting the development of a city rezvani et al 2013 zhang et al 2015 some studies have shown that in shanghai of china and baltimore of the united states increased levels of nitrate in groundwater are primarily caused by anthropogenic activities such as the overuse of nitrogen fertilizers and animal manures the discharge of domestic and industrial sewage and the elevated atmospheric n deposition xue et al 2009 kaushal et al 2011 gu et al 2012 at the same time punjab in pakistan and kharkiv city in the eastern ukraine are influenced by urban industrialization sulfate chloride and fluoride are obviously enriched in the shallow urban aquifer seriously polluting groundwater which is widely used as drinking water source for the urban population farooqi et al 2009 vystavna et al 2017 therefore the impact of urban land use on groundwater pollution has become a key issue of urban land use planning and urban water resource management and protection reddy et al 2012 chisala et al 2007 at present many research projects have examined the relationship among specific land use patterns corresponding pollutant emissions and resultant groundwater quality kellner and hubbart 2016 español et al 2016 koh et al 2017 the selection of groundwater quality assessment methods is the primary problem sarukkalige 2011 traditional methods such as the comprehensive pollution index method and the nemero index method can be calculated easily but ignore the weight factor zhang et al 2000 gray clustering and analytic hierarchy process can reflect uncertain characteristics but present a great subjectivity in determining the index yu et al 2008 in recent years the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc has been widely used in water quality assessment because of its automatic classification and simple and intuitive results it combines dynamic cluster rule with projection pursuit principle to modify the problem of parameters and projection index of the original projection pursuit clustering ppc model friedman and tukey 2006 wang and ni 2008 and takes into account the numerical distribution characteristics of various water quality grades for various factors in groundwater quality standards the optimal projection direction vector is obtained by the ppdc optimization and the size of its components is determined by the characteristics of high order data structure which reflects the sensitivity of the groundwater environment to the change of the single index of each pollution factor wei et al 2014 although this method has been widely used in the field of water science such as regional water resources zoning wang and ni 2008 surface water quality zhao et al 2012 and risk assessment zhao et al 2014 it has not been applied in the study of groundwater quality assessment the effect of urbanization on water quality is a concern in harbin city the capital of heilongjiang province china cai and shang 2009 gong et al 2015 which is the old industrial base of the typical heavy industry in the northeast city in recent years the rapid development of economy in harbin city has increased the demand for water resources thereby increasing groundwater production li et al 2013 with the rapid economic development the quantity and quality of the groundwater have been greatly affected by factories waste landfills groundwater exploitation and other factors which has seriously threatened the safety of groundwater supply zhang et al 2008 deng et al 2011 therefore the more accurate description of the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in urban and the analysis of the relationship between specific land use type and groundwater quality are essential for maintaining a suitable water supply for the city and achieving the sustainability of groundwater resources brink et al 2008 janniche et al 2012 the objectives of the paper are 1 to establish the groundwater pollution index model by using the projection pursuit dynamic clustering ppdc model 2 to determine the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution 3 to evaluate the relationship between land use and groundwater pollution 2 study area harbin city is located in the southeast of songnen plain which is the largest political economic and cultural center in the north of northeast china topographically it is very high in the southeast slightly higher in the south west and northwest lower in the middle and the east with an elevation of 114 638 m li et al 2013 this area presents a temperate continental monsoon climate with semi humid and semi arid characteristics the average annual precipitation and evaporation are 503 2 mm and 1411 19 mm respectively the temperature is high in summer cold in winter and there is a large difference in temperature during the year the average annual temperature is 3 4 c deng et al 2011 the main rivers in the area are the songhua river ash river and majiagou river the songhua river is the largest river system as a firstorder stream whereas the two remaining rivers are secondorder streams gong et al 2015 the study area is located in the urban area of harbin city covers an area of 592 72 km2 and is situated at a latitude between 45 38 17 and 45 51 50 and a longitude between 126 28 16 and 126 50 10 occupying 27 18 of the total area of harbin city the study area is divided into four districts including songbei district daoli district daow nang district and dongl xiangf district fig 1 there are three types of confined aquifers in the high plain confined aquifers in the first order terrace and aquifers in the floodplain in the area of which the latter two types of aquifers are the main exploitation layers of groundwater in the city the aquifers are alluvial sand medium coarse sand and gravel layers of modern rivers which contain large amounts of mud fig 2 li et al 2013 the groundwater recharge in the area mainly comes from underground runoff and atmospheric precipitation agricultural irrigation water domestic sewage and industrial wastewater infiltration gong et al 2015 3 materials and methods 3 1 data collection to reflect the impacts of land use on groundwater pollution accurately and comprehensively the uniform distribution of sampling points was used as the main principle by considering the actual distribution of aquifers and the topography of geomorphology thus a total 77 groundwater wells with depths of 5 0 30 0 m were monitored and sampled from july to august 2015 in the urban area of harbin city fig 1 including 48 wells of the quaternary phreatic aquifer 29 wells of the quaternary confined aquifer and 25 specialized monitoring wells 52 civilian wells the collected samples were tested in the geology and hydrogeology environmental laboratory investigation institute of heilongjiang province the results of water samples testing showed that nitrogen salts and fluoride have a higher exceeding standard ratio so eight indicators such as sulfate chloride nitrate nitrite ammonia nitrogen fluoride total hardness total dissolved solids were selected as representative factors to reflect the water quality these indicators can objectively reflect the situation of water pollution the urban land use data of harbin city were provided by the provincial bureau of surveying and google earth mapping the urban areas are divided into residential and commercial areas industrial area public facilities area urban infrastructure facilities area agricultural area transportation facilities area grass land and managed green areas and water surface fig 3 table 1 shows the land use areas and their relative proportions 3 2 projection pursuit dynamic clustering projection pursuit a statistical method was developed to analyze high dimensional data based on projection hall 1989 pires and ribeiro 2017 this paper describes an issue of linear projection high dimensional data are projected onto one dimensional space and their characteristics are analyzed through the one dimensional space ni et al 2006 zhao et al 2014 if x0 ij i 1 n j 1 m n is the total number of samples m is the number of cluster factors of the samples is the initial value of the jth factor of the ith sample the steps of developing the ppdc model are described as follows 1 data standardization in order to eliminate the effect of different dimension and value range the initial sample will be standardized the standardization equation is 1 x ij x ij 0 x jmin 0 x jmax 0 x jmin 0 where x jmax 0 is the initial maximum of the jth factor and x jmin 0 is the initial minimum of the jth factor 2 linear projection linear projection is used to study the projection of high dimensional data into one dimensional linear space if a a 1 a 2 a j a m t is an m dimensional unit vector and z i is the projected characteristic value of x ij linear projection can be described as 2 zi j 1 m a j x ij where a is projection axis vector and it is also called projection direction vector z z 1 z 2 z i z n are defined as the projection eigenvalue vector set 3 projection index cluster analysis is a tool for exploratory data analysis that tries to find the intrinsic structure of data by organizing patterns into groups or clusters har even and brailovsky 1995 in the ppdc model a new projection index is generated on the basis of dynamic cluster principle first define s z i z k k 1 n as the absolute value of distance between the projected characteristic value z i and z k namely s z i z k z i z k let ω z 1 z 2 z n and the measure of dispersion between the samples is expressed as the degree of interspecific dispersion ss a where ss a can be defined as 3 ss a z i z k ω s z i z k where large ss a means high measures of dispersion within the sample then we assume that the all samples are classified as n 2 n n clusters θ h h 1 2 n is the projected characteristic value space of cluster h which contains all the projected characteristic value of cluster h and thus 4 θ h z i d a h z i d a t z i t 1 2 n t h where d a h z i z i a h and d a t z i z i a t a h and a t is the initial cluster core of both cluster hth and cluster tth respectively in practice we use the average projected characteristic value of clusters as new cluster core to conduct the iteration until the criterion is met wang and ni 2008 the proximity of intraclass samples is expressed by the degree of intraclass aggregation degree dd a where dd a can be defined as 5 dd a h 1 n d h a where dh a z i z k θ h s z i z k the small dd a means high aggregation degree of the intraclass sample finally the new projection index qq a in the ppdc model is as follow 6 qq a ss a dd a obviously when ss a is large and dd a is smalle that is when qq a obtains the maximum value the clustering objectives that the interclass samples are dispersed as far as possible and that the intraclass samples in are aggregated as far as possible are realized 4 model and optimization according to the above analysis the ppdc model can be designed as the following nonlinear optimization problems 7 max qq a a 1 in this study accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was used for calculation yu 2014 wang et al 2006 3 3 modified local polynomial partition interpolation to study the spatial distribution characteristics of groundwater pollution in the study area the spatial interpolation should be carried out in accordance with the calculated values of the pollution index of the sampling points the distribution of groundwater solute concentration may show non stationary characteristics owing to the large differences in human activities in different regions given that the area of the songhua river bed deeply cuts the phreatic aquifer the variation in the groundwater pollution on the two sides of the river bed in the area is non continuous therefore the groundwater pollution index was interpolated using the modified local polynomial interpolation method the local polynomial method is a local weighted least squares fitting method using multiple polynomial interpolations hugger 1994 each polynomial is in a specific overlapping neighborhood that is the value of the grid node is specified by least squares fitting the data within the search ellipse centered on the grid node and given the length of long and short axis jana 2006 in this study a three order polynomial was used as the interpolation function and the circular search domain was selected for simplified processing considering the water sample distribution and the diffusion capacity of the ground water solute the search radius was r 8000 m specific calculation procedures were referred to literature fan and gijbels 1996 although the local polynomial interpolation method has a strong ability to determine small scale variations of spatial variables there is a problem that the valuation trend is smooth especially when the groundwater quality is easily affected by the point pollution source the local variation will be very large which will cause great local error kunis and potts 2007 radanović and bašić 2018 to solve this problem this study combines local polynomial trend surface equation with residual analysis to improve the accuracy of the original data interpolation zuppa 2004 ordinary kriging method was used to interpolate the residual which was the difference between the sampling point data and the interpolation result of the local polynomial method then the interpolation result of the local trend surface was added to the value of the residual estimate and the result was the value of the modified estimate at the same time the area of the songhua river was blanked and the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the north and south sides of the songhua river was partition interpolated and then the interpolation results were superposed and fused to obtain the overall interpolation results 3 4 establishment of slm and statistical analysis the key to studying the relationship between groundwater pollution and land use types is to determine the scope of monitoring wells that are expected to be contaminated by the land use types in many national water quality assessment nawqa studies the impact of land use on groundwater pollution is usually analyzed using a circular area with a radius of 500 m an et al 2005 singh et al 2013 gardner and vogel 2005 considered the terrain slope and proposed a wedge model wsm that used the monitoring well as the apex and followed the terrain slope to evaluate the impact of land use on groundwater pollution however wsm ignores the role of groundwater dynamics and considers only that of the vertical and downward seepages of pollutants in the circular range thereby limiting the application of this model nasrabadi and maedeh 2014 on this basis yan et al 2016 proposed a searchlight shape model slm that used the monitoring well as the center along the flow direction width of 500 m and radii of 50 250 500 750 and 1000 m he compared the impacts of urban land use on groundwater nitrate contamination and the results showed that the region at a radius of 500 m presents highest probability of contamination therefore the slm with a radius of 500 m and using monitoring wells as the center was used along the groundwater flow direction in this paper liu et al 2009 arcgis was used to extract the area of land use types in the radius area of each monitoring well fig 4 then the correlation between the percentage of urban land use and groundwater pollution was assessed using kendall s tau b and the main land type influencing the distribution of groundwater pollution in every district was assessed kendall s tau b is a robust rank based correlation test used extensively in water quality analyses and is especially well suited for skewed relationships or when data outliers may be present helsel and hirsch 2002 spss 16 0 spss inc chicago il was used for database setup and statistical analyses with a sequential bonferroni correction set at p 0 05 holm 1979 the calculation steps were as follows first the area and percentage of land use types near the monitoring wells were extracted by the slm second the groundwater pollution index of each monitoring well was calculated third the kendall rank correlation between land use type and groundwater pollution index was calculated by using spss 16 0 4 results and discussion 4 1 optimal projection vector the evaluation criteria for this study were based on groundwater quality standards gb t14848 93 jie et al 2012 in accordance with the distribution of the measured data of sample an upper limit index was added to the class v of each index the upper limit of the measured water samples should not exceed this upper limit table 2 and the water of class iii needs to be treated before it can be used for drinking while the water of class iv and class v water cannot be used as a source of drinking water a total of 50 values were randomly generated in the vicinity of the lower limit of the standard lower limit of the 5 grades of the 8 evaluation indicators namely ρ so4 2 ρ cl ρ no3 ρ no2 ρ nh4 ρ f ρ caco3 and ρ tds as a result 50 standard water samples were formed finally the projection index function was constructed on the basis of the calculation procedure of the ppdc method accelerated genetic algorithm with real number coding was used to optimize the projection index function in which m 8 n 250 and n 5 and was programmed in matlab 7 01 and computed by computer after 15 iterations the optimal projection direction was obtained a 0 512 0 363 0 231 0 308 0 446 0 209 0 251 0 401 the measured standardized sample index vector was multiplied by the projection direction and 250 standard sample projection values were obtained accordingly the empirical projection values of each standard grade could be obtained z i i i ii v the average of the projected values of the 50 samples of the class then the relationship curve between the projection value and the water quality grade was established fig 5 that is the ppdc groundwater pollution index model the projection value of the midpoint of the two standard grades was the projection value for the water quality grade limit as shown in fig 5 the ppdc model presents high precision for water quality assessment and can be used to describe the relationship between water quality indexes and water quality grades given that r 2 0 9956 shao et al 2010 espezua et al 2015 moreover the projection value of z i is small and the water quality is good on the contrary large z i means poor water quality at the same time from the optimal projection direction we can determine the influence degree of each assessment index on the comprehensive assessment results their order from large to small is as follows so4 2 nh4 tds cl no2 caco3 no3 f the optimal projection direction was combined with the 77 measured water samples in the study area and the projection value was calculated the projection value of each water sample based on the optimal projection direction was substituted into the relationship curve of z i y i to evaluate the water quality grade table 3 then the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation fce gong and jin 2009 and matter element extension mee yingxue et al 2015 methods were used to evaluate the water quality grade of the collected water samples for comparative analysis table 3 the ppdc model is a method of data statistics based on data structure and feature the projection direction reflects the influence degree of each index on the assessment results the ppdc model is sensitive to the change in each index value and the size of projection value can reflect the advantages and disadvantages of each water sample given that the result is continuous we can assess the spatial variations in groundwater quality on the basis of the assessment results which cannot be achieved by traditional methods in addition the fce and mee methods are related to the weight weight coefficient determination the evaluation results are frequently subjective because weight coefficients are frequently determined manually the ppdc model solves the problem by machine simulation and thus avoids human oriented interference table 3 shows that the assessment results of the ppdc model are in good agreement with the results of the fce and mee methods however the assessment results of the fce and mee methods have a sudden change in the water of class i and class iii while the assessment results of the ppdc model show that the water of class ii accounts for 25 97 of the total and the distribution of all grades of water is relatively uniform the reason is that the class i and class ii standard intervals of nh4 are overlapping in the groundwater quality standards and the class i class ii and class iii standard intervals of f are overlapping the fce and mee methods both directly classify the value of these intervals to the water of class i and class iii and establish the membership function and the correlation function respectively the ppdc model normalizes the sample values and then the normalized data is projected and clustered so the results are continuous therefore the ppdc method is an effective and reliable water quality assessment method 4 2 spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in accordance with the groundwater pollution index obtained by the ppdc method the spatial distribution map of groundwater pollution index was generated in addition the groundwater pollution line was drawn on the basis of the lower limit of pollution index of class iii z i 0 391 for groundwater quality standards fig 6 the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution index in the urban area of harbin city is shown in fig 6 the results show that the groundwater pollution in the study area presents obvious spatial distribution characteristics and exhibits many areas with a pollution index higher than the benchmark value z i 0 391 the high value areas of groundwater pollution index are concentrated in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district and the maximum groundwater pollution index is 1 806 the minimum is 0 091 and the average is 0 592 in daoli district groundwater pollution indexes are generally low with maximum and minimum values of 0 582 and 0 165 respectively the groundwater quality in the northeast and southwest regions of the district is the water of class iii and that of most of the remaining areas is lower than the benchmark value therefore the groundwater quality in daoli district is generally good however the groundwater pollution index in daow nang district is generally high with a maximum value of 1 806 except for the northeastern region the groundwater quality in most parts of the district is the water of class iii v so groundwater pollution is the most serious in dongl xiangf district the maximum value is 1 551 and the average pollution index is 0 715 in songbei district the maximum value is 0 975 and the average pollution index is 0 569 the combination of fig 6 and the land use areas maps in fig 3 shows that the land use types in the high value area of groundwater pollution index are mainly industrial area residential and commercial areas and agricultural area to further analyze the relationship between groundwater pollution and spatial distribution of land use in the urban area of harbin city the number of monitoring wells located in different land use types and the number of monitoring wells above the lower limit of pollution index of class iii z i 0 391 were analyzed by mathematical statistics table 4 from table 4 the groundwater pollution indexes of industrial area and agricultural area are found higher than those of the rest of the land use types in the urban area of harbin city with maximum values of 1 806 and 1 556 respectively and average values of 0 718 and 0 627 respectively according to the statistical data of monitoring wells above the benchmark value the ratio of the groundwater pollution in agricultural area is the highest and the groundwater pollution indexes of 19 of the 24 monitoring wells 79 17 are higher than the benchmark value the next highest is that of industrial area 78 57 followed by residential and commercial areas 66 67 transportation facilities area 66 67 and public facilities area 57 14 the land use giving the lowest ratios is in the grass land and managed green areas and the urban infrastructure facilities area the ratios of groundwater pollution in the industrial area the residential and commercial areas and agricultural area is higher indicating that the general causes of groundwater pollution may be related to particular land uses 4 3 analysis on groundwater pollution land use type according to the measured data of groundwater level in 77 groundwater wells from july to august 2015 in the urban area of harbin city the groundwater seepage field map in the study area shown in fig 7 can be obtained then on the basis of the percentages of land use in the range of 500 m for the slm and groundwater pollution indexes the kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the study area and each district and the main land use types impacting groundwater pollution were obtained the results are shown in table 5 and table 6 from table 5 positive correlations are found between residential and commercial areas industrial area agricultural area transportation facilities area and groundwater pollution indexes in the study area with kendall s tau b values of are 0 166 0 106 0 074 and 0 036 respectively the rest of the land use types and groundwater pollution indexes show a negative correlation therefore groundwater pollution presents a good correlation with land use types moreover the types of land use exert a significant impact on the distribution of groundwater pollution table 6 in addition according to the calculation formula of the groundwater pollution index z i the product of the pollution index of each pollution indicator and the corresponding sub vector of a is the contribution value to z i and the ratio of contribution value to z i is the pollution contribution rate of this sub vector the greater the contribution rate the greater the influence of this indicator on the groundwater environment therefore the contribution rate of each pollution indicator in different districts was calculated based on the collected water samples fig 8 songbei district is an important grain industry base in harbin city and has a large area of agricultural coverage furthermore the west side of the songhua river is a densely populated area therefore this district is impacted by agricultural irrigation wastewater and domestic sewage which cause serious pollution of groundwater as shown in fig 6 and table 6 the scope of groundwater pollution in songbei district is spread throughout the northern eastern of the region and coastal areas of the songhua river and the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution are mainly residential and commercial areas and agricultural area with kendall s tau b values of 0 429 and 0 345 respectively at the same time fig 8 shows that nh4 and no3 are the leading indicators of groundwater pollution in songbei district which again proves that there is a significant correlation between groundwater pollution and land use types in songbei district as the central area of harbin city daoli district has a relatively low level of groundwater pollution and it is known from fig 6 that the groundwater pollution is only in the northeast and southwest of the region in the northeastern part of the district as the center of the city due to the dense population the large amount of domestic sewage and the imperfect domestic sewage treatment measures the domestic sewage has leaked into and polluted the groundwater thus the groundwater in this region presents regional pollution however the western and southern parts of the district are new built urban areas where the environmental protection measures are relatively perfect so the groundwater quality in this region is good as a whole as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in daoli district are mainly industrial area and public facilities area with kendall s tau b values of 0 173 and 0 227 respectively daow nang district is an old city formed and developed in harbin city many traditional industrial and heavy industrial production bases are located in the central area of the district thus industrial wastewater discharging phenomenon is serious which results in serious groundwater pollution in this district fig 3 and fig 6 show that the scope of groundwater pollution is mainly concentrated in the industrial area which is in the center of the district as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in the district are mainly industrial area and grass land and managed green areas with kendall s tau b values of 0 221 and 0 333 respectively at the same time fig 8 shows that nh4 is the leading indicator of groundwater pollution in the district and the contribution rates of so4 2 and cl are relatively high therefore industrial area is the main type of land use that impacts groundwater pollution in daow nang district the north of dongl xiangf district is an emerging industrial area in harbin city and most of the southeastern parts are farming area therefore this district is impacted by industrial wastewater and agricultural wastewater which cause serious pollution of groundwater fig 6 shows that groundwater pollution is serious in the northern and southeastern areas of the district and the land use types mainly comprise industrial area and agricultural area as shown in table 6 the land use types impacting the groundwater pollution in dongl xiangf district are mainly industrial area and transportation facilities area with kendall s tau b values of 0 345 and 0 290 respectively in addition fig 8 shows that no3 and caco3 are the leading indicators of groundwater pollution in the district which again proves that the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution is related to industrial area and agricultural area in summary the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city is impacted by land use types among which residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area are the main influencing factors moreover the degree and spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in each district are also related to the types of land use moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 due to the impact of land use types in this study only one sampling event was adopted and eight common water quality indicators were selected based on the results of water samples testing however the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution still needs more continuous work under complex hydrological conditions for example groundwater samples at different periods will be collected and tested and more pollutant indicators related to land use will be selected to study the relationship between land use types and spatio temporal evolution of groundwater pollution to overcome these limitations 5 summary and conclusions in this study we used gis technology and statistical method based on the ppdc method to analyze the correlation between groundwater pollution and land use using the data collected from the monitoring wells in the urban area of harbin city the analysis results can provide a new idea for the study of the impact of urban land use on groundwater pollution and provide a basis for the protection of urban water sources and the management and utilization of groundwater resources from the results the following conclusions were drawn the groundwater pollution index model based on the ppdc method is a good groundwater quality assessment approach for reflecting the groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city in addition the modified local polynomial interpolation method can effectively solve the problem of large local variation in groundwater pollution and non continuous of groundwater pollution the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city on the two sides of the songhua river is interpolated using the partition interpolation method the groundwater pollution indexes in the urban area are generally high with serious groundwater pollution and the groundwater pollution presents obvious spatial distribution characteristics the areas with serious groundwater pollution are concentrated in daow nang district and the eastern part of dongl xiangf district based on the statistical results of the slm the kendall rank correlation test was used to analyze the impact of land use on the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the whole study area and each district the test results show that the tau b values of the correlation between groundwater pollution and land use types include positive and negative numbers which suggests that not all land types could be causing the increase in groundwater pollution the spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in the urban area of harbin city has a good correlation with the types of land use among which residential and commercial areas industrial area and agricultural area are the main influencing factors of groundwater quality and the degree and spatial distribution of groundwater pollution in each district are also related to the types of land use moreover the main impact indicators of groundwater pollution in the study area are nh4 no3 and caco3 due to the impact of land use types conflict of
