24535,a surface based kinetic model for the anaerobic digestion of potato waste was proposed the model was calibrated and validated and a local sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the most sensitive parameters the model consisted of a modified anaerobic digestion model n 1 where the disintegration process was defined through a surface based approach able to account for the influence of the particle size on the process development ad hoc experiments were carried out to calibrate and validate the model at a laboratory scale the calibration and validation procedures accounted for the methane production and organic acid concentrations observed during experimental tests the quality of model fitting with lab scale data was evaluated by the modeling efficiency the index of agreement and the root mean square error methods results confirmed the high accuracy of the model for the bio methane and organic by products prediction during the anaerobic conversion of potato waste keywords adm1 based model surface based kinetic approach odes system local sensitivity analysis anaerobic digestion 1 introduction during the last decades the anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely used for the stabilization and the treatment of organic waste biomasses notable examples of ad application are the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and the stabilization of the sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants de bere 2000 sosnowski et al 2003 hartmann and ahring 2005 due to the ability of specific microbial species involved in the process ad allows the simultaneous stabilization of wastes and the production of a renewable energy source in the form of biogas holm nielsen et al 2009 chae et al 2008 lastella et al 2002 lokshina and vavilin 1999 the latter is characterized by a high methane content 40 75 and can be effectively used for clean heat and electrical energy generation zhou et al 2015 the mathematical modeling of ad process has been a challenging topic for the scientific community for about half a century indeed the development of predictive mathematical models plays a key role for the definition of management strategies and the designing of full scale bio reactors according to xie et al 2016 mathematical models of ad processes can be divided into three different categories i kinetic ii statistical and iii computational fluid dynamics cfd based models kinetic models are able to account for microbial growth and substrate consumption rates to describe the system evolution among them some models describe the ad process based on its limiting steps these are usually simplified models describing the slower kinetics related to substrates and or species involved in the process andrews 1969 1971 lawrence 1971 andrews and graef 1970 other kinetic models are more complex and entirely describe the ad process without establishing a limiting step vavilin et al 1994 angelidaki et al 1999 statistical models are mainly focused on the link between some key parameters and the model output these models give information about the optimum set of initial conditions able to maximize the specific process target for instance some of them try to find the best substrate composition by using a polynomial regression which describes the relationship between the output and substrate components wang et al 2013 cfd models numerically simulate physics phenomena occurring into bio reactors given a specific reactor configuration they are able to predict many abiotic conditions such as the velocity field the turbulence the temperature distribution and the residence time the main aim is to study the effect of mixing conditions on the microbial population performing the ad process indeed this information might be very useful at a real scale level to determine the contact time between the substrate and the microbial biomass yu et al 2013 it is important to notice that cfd based models completely neglect the aspects related to the biological reactions occurring in ad to predict the evolution of the process a separate biological compartment constituted by a specific system of equations is required however cfd models are computationally more demanding than all the other models among kinetic models in 2002 the international water association iwa task group for mathematical modeling of anaerobic digestion processes developed a comprehensive mathematical model known as anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm 1 batstone et al 2002 which was based on experiences acquired over the previous years in modeling and simulating the ad process although some processes involved in the ad are neglected adm 1 was the first real attempt to create a common framework in the ad modeling field from its publication in 2002 almost 2000 works have been inspired on adm 1 structure the model was proposed for the ad of sewage sludge and it considered different biochemical e g substrate decomposition biomass growth etc and physico chemical e g gas transfer acid base equilibrium etc processes taking place in an ad reactor it is based on mass balance equations for different state variables particulate soluble and gaseous substance concentrations and it reproduces the conversion of complex organic matter to a methane rich biogas the adm 1 can be applied to a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr where a perfect mixing is implemented in this case the derived mass balance equations represent a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode where the state variables only depend on time and the non linearity is due to the source terms the model schematizes the process in five main phases disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in its first edition of 2002 adm 1 neglected crucial processes involved in ad reduction of sulfate and nitrates oxidation of acetate homoacetogenesis precipitation of solids inhibition due to sulfide nitrates long chain fatty acids lcfas and weak acids and bases over the years many modifications have been proposed to the original adm 1 to take into account some of these processes overlooked by the model for instance in 2008 esposito et al 2008 proposed a modified adm 1 based model to study the effect of the solid particle size on the production of methane the authors modeled the disintegration process with a surface based kinetic sbk approach they introduced a kinetic constant depending on two terms the specific disintegration rate k s b k and the overall surface area of the treated complex organic particles per unit mass a the first term was influenced by the nature of the substrate the latter was affected by the particle size in particular they considered spherical shape particles fed to the bio reactor in another work esposito et al 2011 the same authors calibrated and validated the model considering a small particle size range 0 5 2 5 mm of the fed particles and the calibration was performed with ad experimental data obtained from the conversion of a synthetic cheese and pasta substrate other authors used a sbk approach for modeling the disintegration process of ad momoh and saroj studied the applicability of both surface based and water based diffusion kinetic models for biogas production from cow manure momoh and saroj 2016 they found that both approaches can be successfully applied to model the kinetics of hydrolysis and the biogas production dawei li et al focused on the effects of porphyritic andesite on the hydrolysis and the acidogenesis phases of solid organic wastes ad li et al 2009 they proved that particulate substrate degradation is enhanced by the addition of porphyritic andesite and they showed that the proper dose of this additive compound is able to adsorb volatile acids increase local ph levels and accelerate solids degradation this resulted in the use of an increased value of the k s b k rate liotta et al investigated the role of total solids ts content in the ad of selected complex organic matters using a mathematical model based on a modified version of the adm1 liotta et al 2015 the authors linked the k s b k kinetic constant to the ts content through a linear function introducing two new parameters to be calibrated they found a good agreement between numerical and observed data of ad of food waste and rice straw in batch conditions in the present study a modified version of adm 1 has been calibrated and validated for a wider range of particle size using potato waste as substrate a local sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain information about the influence of all model parameters on the numerical output of the mathematical model the calibration was based on experimental data of the cumulative methane production and acidic byproducts concentrations achieved with lab scale bio reactors the experimental tests were performed using potato waste with particle size lower than one millimeter finally the validation of the model was carried out with other experimental data sets related to the ad of potato waste with particle sizes of 4 and 20 mm respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical modeling the mathematical model is based on a modified version of the adm 1 proposed by esposito et al 2008 the model accounts for the effect of particle size distribution during the disintegration process by using a sbk approach in addition adm 1 discrepancies in both carbon and nitrogen balances are removed according to blumensaat and keller 2005 these authors highlighted that due to the decay of microbial biomass involved in the process additional balance terms are required to close carbon and nitrogen balances the use of a sbk approach for the disintegration kinetic allows to contextually account for the mechanical and granulometric characteristics of substrates the equation governing the disintegration is defined as 1 d c d t k s b k a c where k s b k is the surface based kinetic constant and a is the specific surface area of the disintegrating substrate which directly depends on the particle geometry e g radius r 0 height h 0 etc notably k s b k is independent from the granulometry of the waste as it is a function of the mechanical characteristics of the substrate i e the physical resistance of the waste to disintegration on the other hand the specific area a only depends on the geometry of waste particles involved in the process in particular k s b k is experimentally determined based on the quality of the organic material while a can be derived from the geometry of the waste assuming cylindrical particles with radius r 0 and height h 2 r 0 a can be calculated as 2 a 3 δ r 0 where δ is the mass density of the waste material the model is based on mass conservation principles and it is formulated as a set of odes for soluble gaseous and particulate components indeed the system of equations is organized in three different groups i soluble components in liquid phase s i including the compounds deriving from the hydrolysis of the complex organic matter ii particulate components x i representing the concentration of the microbial groups involved in the biochemical reactions the complex organic matter fed to the ad system and the macromolecules deriving from the disintegration step iii gas components s g a s i i e hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane which are in equilibrium with the corresponding components in the liquid phase the differential equations governing soluble particulate and gas components involved in the ad processes are defined as 3 d v l i q s i d t v l i q γ i ρ a i t s ρ t i t s s gas v l i q j 1 m α i j ρ j t s x i 1 n 1 t 0 4 d v l i q x i d t v l i q j 1 m α i j ρ j t s x i n 1 1 n 2 t 0 5 d v g a s s g a s i d t q g a s s g a s i v l i q ρ t i t s s gas i 1 n 1 t 0 where n 1 denotes the number of soluble components n 2 n 1 denotes the number of particulate components m denotes the number of biochemical processes taken into account α i j is the stoichiometric coefficient of the species i referred to the biochemical process j γ i is the stoichiometric coefficient for the acid base reaction involving the i t h soluble component s i denotes the i t h soluble component x i denotes the i t h particulate component s g a s i denotes the i t h component in gas form ρ j t s x represents the rate of the j t h biochemical process ρ a i t s represents the acid base kinetic rate equation for the i t h soluble component and ρ t i t s s gas represents the gas transfer rate for the i t h soluble component one of the main issues of ad processes is the accumulation of inhibiting byproducts such as organic acids in the bio reactor environment this phenomenon typically leads to undesired ph levels which negatively affect the biological production of methane and the stabilization of the organic waste fed to the ad units to account for ph variations and control the ad process a charge balance equation accounting for all dissolved ionic species has been considered 6 i 1 p q i i 1 q q i 0 p q n 1 where p is the number of cationic components q is the number of anionic components q i represents the cationic equivalent concentration of species i t h q i represents the anionic equivalent concentration of species i t h to solve the differential algebraic equations system 3 6 suitable initial conditions have been prescribed 7 s i 0 s i 0 i 1 n 1 8 x i 0 x i 0 i n 1 1 n 2 9 s g a s i 0 s g a s i 0 i 1 n 1 the detailed biochemical ρ j t s x acid base ρ a i t s and gas transfer ρ t i t s s gas reaction rates adopted in the model are reported in the following sections in tables 6 and 7 the model equations are shown in the petersen matrix form 2 1 1 biochemical reaction rates during the anaerobic bio conversion many biological processes are contextually performed by different microbial species which can grow proliferate and decay at specific kinetic rates depending on the availability of substrates over time according to the adm 1 the process can be considered as five main sub processes or degradation steps i the disintegration of complex organic matter x c in degradable particulate organic macromolecules x c h x p r x l i x i with the contextual release of inorganic carbon x i c and inorganic nitrogen x i n ii the hydrolysis of the particulate macromolecules in soluble monomers s s u s a a s f a iii the degradation of soluble monomers in organic volatile acids s v a s p r s b u this step is usually named acidogenesis iv the formation of the acetic acid s a c and hydrogen gas s h 2 from the degradation of volatile acids and from the hydrolysis of soluble monomers i e acetogenesis v the formation of methane gas s c h 4 through acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in adm 1 these sub processes are performed by seven microbial groups sugar degraders x s u amino acid degraders x a a lcfa degraders x f a valerate and buryrate degraders x c 4 propionate degraders x p r o acetate degraders x a c hydrogen degraders x h 2 whose kinetics are usually described as conversion rate equations defined as ρ j t s x the rates describe all biological processes occurring in ad based on the availability of the required substrates in the present work the kinetic rates have been formulated as 10 ρ 1 k s b k a x c 11 ρ 2 k h y d c h x c

maximum specific growth rate and the yield of biomass on substrate respectively according to the adm 1 eqs 14 21 allow for the inclusion of additional environmental aspects influencing specific bacterial species during the anaerobic bio conversion inhibition factors related to ph level hydrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations have been considered in the model moreover the limiting factor due to inorganic nitrogen concentration has been included in eqs 29 31 based on experimental evidences specific microbial species involved in ad process are strongly affected by these inhibiting and limiting factors and the inclusion of inhibition and limiting effects is required to properly describe the related kinetic rates these functions assume the form 29 i 1 i p h i i n l i m 30 i 2 i i p h

in terms of biodegradable substrates contextually they can be differently converted in inert materials depending on the considered species in particular for the microorganisms involved in butyric and valeric acids propionic acid and acetic acid degradation a percentage of 20 of the dead biomass has been supposed to constitute new substrates in the present model for all other microbial species the same percentage was fixed at 25 this aspect has been neglected in esposito et al 2008 where 100 of the dead biomass constituted new composite organic material for all microbial species moreover specific decay kinetic constants were used for the bacterial groups acting the uptake of butyric valeric propionic and acetic acid k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c while the constant decay term k d e c a l l was used for all the other bacterial groups this is in contrast with previous models where the decay kinetic constant assumed the same value for all the bacterial groups involved in the process the present approach allows to consider the different nature of microbial species involved in the process avoiding under over estimation errors due to biomass decay quantification 2 1 2 acid base process rate to account for all different cationic and anionic species influencing the ph evolution over time eq 6 the model includes acid base equilibrium equations of all soluble compounds involved in the ad process soluble compounds such as organic acids inorganic carbon and inorganic nitrogen can be found in different ionic forms depending on the specific ph level of the anaerobic environment kinetic rate equations regulate the form of soluble compounds in ad bio reactors they can be expressed as 36 ρ a v a k a b v a s v a s h k a v a k a v a s v a 37 ρ a b u k a b b u s b u s

2 s i c 41 ρ a n h 3 k a b i n s n h 3 s h k a i n k a i n s i n where k a b i and k a i are the acid base kinetic parameter and the acid base equilibrium coefficient for the i t h species with i v a b u p r o a c c o 2 i n respectively the coefficient γ i in eq 3 is equal to 1 when i v a b u p r o a c h c o 3 n h 3 in all other cases it assumes the value of zero 2 2 gas transfer process rate according to the adm 1 the liquid gas transfer processes regulating the concentrations of hydrogen s h 2 methane s c h 4 and inorganic carbon s i c in the liquid and gaseous phases have been considered based on thermodynamic principles these compounds can be found in two different forms due to concentration gradients which are generated between the liquid and gaseous phases of the ad reactors the mass transfer kinetic rates included in the present work are described as 42 ρ t h 2 k l a s h 2 16 k h h 2 p g a s h 2 43 ρ t c h 4 k l a s c h 4 64 k h c h 4 p g a s c h 4 44 ρ t i c k

partial pressure of the i t h component respectively 2 3 experimental activities 2 3 1 ad bio reactors ad hoc ad experiments in semi batch conditions were set up to achieve the required data for model calibration and validation the reactors were constituted by a airtight 2000 ml transparent borosilicate glass bottle simax czech republic with caps equipped with thin tubing on the top for sampling and gas extraction the produced biogas was forced to pass into a volumetric gas measurement system constituted by two different overturned bottles the first was filled with a naoh solution to trap the produced carbon dioxide before methane evaluation the second bottle filled with distilled water allowed for the determination of the produced methane volume from the ad process the reactors were immersed in a thermostatic bath at 33 1 c to ensure mesophilic conditions the initial substrate to inoculum ratio f m food microorganisms was set at 0 5 to promote catabolic reactions the substrate used during the experiments f was constituted by potato waste it was pre treated prior its feeding to reach different desired sizes however it was possible to study the effect of the initial particles size distribution on the disintegration process indeed the same amount of potato waste of 10 k g c o d m 3 was fed twice during 2 different experimental sets named a and b where the substrate particle size was fixed to 1 and 4 mm respectively an additional experimental set bio reactor c was carried out by using a substrate particle size of 20 mm fed twice with 8 5 and 11 kg c o d m 3 each reactor was fed twice to allow the microbial community to acclimate to the specific substrate and to avoid lag phases and undesired byproducts accumulation for each bio reactor a b and c the second organic load was applied when the cumulative biological methane production reached a constant value after 16 16 and 17 days respectively the inoculum for ad tests m was obtained from a full scale ad reactor operating the bio conversion of buffalo manure to biogas all the tests were carried out in triplicate the organic substrate f and the anaerobic digestate m were characterized in terms of ts and volatile solids vs to estimate their organic content and fix the f m ratio to 0 5 prior to start the experiments spasiano et al 2019 the results are shown in table 1 in addition potato waste was characterized in terms of carbohydrates proteins lipids and inert material table 2 to achieve information on the organic composition of the waste these analysis were required to set the adm 1 based mathematical model each of the replicate of the experimental sets a b and c was operated at the same working volume of 1500 ml by adding the same amount of three components substrate digestate and water containing a buffer solution for each experimental set these components were used proportionally to fix the f m ratio and reach the working volume of 1500 ml the buffer solution was included to avoid inhibition effects due to acids accumulation at the end of the experiments the substrate fed to each bioreactor was completely degraded indeed the digestate characterization did not show any visible residue and the same final methane production was observed 2 3 2 analytical methods ts and volatile solids vs were determined according to standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 carbohydrates proteins and lipids were quantified according to the handbook of food analysis nollet 2004 the daily methane production was measured using the volumetric method described above to control the efficiency of the system in removing carbon dioxide some gaseous samples were checked with a varian star 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with shincarbon st 80 100 column and a thermal conductivity detector only methane was detected in the outflow biogas temperature and ph were monitored for at least once a day with a wtw ph meter wtw germany the extracted liquid samples were characterized in terms of organic content chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was obtained using a conversion factor from the vs content 1 5 g c o d g v s 1 volatile fatty acid vfa concentrations were obtained by a solid phase micro extraction of the head space hs spme technique followed by a gas chromatographic coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms analysis with a nukol supelco usa fused silica capillary column panico et al 2015 total vfas tvfas were also evaluated by direct titration of the samples total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were obtained with the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn technique according to the standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 total organic carbon toc and total inorganic carbon tic measurements were performed using a shimadzu 5000 a toc analyzer kyoto japan 2 4 model application 2 4 1 initial conditions a crucial step to use the adm 1 based mathematical model for the simulation of lab scale experiments was to prescribe a reasonable initial condition for the complete set of equations firstly the initial concentration of complex organic matter x c in terms of kg c o d m 3 was derived from experimental measurements it was fixed at 10 kg c o d m 3 to reproduce bio reactors a and b the same amount of potato waste was fed again after 16 days to the bio reactors a and b this was reproduced by numerical simulations where the second organic load was considered at day 16 according to the experimental procedures the initial concentration of the complex organic matter x c was fixed to 8 5 kg c o d m 3 to simulate the bio methane production of reactor c after 17 days of simulation the second organic load of 11 kg c o d m 3 was applied similarly the initial inorganic nitrogen s i n and inorganic carbon s i c were set in accordance with experimental measurements in adm 1 based models a number of microbial species is hypothesized to perform the biochemical reactions for the conversion of organic matter into biogas these species are usually categorized based on their contribution on the anaerobic bio conversion instead of classifying their specific phylum or genera initially the conversion steps of ad lead to the production of vfas which depends on the concentration of the microbial species in the inoculum noteworthy different inocula are characterized by different microbial species distribution depending on the inoculum origin and the bioprocess performed at a real scale for these reasons it is very complicated to set the initial conditions for microbial species distribution in an adm 1 based model in the present work the initial condition for microbial species x s u x a a x f a x c 4 x p r o x a c and x h 2 was set based on numerical simulations the model was run different times for a few days using as initial organic carbon concentration the corresponding value set for reactor a test in this way the initial values of microbial concentrations were adjusted to fit substrate trends during the beginning of the experiment the optimized microbial biomass distribution was used as initial condition for subsequent numerical simulations presented in this work the obtained initial microbial concentrations and the initial condition adopted for reactors a b and c are reported in table 3 the modified adm 1 model was implemented in an original software developed on matlab platform 2 4 2 sensitivity analysis due to the consistent number of equations and parameters a local sensitivity analysis lsa was carried out to investigate the most influencing parameters on model outputs lsa is able to investigate the effect of a single parameter variation on a specific model output xu et al 2004 cariboni et al 2007 the influence of a varying parameter is studied by computing the output variable first order partial derivative over time with respect to the considered parameter zi 2011 eq 45 for each parameter the maximum or the minimum value of the obtained partial derivatives can be used as sensitivity index s i depending on which one is higher in absolute terms eq 46 45 w i j t c u c i t c u u j 46 s i i j max t 0 τ w i j t c u i f max t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j t c u i f max t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j in eqs 45 and 46 s i i j is the j t h parameter sensitivity with respect to the i t h output state variable at time t w i j is the value of the partial derivative of the i t h output state variable with respect to the j t h parameter at the instant time t c i is the i t h chosen output state variable concentration c is the vector of the state variables concentration in soluble particle or gaseous phase u j is the j t h investigated parameter value u is the vector of the model parameters and τ is the final instant time it is important to notice that some sensitivity analysis results may depend on the initial condition as some parameter could be characterized by a wide fluctuation range zi 2011 razavi et al 2021 the cumulative methane production and the vfas concentration over time were set as model output for eq 45 and the sensitivity of three groups of biochemical parameters was evaluated the first group included the kinetic parameters such as maximum specific uptake rates k m s u k m a a k m f a k m c 4 k m p r o k m a c k m h 2 half saturation constants k s s u k s a a k s f a k s c 4 k s p r o k s a c k s h 2 and first order decay rates k d e c a l l k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c the second group was constituted by stoichiometric parameters such as yields of microbial species on substrates y s u y a a y f a y c 4 y p r o y a c y h 2 the third group included hydrolysis disintegration related parameters k h y d c h k h y d p r k h y d l i and k s b k all non biochemical parameters e g limiting inhibiting constants equilibrium constants for gas transfer and acid base reactions were not investigated in the present study as their uncertainty can be attributed to the experimental design and the reactor configuration tartakovsky et al 2008 the sensitivity analysis was performed by simulating the process dynamics of the reactor a and setting the initial condition presented in table 3 the initial values of the investigated parameters were set in accordance to the original adm 1 batstone et al 2002 the initial value for the surface based kinetic constant k s b k was set in accordance to sanders et al 2000 where the same substrate and a similar equation were used the matlab tool sens sys molla and padilla 2002 coupled with an ode solver were used to perform the numerical analysis 2 4 3 model calibration and validation based on the sensitivity analysis a trial and error method was used to calibrate the model this method is highly recommended for the calibration of complex mathematical models with a high number of parameters varying in a wide range refsgaard and storm 1990 specifically the selected parameters are calibrated individually once the first parameter is calibrated another parameter is allowed to vary in its specific variation range the algorithm ends when a reasonable fitness with experimental data is reached sin et al 2008 the parameters with higher sensitivity indexes where calibrated before all the others to compare model prediction with experimental data during the calibration steps the experimental cumulative methane production and vfas trends data in the bio reactor a were used the performance of the calibration was evaluated by three different methods janssen and heuberger 1995 the modeling efficiency m e the index of agreement i o a and the root mean square error r m s e method including its normalized form n r m s e these methods require the computation of four different indexes eqs 47 50 47 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 48 n r m s e r m s e o 49 m e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 50 i o a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where p i is the i t h model predicted value o i and o are the i t h and the means observed value and n is the number of observations the model validation consisted in verifying the agreement between simulated values and experimental data achieved from bio reactors b and c with particle sizes of 4 and 20 mm respectively the values of all parameters were obtained from the calibration step the performance of the validation procedure was evaluated through the same parameters described above eqs 47 50 3 results and discussions 3 1 sensitivity analysis the aim of ad is to maximize the production of methane from a given substrate with a stable biological process on the other hand vfas concentration during the anaerobic conversion may be a useful index to avoid bio reactor acidification and decreased conversion efficiency the cumulative methane production was chosen as the model output to perform the sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity indexes for each investigated parameter are shown in fig 1 the sensitivity analysis was also performed based on vfas concentration and the results are reported in figs 2 4 the results of the sensitivity index of the kinetic and hydrolysis disintegration related parameters referred to methane production fig 1a showed that the most sensitive parameter was the disintegration kinetic constant k s b k whose sensitivity index value was 0 339 this result is in accordance with the sensitivity analysis performed in chen et al 2016 where the adm 1 was applied to simulate biogas production from a different organic substrate despite a different index was used the most significant sensitivity was referred to the kinetic constant of the disintegration process another relevant result is related to the maximum specific uptake rate for acetic acid k m a c which showed the higher si than all the other parameters grouped in fig 1a si 3 6 1 0 5 however this value is not comparable with respect to the si of the disintegration constant k s b k this evidence is in contrast with the local sensitivity analysis reported in montecchio et al 2017 where adm 1 was used to model the effects of thermal pretreatment on an ad process of food waste they reported a si value of k m a c with the same magnitude of the disintegration constant in the present work the sensitivity of k m a c increased when the acetic acid concentration was considered as the model output of the sensitivity analysis fig 2a however it was lower than the sensitivity of k s b k among kinetic and hydrolysis disintegration related parameters the si of k s b k showed the highest value when using other vfa concentrations as output variables fig 2 this can be explained by the crucial role of the disintegration during the first steps of the anaerobic bio conversion indeed low values of k s b k lead to low kinetic rates due to the reduced availability of substrates when high k s b k values are applied all the anaerobic kinetics are stimulated and the complexity and the particle size distribution of the substrates are completely neglected the si values of all half saturation constants with respect to the cumulative methane production are reported in fig 1b in log scale the majority of the half saturation constants showed si values around 10 3 except for k s f a and k s h 2 for these parameters the sensitivity reached the extreme values of 1 42 1 0 6 and 1 21 respectively the assimilation of fatty acids regulated by k s f a has a relatively negligible effect on methane production while hydrogen kinetics strongly influence the final methane production a similar result was also obtained by using vfa concentrations as output variable fig 3a the most sensitive half saturation constant was k s h 2 si 1 0 2 and a negligible si value was found for all the other parameters in particular k s f a showed the lower si value when valeric propionic or acetic acid were selected as model output while k s a c showed the lowest sensitivity value in the case of butyric acid the crucial role of k s h 2 is due to the importance of hydrogen dynamics during ad indeed hydrogen is able to affect the assimilation kinetic rates of fatty acids valerate butyrate and propionate eqs 16 19 a partial inhibition of these processes leads to a slower acetate production and consequent negative effects on methane generation by acetoclastic methanogens eq 20 the si values of yield coefficients with respect to the cumulative methane production fig 1c revealed a significant influence of sugar and acetic acid consuming microorganisms the values of 0 007 and 0 005 were obtained for y s u and y a c respectively the low sensitivity of the majority of half saturation constants and yield coefficients is in accordance with the results of the local sensitivity analysis reported by souza et al 2013 in the case of vfas used as sensitivity output fig 3b the yields of valeric butyric propionic and acetic acid consuming species were relevant for the corresponding acid concentrations specifically the propionic acid concentration s p r o resulted more sensitive to the yield y p r o than y s u such a result is in contrast with the sensitivity analysis performed by barrera et al 2015 where y s u was one of the more influencing parameter on the propionic acid concentration in addition the yield of propionic acid consuming biomass was characterized by a very low sensitivity with respect to the same variable this result can be due to the different structure of the model presented in barrera et al 2015 accounting for sulfate reduction during propionate uptake finally the si values of all decay terms were reported in figs 1d and 4 among them the decay term related to sugar amino acids fatty acids and hydrogen consuming species k d e c a l l showed the highest effect on the cumulative methane production in the case of vfas the more sensitive decay rate was related to the microbial species involved in the degradation of each corresponding vfa 3 2 model calibration based on the results of the sensitivity analysis the parameters k s b k k h y d c h k h y d p r k h y d l i k m p r o k m a c k s s u k s c 4 k s a c k d e c a l l k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c were selected for the calibration other sensitive parameters such as k s h 2 and all the yields coefficients were set to the default adm 1 value as it was possible to appropriately fit the experimental data in all the studied cases table 4 reports the calibrated values for the investigated parameters compared to the adm 1 values the calibrated value of the disintegration constant k s b k is not comparable with any adm 1 parameter as a different equation is assumed for the sbk model however the k s b k value has been investigated in very few cases in literature and its wide variation range strongly depends on the specific organic substrate converted in the present case the value of 0 72 kg m 2 d 1 for this parameter allowed to achieve the best fit between experimental and simulated data this value is higher with respect to 9 6 1 0 3 10 8 1 0 3 and 12 0 1 0 3 kg m 2 d 1 used for a similar substrate by sanders et al 2000 these authors reproduced experimental data of ad batch reactors operated by using particulate starch obtained from fresh potatoes and commercially available starch as organic substrate they carried out experiments using fresh potatoes with particle size less than 45 µm and between 45 and 125 µm they validated the model using experimental results of ad in batch reactors for the commercially available starch on the contrary the value of k s b k calibrated in the present study is lower than 12 96 1 0 3 kg m 2 d 1 reported in esposito et al 2011 where the authors performed biomethane potential bmp experiments on synthetic organic waste pasta and cheese with different particle size distributions these differences in k s b k value allow to confirm that it directly depends on the nature and characteristics of substrates such as biodegradability and composition some differences with the adm 1 model have been observed with the maximum propionic and acetic acid uptake rate constants k m p r o and k m a c these values were set to 60 d 1 and 27 d 1 in the modified model differently from fatolahi et al 2020 where the increase of k m p r o and k m a c with respect to their baseline values of adm 1 was not required in addition the authors operated significant modifications of the monod maximum specific uptake rates k m s u and k m c 4 fatolahi et al 2020 in the present study k m s u and k m c 4 were set according to the adm 1 model moreover the values of the calibrated half saturation constants k s s u k s c 4 and k s a c were lower than those used in the adm 1 to better fit experimental data the half saturation constants for valerate butyrate and acetate were reduced a similar result was obtained in the calibration of a modified adm 1 used to reproduce starch wastewater and synthetic substrate bio conversion in a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor hinken et al 2014 the calibrated values related to the hydrolysis constants k h y d c h k h y d p r and k h y d l i resulted lower than those reported in batstone et al 2002 these values are in accordance with batstone et al 2009 where the range of 0 15 0 3 d 1 was reported for bmp tests of hydrolyzed sludge samples decreased values for the hydrolysis parameters were also reported in garcía gen et al 2015 the authors studied the disintegration and hydrolysis kinetics during the ad of fruit and vegetable waste the differences with adm 1 can be mainly ascribed to the different substrate fed to the bioreactors adm 1 was calibrated based on the ad of activated sludge which is generally constituted by an hydrolyzed semi solid matrix containing slow biodegradable compounds on the other hand potato waste needs to be hydrolyzed during ad and its readily biodegradable organic content is higher than activated sludge this fraction is able to stimulate biological kinetics during the bio conversion and modify the kinetic constants the model was able to fit the experimental cumulative methane production data related to the bio reactor a as it is shown in fig 5 the performance indicators are reported in table 5 the goodness of fit indexes are referred to the cumulative methane production trends the good quality of the calibration is described by the m e and the i o a coefficients which are both close to 1 moreover the small values of the rmse and its normalized form show that a negligible mean error of 209 51 ml with respect to the total methane production 7521 ml affected the model prediction these results confirmed the good accuracy of the calibration procedure the vfas production figs 6 7 accurately reproduced the experimental data except for butyric acid fig 7a this can be due to the coupled kinetic uptake rates related to valeric and butyric acid assimilation reported in eqs 17 18 in some cases two separate microbial species operating the valeric acid and the butyric acid conversion were considered in this study a common microbial species was considered for s b u and s v a degradation according to the original adm 1 this choice leads to a relative overestimation of butyric acid with respect to the experimental data but it allows the possibility of comparing other adm 1 based works with the presented results to further compare the sbk model with the original adm 1 the same calibration procedure was adopted using the original adm 1 the common parameters of the different models were calibrated using the reactor a data set indeed the k s b k kinetic constant of the sbk model was replaced by the disintegration kinetic constant k d i s of the original adm 1 the resulting performance indicators are reported in table 5 it can be noticed that all the goodness of fit indexes are worse than those obtained during the calibration of the modified sbk model the results confirmed the importance of adopting a sbk kinetic model when the disintegration of the organic substrate represents the limiting step of the ad process noteworthy the calibration of the model was achieved by using the complete set of data related to the bio reactor a based on the experimental feeding procedure it should be possible to divide the data set and use the obtained partial set of data from day 16 to the end of the experiment to calibrate the model usually this procedure avoids any calibration error due to microbial species adaptation to the specific fed substrate and it allows to obtain a more representative set of parameters in the present case this procedure was not required as no differences were observed when using the complete or the partial data set 3 3 model validation numerical simulations were run to validate the model using the data sets related to bio reactors b and c where potato waste was fed at different particle sizes 4 and 20 mm and comparable concentrations the values of the calibrated parameters were used for numerical simulations and the validation results of the cumulative methane production and organic acids over time have been reported in figs 8 13 moreover table 5 shows also the performance indicators values obtained during model validation steps using different data sets the values of m e i o a r m s e and n r m s e confirmed that the model is able to properly predict the cumulative methane production for a wide range of substrate particle size however a small drop in the m e and the i o a indexes and an increase in the mean error r m s e have been observed from simulations related to reactor c the largest particle size investigated nevertheless these values are acceptable as the r m s e is still a small value compared to the total cumulative produced methane of 7375 ml moreover the m e coefficient and the i o a are still close to 1 the vfa evolution curves were adequately fitted by model simulations except for the butyric acid as previously reported the fitting with experimental data should be improved by uncoupling butyric and valeric acid degradation kinetics the accuracy of the model validation for substrates with a larger particle size distribution proved that the model can be also applied to the case of the ad of other substrates such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw esposito et al 2008 once the parameters related to the characteristics of a specific substrate have been calibrated it is possible to reproduce the ad of that substrate with smaller and or larger particle sizes indeed the k s b k is the same for each particle size while only a depends on the size of the particles it is important to highlight that the application of such kinetic model is possible when a wet anaerobic process is considered in this condition it could be assumed that substrates are continuously available to microbial species during the bioconversion increasing the particle size may lead to incorrect predictions of the process development as incomplete substrate conversion or local accumulation of substrate occur in these cases it is necessary to consider a different mass balance equation to account for transport phenomena occurring within the bioreactor differently from liotta et al 2015 in this work it was not necessary to relate the disintegration rate constant k s b k to the ts content in the bioreactor this relationship increases the complexity of the model as the calibration of two new parameters is required indeed the parameters reported in liotta et al 2015 were related to different biotic and abiotic conditions such as the substrate nature specific experimental conditions temperature pressure ph retention time and mixing conditions in the present work experimental results were successfully reproduced without focusing on k s b k and ts relationship finally numerical results showed that a proper identification of k s b k allows for the correct prediction of substrate degradation and methane production using different particle size distribution this result is in contrast with li et al 2009 where the k s b k was related to the particle mean diameter detected in bioreactors at different times 4 conclusions the aim of the present work was to calibrate and validate a surface based kinetic model for the anaerobic digestion process of potato waste the model consisted on a modified adm 1 model where the disintegration kinetic was able to account for the particle size of the organic substrate modifications concerning the kinetic parameters of the microbial species involved in the ad process have been discussed a local sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of choosing the correct set of parameters to model methane generation and volatile fatty acids concentrations in real ad bio reactors the introduced disintegration kinetic constant k s b k presented the highest sensitivity among disintegration hydrolysis related parameters and monod specific uptake rates a standard procedure for calibration and validation of the model for different substrates has been defined the model was successfully calibrated and validated with ad hoc ad experiments carried out using potato waste as organic substrate the model properly predicted the cumulative methane production and vfas concentration profiles achieved during lab scale experiments finally validation results showed the ability of the surface based kinetic model to adequately describe real processes where a wide range of particle size characterizes the substrate fed to ad reactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

24535,a surface based kinetic model for the anaerobic digestion of potato waste was proposed the model was calibrated and validated and a local sensitivity analysis was performed to investigate the most sensitive parameters the model consisted of a modified anaerobic digestion model n 1 where the disintegration process was defined through a surface based approach able to account for the influence of the particle size on the process development ad hoc experiments were carried out to calibrate and validate the model at a laboratory scale the calibration and validation procedures accounted for the methane production and organic acid concentrations observed during experimental tests the quality of model fitting with lab scale data was evaluated by the modeling efficiency the index of agreement and the root mean square error methods results confirmed the high accuracy of the model for the bio methane and organic by products prediction during the anaerobic conversion of potato waste keywords adm1 based model surface based kinetic approach odes system local sensitivity analysis anaerobic digestion 1 introduction during the last decades the anaerobic digestion ad process has been widely used for the stabilization and the treatment of organic waste biomasses notable examples of ad application are the treatment of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes and the stabilization of the sewage sludge from municipal wastewater treatment plants de bere 2000 sosnowski et al 2003 hartmann and ahring 2005 due to the ability of specific microbial species involved in the process ad allows the simultaneous stabilization of wastes and the production of a renewable energy source in the form of biogas holm nielsen et al 2009 chae et al 2008 lastella et al 2002 lokshina and vavilin 1999 the latter is characterized by a high methane content 40 75 and can be effectively used for clean heat and electrical energy generation zhou et al 2015 the mathematical modeling of ad process has been a challenging topic for the scientific community for about half a century indeed the development of predictive mathematical models plays a key role for the definition of management strategies and the designing of full scale bio reactors according to xie et al 2016 mathematical models of ad processes can be divided into three different categories i kinetic ii statistical and iii computational fluid dynamics cfd based models kinetic models are able to account for microbial growth and substrate consumption rates to describe the system evolution among them some models describe the ad process based on its limiting steps these are usually simplified models describing the slower kinetics related to substrates and or species involved in the process andrews 1969 1971 lawrence 1971 andrews and graef 1970 other kinetic models are more complex and entirely describe the ad process without establishing a limiting step vavilin et al 1994 angelidaki et al 1999 statistical models are mainly focused on the link between some key parameters and the model output these models give information about the optimum set of initial conditions able to maximize the specific process target for instance some of them try to find the best substrate composition by using a polynomial regression which describes the relationship between the output and substrate components wang et al 2013 cfd models numerically simulate physics phenomena occurring into bio reactors given a specific reactor configuration they are able to predict many abiotic conditions such as the velocity field the turbulence the temperature distribution and the residence time the main aim is to study the effect of mixing conditions on the microbial population performing the ad process indeed this information might be very useful at a real scale level to determine the contact time between the substrate and the microbial biomass yu et al 2013 it is important to notice that cfd based models completely neglect the aspects related to the biological reactions occurring in ad to predict the evolution of the process a separate biological compartment constituted by a specific system of equations is required however cfd models are computationally more demanding than all the other models among kinetic models in 2002 the international water association iwa task group for mathematical modeling of anaerobic digestion processes developed a comprehensive mathematical model known as anaerobic digestion model no 1 adm 1 batstone et al 2002 which was based on experiences acquired over the previous years in modeling and simulating the ad process although some processes involved in the ad are neglected adm 1 was the first real attempt to create a common framework in the ad modeling field from its publication in 2002 almost 2000 works have been inspired on adm 1 structure the model was proposed for the ad of sewage sludge and it considered different biochemical e g substrate decomposition biomass growth etc and physico chemical e g gas transfer acid base equilibrium etc processes taking place in an ad reactor it is based on mass balance equations for different state variables particulate soluble and gaseous substance concentrations and it reproduces the conversion of complex organic matter to a methane rich biogas the adm 1 can be applied to a continuous stirred tank reactor cstr where a perfect mixing is implemented in this case the derived mass balance equations represent a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ode where the state variables only depend on time and the non linearity is due to the source terms the model schematizes the process in five main phases disintegration hydrolysis acidogenesis acetogenesis and methanogenesis in its first edition of 2002 adm 1 neglected crucial processes involved in ad reduction of sulfate and nitrates oxidation of acetate homoacetogenesis precipitation of solids inhibition due to sulfide nitrates long chain fatty acids lcfas and weak acids and bases over the years many modifications have been proposed to the original adm 1 to take into account some of these processes overlooked by the model for instance in 2008 esposito et al 2008 proposed a modified adm 1 based model to study the effect of the solid particle size on the production of methane the authors modeled the disintegration process with a surface based kinetic sbk approach they introduced a kinetic constant depending on two terms the specific disintegration rate k s b k and the overall surface area of the treated complex organic particles per unit mass a the first term was influenced by the nature of the substrate the latter was affected by the particle size in particular they considered spherical shape particles fed to the bio reactor in another work esposito et al 2011 the same authors calibrated and validated the model considering a small particle size range 0 5 2 5 mm of the fed particles and the calibration was performed with ad experimental data obtained from the conversion of a synthetic cheese and pasta substrate other authors used a sbk approach for modeling the disintegration process of ad momoh and saroj studied the applicability of both surface based and water based diffusion kinetic models for biogas production from cow manure momoh and saroj 2016 they found that both approaches can be successfully applied to model the kinetics of hydrolysis and the biogas production dawei li et al focused on the effects of porphyritic andesite on the hydrolysis and the acidogenesis phases of solid organic wastes ad li et al 2009 they proved that particulate substrate degradation is enhanced by the addition of porphyritic andesite and they showed that the proper dose of this additive compound is able to adsorb volatile acids increase local ph levels and accelerate solids degradation this resulted in the use of an increased value of the k s b k rate liotta et al investigated the role of total solids ts content in the ad of selected complex organic matters using a mathematical model based on a modified version of the adm1 liotta et al 2015 the authors linked the k s b k kinetic constant to the ts content through a linear function introducing two new parameters to be calibrated they found a good agreement between numerical and observed data of ad of food waste and rice straw in batch conditions in the present study a modified version of adm 1 has been calibrated and validated for a wider range of particle size using potato waste as substrate a local sensitivity analysis was performed to obtain information about the influence of all model parameters on the numerical output of the mathematical model the calibration was based on experimental data of the cumulative methane production and acidic byproducts concentrations achieved with lab scale bio reactors the experimental tests were performed using potato waste with particle size lower than one millimeter finally the validation of the model was carried out with other experimental data sets related to the ad of potato waste with particle sizes of 4 and 20 mm respectively 2 materials and methods 2 1 mathematical modeling the mathematical model is based on a modified version of the adm 1 proposed by esposito et al 2008 the model accounts for the effect of particle size distribution during the disintegration process by using a sbk approach in addition adm 1 discrepancies in both carbon and nitrogen balances are removed according to blumensaat and keller 2005 these authors highlighted that due to the decay of microbial biomass involved in the process additional balance terms are required to close carbon and nitrogen balances the use of a sbk approach for the disintegration kinetic allows to contextually account for the mechanical and granulometric characteristics of substrates the equation governing the disintegration is defined as 1 d c d t k s b k a c where k s b k is the surface based kinetic constant and a is the specific surface area of the disintegrating substrate which directly depends on the particle geometry e g radius r 0 height h 0 etc notably k s b k is independent from the granulometry of the waste as it is a function of the mechanical characteristics of the substrate i e the physical resistance of the waste to disintegration on the other hand the specific area a only depends on the geometry of waste particles involved in the process in particular k s b k is experimentally determined based on the quality of the organic material while a can be derived from the geometry of the waste assuming cylindrical particles with radius r 0 and height h 2 r 0 a can be calculated as 2 a 3 δ r 0 where δ is the mass density of the waste material the model is based on mass conservation principles and it is formulated as a set of odes for soluble gaseous and particulate components indeed the system of equations is organized in three different groups i soluble components in liquid phase s i including the compounds deriving from the hydrolysis of the complex organic matter ii particulate components x i representing the concentration of the microbial groups involved in the biochemical reactions the complex organic matter fed to the ad system and the macromolecules deriving from the disintegration step iii gas components s g a s i i e hydrogen carbon dioxide and methane which are in equilibrium with the corresponding components in the liquid phase the differential equations governing soluble particulate and gas components involved in the ad processes are defined as 3 d v l i q s i d t v l i q γ i ρ a i t s ρ t i t s s gas v l i q j 1 m α i j ρ j t s x i 1 n 1 t 0 4 d v l i q x i d t v l i q j 1 m α i j ρ j t s x i n 1 1 n 2 t 0 5 d v g a s s g a s i d t q g a s s g a s i v l i q ρ t i t s s gas i 1 n 1 t 0 where n 1 denotes the number of soluble components n 2 n 1 denotes the number of particulate components m denotes the number of biochemical processes taken into account α i j is the stoichiometric coefficient of the species i referred to the biochemical process j γ i is the stoichiometric coefficient for the acid base reaction involving the i t h soluble component s i denotes the i t h soluble component x i denotes the i t h particulate component s g a s i denotes the i t h component in gas form ρ j t s x represents the rate of the j t h biochemical process ρ a i t s represents the acid base kinetic rate equation for the i t h soluble component and ρ t i t s s gas represents the gas transfer rate for the i t h soluble component one of the main issues of ad processes is the accumulation of inhibiting byproducts such as organic acids in the bio reactor environment this phenomenon typically leads to undesired ph levels which negatively affect the biological production of methane and the stabilization of the organic waste fed to the ad units to account for ph variations and control the ad process a charge balance equation accounting for all dissolved ionic species has been considered 6 i 1 p q i i 1 q q i 0 p q n 1 where p is the number of cationic components q is the number of anionic components q i represents the cationic equivalent concentration of species i t h q i represents the anionic equivalent concentration of species i t h to solve the differential algebraic equations system 3 6 suitable initial conditions have been prescribed 7 s i 0 s i 0 i 1 n 1 8 x i 0 x i 0 i n 1 1 n 2 9 s g a s i 0 s g a s i 0 i 1 n 1 the detailed biochemical ρ j t s x acid base ρ a i t s and gas transfer ρ t i t s s gas reaction rates adopted in the model are reported in the following sections in tables 6 and 7 the model equations are shown in the petersen matrix form 2 1 1 biochemical reaction rates during the anaerobic bio conversion many biological processes are contextually performed by different microbial species which can grow proliferate and decay at specific kinetic rates depending on the availability of substrates over time according to the adm 1 the process can be considered as five main sub processes or degradation steps i the disintegration of complex organic matter x c in degradable particulate organic macromolecules x c h x p r x l i x i with the contextual release of inorganic carbon x i c and inorganic nitrogen x i n ii the hydrolysis of the particulate macromolecules in soluble monomers s s u s a a s f a iii the degradation of soluble monomers in organic volatile acids s v a s p r s b u this step is usually named acidogenesis iv the formation of the acetic acid s a c and hydrogen gas s h 2 from the degradation of volatile acids and from the hydrolysis of soluble monomers i e acetogenesis v the formation of methane gas s c h 4 through acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis in adm 1 these sub processes are performed by seven microbial groups sugar degraders x s u amino acid degraders x a a lcfa degraders x f a valerate and buryrate degraders x c 4 propionate degraders x p r o acetate degraders x a c hydrogen degraders x h 2 whose kinetics are usually described as conversion rate equations defined as ρ j t s x the rates describe all biological processes occurring in ad based on the availability of the required substrates in the present work the kinetic rates have been formulated as 10 ρ 1 k s b k a x c 11 ρ 2 k h y d c h x c

bacterial species during the anaerobic bio conversion inhibition factors related to ph level hydrogen and ammonia nitrogen concentrations have been considered in the model moreover the limiting factor due to inorganic nitrogen concentration has been included in eqs 29 31 based on experimental evidences specific microbial species involved in ad process are strongly affected by these inhibiting and limiting factors and the inclusion of inhibition and limiting effects is required to properly describe the related kinetic rates these functions assume the form 29 i 1 i p h i i n l i m 30 i 2 i i p h

in terms of biodegradable substrates contextually they can be differently converted in inert materials depending on the considered species in particular for the microorganisms involved in butyric and valeric acids propionic acid and acetic acid degradation a percentage of 20 of the dead biomass has been supposed to constitute new substrates in the present model for all other microbial species the same percentage was fixed at 25 this aspect has been neglected in esposito et al 2008 where 100 of the dead biomass constituted new composite organic material for all microbial species moreover specific decay kinetic constants were used for the bacterial groups acting the uptake of butyric valeric propionic and acetic acid k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c while the constant decay term k d e c a l l was used for all the other bacterial groups this is in contrast with previous models where the decay kinetic constant assumed the same value for all the bacterial groups involved in the process the present approach allows to consider the different nature of microbial species involved in the process avoiding under over estimation errors due to biomass decay quantification 2 1 2 acid base process rate to account for all different cationic and anionic species influencing the ph evolution over time eq 6 the model includes acid base equilibrium equations of all soluble compounds involved in the ad process soluble compounds such as organic acids inorganic carbon and inorganic nitrogen can be found in different ionic forms depending on the specific ph level of the anaerobic environment kinetic rate equations regulate the form of soluble compounds in ad bio reactors they can be expressed as 36 ρ a v a k a b v a s v a s h k a v a k a v a s v a 37 ρ a b u k a b b u s b u s

according to the adm 1 the liquid gas transfer processes regulating the concentrations of hydrogen s h 2 methane s c h 4 and inorganic carbon s i c in the liquid and gaseous phases have been considered based on thermodynamic principles these compounds can be found in two different forms due to concentration gradients which are generated between the liquid and gaseous phases of the ad reactors the mass transfer kinetic rates included in the present work are described as 42 ρ t h 2 k l a s h 2 16 k h h 2 p g a s h 2 43 ρ t c h 4 k l a s c h 4 64 k h c h 4 p g a s c h 4 44 ρ t i c k l a s c o 2 k h c o 2 p g a s c o 2 where k l a is the gas liquid transfer coefficient while k h i and p g a s i i h 2 c h 4 c o 2 are the henry s law coefficient and the steady state gas phase partial pressure of the i t h component respectively 2 3 experimental activities 2 3 1 ad bio reactors ad hoc ad experiments in semi batch conditions were set up to achieve the required data for model calibration and validation the reactors were constituted by a airtight 2000 ml transparent borosilicate glass bottle simax czech republic with caps equipped with thin tubing on the top for sampling and gas extraction the produced biogas was forced to pass into a volumetric gas measurement system constituted by two different overturned bottles the first was filled with a naoh solution to trap the produced carbon dioxide before methane evaluation the second bottle filled with distilled water allowed for the determination of the produced methane volume from the ad process the reactors were immersed in a thermostatic bath at 33 1 c to ensure mesophilic conditions the initial substrate to inoculum ratio f m food microorganisms was set at 0 5 to promote catabolic reactions the substrate used during the experiments f was constituted by potato waste it was pre treated prior its feeding to reach different desired sizes however it was possible to study the effect of the initial particles size distribution on the disintegration process indeed the same amount of potato waste of 10 k g c o d m 3 was fed twice during 2 different experimental sets named a and b where the substrate particle size was fixed to 1 and 4 mm respectively an additional experimental set bio reactor c was carried out by using a substrate particle size of 20 mm fed twice with 8 5 and 11 kg c o d m 3 each reactor was fed twice to allow the microbial community to acclimate to the specific substrate and to avoid lag phases and undesired byproducts accumulation for each bio reactor a b and c the second organic load was applied when the cumulative biological methane production reached a constant value after 16 16 and 17 days respectively the inoculum for ad tests m was obtained from a full scale ad reactor operating the bio conversion of buffalo manure to biogas all the tests were carried out in triplicate the organic substrate f and the anaerobic digestate m were characterized in terms of ts and volatile solids vs to estimate their organic content and fix the f m ratio to 0 5 prior to start the experiments spasiano et al 2019 the results are shown in table 1 in addition potato waste was characterized in terms of carbohydrates proteins lipids and inert material table 2 to achieve information on the organic composition of the waste these analysis were required to set the adm 1 based mathematical model each of the replicate of the experimental sets a b and c was operated at the same working volume of 1500 ml by adding the same amount of three components substrate digestate and water containing a buffer solution for each experimental set these components were used proportionally to fix the f m ratio and reach the working volume of 1500 ml the buffer solution was included to avoid inhibition effects due to acids accumulation at the end of the experiments the substrate fed to each bioreactor was completely degraded indeed the digestate characterization did not show any visible residue and the same final methane production was observed 2 3 2 analytical methods ts and volatile solids vs were determined according to standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 carbohydrates proteins and lipids were quantified according to the handbook of food analysis nollet 2004 the daily methane production was measured using the volumetric method described above to control the efficiency of the system in removing carbon dioxide some gaseous samples were checked with a varian star 3400 gas chromatograph equipped with shincarbon st 80 100 column and a thermal conductivity detector only methane was detected in the outflow biogas temperature and ph were monitored for at least once a day with a wtw ph meter wtw germany the extracted liquid samples were characterized in terms of organic content chemical oxygen demand cod concentration was obtained using a conversion factor from the vs content 1 5 g c o d g v s 1 volatile fatty acid vfa concentrations were obtained by a solid phase micro extraction of the head space hs spme technique followed by a gas chromatographic coupled to mass spectrometry gc ms analysis with a nukol supelco usa fused silica capillary column panico et al 2015 total vfas tvfas were also evaluated by direct titration of the samples total nitrogen and ammonia nitrogen were obtained with the total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn technique according to the standard methods apha awwa wef 1998 total organic carbon toc and total inorganic carbon tic measurements were performed using a shimadzu 5000 a toc analyzer kyoto japan 2 4 model application 2 4 1 initial conditions a crucial step to use the adm 1 based mathematical model for the simulation of lab scale experiments was to prescribe a reasonable initial condition for the complete set of equations firstly the initial concentration of complex organic matter x c in terms of kg c o d m 3 was derived from experimental measurements it was fixed at 10 kg c o d m 3 to reproduce bio reactors a and b the same amount of potato waste was fed again after 16 days to the bio reactors a and b this was reproduced by numerical simulations where the second organic load was considered at day 16 according to the experimental procedures the initial concentration of the complex organic matter x c was fixed to 8 5 kg c o d m 3 to simulate the bio methane production of reactor c after 17 days of simulation the second organic load of 11 kg c o d m 3 was applied similarly the initial inorganic nitrogen s i n and inorganic carbon s i c were set in accordance with experimental measurements in adm 1 based models a number of microbial species is hypothesized to perform the biochemical reactions for the conversion of organic matter into biogas these species are usually categorized based on their contribution on the anaerobic bio conversion instead of classifying their specific phylum or genera initially the conversion steps of ad lead to the production of vfas which depends on the concentration of the microbial species in the inoculum noteworthy different inocula are characterized by different microbial species distribution depending on the inoculum origin and the bioprocess performed at a real scale for these reasons it is very complicated to set the initial conditions for microbial species distribution in an adm 1 based model in the present work the initial condition for microbial species x s u x a a x f a x c 4 x p r o x a c and x h 2 was set based on numerical simulations the model was run different times for a few days using as initial organic carbon concentration the corresponding value set for reactor a test in this way the initial values of microbial concentrations were adjusted to fit substrate trends during the beginning of the experiment the optimized microbial biomass distribution was used as initial condition for subsequent numerical simulations presented in this work the obtained initial microbial concentrations and the initial condition adopted for reactors a b and c are reported in table 3 the modified adm 1 model was implemented in an original software developed on matlab platform 2 4 2 sensitivity analysis due to the consistent number of equations and parameters a local sensitivity analysis lsa was carried out to investigate the most influencing parameters on model outputs lsa is able to investigate the effect of a single parameter variation on a specific model output xu et al 2004 cariboni et al 2007 the influence of a varying parameter is studied by computing the output variable first order partial derivative over time with respect to the considered parameter zi 2011 eq 45 for each parameter the maximum or the minimum value of the obtained partial derivatives can be used as sensitivity index s i depending on which one is higher in absolute terms eq 46 45 w i j t c u c i t c u u j 46 s i i j max t 0 τ w i j t c u i f max t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j t c u i f max t 0 τ w i j min t 0 τ w i j in eqs 45 and 46 s i i j is the j t h parameter sensitivity with respect to the i t h output state variable at time t w i j is the value of the partial derivative of the i t h output state variable with respect to the j t h parameter at the instant time t c i is the i t h chosen output state variable concentration c is the vector of the state variables concentration in soluble particle or gaseous phase u j is the j t h investigated parameter value u is the vector of the model parameters and τ is the final instant time it is important to notice that some sensitivity analysis results may depend on the initial condition as some parameter could be characterized by a wide fluctuation range zi 2011 razavi et al 2021 the cumulative methane production and the vfas concentration over time were set as model output for eq 45 and the sensitivity of three groups of biochemical parameters was evaluated the first group included the kinetic parameters such as maximum specific uptake rates k m s u k m a a k m f a k m c 4 k m p r o k m a c k m h 2 half saturation constants k s s u k s a a k s f a k s c 4 k s p r o k s a c k s h 2 and first order decay rates k d e c a l l k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c the second group was constituted by stoichiometric parameters such as yields of microbial species on substrates y s u y a a y f a y c 4 y p r o y a c y h 2 the third group included hydrolysis disintegration related parameters k h y d c h k h y d p r k h y d l i and k s b k all non biochemical parameters e g limiting inhibiting constants equilibrium constants for gas transfer and acid base reactions were not investigated in the present study as their uncertainty can be attributed to the experimental design and the reactor configuration tartakovsky et al 2008 the sensitivity analysis was performed by simulating the process dynamics of the reactor a and setting the initial condition presented in table 3 the initial values of the investigated parameters were set in accordance to the original adm 1 batstone et al 2002 the initial value for the surface based kinetic constant k s b k was set in accordance to sanders et al 2000 where the same substrate and a similar equation were used the matlab tool sens sys molla and padilla 2002 coupled with an ode solver were used to perform the numerical analysis 2 4 3 model calibration and validation based on the sensitivity analysis a trial and error method was used to calibrate the model this method is highly recommended for the calibration of complex mathematical models with a high number of parameters varying in a wide range refsgaard and storm 1990 specifically the selected parameters are calibrated individually once the first parameter is calibrated another parameter is allowed to vary in its specific variation range the algorithm ends when a reasonable fitness with experimental data is reached sin et al 2008 the parameters with higher sensitivity indexes where calibrated before all the others to compare model prediction with experimental data during the calibration steps the experimental cumulative methane production and vfas trends data in the bio reactor a were used the performance of the calibration was evaluated by three different methods janssen and heuberger 1995 the modeling efficiency m e the index of agreement i o a and the root mean square error r m s e method including its normalized form n r m s e these methods require the computation of four different indexes eqs 47 50 47 r m s e i 1 n p i o i 2 n 48 n r m s e r m s e o 49 m e 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 50 i o a 1 i 1 n p i o i 2 i 1 n p i o o i o 2 where p i is the i t h model predicted value o i and o are the i t h and the means observed value and n is the number of observations the model validation consisted in verifying the agreement between simulated values and experimental data achieved from bio reactors b and c with particle sizes of 4 and 20 mm respectively the values of all parameters were obtained from the calibration step the performance of the validation procedure was evaluated through the same parameters described above eqs 47 50 3 results and discussions 3 1 sensitivity analysis the aim of ad is to maximize the production of methane from a given substrate with a stable biological process on the other hand vfas concentration during the anaerobic conversion may be a useful index to avoid bio reactor acidification and decreased conversion efficiency the cumulative methane production was chosen as the model output to perform the sensitivity analysis the results of the sensitivity indexes for each investigated parameter are shown in fig 1 the sensitivity analysis was also performed based on vfas concentration and the results are reported in figs 2 4 the results of the sensitivity index of the kinetic and hydrolysis disintegration related parameters referred to methane production fig 1a showed that the most sensitive parameter was the disintegration kinetic constant k s b k whose sensitivity index value was 0 339 this result is in accordance with the sensitivity analysis performed in chen et al 2016 where the adm 1 was applied to simulate biogas production from a different organic substrate despite a different index was used the most significant sensitivity was referred to the kinetic constant of the disintegration process another relevant result is related to the maximum specific uptake rate for acetic acid k m a c which showed the higher si than all the other parameters grouped in fig 1a si 3 6 1 0 5 however this value is not comparable with respect to the si of the disintegration constant k s b k this evidence is in contrast with the local sensitivity analysis reported in montecchio et al 2017 where adm 1 was used to model the effects of thermal pretreatment on an ad process of food waste they reported a si value of k m a c with the same magnitude of the disintegration constant in the present work the sensitivity of k m a c increased when the acetic acid concentration was considered as the model output of the sensitivity analysis fig 2a however it was lower than the sensitivity of k s b k among kinetic and hydrolysis disintegration related parameters the si of k s b k showed the highest value when using other vfa concentrations as output variables fig 2 this can be explained by the crucial role of the disintegration during the first steps of the anaerobic bio conversion indeed low values of k s b k lead to low kinetic rates due to the reduced availability of substrates when high k s b k values are applied all the anaerobic kinetics are stimulated and the complexity and the particle size distribution of the substrates are completely neglected the si values of all half saturation constants with respect to the cumulative methane production are reported in fig 1b in log scale the majority of the half saturation constants showed si values around 10 3 except for k s f a and k s h 2 for these parameters the sensitivity reached the extreme values of 1 42 1 0 6 and 1 21 respectively the assimilation of fatty acids regulated by k s f a has a relatively negligible effect on methane production while hydrogen kinetics strongly influence the final methane production a similar result was also obtained by using vfa concentrations as output variable fig 3a the most sensitive half saturation constant was k s h 2 si 1 0 2 and a negligible si value was found for all the other parameters in particular k s f a showed the lower si value when valeric propionic or acetic acid were selected as model output while k s a c showed the lowest sensitivity value in the case of butyric acid the crucial role of k s h 2 is due to the importance of hydrogen dynamics during ad indeed hydrogen is able to affect the assimilation kinetic rates of fatty acids valerate butyrate and propionate eqs 16 19 a partial inhibition of these processes leads to a slower acetate production and consequent negative effects on methane generation by acetoclastic methanogens eq 20 the si values of yield coefficients with respect to the cumulative methane production fig 1c revealed a significant influence of sugar and acetic acid consuming microorganisms the values of 0 007 and 0 005 were obtained for y s u and y a c respectively the low sensitivity of the majority of half saturation constants and yield coefficients is in accordance with the results of the local sensitivity analysis reported by souza et al 2013 in the case of vfas used as sensitivity output fig 3b the yields of valeric butyric propionic and acetic acid consuming species were relevant for the corresponding acid concentrations specifically the propionic acid concentration s p r o resulted more sensitive to the yield y p r o than y s u such a result is in contrast with the sensitivity analysis performed by barrera et al 2015 where y s u was one of the more influencing parameter on the propionic acid concentration in addition the yield of propionic acid consuming biomass was characterized by a very low sensitivity with respect to the same variable this result can be due to the different structure of the model presented in barrera et al 2015 accounting for sulfate reduction during propionate uptake finally the si values of all decay terms were reported in figs 1d and 4 among them the decay term related to sugar amino acids fatty acids and hydrogen consuming species k d e c a l l showed the highest effect on the cumulative methane production in the case of vfas the more sensitive decay rate was related to the microbial species involved in the degradation of each corresponding vfa 3 2 model calibration based on the results of the sensitivity analysis the parameters k s b k k h y d c h k h y d p r k h y d l i k m p r o k m a c k s s u k s c 4 k s a c k d e c a l l k d e c c 4 k d e c p r o k d e c a c were selected for the calibration other sensitive parameters such as k s h 2 and all the yields coefficients were set to the default adm 1 value as it was possible to appropriately fit the experimental data in all the studied cases table 4 reports the calibrated values for the investigated parameters compared to the adm 1 values the calibrated value of the disintegration constant k s b k is not comparable with any adm 1 parameter as a different equation is assumed for the sbk model however the k s b k value has been investigated in very few cases in literature and its wide variation range strongly depends on the specific organic substrate converted in the present case the value of 0 72 kg m 2 d 1 for this parameter allowed to achieve the best fit between experimental and simulated data this value is higher with respect to 9 6 1 0 3 10 8 1 0 3 and 12 0 1 0 3 kg m 2 d 1 used for a similar substrate by sanders et al 2000 these authors reproduced experimental data of ad batch reactors operated by using particulate starch obtained from fresh potatoes and commercially available starch as organic substrate they carried out experiments using fresh potatoes with particle size less than 45 µm and between 45 and 125 µm they validated the model using experimental results of ad in batch reactors for the commercially available starch on the contrary the value of k s b k calibrated in the present study is lower than 12 96 1 0 3 kg m 2 d 1 reported in esposito et al 2011 where the authors performed biomethane potential bmp experiments on synthetic organic waste pasta and cheese with different particle size distributions these differences in k s b k value allow to confirm that it directly depends on the nature and characteristics of substrates such as biodegradability and composition some differences with the adm 1 model have been observed with the maximum propionic and acetic acid uptake rate constants k m p r o and k m a c these values were set to 60 d 1 and 27 d 1 in the modified model differently from fatolahi et al 2020 where the increase of k m p r o and k m a c with respect to their baseline values of adm 1 was not required in addition the authors operated significant modifications of the monod maximum specific uptake rates k m s u and k m c 4 fatolahi et al 2020 in the present study k m s u and k m c 4 were set according to the adm 1 model moreover the values of the calibrated half saturation constants k s s u k s c 4 and k s a c were lower than those used in the adm 1 to better fit experimental data the half saturation constants for valerate butyrate and acetate were reduced a similar result was obtained in the calibration of a modified adm 1 used to reproduce starch wastewater and synthetic substrate bio conversion in a lab scale upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor hinken et al 2014 the calibrated values related to the hydrolysis constants k h y d c h k h y d p r and k h y d l i resulted lower than those reported in batstone et al 2002 these values are in accordance with batstone et al 2009 where the range of 0 15 0 3 d 1 was reported for bmp tests of hydrolyzed sludge samples decreased values for the hydrolysis parameters were also reported in garcía gen et al 2015 the authors studied the disintegration and hydrolysis kinetics during the ad of fruit and vegetable waste the differences with adm 1 can be mainly ascribed to the different substrate fed to the bioreactors adm 1 was calibrated based on the ad of activated sludge which is generally constituted by an hydrolyzed semi solid matrix containing slow biodegradable compounds on the other hand potato waste needs to be hydrolyzed during ad and its readily biodegradable organic content is higher than activated sludge this fraction is able to stimulate biological kinetics during the bio conversion and modify the kinetic constants the model was able to fit the experimental cumulative methane production data related to the bio reactor a as it is shown in fig 5 the performance indicators are reported in table 5 the goodness of fit indexes are referred to the cumulative methane production trends the good quality of the calibration is described by the m e and the i o a coefficients which are both close to 1 moreover the small values of the rmse and its normalized form show that a negligible mean error of 209 51 ml with respect to the total methane production 7521 ml affected the model prediction these results confirmed the good accuracy of the calibration procedure the vfas production figs 6 7 accurately reproduced the experimental data except for butyric acid fig 7a this can be due to the coupled kinetic uptake rates related to valeric and butyric acid assimilation reported in eqs 17 18 in some cases two separate microbial species operating the valeric acid and the butyric acid conversion were considered in this study a common microbial species was considered for s b u and s v a degradation according to the original adm 1 this choice leads to a relative overestimation of butyric acid with respect to the experimental data but it allows the possibility of comparing other adm 1 based works with the presented results to further compare the sbk model with the original adm 1 the same calibration procedure was adopted using the original adm 1 the common parameters of the different models were calibrated using the reactor a data set indeed the k s b k kinetic constant of the sbk model was replaced by the disintegration kinetic constant k d i s of the original adm 1 the resulting performance indicators are reported in table 5 it can be noticed that all the goodness of fit indexes are worse than those obtained during the calibration of the modified sbk model the results confirmed the importance of adopting a sbk kinetic model when the disintegration of the organic substrate represents the limiting step of the ad process noteworthy the calibration of the model was achieved by using the complete set of data related to the bio reactor a based on the experimental feeding procedure it should be possible to divide the data set and use the obtained partial set of data from day 16 to the end of the experiment to calibrate the model usually this procedure avoids any calibration error due to microbial species adaptation to the specific fed substrate and it allows to obtain a more representative set of parameters in the present case this procedure was not required as no differences were observed when using the complete or the partial data set 3 3 model validation numerical simulations were run to validate the model using the data sets related to bio reactors b and c where potato waste was fed at different particle sizes 4 and 20 mm and comparable concentrations the values of the calibrated parameters were used for numerical simulations and the validation results of the cumulative methane production and organic acids over time have been reported in figs 8 13 moreover table 5 shows also the performance indicators values obtained during model validation steps using different data sets the values of m e i o a r m s e and n r m s e confirmed that the model is able to properly predict the cumulative methane production for a wide range of substrate particle size however a small drop in the m e and the i o a indexes and an increase in the mean error r m s e have been observed from simulations related to reactor c the largest particle size investigated nevertheless these values are acceptable as the r m s e is still a small value compared to the total cumulative produced methane of 7375 ml moreover the m e coefficient and the i o a are still close to 1 the vfa evolution curves were adequately fitted by model simulations except for the butyric acid as previously reported the fitting with experimental data should be improved by uncoupling butyric and valeric acid degradation kinetics the accuracy of the model validation for substrates with a larger particle size distribution proved that the model can be also applied to the case of the ad of other substrates such as the organic fraction of municipal solid waste ofmsw esposito et al 2008 once the parameters related to the characteristics of a specific substrate have been calibrated it is possible to reproduce the ad of that substrate with smaller and or larger particle sizes indeed the k s b k is the same for each particle size while only a depends on the size of the particles it is important to highlight that the application of such kinetic model is possible when a wet anaerobic process is considered in this condition it could be assumed that substrates are continuously available to microbial species during the bioconversion increasing the particle size may lead to incorrect predictions of the process development as incomplete substrate conversion or local accumulation of substrate occur in these cases it is necessary to consider a different mass balance equation to account for transport phenomena occurring within the bioreactor differently from liotta et al 2015 in this work it was not necessary to relate the disintegration rate constant k s b k to the ts content in the bioreactor this relationship increases the complexity of the model as the calibration of two new parameters is required indeed the parameters reported in liotta et al 2015 were related to different biotic and abiotic conditions such as the substrate nature specific experimental conditions temperature pressure ph retention time and mixing conditions in the present work experimental results were successfully reproduced without focusing on k s b k and ts relationship finally numerical results showed that a proper identification of k s b k allows for the correct prediction of substrate degradation and methane production using different particle size distribution this result is in contrast with li et al 2009 where the k s b k was related to the particle mean diameter detected in bioreactors at different times 4 conclusions the aim of the present work was to calibrate and validate a surface based kinetic model for the anaerobic digestion process of potato waste the model consisted on a modified adm 1 model where the disintegration kinetic was able to account for the particle size of the organic substrate modifications concerning the kinetic parameters of the microbial species involved in the ad process have been discussed a local sensitivity analysis highlighted the importance of choosing the correct set of parameters to model methane generation and volatile fatty acids concentrations in real ad bio reactors the introduced disintegration kinetic constant k s b k presented the highest sensitivity among disintegration hydrolysis related parameters and monod specific uptake rates a standard procedure for calibration and validation of the model for different substrates has been defined the model was successfully calibrated and validated with ad hoc ad experiments carried out using potato waste as organic substrate the model properly predicted the cumulative methane production and vfas concentration profiles achieved during lab scale experiments finally validation results showed the ability of the surface based kinetic model to adequately describe real processes where a wide range of particle size characterizes the substrate fed to ad reactors declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

24536,ecosystem based approaches that take species interactions into account have shifted to the forefront of fisheries modelling and management in recent years as a result multispecies size spectrum models have been increasingly used to explore impacts of fishing on marine community dynamics the use of these models which has been facilitated by the development of the r package mizer requires the estimation of species specific parameters related to growth reproduction and feeding these parameters which may be estimated from imperfect information may contribute to model uncertainty and thus reduce the value of information available for management purposes in this study of a freshwater fishery we conduct a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis pairing the morris and sobol methods to identify life history parameters having the largest influence on model outputs here we focus on i the size spectrum slope ii the scatter around the linear relationship of the size spectrum iii total biomass and iv species diversity we found that parameters relating to growth namely the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass had the greatest influence on our size spectrum model results this was particularly true for top predators and the most abundant species our results suggest that estimation of growth parameters of top predators be given priority to reduce uncertainty in model output and ultimately fisheries management 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems provide invaluable resources and services around the world aylward et al 2005 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 lynch et al 2016 yet they are also among the most threatened ecosystems largely as a result of human activity albert et al 2020 a combination of human induced stressors including water quality changes associated with habitat alteration and or pollution overexploitation associated with harvest and community changes due to the introduction of exotic species has led to negative impacts for these ecosystems and the species residing within them dudgeon 2019 as a result freshwater biodiversity is in sharp decline with depletion rates much higher than those seen in terrestrial ecosystems turak et al 2017 albert et al 2020 this is particularly true for freshwater vertebrates such as fishes reid et al 2019 freshwater fishes are important not only for their ecological roles but also for their cultural and economic value inland fisheries are a primary source of income and dietary protein in many developing regions lynch et al 2016 in many developed nations the predominant use of wild fish stocks is recreational fishing and inland waters represent a significant component of the fishery cooke and cowx 2004 deines et al 2017 embke et al 2019 given the importance of fisheries observational and modelling approaches are constantly being refined to evaluate stock status and improve monitoring and management approaches historically fisheries management has been based on a single species approach often using maximum sustainable yield theory however this approach has long been criticized for its shortcomings particularly in regard to capturing species interactions and the dynamics of non target species larkin 1977 mesnil 2012 zhang et al 2016a ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm has been proposed as a methodology to address these issues ebfm has numerous definitions but can effectively be described as a more holistic approach to resource allocation and management larkin 1996 link 2002 most notably ebfm emphasizes a multi species perspective considering complex interactions between both target and non target species trochta et al 2018 this framework has shifted to the forefront of fisheries management in recent years resulting in a paradigm shift from a single species approach to an ecosystem approach and has thus been adopted as a guiding framework by many governmental agencies around the globe link et al 2011 townsend et al 2019 following this shift ecosystem models that capture community dynamics and interactions between species have become a crucial tool for implementing ebfm and have become a principal component of many management frameworks marasco et al 2007 townsend et al 2019 one class of models that may prove useful in implementing an ebfm framework are those based on size spectrum theory andersen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b although size spectrum models were originally conceived to assess ecosystem dynamics without taking species identity into account benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 recent developments have allowed individual species or groups of species to be defined by their asymptotic mass and other life history traits andersen and pedersen 2010 hartvig et al 2011 with this development multi species size spectrum models can be used to assess interactions between species as well as simulate community dynamics under a variety of scenarios recent applications of multi species size spectrum models have explored climate change impacts on community dynamics woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 reum et al 2020 trade offs in fishing and conservation objectives blanchard et al 2014 and even historic species invasions van zwieten et al 2016 a promising contribution in the field of size spectrum models has been the development of mizer an r package that facilitates the implementation of these ecological models scott et al 2014 mizer may serve as an important tool for those interested in taking an ebfm approach as new users will benefit from growing literature on the subject and continued development of the package see https sizespectrum org mizer index html for details delius et al 2020 ecosystem models including size spectrum models typically consist of a large number of parameters that may be calibrated with imperfect information mcelhany et al 2010 imperfect data may result from human or measurement error or even bias in sampling for example alofs 2016 found that the maximum size of small prey fishes recorded during field sampling was often larger than the maximum size recorded by other sources while the opposite was found for larger sport fishes this phenomenon is likely driven by sampling bias as sport fishes are more often the targets of research and monitoring programs and their sizes are therefore better documented than those of smaller prey fishes it is also important to consider the relationship between parameters during data collection given that errors in the estimation of one parameter will affect the other andersen 2019 parameters estimated from imperfect information can contribute to model uncertainty and influence model outputs ultimately this effect can reduce the confidence with which we draw conclusions from modelling scenarios and limit the value of information available for management purposes to address this uncertainty issue model calibration is routinely paired with sensitivity analyses that evaluate how changes in model input affect its output zhang et al 2015b sensitivity analyses can be used to identify unimportant parameters that can be set to default as well as influential parameters that can be a focus of future research sampling and calibrations to reduce overall uncertainty previous work assessed the uncertainty of a size spectrum model resulting from observation and process errors zhang et al 2015a in their study zhang et al 2015a found that metabolic scale parameters had the largest influence on model uncertainty followed by life history parameters when implementing a multi species size spectrum model in mizer default values for metabolic scale parameters are included however life history parameters must be input directly to distinguish different species additionally metabolic scale parameters can be more difficult to estimate than life history parameters researchers and managers taking a size spectrum model approach are therefore more likely to focus their efforts on life history parameters and would benefit from knowledge of which ones are most influential and should thus be estimated with minimal uncertainty in this study we parameterized a multi species size spectrum model for a typical north temperate lake we believe this is one of the first applications of this model to a freshwater system for marine examples see blanchard et al 2014 jacobsen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b szuwalski et al 2017 reum et al 2019 to streamline future applications of the model and identify data needs in the context of freshwater fisheries management we sought to identify which life history parameters would have the greatest influence on model output to do this we conducted comprehensive sensitivity analyses focusing on various model results including the linear size spectrum slope scatter around the linear relationship community biomass and species diversity we chose these indicators as they are aspects of size spectrum models that are often used to evaluate community status e g emmrich et al 2011 2 methods 2 1 size spectrum model here we use the multi species modelling framework developed by andersen and beyer 2006 and hartvig et al 2011 in this framework growth and maturation are food dependent with all processes formulated at the individual level scott et al 2014 life history parameters related to growth reproduction and feeding are required to model these individual processes for each distinct species individual processes are then scaled to the size spectrum i e community level by the mckendrick von foerster equation mckendrick 1925 von foerster 1959 which is applied to each species 1 n w t g w n w w μ w n w where w is body size mass g w and μ w are size dependent growth and mortality respectively and n w represents the abundance or density of individuals of a given size growth in the model is biphasic with all resources devoted to somatic growth until the mass at maturity is reached from which point resources are devoted to both growth and reproduction a beverton holt stock recruitment relationship beverton and holt 1957 is included to limit the amount of surviving eggs and impose direct density dependence in recruitment this requires the estimation of the maximum recruitment parameter r max for each species imposing a limit on recruitment through r max is important for dynamical stability and coexistence in model communities and it also regulates the amount of piscivory relative to reliance on basal resources andersen et al 2016 within the model interactions between species are governed by a size based feeding preference curve and by a matrix with pairwise species interaction terms the feeding preference of an individual is determined by the body size ratio between predator w and prey wp described by ursin s 1973 log normal selection model 2 φ w w p exp ln w w p β 2 2 σ s 2 where β is the preferred predator prey mass ratio and σs is the width of the size selection function both species specific mortality μ w is modelled as the sum of three main components i predation mortality which results explicitly from all the feeding interactions among individuals ii fishing mortality which is optionally included in mizer through a variety of gear size selectivity functions and iii a background mortality rate which accounts for all mortality factors other than predation or fishing and is a fixed allometric function of the species asymptotic size important parameters related to growth are the asymptotic mass w inf and the von bertalanffy growth coefficient k vb these parameters are necessary to estimate the maximum food intake coefficient h of each species 3 h 3 k v b α f 0 w i n f 1 3 where α refers to assimilation efficiency and f 0 represents the feeding level of small individuals both are given default values of 0 6 based on estimates from the literature delius et al 2020 maximum food intake in turn is related to the volumetric search rate and standard metabolism both of which play a role in determining growth a more detailed description of equations describing these relationships can be found in the mizer vignette scott et al 2014 the model produces a number of valuable outputs most notably biomass estimates of each species through time and a community size spectrum fig 1 size spectrum slopes are useful ecosystem indicators and have been used to quantify the impacts of perturbations such as pollution habitat modification and fisheries exploitation shin and cury 2004 emmrich et al 2011 gomez canchong et al 2013 they can also provide information on trophic transfer efficiency or the efficiency with which energy transfers from prey to predators within an ecosystem trebilco et al 2013 residual variation around the linear relationship of the community size spectrum can also be examined as there is reason to believe that scatter around the spectrum may be driven by trophic cascades rossberg et al 2019 2 2 model parameterization the model was parameterized to represent a typical fish community of a north temperate lake using data from lake nipissing in ontario canada lake nipissing is a large 873 km2 shallow lake mean depth 4 5 m with a productive fish community comprising over 40 species many of which are important for the recreational and indigenous fisheries morgan 2012 data for lake nipissing were acquired from the ontario ministry of northern development mines natural resources and forestry broad scale monitoring bsm program for inland lakes lester et al 2020 this program samples fish communities using large mesh with mesh sizes varying from 38 to 127 mm and small mesh gillnets with mesh sizes varying from 13 to 38 mm under a randomized depth stratified design sandstrom et al 2013 the modelled community focuses on seven species cisco coregonus artedi common shiner luxilus cornutus freshwater drum aplodinotus grunniens northern pike esox lucius trout perch percopsis omiscomaycus walleye sander vitreus and yellow perch perca flavescens although this assemblage is a portion of the species pool we chose these species as their cumulative biomass estimated from net selectivity curves represents 90 of the total community biomass when possible life history parameters for each species were estimated directly from the bsm data the asymptotic length and von bertalanffy growth coefficient k vb were estimated from length at age data with asymptotic length subsequently converted to mass w inf using known length weight relationships for the species in the province reproductive status mature versus immature was assessed for some species in the field which allowed the estimation of mass at 90 maturity used to represent w mat through logistic regressions these analyses were conducted in r r core team 2019 using the fisheries stock assessment fsa package ogle et al 2020 for cisco northern pike excluding weight at maturity yellow perch and walleye when insufficient data were available to estimate these parameters values were obtained from the literature or online databases specifically weight at maturity for northern pike was derived from estimates identified by malette and morgan 2002 weight at maturity and von bertalanffy growth coefficients for common shiner and trout perch were found in a study by randall and minns 2000 and their asymptotic masses came from the ontario freshwater fishes life history database eakins 2020 and fishbase froese and pauly 2020 respectively weight at maturity the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass from freshwater drum came from bur 1984 and rypel et al 2006 dietary parameters loosely follow those used by hartvig et al 2011 with lower preferred predator prey mass ratio values β for piscivores and higher values for omnivores and planktivores the width of the size selection function σs follows a similar trend with lower values for piscivores reflecting a more specialized diet and larger values for planktivores maximum recruitment r max for each species was determined as a decreasing function of asymptotic body size following theoretical expectations of an equilibrium community approaching a linear size spectrum jacobsen et al 2014 parameter values for the seven species are summarized in table 1 these values were used as the baseline for the sensitivity analyses interaction terms required for all fish species in the model were estimated for each species pair from spatial co occurrence data supplemental table 1 spatial co occurrence was determined using catch data from gillnets deployed in a depth stratified manner sandstrom et al 2013 the morisita index morisita 1959 which is a measure of niche overlap that uses counts of individuals was chosen to measure overlap as it has been shown to perform well regardless of sample size and number of resources in this case depth strata considered smith and zaret 1982 the index c is calculated as 4 c 2 i n p i j p i k i n p i j n i j 1 n j 1 i n p i k n i k 1 n k 1 where p i j and p i k are the proportion resource i is of the total resources used by species j and k respectively the number of individuals of species j and k that use resource category i are denoted by n i j and n i k the total number of individuals of each species in the sample are represented by n the index ranges from zero to one with zero representing no overlap between species and one reflecting consistent co occurrence 2 3 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analyses for complex ecological models can be computationally expensive and time consuming due to the large number of interacting parameters to simplify our analyses and reduce computational demands we adopted a two step approach including a screening procedure as suggested by campolongo et al 2007 we chose to pair the morris method morris 1991 with the sobol method sobol 1993 saltelli et al 2000 as the combination of these two approaches is an established methodology that has been applied across a range of disciplines e g dejonge et al 2012 sumner et al 2012 morris et al 2014 wan et al 2015 the morris method is a one at a time approach that can be used to qualitatively identify influential parameters at low computational costs dejonge et al 2012 the method can determine which parameters have 1 negligible effects 2 linear and additive effects or 3 non linear effects or interactions with other parameters campolongo et al 2007 saltelli et al 2008 in this approach only one parameter is modified between successive runs of the model in each model run a given parameter is randomly sampled from the uncertainty region the effect of each input on model output or the elementary effect is then calculated see campolongo et al 2007 and ciric et al 2012 for detailed methods the two sensitivity measures μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the elementary effects of each parameter a large absolute mean μ indicates an input with an important overall influence on the output and a large standard deviation σ indicates a parameter involved in interactions or having non linear effects morris 1991 in this framework parameters that are deemed influential can be assessed further with the sobol method here we followed the approach of ciric et al 2012 to rank the parameters by their influence incorporating both the magnitude of their direct mean of elementary effects and interactive effects standard deviation of elementary effects on model output influence was calculated as the euclidean distance from the origin of the morris plot which has μ i and σ i on the x and y axes 4 μ i 2 σ i 2 the sobol method is based on variance decomposition using a similar framework as an analysis of variance in a factorial design which aims to determine how much of the variability in model output is dependent on each of the input parameters zhang et al 2015b a sobol sensitivity analysis will reveal first order or main effects as well as total order or total effects main effects are used to measure the fractional contribution of a single parameter to output variance while total effects consider both main effects and higher order effects that account for parameter interactions zhang et al 2015b benefits of the sobol method include no assumption regarding the relationship between model input and output as well as an ability to evaluate the full range of parameter variation however this leads to high computational costs in our analyses we evaluated the influence of 42 parameters i e six parameters for each of seven species as depicted in table 1 on our lake size spectrum model output they represent life history and trophic traits with recognized importance for population dynamics and species interactions and whose parameterization is required for any application of a multi species model setup in mizer we do not doubt that other parameters such as allometric coefficients relating metabolism or maximum consumption to body size can have a strong influence on model dynamics however they represent more general bioenergetic constraints and are very unlikely in practice to require parameterization on a system specific basis we used uniform distributions for each parameter with bounds varying 10 either side of the nominal baseline values following morris et al 2014 although uniform distributions may not reflect the true uncertainty distributions of these life history parameters their use is sufficient for the purpose of a sensitivity analysis as uninfluential parameters will show little influence regardless of distribution saltelli et al 2008 although bounds of 10 were arbitrarily chosen and may seem low higher changes may lead to parameter values that fall outside of the range of biological relevance for each species the morris method was used to screen and test for interactions among all 42 parameters and the summary statistics μ and σ were used to identify the top ten most influential parameters the top ten parameters were then passed to a sobol sensitivity analysis to identify their main and total effects on model output in the morris analysis we sampled k 42 parameters r 40 times leading to r k 1 1720 model input sets morris 1991 the sobol analysis was conducted using k 10 input factors and a sample size of n k 2 input sets following the approach of saltelli 2002 in this study we used n 7500 resulting in 90 000 unique model input sets all analyses were conducted in r 3 6 1 core team 2021 using the sensitivity iooss et al 2019 and multisensi bidot et al 2018 packages in all cases the size spectrum model was implemented through mizer and run for 500 years to ensure equilibrium dynamics were achieved the baseline model output is available in supplemental fig 1 model output from the final time step was used for all analyses the model outputs we examined were the i slope of the community spectrum ii scatter around the linear relationship of the community spectrum measured as mean squared error of the linear regression used to estimate the spectrum slope iii total community biomass and iv the shannon wiener community diversity index magurran 2013 based on the species relative biomasses 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses the ten highest ranking parameters are labelled on each morris plot representing a model output variable in fig 2 in all four cases parameters relating to size and growth w inf and k vb made up 70 or more of the top ten ranked parameters table 2 other influential parameters include the preferred predator prey mass ratio β and maximum recruitment r max the main and total sensitivity index results of the sobol analysis were similar to those produced by the morris sensitivity analyses fig 3 table 2 for approximately 25 of the assessed parameters the main effect was slightly larger than the total effect this result is unexpected and may be resolved by increasing the number of simulations conducted however as we included a large number of input sets and ran each analysis for over two weeks of computation processing time we believe these values are qualitatively sufficient to address the questions at hand to avoid potential biases related to computation processing time differences between main and total effects and hence interactions between parameters were not considered 3 2 von bertalanffy k coefficient the sobol analysis identified the von bertalanffy growth coefficient as the most influential parameter for three of the four output variables the growth coefficient for walleye k vb 6 had the greatest influence on the slope of the community size spectrum fig 3a and the total community biomass fig 3c to determine the relationship between the walleye growth coefficient and the slope of the spectrum we plotted the abundance spectrum produced from simulations with three different parameter values the nominal value and the upper and lower bounds from the sensitivity analyses nominal value 10 as the growth coefficient for walleye increases the left end of the spectrum where smaller organisms are found e g organisms below 10 gs shows a minor if not negligible increase in abundance in contrast abundance in large bodied individuals decreases as demonstrated by a decrease in height on the right end of the spectrum fig 4 to identify the relationship between the walleye growth coefficient and community biomass we ran a number of mizer simulations with the parameter ranging from the lower to upper bounds of the sensitivity analyses 10 of the nominal value and tracked the biomass of each species in the community as the growth coefficient for walleye increased so did the walleye biomass however the biomass of all remaining species decreased fig 5 for all species relative biomass decreases were larger than the relative increase in biomass of walleye supplemental fig 2 additionally we found that as the growth coefficient for walleye increased the growth efficiency a component of trophic transfer efficiency of the two top predators walleye and northern pike decreased supplemental fig 3 in contrast the growth efficiency of all other species in the community increased overall the growth efficiency of the entire community remained relatively stable the growth coefficient for cisco k vb 2 had the largest influence on community diversity as measured through the shannon wiener diversity index fig 3d to explore the influence of this parameter on community diversity we ran simulations with the parameter ranging from the lower to upper bounds of the sensitivity analyses 10 of the nominal value and tracked the shannon wiener diversity index we found that increases in the growth coefficient led to increases in cisco biomass and a subsequent reduction in the overall community diversity index fig 6 relative biomass changes reported in supplemental fig 4 3 3 asymptotic mass asymptotic mass had the largest influence in one of the four scenarios the asymptotic mass of northern pike w inf 4 was found to be the most influential parameter on the scatter of the linear relationship of the community size spectrum as measured by the mean squared error of the spectrum regression fig 3b to understand how the asymptotic mass of northern pike influenced the scatter around the linear relationship of the community size spectrum we plotted the relative abundance of all species with three different parameter values the nominal value and the upper and lower bounds from the sensitivity analyses nominal value 10 we chose this approach as it allows for the identification of abundance changes across size classes which may lead to lumpy spectra with lots of scatter as the asymptotic mass of northern pike is changed the relative abundance of individuals in size classes ranging from 10 g to 12 000 g also changes fig 7 it is important to note that although not identified as the most influential parameter the asymptotic mass of cisco w inf 2 did have a large influence on community diversity 4 discussion as fisheries management shifts from analyses of single stocks to ebfm approaches with multi species models it is imperative that we understand how model parameterization and calibration impact our understanding of fish communities in our sensitivity analyses of a multi species size spectrum model we identify two parameters related to growth the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass as having large impacts on several model outputs related to community biomass and structure sensitivity results from the morris and sobol analyses were comparable which underscores the importance of growth parameters in models of aquatic communities the von bertalanffy growth coefficient of walleye a top predator in the system had the largest influence on the slope of the community spectrum and the total community biomass this was likely driven by changes in trophic transfer efficiency associated with changes in the growth coefficient the absolute value of standard metabolism calculated in this model as 20 of the maximum food intake h eq 2 increases as the growth coefficient increases because the realized food intake does not increase proportionally with the expected maximum intake due to limited prey availability such increase in standard metabolism leads to decreased transfer efficiency and less energy available for larger organisms in turn this leads to a more negative community spectrum slope with a relative decrease in the abundance of larger organisms as seen in our model output previous models have demonstrated the same relationship via changes in the growth efficiency of predators in which decreases in efficiency led to steeper slopes and similar changes in biomass as those presented here benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 trebilco et al 2013 this relationship between trophic transfer efficiency and slope has also been demonstrated empirically in a study of community size spectra in german lakes mehner et al 2018 found that lake food webs exhibiting size spectrum slopes more negative than expected by theory were linked to low trophic transfer efficiency the von bertalanffy growth coefficient of cisco an abundant planktivorous species had the largest influence on community diversity represented by the shannon wiener index community diversity was the only model output to be more strongly influenced by parameters associated with a planktivore than by those associated with a top predator these results were likely driven by the high abundance of cisco in the baseline model as this species already had the highest overall biomass any increases in growth or asymptotic mass that further increase biomass would subsequently affect the diversity index e g through decreased evenness increases in prey biomass likely impact predator biomasses although these changes will be mediated by the interaction matrix and feeding preferences the asymptotic mass of northern pike the largest predator in the system had the largest effect on the scatter around the linear relationship of the community spectrum measured as the mean squared error of the spectrum regression changes in residual variation associated with the mass of this predator are likely driven both by a lack of fishing pressure and trophic cascades as fishing was not incorporated in this model analysis low numbers of large northern pike can remain in the system and lead to a noticeable dip for the largest body masses of the spectrum however trophic cascades likely play a substantial role as well as seen in our results changes in the asymptotic mass of this predator lead to fluctuations in the relative abundance of organisms along a size gradient these changes in abundance are likely driven by changes in the available prey field as the asymptotic mass of the predator increases or decreases although there are numerous hypotheses regarding the cause of scatter around the linear relationship in both empirical and modelled size spectra blanchard et al 2017 previous modelling has demonstrated that trophic cascades induced by top predators can result in the presence of domes in community size spectra rossberg et al 2019 nonlinearity of the spectrum driven by trophic cascades has also been shown empirically in a study of numerous lake fish communities arranz et al 2018 showed that deviations from linearity were driven by predator prey interactions in particular the largest deviations from linearity were seen in lakes where predators were both abundant and closer in size to their prey the results of our study suggest that effort should be taken to ensure the best possible estimates of the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass of a species prior to modelling in mizer given their influence on model output fish size and growth rates are influenced by a number of factors including metabolism temperature and the amount of energy and resources available for consumption von bertalanffy 1957 west et al 2001 brown et al 2004 fortunately these parameters are generally easier to estimate than other life history parameters included in the model e g froese and binohlan 2000 ogle 2015 and are often readily estimated from data measured and recorded during fish community monitoring programs the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass are often measured or estimated concurrently and are strongly correlated increases in asymptotic size are mirrored by decreases in the growth coefficient as larger bodied organisms typically exhibit slower relative growth and take longer to reach adult sizes morais and bellwood 2018 within the modelling framework the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass are treated as independent inputs however both are used to calculate the maximum intake and ultimately growth of each species it is important to note that these inputs do not guarantee the same von bertalanffy growth curve expected from empirical estimation as the emergent growth trajectory will be dependent on the feeding level and prey availability for each species as the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass of a particular species increase so does its consumptive capacity although increases in both of these parameters lead to increases in maximum intake their effects are not identical as expressed by eq 2 in addition unlike the growth coefficient the asymptotic mass will strongly influence the distribution of predatory interactions within the model as body size will determine what prey are available to a given species these differences allow us to tease apart the influence of each parameter on model output despite their correlation in cases where data are not available for parameter estimation values can be obtained from online databases such as fishbase and fishtraits frimpong and angermeier 2020 froese and pauly 2020 although available data and measurements may not accurately describe every population cordlandwehr et al 2013 thorson et al 2014 found that data retrieved from fishbase can often be used as an accurate measure of life history traits this was particularly true for asymptotic length which can be used to estimate asymptotic mass and the growth coefficient which were found to show little to no bias when compared to estimates from local experts it may therefore be possible to parameterize a multi species size spectrum model in data poor systems using information from these databases promoting the implementation of ebfm practices previous work has highlighted this aspect of size spectrum models using mizer further demonstrating the applicability of this approach zhang et al 2016b through our sensitivity analyses we found that the most influential species were large bodied predators or those high in biomass while most prey species demonstrated little effect on the model output it is therefore important that extra consideration be given to these large bodied species and the parameters associated with them when constructing a multi species size spectrum model these findings suggest that it may be possible to group less abundant prey species together into functional groups or guilds benoit et al 2021 grouping these species together may simplify model construction and calibration particularly when working in highly diverse systems this approach is consistent with ecological abstraction theory which poses that ecosystem components with relatively high turnover rates such as short lived and small bodied species can be more safely lumped together in fewer categories without altering the dynamical behaviour of the system whereas large and long lived species which change more slowly require a more explicit representation schaffer 1981 burgess et al 2017 such an approach would combine aspects from different size spectrum modelling frameworks namely a focus on size over identity for small species as seen in earlier models e g benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 and species specific information for predators and abundant species as is common in more recent models e g blanchard et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a reum et al 2019 this combination may increase the applicability of size spectrum models and facilitate their use for management purposes 5 summary and conclusion we found that parameters relating to size and growth particularly for top predators and abundant species had the largest influence on the slope of the community size spectrum scatter around the linear relationship of the spectrum total community biomass and community diversity our findings suggest that special attention should be paid to the measurement or estimation of asymptotic mass and the von bertalanffy growth coefficient in fish community assessments fortunately these parameters are easier to estimate than others in the model and numerous databases with information on these traits exist however it is important to consider biases that may exist within these databases i e underestimation for non sport fishes an avenue for future research is the potential to simplify these complex models by grouping less influential species into guilds or functional groups doing so would reduce the number of parameters requiring estimation and perhaps ease the implementation of these models which may become more commonplace as we move forward with ebfm practices credit authorship contribution statement

24536,ecosystem based approaches that take species interactions into account have shifted to the forefront of fisheries modelling and management in recent years as a result multispecies size spectrum models have been increasingly used to explore impacts of fishing on marine community dynamics the use of these models which has been facilitated by the development of the r package mizer requires the estimation of species specific parameters related to growth reproduction and feeding these parameters which may be estimated from imperfect information may contribute to model uncertainty and thus reduce the value of information available for management purposes in this study of a freshwater fishery we conduct a comprehensive global sensitivity analysis pairing the morris and sobol methods to identify life history parameters having the largest influence on model outputs here we focus on i the size spectrum slope ii the scatter around the linear relationship of the size spectrum iii total biomass and iv species diversity we found that parameters relating to growth namely the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass had the greatest influence on our size spectrum model results this was particularly true for top predators and the most abundant species our results suggest that estimation of growth parameters of top predators be given priority to reduce uncertainty in model output and ultimately fisheries management 1 introduction freshwater ecosystems provide invaluable resources and services around the world aylward et al 2005 hoekstra and mekonnen 2012 lynch et al 2016 yet they are also among the most threatened ecosystems largely as a result of human activity albert et al 2020 a combination of human induced stressors including water quality changes associated with habitat alteration and or pollution overexploitation associated with harvest and community changes due to the introduction of exotic species has led to negative impacts for these ecosystems and the species residing within them dudgeon 2019 as a result freshwater biodiversity is in sharp decline with depletion rates much higher than those seen in terrestrial ecosystems turak et al 2017 albert et al 2020 this is particularly true for freshwater vertebrates such as fishes reid et al 2019 freshwater fishes are important not only for their ecological roles but also for their cultural and economic value inland fisheries are a primary source of income and dietary protein in many developing regions lynch et al 2016 in many developed nations the predominant use of wild fish stocks is recreational fishing and inland waters represent a significant component of the fishery cooke and cowx 2004 deines et al 2017 embke et al 2019 given the importance of fisheries observational and modelling approaches are constantly being refined to evaluate stock status and improve monitoring and management approaches historically fisheries management has been based on a single species approach often using maximum sustainable yield theory however this approach has long been criticized for its shortcomings particularly in regard to capturing species interactions and the dynamics of non target species larkin 1977 mesnil 2012 zhang et al 2016a ecosystem based fisheries management ebfm has been proposed as a methodology to address these issues ebfm has numerous definitions but can effectively be described as a more holistic approach to resource allocation and management larkin 1996 link 2002 most notably ebfm emphasizes a multi species perspective considering complex interactions between both target and non target species trochta et al 2018 this framework has shifted to the forefront of fisheries management in recent years resulting in a paradigm shift from a single species approach to an ecosystem approach and has thus been adopted as a guiding framework by many governmental agencies around the globe link et al 2011 townsend et al 2019 following this shift ecosystem models that capture community dynamics and interactions between species have become a crucial tool for implementing ebfm and have become a principal component of many management frameworks marasco et al 2007 townsend et al 2019 one class of models that may prove useful in implementing an ebfm framework are those based on size spectrum theory andersen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b although size spectrum models were originally conceived to assess ecosystem dynamics without taking species identity into account benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 recent developments have allowed individual species or groups of species to be defined by their asymptotic mass and other life history traits andersen and pedersen 2010 hartvig et al 2011 with this development multi species size spectrum models can be used to assess interactions between species as well as simulate community dynamics under a variety of scenarios recent applications of multi species size spectrum models have explored climate change impacts on community dynamics woodworth jefcoats et al 2013 reum et al 2020 trade offs in fishing and conservation objectives blanchard et al 2014 and even historic species invasions van zwieten et al 2016 a promising contribution in the field of size spectrum models has been the development of mizer an r package that facilitates the implementation of these ecological models scott et al 2014 mizer may serve as an important tool for those interested in taking an ebfm approach as new users will benefit from growing literature on the subject and continued development of the package see https sizespectrum org mizer index html for details delius et al 2020 ecosystem models including size spectrum models typically consist of a large number of parameters that may be calibrated with imperfect information mcelhany et al 2010 imperfect data may result from human or measurement error or even bias in sampling for example alofs 2016 found that the maximum size of small prey fishes recorded during field sampling was often larger than the maximum size recorded by other sources while the opposite was found for larger sport fishes this phenomenon is likely driven by sampling bias as sport fishes are more often the targets of research and monitoring programs and their sizes are therefore better documented than those of smaller prey fishes it is also important to consider the relationship between parameters during data collection given that errors in the estimation of one parameter will affect the other andersen 2019 parameters estimated from imperfect information can contribute to model uncertainty and influence model outputs ultimately this effect can reduce the confidence with which we draw conclusions from modelling scenarios and limit the value of information available for management purposes to address this uncertainty issue model calibration is routinely paired with sensitivity analyses that evaluate how changes in model input affect its output zhang et al 2015b sensitivity analyses can be used to identify unimportant parameters that can be set to default as well as influential parameters that can be a focus of future research sampling and calibrations to reduce overall uncertainty previous work assessed the uncertainty of a size spectrum model resulting from observation and process errors zhang et al 2015a in their study zhang et al 2015a found that metabolic scale parameters had the largest influence on model uncertainty followed by life history parameters when implementing a multi species size spectrum model in mizer default values for metabolic scale parameters are included however life history parameters must be input directly to distinguish different species additionally metabolic scale parameters can be more difficult to estimate than life history parameters researchers and managers taking a size spectrum model approach are therefore more likely to focus their efforts on life history parameters and would benefit from knowledge of which ones are most influential and should thus be estimated with minimal uncertainty in this study we parameterized a multi species size spectrum model for a typical north temperate lake we believe this is one of the first applications of this model to a freshwater system for marine examples see blanchard et al 2014 jacobsen et al 2016 zhang et al 2016b szuwalski et al 2017 reum et al 2019 to streamline future applications of the model and identify data needs in the context of freshwater fisheries management we sought to identify which life history parameters would have the greatest influence on model output to do this we conducted comprehensive sensitivity analyses focusing on various model results including the linear size spectrum slope scatter around the linear relationship community biomass and species diversity we chose these indicators as they are aspects of size spectrum models that are often used to evaluate community status e g emmrich et al 2011 2 methods 2 1 size spectrum model here we use the multi species modelling framework developed by andersen and beyer 2006 and hartvig et al 2011 in this framework growth and maturation are food dependent with all processes formulated at the individual level scott et al 2014 life history parameters related to growth reproduction and feeding are required to model these individual processes for each distinct species individual processes are then scaled to the size spectrum i e community level by the mckendrick von foerster equation mckendrick 1925 von foerster 1959 which is applied to each species 1 n w t g w n w w μ w n w where w is body size mass g w and μ w are size dependent growth and mortality respectively and n w represents the abundance or density of individuals of a given size growth in the model is biphasic with all resources devoted to somatic growth until the mass at maturity is reached from which point resources are devoted to both growth and reproduction a beverton holt stock recruitment relationship beverton and holt 1957 is included to limit the amount of surviving eggs and impose direct density dependence in recruitment this requires the estimation of the maximum recruitment parameter r max for each species imposing a limit on recruitment through r max is important for dynamical stability and coexistence in model communities and it also regulates the amount of piscivory relative to reliance on basal resources andersen et al 2016 within the model interactions between species are governed by a size based feeding preference curve and by a matrix with pairwise species interaction terms the feeding preference of an individual is determined by the body size ratio between predator w and prey wp described by ursin s 1973 log normal selection model 2 φ w w p exp ln w w p β 2 2 σ s 2 where β is the preferred predator prey mass ratio and σs is the width of the size selection function both species specific mortality μ w is modelled as the sum of three main components i predation mortality which results explicitly from all the feeding interactions among individuals ii fishing mortality which is optionally included in mizer through a variety of gear size selectivity functions and iii a background mortality rate which accounts for all mortality factors other than predation or fishing and is a fixed allometric function of the species asymptotic size important parameters related to growth are the asymptotic mass w inf and the von bertalanffy growth coefficient k vb these parameters are necessary to estimate the maximum food intake coefficient h of each species 3 h 3 k v b α f 0 w i n f 1 3 where α refers to assimilation efficiency and f 0 represents the feeding level of small individuals both are given default values of 0 6 based on estimates from the literature delius et al 2020 maximum food intake in turn is related to the volumetric search rate and standard metabolism both of which play a role in determining growth a more detailed description of equations describing these relationships can be found in the mizer vignette scott et al 2014 the model produces a number of valuable outputs most notably biomass estimates of each species through time and a community size spectrum fig 1 size spectrum slopes are useful ecosystem indicators and have been used to quantify the impacts of perturbations such as pollution habitat modification and fisheries exploitation shin and cury 2004 emmrich et al 2011 gomez canchong et al 2013 they can also provide information on trophic transfer efficiency or the efficiency with which energy transfers from prey to predators within an ecosystem trebilco et al 2013 residual variation around the linear relationship of the community size spectrum can also be examined as there is reason to believe that scatter around the spectrum may be driven by trophic cascades rossberg et al 2019 2 2 model parameterization the model was parameterized to represent a typical fish community of a north temperate lake using data from lake nipissing in ontario canada lake nipissing is a large 873 km2 shallow lake mean depth 4 5 m with a productive fish community comprising over 40 species many of which are important for the recreational and indigenous fisheries morgan 2012 data for lake nipissing were acquired from the ontario ministry of northern development mines natural resources and forestry broad scale monitoring bsm program for inland lakes lester et al 2020 this program samples fish communities using large mesh with mesh sizes varying from 38 to 127 mm and small mesh gillnets with mesh sizes varying from 13 to 38 mm under a randomized depth stratified design sandstrom et al 2013 the modelled community focuses on seven species cisco coregonus artedi common shiner luxilus cornutus freshwater drum aplodinotus grunniens northern pike esox lucius trout perch percopsis omiscomaycus walleye sander vitreus and yellow perch perca flavescens although this assemblage is a portion of the species pool we chose these species as their cumulative biomass estimated from net selectivity curves represents 90 of the total community biomass when possible life history parameters for each species were estimated directly from the bsm data the asymptotic length and von bertalanffy growth coefficient k vb were estimated from length at age data with asymptotic length subsequently converted to mass w inf using known length weight relationships for the species in the province reproductive status mature versus immature was assessed for some species in the field which allowed the estimation of mass at 90 maturity used to represent w mat through logistic regressions these analyses were conducted in r r core team 2019 using the fisheries stock assessment fsa package ogle et al 2020 for cisco northern pike excluding weight at maturity yellow perch and walleye when insufficient data were available to estimate these parameters values were obtained from the literature or online databases specifically weight at maturity for northern pike was derived from estimates identified by malette and morgan 2002 weight at maturity and von bertalanffy growth coefficients for common shiner and trout perch were found in a study by randall and minns 2000 and their asymptotic masses came from the ontario freshwater fishes life history database eakins 2020 and fishbase froese and pauly 2020 respectively weight at maturity the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass from freshwater drum came from bur 1984 and rypel et al 2006 dietary parameters loosely follow those used by hartvig et al 2011 with lower preferred predator prey mass ratio values β for piscivores and higher values for omnivores and planktivores the width of the size selection function σs follows a similar trend with lower values for piscivores reflecting a more specialized diet and larger values for planktivores maximum recruitment r max for each species was determined as a decreasing function of asymptotic body size following theoretical expectations of an equilibrium community approaching a linear size spectrum jacobsen et al 2014 parameter values for the seven species are summarized in table 1 these values were used as the baseline for the sensitivity analyses interaction terms required for all fish species in the model were estimated for each species pair from spatial co occurrence data supplemental table 1 spatial co occurrence was determined using catch data from gillnets deployed in a depth stratified manner sandstrom et al 2013 the morisita index morisita 1959 which is a measure of niche overlap that uses counts of individuals was chosen to measure overlap as it has been shown to perform well regardless of sample size and number of resources in this case depth strata considered smith and zaret 1982 the index c is calculated as 4 c 2 i n p i j p i k i n p i j n i j 1 n j 1 i n p i k n i k 1 n k 1 where p i j and p i k are the proportion resource i is of the total resources used by species j and k respectively the number of individuals of species j and k that use resource category i are denoted by n i j and n i k the total number of individuals of each species in the sample are represented by n the index ranges from zero to one with zero representing no overlap between species and one reflecting consistent co occurrence 2 3 global sensitivity analysis global sensitivity analyses for complex ecological models can be computationally expensive and time consuming due to the large number of interacting parameters to simplify our analyses and reduce computational demands we adopted a two step approach including a screening procedure as suggested by campolongo et al 2007 we chose to pair the morris method morris 1991 with the sobol method sobol 1993 saltelli et al 2000 as the combination of these two approaches is an established methodology that has been applied across a range of disciplines e g dejonge et al 2012 sumner et al 2012 morris et al 2014 wan et al 2015 the morris method is a one at a time approach that can be used to qualitatively identify influential parameters at low computational costs dejonge et al 2012 the method can determine which parameters have 1 negligible effects 2 linear and additive effects or 3 non linear effects or interactions with other parameters campolongo et al 2007 saltelli et al 2008 in this approach only one parameter is modified between successive runs of the model in each model run a given parameter is randomly sampled from the uncertainty region the effect of each input on model output or the elementary effect is then calculated see campolongo et al 2007 and ciric et al 2012 for detailed methods the two sensitivity measures μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the elementary effects of each parameter a large absolute mean μ indicates an input with an important overall influence on the output and a large standard deviation σ indicates a parameter involved in interactions or having non linear effects morris 1991 in this framework parameters that are deemed influential can be assessed further with the sobol method here we followed the approach of ciric et al 2012 to rank the parameters by their influence incorporating both the magnitude of their direct mean of elementary effects and interactive effects standard deviation of elementary effects on model output influence was calculated as the euclidean distance from the origin of the morris plot which has μ i and σ i on the x and y axes 4 μ i 2 σ i 2 the sobol method is based on variance decomposition using a similar framework as an analysis of variance in a factorial design which aims to determine how much of the variability in model output is dependent on each of the input parameters zhang et al 2015b a sobol sensitivity analysis will reveal first order or main effects as well as total order or total effects main effects are used to measure the fractional contribution of a single parameter to output variance while total effects consider both main effects and higher order effects that account for parameter interactions zhang et al 2015b benefits of the sobol method include no assumption regarding the relationship between model input and output as well as an ability to evaluate the full range of parameter variation however this leads to high computational costs in our analyses we evaluated the influence of 42 parameters i e six parameters for each of seven species as depicted in table 1 on our lake size spectrum model output they represent life history and trophic traits with recognized importance for population dynamics and species interactions and whose parameterization is required for any application of a multi species model setup in mizer we do not doubt that other parameters such as allometric coefficients relating metabolism or maximum consumption to body size can have a strong influence on model dynamics however they represent more general bioenergetic constraints and are very unlikely in practice to require parameterization on a system specific basis we used uniform distributions for each parameter with bounds varying 10 either side of the nominal baseline values following morris et al 2014 although uniform distributions may not reflect the true uncertainty distributions of these life history parameters their use is sufficient for the purpose of a sensitivity analysis as uninfluential parameters will show little influence regardless of distribution saltelli et al 2008 although bounds of 10 were arbitrarily chosen and may seem low higher changes may lead to parameter values that fall outside of the range of biological relevance for each species the morris method was used to screen and test for interactions among all 42 parameters and the summary statistics μ and σ were used to identify the top ten most influential parameters the top ten parameters were then passed to a sobol sensitivity analysis to identify their main and total effects on model output in the morris analysis we sampled k 42 parameters r 40 times leading to r k 1 1720 model input sets morris 1991 the sobol analysis was conducted using k 10 input factors and a sample size of n k 2 input sets following the approach of saltelli 2002 in this study we used n 7500 resulting in 90 000 unique model input sets all analyses were conducted in r 3 6 1 core team 2021 using the sensitivity iooss et al 2019 and multisensi bidot et al 2018 packages in all cases the size spectrum model was implemented through mizer and run for 500 years to ensure equilibrium dynamics were achieved the baseline model output is available in supplemental fig 1 model output from the final time step was used for all analyses the model outputs we examined were the i slope of the community spectrum ii scatter around the linear relationship of the community spectrum measured as mean squared error of the linear regression used to estimate the spectrum slope iii total community biomass and iv the shannon wiener community diversity index magurran 2013 based on the species relative biomasses 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analyses the ten highest ranking parameters are labelled on each morris plot representing a model output variable in fig 2 in all four cases parameters relating to size and growth w inf and k vb made up 70 or more of the top ten ranked parameters table 2 other influential parameters include the preferred predator prey mass ratio β and maximum recruitment r max the main and total sensitivity index results of the sobol analysis were similar to those produced by the morris sensitivity analyses fig 3 table 2 for approximately 25 of the assessed parameters the main effect was slightly larger than the total effect this result is unexpected and may be resolved by increasing the number of simulations conducted however as we included a large number of input sets and ran each analysis for over two weeks of computation processing time we believe these values are qualitatively sufficient to address the questions at hand to avoid potential biases related to computation processing time differences between main and total effects and hence interactions between parameters were not considered 3 2 von bertalanffy k coefficient the sobol analysis identified the von bertalanffy growth coefficient as the most influential parameter for three of the four output variables the growth coefficient for walleye k vb 6 had the greatest influence on the slope of the community size spectrum fig 3a and the total community biomass fig 3c to determine the relationship between the walleye growth coefficient and the slope of the spectrum we plotted the abundance spectrum produced from simulations with three different parameter values the nominal value and the upper and lower bounds from the sensitivity analyses nominal value 10 as the growth coefficient for walleye increases the left end of the spectrum where smaller organisms are found e g organisms below 10 gs shows a minor if not negligible increase in abundance in contrast abundance in large bodied individuals decreases as demonstrated by a decrease in height on the right end of the spectrum fig 4 to identify the relationship between the walleye growth coefficient and community biomass we ran a number of mizer simulations with the parameter ranging from the lower to upper bounds of the sensitivity analyses 10 of the nominal value and tracked the biomass of each species in the community as the growth coefficient for walleye increased so did the walleye biomass however the biomass of all remaining species decreased fig 5 for all species relative biomass decreases were larger than the relative increase in biomass of walleye supplemental fig 2 additionally we found that as the growth coefficient for walleye increased the growth efficiency a component of trophic transfer efficiency of the two top predators walleye and northern pike decreased supplemental fig 3 in contrast the growth efficiency of all other species in the community increased overall the growth efficiency of the entire community remained relatively stable the growth coefficient for cisco k vb 2 had the largest influence on community diversity as measured through the shannon wiener diversity index fig 3d to explore the influence of this parameter on community diversity we ran simulations with the parameter ranging from the lower to upper bounds of the sensitivity analyses 10 of the nominal value and tracked the shannon wiener diversity index we found that increases in the growth coefficient led to increases in cisco biomass and a subsequent reduction in the overall community diversity index fig 6 relative biomass changes reported in supplemental fig 4 3 3 asymptotic mass asymptotic mass had the largest influence in one of the four scenarios the asymptotic mass of northern pike w inf 4 was found to be the most influential parameter on the scatter of the linear relationship of the community size spectrum as measured by the mean squared error of the spectrum regression fig 3b to understand how the asymptotic mass of northern pike influenced the scatter around the linear relationship of the community size spectrum we plotted the relative abundance of all species with three different parameter values the nominal value and the upper and lower bounds from the sensitivity analyses nominal value 10 we chose this approach as it allows for the identification of abundance changes across size classes which may lead to lumpy spectra with lots of scatter as the asymptotic mass of northern pike is changed the relative abundance of individuals in size classes ranging from 10 g to 12 000 g also changes fig 7 it is important to note that although not identified as the most influential parameter the asymptotic mass of cisco w inf 2 did have a large influence on community diversity 4 discussion as fisheries management shifts from analyses of single stocks to ebfm approaches with multi species models it is imperative that we understand how model parameterization and calibration impact our understanding of fish communities in our sensitivity analyses of a multi species size spectrum model we identify two parameters related to growth the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass as having large impacts on several model outputs related to community biomass and structure sensitivity results from the morris and sobol analyses were comparable which underscores the importance of growth parameters in models of aquatic communities the von bertalanffy growth coefficient of walleye a top predator in the system had the largest influence on the slope of the community spectrum and the total community biomass this was likely driven by changes in trophic transfer efficiency associated with changes in the growth coefficient the absolute value of standard metabolism calculated in this model as 20 of the maximum food intake h eq 2 increases as the growth coefficient increases because the realized food intake does not increase proportionally with the expected maximum intake due to limited prey availability such increase in standard metabolism leads to decreased transfer efficiency and less energy available for larger organisms in turn this leads to a more negative community spectrum slope with a relative decrease in the abundance of larger organisms as seen in our model output previous models have demonstrated the same relationship via changes in the growth efficiency of predators in which decreases in efficiency led to steeper slopes and similar changes in biomass as those presented here benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 trebilco et al 2013 this relationship between trophic transfer efficiency and slope has also been demonstrated empirically in a study of community size spectra in german lakes mehner et al 2018 found that lake food webs exhibiting size spectrum slopes more negative than expected by theory were linked to low trophic transfer efficiency the von bertalanffy growth coefficient of cisco an abundant planktivorous species had the largest influence on community diversity represented by the shannon wiener index community diversity was the only model output to be more strongly influenced by parameters associated with a planktivore than by those associated with a top predator these results were likely driven by the high abundance of cisco in the baseline model as this species already had the highest overall biomass any increases in growth or asymptotic mass that further increase biomass would subsequently affect the diversity index e g through decreased evenness increases in prey biomass likely impact predator biomasses although these changes will be mediated by the interaction matrix and feeding preferences the asymptotic mass of northern pike the largest predator in the system had the largest effect on the scatter around the linear relationship of the community spectrum measured as the mean squared error of the spectrum regression changes in residual variation associated with the mass of this predator are likely driven both by a lack of fishing pressure and trophic cascades as fishing was not incorporated in this model analysis low numbers of large northern pike can remain in the system and lead to a noticeable dip for the largest body masses of the spectrum however trophic cascades likely play a substantial role as well as seen in our results changes in the asymptotic mass of this predator lead to fluctuations in the relative abundance of organisms along a size gradient these changes in abundance are likely driven by changes in the available prey field as the asymptotic mass of the predator increases or decreases although there are numerous hypotheses regarding the cause of scatter around the linear relationship in both empirical and modelled size spectra blanchard et al 2017 previous modelling has demonstrated that trophic cascades induced by top predators can result in the presence of domes in community size spectra rossberg et al 2019 nonlinearity of the spectrum driven by trophic cascades has also been shown empirically in a study of numerous lake fish communities arranz et al 2018 showed that deviations from linearity were driven by predator prey interactions in particular the largest deviations from linearity were seen in lakes where predators were both abundant and closer in size to their prey the results of our study suggest that effort should be taken to ensure the best possible estimates of the von bertalanffy growth coefficient and asymptotic mass of a species prior to modelling in mizer given their influence on model output fish size and growth rates are influenced by a number of factors including metabolism temperature and the amount of energy and resources available for consumption von bertalanffy 1957 west et al 2001 brown et al 2004 fortunately these parameters are generally easier to estimate than other life history parameters included in the model e g froese and binohlan 2000 ogle 2015 and are often readily estimated from data measured and recorded during fish community monitoring programs the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass are often measured or estimated concurrently and are strongly correlated increases in asymptotic size are mirrored by decreases in the growth coefficient as larger bodied organisms typically exhibit slower relative growth and take longer to reach adult sizes morais and bellwood 2018 within the modelling framework the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass are treated as independent inputs however both are used to calculate the maximum intake and ultimately growth of each species it is important to note that these inputs do not guarantee the same von bertalanffy growth curve expected from empirical estimation as the emergent growth trajectory will be dependent on the feeding level and prey availability for each species as the growth coefficient and asymptotic mass of a particular species increase so does its consumptive capacity although increases in both of these parameters lead to increases in maximum intake their effects are not identical as expressed by eq 2 in addition unlike the growth coefficient the asymptotic mass will strongly influence the distribution of predatory interactions within the model as body size will determine what prey are available to a given species these differences allow us to tease apart the influence of each parameter on model output despite their correlation in cases where data are not available for parameter estimation values can be obtained from online databases such as fishbase and fishtraits frimpong and angermeier 2020 froese and pauly 2020 although available data and measurements may not accurately describe every population cordlandwehr et al 2013 thorson et al 2014 found that data retrieved from fishbase can often be used as an accurate measure of life history traits this was particularly true for asymptotic length which can be used to estimate asymptotic mass and the growth coefficient which were found to show little to no bias when compared to estimates from local experts it may therefore be possible to parameterize a multi species size spectrum model in data poor systems using information from these databases promoting the implementation of ebfm practices previous work has highlighted this aspect of size spectrum models using mizer further demonstrating the applicability of this approach zhang et al 2016b through our sensitivity analyses we found that the most influential species were large bodied predators or those high in biomass while most prey species demonstrated little effect on the model output it is therefore important that extra consideration be given to these large bodied species and the parameters associated with them when constructing a multi species size spectrum model these findings suggest that it may be possible to group less abundant prey species together into functional groups or guilds benoit et al 2021 grouping these species together may simplify model construction and calibration particularly when working in highly diverse systems this approach is consistent with ecological abstraction theory which poses that ecosystem components with relatively high turnover rates such as short lived and small bodied species can be more safely lumped together in fewer categories without altering the dynamical behaviour of the system whereas large and long lived species which change more slowly require a more explicit representation schaffer 1981 burgess et al 2017 such an approach would combine aspects from different size spectrum modelling frameworks namely a focus on size over identity for small species as seen in earlier models e g benoit and rochet 2004 law et al 2009 and species specific information for predators and abundant species as is common in more recent models e g blanchard et al 2014 zhang et al 2015a reum et al 2019 this combination may increase the applicability of size spectrum models and facilitate their use for management purposes 5 summary and conclusion we found that parameters relating to size and growth particularly for top predators and abundant species had the largest influence on the slope of the community size spectrum scatter around the linear relationship of the spectrum total community biomass and community diversity our findings suggest that special attention should be paid to the measurement or estimation of asymptotic mass and the von bertalanffy growth coefficient in fish community assessments fortunately these parameters are easier to estimate than others in the model and numerous databases with information on these traits exist however it is important to consider biases that may exist within these databases i e underestimation for non sport fishes an avenue for future research is the potential to simplify these complex models by grouping less influential species into guilds or functional groups doing so would reduce the number of parameters requiring estimation and perhaps ease the implementation of these models which may become more commonplace as we move forward with ebfm practices credit authorship contribution statement

24537,models capable of simulating both local population dynamics and long range dispersal of wind borne pests show promise as components of adaptive areawide pest management programs local life cycles and long range wind borne transport patterns especially for small weak fliers are relatively well understood however modelling proximate causes of emigration from crop fields and hence subsequent infestation of remote crop fields remains a challenge we present results of a robustness analysis ra in which we systematically deconstructed the representation of emigration in a recent model that forecasts regional infestations of north american sorghum sorghum bicolor fields by the sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari results of ra suggested that forecasts of emigration timing were robust whereas forecasts of emigration magnitude were not for all deconstructed versions of the model the time lag between initial infestation of a sorghum field and first emigration of aphids from that field was consistently in 83 of the simulations less than a week however total magnitude of emigration from any given sorghum field differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold or by hundreds of thousands of aphids placing these ra results within the context of areawide aphid management they suggest a shift in modelling priorities from further refinement of details representing local population dynamics and magnitudes of emigration events to accurate representation of the dispersion and deposition of migrating aphids since 1 forecasted time lags between initial infestation and first emigration were both robust to changes in representation of the emigration process and of short duration and 2 time lags between a small initial infestation and populations reaching the lower action threshold for pesticide application also can be of short duration forecasted magnitudes of emigration in addition to being non robust were of marginal utility within an areawide forecasting context we hasten to note that details of the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle are of the utmost importance from the perspective of modelling local population increase and means of suppression but that is not our focus here placing our results within the broader context of simulating long range migration of wind borne pests as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs we advocate the systematic deconstruction of local scale insect pest models as a matter of habit systematic deconstruction could identify robust simplifications that could facilitate linking local scale models to existing atmospheric transport models thus increasing transferability of local levels models from one system to another keywords areawide pest management crop pests individual

important component of adaptive areawide pest management programs elliott et al 2008 giles et al 2008 irwin et al 2007 the predominant mode of migration of small insects including many crop pests is via atmospheric transport wainwright et al 2017 once airborne long range wind borne transport patterns especially for small weak fliers like cereal aphids are relatively well understood glick 1939 zhu et al 2006 a variety of atmospheric simulation models gensim rochester et al 1996 hysplit stein et al 2015 name chapman et al 2012 have been used to simulate migration flights of a variety of insect species westbrook 2008 the ecological and environmental factors affecting local population dynamics of crop pests such as aphids have been identified karley et al 2004 and references therein schellhorn et al 2015 and have been modeled in a variety of ways gosselke et al 2001 and references therein parry et al 2006 initiation of migration from local populations likely depends on host plant growth stage pest density and developmental stage weather or some combination thereof irwin et al 2007 parry 2013 a conceptual framework integrating mechanistic models that link simulation of migration events with large scale atmospheric migration models has been proposed for cereal aphids parry 2013 and a prototype quantitative platform to achieve such integration has been tested successfully koralewski et al 2019 however appropriate representation of the emigration process in mechanistic forecasting models for wind borne crop pests remains challenging indeed this was our experience while developing a model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of the sugarcane aphid with the goal of forecasting infestations of sorghum sorghum bicolor fields in the southern to central great plains of the usa wang et al 2019 the current model represents emigration as a function of sorghum growth stage and aphid developmental stage but aphid density and weather currently are not considered explicitly our decisions regarding the specific manner in which we represented the emigration process were based on on going discussions within our team of project scientists with different areas of expertise these discussions focused on the temporal spatial and organizational scales at which to represent the proximate causes of emigration our conversations embodied different disciplinary perspectives and resulted in as is always the case a necessarily subjective definition of causality iwanaga et al review in a very real sense model development paralleled our conversations different disciplinary perspectives and strengths are essential to the development of credible models but there is an unavoidable consequence that is easily overlooked iwanaga et al 2021 wang and grant 2021 it is what grimm and berger 2016 have referred to as the path dependence of model development by path dependence these authors mean that the choices made at each step during model development constrain the choices available in subsequent steps this danger is inherent in the development of all models but arguably is more insidious during model development by teams of scientists a team is more likely to have considered tested and discarded several alternative representations of a process perhaps even considering the consequences for subsequent model development associated with each before making their final decision having done so the team is less likely to revisit those decisions after they have completed development of a model that works just fine grimm and berger 2016 suggest going beyond the acceptance of models that work just fine by conducting robustness analyses involving systematic attempts to break the model via the deconstruction of important model processes the goal is to identify general principles related to the processes that are independent of the idiosyncrasies of a specific path of model development in this note following the suggestion of grimm and berger 2016 we report results of a robustness analysis ra in which we systematically deconstructed the representation of the emigration process in the model of wang et al 2019 more specifically we investigated the effect on timing and magnitude of emigration of six alternative representations of the emigration process our goal was two fold we sought to identify general aspects of the emigration process of relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields throughout the southern to central great plains of the usa that were independent of our specific path of model development we also wanted to motivate via a specific example the establishment of a culture of replicating and breaking sensu thiele and grimm 2015 ecological models which is an idea that until recently has been discussed primarily in the social sciences e g edmunds and hales 2003 2 background information 2 1 sugarcane aphids and sorghum the sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is found worldwide and is an economic pest of sorghum sorghum bicolor in asia africa australia and south america singh et al 2004 the species is a recent invasive pest of sorghum in north america bowling et al 2016 sugarcane aphid populations can increase rapidly under warm dry climatic conditions such as those during the sorghum growing season in much of north america gordy et al 2021 following colonization populations can grow exponentially and densities exceeding 10 000 aphids per plant have been observed in sorghum fields in the southern to central great plains of north america bowling et al 2016 2 2 the model of wang et al 2019 the model is a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of the sugarcane aphid to forecast regional multi generational infestations of sorghum fields derived from migrating and reproducing aphids fig 1 a the model represents an area of 1750 000 km2 divided into landscape cells measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 simulations are run for 1 year using a daily time step attributes of landscape cells include the proportion of the cell containing sorghum fields air temperature growth stage of sorghum here defined following gerik et al 2003 as vegetative gs 1 reproductive gs 2 and grain fill gs 3 leaf area per sorghum plant and aphid density per sorghum leaf within landscape cells sorghum planting dates and sorghum development class short or long duration development variety are latitude dependent and sorghum growth through stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 and increase of leaf area are temperature dependent attributes of aphids include development pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive reproduction and mortality these are temperature dependent with mortality also influenced by aphid density on sorghum leaves aphid emigration from landscape cells depends on sorghum phenology with probability of emigration increasing markedly during the last growth stage gs 3 implicitly as plant nutritive value for aphids declines emigration also depends on aphid developmental stage emigrants must have become adults within the past two days nymphs and older adults cannot emigrate and apterous wingless and alate winged morphs are not distinguished emigrating aphids are dispersed by prevailing winds with subsequent immigration and colonization of landscape cells depending on wind trajectories and the amount of growing sorghum in landscape cells receiving migrants a detailed model description is available in wang et al 2019 3 model modifications and robustness analysis 3 1 model modifications to facilitate examination of the representation of the emigration process we developed an abridged version of the model of wang et al 2019 fig 1b we 1 uncoupled the terrestrial portion of the model from the meteorological wind transport portion 2 represented each aphid as a unique individual rather than as a super individual sensu scheffer et al 1995 and 3 focused on local dynamics of each of ten landscape cells which were distributed latitudinally within the study area those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 for each of these cells we specified initial infestation dates as described below and read in time series of daily temperatures and the corresponding sorghum growth stages and leaf areas which we had archived from runs of the original model 3 2 robustness analysis phase i our ra analysis involved two phases the first phase consisted of systematically deconstructing representation of the emigration process by the use of seven versions of the abridged model we focused our deconstruction on changes in representation of the effects of sorghum growth stage and aphid developmental stage on emigration table 1 collectively these different model versions embody the paths not taken during model development that is they represent alternative representations of the emigration process which we discussed and subsequently discarded during early stages of model development version 0 represented the emigration process as in the original model version 1 relaxed the restriction that emigration depends on sorghum growth stage by changing the daily probabilities of emigrating from sorghum development stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 from 0 1 0 1 and 0 5 to 0 5 0 5 and 0 5 respectively version 2 relaxed the restriction that emigrants must have become adults within the past two days by allowing all adults but not nymphs to emigrate version 3 assumed emigration depended on cumulative aphid days instead of sorghum growth stage concept based on work of matis et al 2009 we did this by linearly increasing the probability of emigration from 0 to 1 as the total number of aphid days post infestation increased from 0 to 1000 1000 aphids per sorghum leaf is maximum density in model of wang et al 2019 regardless of sorghum growth stage version 4 distinguished alate and apterous morphs by determining morph type probabilistically as a function of aphid density number of aphids per sorghum leaf at the time the aphid was born probability of becoming an alate 0 002 0 991 1 exp 0 076 aphid density 67 416 morgan 2000 only alates were allowed to emigrate version 5 assumed all aphids in excess of 1000 per leaf emigrate none die before emigrating by simply tallying these excess aphids with those that already had emigrated version 6 relaxed the restriction of only 1000 aphids per sorghum leaf by increasing the maximum density allowed to 5000 per leaf further increases in maximum density resulted in numbers of aphids that exceeded the capacity of the program to execute for each of these seven versions we simulated four scenarios in which we specified initial infestation dates of the landscape cells as coinciding with the beginning of sorghum growth stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 respectively and also as coinciding approximately with those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 for each of these 28 cases we ran 50 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations during each simulation we monitored emigration timing and magnitude as general aspects of the process of particular relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields the portions of model that were modified for each of the model versions as well as the original forms of those portions of the model can be found in the supplementary material 3 3 robustness analysis phase ii the second phase of our ra consisted of implementing each of the six deconstructed representations of the emigration process in the unabridged with coupled terrestrial and meteorological parts model of wang et al 2019 and comparing infestation patterns generated by each alternative representation to infestation patterns observed in the field we ran five replicate stochastic simulations with each version of the coupled model under the environmental conditions simulated by wang et al 2019 which were representative of the southern to central great plains of the usa during the year 2017 during each simulation we recorded the day of year of first infestation for each landscape cell and subsequently summarized these data in terms of the earliest average and latest day of year of first infestation in each of the five latitudinally stratified zones defined by wang et al 2019 4 results 4 1 emigration timing the time lag between initial infestation and first emigration differed little among model versions consistently in 83 of the simulations the lag was 7 days or less although occasionally it was as long as 26 days in general the time lag was shorter than version 0 for versions 1 and 2 shorter or the same for version 3 the same for version 6 and longer for versions 4 and 5 regardless of the sorghum stage infested table 2 hence the day of year of first emigration was earlier than version 0 for versions 1 and 2 earlier or the same for version 3 the same for version 6 and later for versions 4 and 5 fig 2 the two landscape cells in southern texas cells 128 and 156 fig 1b were notable exceptions to this general trend if initial infestation occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 2 under versions 4 or 5 in cell 156 the maximum time lag was 16 or 26 days respectively fig 3 if initial infestation occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 2 under versions 0 or 6 in cell 128 the maximum time lag was 16 or 19 days respectively see fig s2 in supplementary material in these cases emigration did not occur due to seasonally high environmental temperatures that slowed aphid development and reduced reproduction note initial infestations in these two cells occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 1 when set to coincide with those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 4 2 emigration magnitude total magnitude of emigration during simulations differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold hundreds of thousands of aphids total magnitude was smaller than version 0 for version 3 smaller or the same for version 2 the same for version 1 and version 4 and larger for versions 5 and 6 regardless of the sorghum stage infested fig 4 the two landscape cells in southern texas again were notable exceptions to this general trend in the same cases as mentioned above fig 4 a summary of results of all 28 cases included in the ra can be found in the supplementary material 4 3 patterns of first infestation infestation patterns simulated with each of the deconstructed versions of the emigration process implemented in the unabridged model were robust to the changes we made in representation of the emigration process fig 5 earliest average and latest day of year of first infestations for each deconstructed version of the model were similar to those of the original version of the model hence each deconstructed version of the model also exhibited essentially the same relationships to the field data as did the original model 5 discussion the specific goal of our ra was to identify general aspects of the emigration process of relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields in the southern to central great plains of the usa that were independent of our specific path of model development more generally we were interested in placing our results within the broader context of simulating long range migration of wind borne pests as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs we utilized ra to improve representation of the emigration process in the areawide pest forecasting model for sugarcane aphid as first presented by wang et al 2019 we have explored the adaptation of this model to the needs of forecasting aphid risk on a large regional scale koralewski et al 2020a and we have integrated the model within a near real time forecasting system koralewski et al 2020b for potential use in areawide pest management for sugarcane aphid brewer et al 2019 for ra we followed the general framework elucidated by grimm and berger 2016 to increase our understanding of the practical importance of choosing one alternative representation of the emigration process over others thus our ra complements existing knowledge regarding processes involved in the migration of cereal aphid pests capable of wind aided long distance movement parry 2013 our results also provide guidance regarding the level of detail required in dynamic forecasting models used within the framework for adaptive areawide pest management of cereal aphids capable of long range migration elliott et al 2008 giles et al 2008 irwin et al 2007 results of the first phase of our ra suggested that our forecasts of emigration timing were robust whereas our forecasts of emigration magnitude were not regardless of model version time lag between initial infestation of a sorghum field by aphids and first emigration of aphids from that field was generally less than a week hence day of year of first emigration of aphids from any given sorghum field generally differed by less than a week however total magnitude of emigration of aphids from any given sorghum field differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold or by hundreds of thousands of aphids even among infestations that occurred within the same sorghum growth stage total emigration magnitude was greater when initial infestation occurred in earlier sorghum growth stages contemplating these ra results in light of what we know about aphid biology we would suggest that differences in representation of details of the process by which aphids emigrate from a sorghum field are not relevant in terms of forecasting subsequent aphid infestations of remote sorghum fields within an adaptive areawide pest management program at first glance this statement may seem heretical we offer the following rationale a robust aphid management relies on timely detection of aphid infestations prior to economic plant injury brewer et al 2019 that is early detection of colonies formed from immigrating aphids from more southern locations in the case of sugarcane aphid on sorghum in north america greatly facilitates timely aphid management gordy et al 2019 migration requires the presence of aphids aloft and wind currents aphids aloft behave essentially as inert particles in the atmosphere but see wainwright et al 2017 for details on vertical movements in the convective boundary layer and may be dispersed widely from any given point source zhu et al 2006 this essentially precludes establishment of an accurate relationship between numbers emigrating from point a and numbers immigrating at point b but see westbrook et al 2014 for doppler radar detection of moth migration upon colonization aphid populations can increase rapidly under weather conditions typical of the sorghum growing season in the absence of natural predators an initial population density of 10 aphids leaf can increase beyond the accepted lower action threshold for pesticide application for sugarcane aphids in sorghum within a week wang et al 2020 results of the second phase of our ra provided support for this line of reasoning when implemented in the unabridged model each of the deconstructed versions of the emigration process generated areawide infestation patterns that matched those observed in the field equally well fig 5 that is in each of the five latitudinally stratified zones defined by wang et al 2019 the earliest average and latest day of year of first infestation were similar to those of the original version of the model even version 3 which was the only version that included the concept of cumulative aphid days sensu matis et al 2009 table 1 and hence was arguably the most distinct of the versions did not generate distinctive areawide infestation patterns thus within the context of areawide aphid management the take home message from ra is that we should shift our modeling priorities from further refinement of the details representing local population dynamics and magnitudes of emigration events to accurate representation of the dispersion and deposition of migrating aphids koralewski et al 2021 wang et al 2020 that is since 1 forecasted time lags between initial infestation and first emigration were both robust to changes in representation of the emigration process and of short duration and 2 time lags between a small initial infestation and populations reaching the lower action threshold for pesticide application also can be of short duration forecasted magnitudes of emigration in addition to being non robust were of marginal utility within an areawide forecasting context we hasten to note that of course details of the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle are of the utmost importance from the perspective of modeling local population increase and means of suppression either through managed or natural processes brewer et al 2019 piyaratne et al 2013 natural enemies for example may be effective in suppressing aphid population growth in some local landscapes although not in others elliott et al 2021 considerations related to choice of the spatial temporal and organizational scales at which to model system processes is an area of much current research see review by elsawah et al 2020 and koo et al 2020 and is a topic upon which we have reflected at length with regard to modeling areawide aphid infestations see aphid case study in iwanaga et al 2021a reflecting upon the role that ra played in reshaping our thoughts about representation of the emigration process two ra results in particular suggested the shift in emphasis toward aphid aeroecology one was the robustness of time lags between initial infestation and first emigration which we mentioned above the other was our recognition that the path dependency of model development had led to forecasts of emigration magnitudes that were in effect idiosyncratic accidents of representation sensu grimm and berger 2016 that is during model development the early choices that we made regarding details of the emigration process constrained subsequent choices and led to a non robust representation of emigration magnitude although there is not a single robust mechanism sensu grimm and berger 2016 in the model responsible for the consistent trend in time lags between initial infestation and first emigration they can be explained directly in terms of the interaction of modelled processes representing population growth in a limited environment these processes are represented differently in the different versions of the model but all implicitly represent the interaction of increasing aphid density and decreasing sorghum quality as aphid habitat note the density independent effects of weather conditions on initiation of migration parry 2013 and references therein were the same in all of our simulations since we used the same time series of environmental variables to drive all simulations finally placing our results within the broader context of simulating long range migration of wind borne pests as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs we advocate the systematic deconstruction of local scale insect pest models as a matter of habit grimm and berger 2016 have argued convincingly that we have a multitude of different models for almost any class of ecological question and that our failure to systematically deconstruct our models via ra is a major impediment to the identification of robust representations of important system processes details of local scale insect pest models are influenced by both the specific problem context as they should be and by the specific path of model development which is unavoidable systematic deconstruction of local scale models could identify robust simplifications that could facilitate linkages to existing atmospheric transport models and thus increase the transferability of local levels models from one system to another credit authorship contribution statement hsiao hsuan wang

24537,models capable of simulating both local population dynamics and long range dispersal of wind borne pests show promise as components of adaptive areawide pest management programs local life cycles and long range wind borne transport patterns especially for small weak fliers are relatively well understood however modelling proximate causes of emigration from crop fields and hence subsequent infestation of remote crop fields remains a challenge we present results of a robustness analysis ra in which we systematically deconstructed the representation of emigration in a recent model that forecasts regional infestations of north american sorghum sorghum bicolor fields by the sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari results of ra suggested that forecasts of emigration timing were robust whereas forecasts of emigration magnitude were not for all deconstructed versions of the model the time lag between initial infestation of a sorghum field and first emigration of aphids from that field was consistently in 83 of the simulations less than a week however total magnitude of emigration from any given sorghum field differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold or by hundreds of thousands of aphids placing these ra results within the context of areawide aphid management they suggest a shift in modelling priorities from further refinement of details representing local population dynamics and magnitudes of emigration events to accurate representation of the dispersion and deposition of migrating aphids since 1 forecasted time lags between initial infestation and first emigration were both robust to changes in representation of the emigration process and of short duration and 2 time lags between a small initial infestation and populations reaching the

important component of adaptive areawide pest management programs elliott et al 2008 giles et al 2008 irwin et al 2007 the predominant mode of migration of small insects including many crop pests is via atmospheric transport wainwright et al 2017 once airborne long range wind borne transport patterns especially for small weak fliers like cereal aphids are relatively well understood glick 1939 zhu et al 2006 a variety of atmospheric simulation models gensim rochester et al 1996 hysplit stein et al 2015 name chapman et al 2012 have been used to simulate migration flights of a variety of insect species westbrook 2008 the ecological and environmental factors affecting local population dynamics of crop pests such as aphids have been identified karley et al 2004 and references therein schellhorn et al 2015 and have been modeled in a variety of ways gosselke et al 2001 and references therein parry et al 2006 initiation of migration from local populations likely depends on host plant growth stage pest density and developmental stage weather or some combination thereof irwin et al 2007 parry 2013 a conceptual framework integrating mechanistic models that link simulation of migration events with large scale atmospheric migration models has been proposed for cereal aphids parry 2013 and a prototype quantitative platform to achieve such integration has been tested successfully koralewski et al 2019 however appropriate representation of the emigration process in mechanistic forecasting models for wind borne crop pests remains challenging indeed this was our experience while developing a model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of the sugarcane aphid with the goal of forecasting infestations of sorghum sorghum bicolor fields in the southern to central great plains of the usa wang et al 2019 the current model represents emigration as a function of sorghum growth stage and aphid developmental stage but aphid density and weather currently are not considered explicitly our decisions regarding the specific manner in which we represented the emigration process were based on on going discussions within our team of project scientists with different areas of expertise these discussions focused on the temporal spatial and organizational scales at which to represent the proximate causes of emigration our conversations embodied different disciplinary perspectives and resulted in as is always the case a necessarily subjective definition of causality iwanaga et al review in a very real sense model development paralleled our conversations different disciplinary perspectives and strengths are essential to the development of credible models but there is an unavoidable consequence that is easily overlooked iwanaga et al 2021 wang and grant 2021 it is what grimm and berger 2016 have referred to as the path dependence of model development by path dependence these authors mean that the choices made at each step during model development constrain the choices available in subsequent steps this danger is inherent in the development of all models but arguably is more insidious during model development by teams of scientists a team is more likely to have considered tested and discarded several alternative representations of a process perhaps even considering the consequences for subsequent model development associated with each before making their final decision having done so the team is less likely to revisit those decisions after they have completed development of a model that works just fine grimm and berger 2016 suggest going beyond the acceptance of models that work just fine by conducting robustness analyses involving systematic attempts to break the model via the deconstruction of important model processes the goal is to identify general principles related to the processes that are independent of the idiosyncrasies of a specific path of model development in this note following the suggestion of grimm and berger 2016 we report results of a robustness analysis ra in which we systematically deconstructed the representation of the emigration process in the model of wang et al 2019 more specifically we investigated the effect on timing and magnitude of emigration of six alternative representations of the emigration process our goal was two fold we sought to identify general aspects of the emigration process of relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields throughout the southern to central great plains of the usa that were independent of our specific path of model development we also wanted to motivate via a specific example the establishment of a culture of replicating and breaking sensu thiele and grimm 2015 ecological models which is an idea that until recently has been discussed primarily in the social sciences e g edmunds and hales 2003 2 background information 2 1 sugarcane aphids and sorghum the sugarcane aphid melanaphis sacchari is found worldwide and is an economic pest of sorghum sorghum bicolor in asia africa australia and south america singh et al 2004 the species is a recent invasive pest of sorghum in north america bowling et al 2016 sugarcane aphid populations can increase rapidly under warm dry climatic conditions such as those during the sorghum growing season in much of north america gordy et al 2021 following colonization populations can grow exponentially and densities exceeding 10 000 aphids per plant have been observed in sorghum fields in the southern to central great plains of north america bowling et al 2016 2 2 the model of wang et al 2019 the model is a spatially explicit individual based stochastic model that integrates the life cycle and aeroecology of the sugarcane aphid to forecast regional multi generational infestations of sorghum fields derived from migrating and reproducing aphids fig 1 a the model represents an area of 1750 000 km2 divided into landscape cells measuring 0 5 latitude by 0 5 longitude 2500 km2 simulations are run for 1 year using a daily time step attributes of landscape cells include the proportion of the cell containing sorghum fields air temperature growth stage of sorghum here defined following gerik et al 2003 as vegetative gs 1 reproductive gs 2 and grain fill gs 3 leaf area per sorghum plant and aphid density per sorghum leaf within landscape cells sorghum planting dates and sorghum development class short or long duration development variety are latitude dependent and sorghum growth through stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 and increase of leaf area are temperature dependent attributes of aphids include development pre reproductive reproductive post reproductive reproduction and mortality these are temperature dependent with mortality also influenced by aphid density on sorghum leaves aphid emigration from landscape cells depends on sorghum phenology with probability of emigration increasing markedly during the last growth stage gs 3 implicitly as plant nutritive value for aphids declines emigration also depends on aphid developmental stage emigrants must have become adults within the past two days nymphs and older adults cannot emigrate and apterous wingless and alate winged morphs are not distinguished emigrating aphids are dispersed by prevailing winds with subsequent immigration and colonization of landscape cells depending on wind trajectories and the amount of growing sorghum in landscape cells receiving migrants a detailed model description is available in wang et al 2019 3 model modifications and robustness analysis 3 1 model modifications to facilitate examination of the representation of the emigration process we developed an abridged version of the model of wang et al 2019 fig 1b we 1 uncoupled the terrestrial portion of the model from the meteorological wind transport portion 2 represented each aphid as a unique individual rather than as a super individual sensu scheffer et al 1995 and 3 focused on local dynamics of each of ten landscape cells which were distributed latitudinally within the study area those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 for each of these cells we specified initial infestation dates as described below and read in time series of daily temperatures and the corresponding sorghum growth stages and leaf areas which we had archived from runs of the original model 3 2 robustness analysis phase i our ra analysis involved two phases the first phase consisted of systematically deconstructing representation of the emigration process by the use of seven versions of the abridged model we focused our deconstruction on changes in representation of the effects of sorghum growth stage and aphid developmental stage on emigration table 1 collectively these different model versions embody the paths not taken during model development that is they represent alternative representations of the emigration process which we discussed and subsequently discarded during early stages of model development version 0 represented the emigration process as in the original model version 1 relaxed the restriction that emigration depends on sorghum growth stage by changing the daily probabilities of emigrating from sorghum development stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 from 0 1 0 1 and 0 5 to 0 5 0 5 and 0 5 respectively version 2 relaxed the restriction that emigrants must have become adults within the past two days by allowing all adults but not nymphs to emigrate version 3 assumed emigration depended on cumulative aphid days instead of sorghum growth stage concept based on work of matis et al 2009 we did this by linearly increasing the probability of emigration from 0 to 1 as the total number of aphid days post infestation increased from 0 to 1000 1000 aphids per sorghum leaf is maximum density in model of wang et al 2019 regardless of sorghum growth stage version 4 distinguished alate and apterous morphs by determining morph type probabilistically as a function of aphid density number of aphids per sorghum leaf at the time the aphid was born probability of becoming an alate 0 002 0 991 1 exp 0 076 aphid density 67 416 morgan 2000 only alates were allowed to emigrate version 5 assumed all aphids in excess of 1000 per leaf emigrate none die before emigrating by simply tallying these excess aphids with those that already had emigrated version 6 relaxed the restriction of only 1000 aphids per sorghum leaf by increasing the maximum density allowed to 5000 per leaf further increases in maximum density resulted in numbers of aphids that exceeded the capacity of the program to execute for each of these seven versions we simulated four scenarios in which we specified initial infestation dates of the landscape cells as coinciding with the beginning of sorghum growth stages gs 1 gs 2 and gs 3 respectively and also as coinciding approximately with those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 for each of these 28 cases we ran 50 replicate stochastic monte carlo simulations during each simulation we monitored emigration timing and magnitude as general aspects of the process of particular relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields the portions of model that were modified for each of the model versions as well as the original forms of those portions of the model can be found in the supplementary material 3 3 robustness analysis phase ii the second phase of our ra consisted of implementing each of the six deconstructed representations of the emigration process in the unabridged with coupled terrestrial and meteorological parts model of wang et al 2019 and comparing infestation patterns generated by each alternative representation to infestation patterns observed in the field we ran five replicate stochastic simulations with each version of the coupled model under the environmental conditions simulated by wang et al 2019 which were representative of the southern to central great plains of the usa during the year 2017 during each simulation we recorded the day of year of first infestation for each landscape cell and subsequently summarized these data in terms of the earliest average and latest day of year of first infestation in each of the five latitudinally stratified zones defined by wang et al 2019 4 results 4 1 emigration timing the time lag between initial infestation and first emigration differed little among model versions consistently in 83 of the simulations the lag was 7 days or less although occasionally it was as long as 26 days in general the time lag was shorter than version 0 for versions 1 and 2 shorter or the same for version 3 the same for version 6 and longer for versions 4 and 5 regardless of the sorghum stage infested table 2 hence the day of year of first emigration was earlier than version 0 for versions 1 and 2 earlier or the same for version 3 the same for version 6 and later for versions 4 and 5 fig 2 the two landscape cells in southern texas cells 128 and 156 fig 1b were notable exceptions to this general trend if initial infestation occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 2 under versions 4 or 5 in cell 156 the maximum time lag was 16 or 26 days respectively fig 3 if initial infestation occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 2 under versions 0 or 6 in cell 128 the maximum time lag was 16 or 19 days respectively see fig s2 in supplementary material in these cases emigration did not occur due to seasonally high environmental temperatures that slowed aphid development and reduced reproduction note initial infestations in these two cells occurred during sorghum growth stage gs 1 when set to coincide with those depicted in figure 7 of wang et al 2019 4 2 emigration magnitude total magnitude of emigration during simulations differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold hundreds of thousands of aphids total magnitude was smaller than version 0 for version 3 smaller or the same for version 2 the same for version 1 and version 4 and larger for versions 5 and 6 regardless of the sorghum stage infested fig 4 the two landscape cells in southern texas again were notable exceptions to this general trend in the same cases as mentioned above fig 4 a summary of results of all 28 cases included in the ra can be found in the supplementary material 4 3 patterns of first infestation infestation patterns simulated with each of the deconstructed versions of the emigration process implemented in the unabridged model were robust to the changes we made in representation of the emigration process fig 5 earliest average and latest day of year of first infestations for each deconstructed version of the model were similar to those of the original version of the model hence each deconstructed version of the model also exhibited essentially the same relationships to the field data as did the original model 5 discussion the specific goal of our ra was to identify general aspects of the emigration process of relevance for forecasting sugarcane aphid infestations of sorghum fields in the southern to central great plains of the usa that were independent of our specific path of model development more generally we were interested in placing our results within the broader context of simulating long range migration of wind borne pests as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs we utilized ra to improve representation of the emigration process in the areawide pest forecasting model for sugarcane aphid as first presented by wang et al 2019 we have explored the adaptation of this model to the needs of forecasting aphid risk on a large regional scale koralewski et al 2020a and we have integrated the model within a near real time forecasting system koralewski et al 2020b for potential use in areawide pest management for sugarcane aphid brewer et al 2019 for ra we followed the general framework elucidated by grimm and berger 2016 to increase our understanding of the practical importance of choosing one alternative representation of the emigration process over others thus our ra complements existing knowledge regarding processes involved in the migration of cereal aphid pests capable of wind aided long distance movement parry 2013 our results also provide guidance regarding the level of detail required in dynamic forecasting models used within the framework for adaptive areawide pest management of cereal aphids capable of long range migration elliott et al 2008 giles et al 2008 irwin et al 2007 results of the first phase of our ra suggested that our forecasts of emigration timing were robust whereas our forecasts of emigration magnitude were not regardless of model version time lag between initial infestation of a sorghum field by aphids and first emigration of aphids from that field was generally less than a week hence day of year of first emigration of aphids from any given sorghum field generally differed by less than a week however total magnitude of emigration of aphids from any given sorghum field differed among model versions by as much as 4 or 5 fold or by hundreds of thousands of aphids even among infestations that occurred within the same sorghum growth stage total emigration magnitude was greater when initial infestation occurred in earlier sorghum growth stages contemplating these ra results in light of what we know about aphid biology we would suggest that differences in representation of details of the process by which aphids emigrate from a sorghum field are not relevant in terms of forecasting subsequent aphid infestations of remote sorghum fields within an adaptive areawide pest management program at first glance this statement may seem heretical we offer the following

wind currents aphids aloft behave essentially as inert particles in the atmosphere but see wainwright et al 2017 for details on vertical movements in the convective boundary layer and may be dispersed widely from any given point source zhu et al 2006 this essentially precludes establishment of an accurate relationship between numbers emigrating from point a and numbers immigrating at point b but see westbrook et al 2014 for doppler radar detection of moth migration upon colonization aphid populations can increase rapidly under weather conditions typical of the sorghum growing season in the absence of natural predators an initial population density of 10 aphids leaf can increase beyond the accepted lower action threshold for pesticide application for sugarcane aphids in sorghum within a week wang et al 2020 results of the second phase of our ra provided support for this line of reasoning when implemented in the unabridged model each of the deconstructed versions of the emigration process generated areawide infestation patterns that matched those observed in the field equally well fig 5 that is in each of the five latitudinally stratified zones defined by wang et al 2019 the earliest average and latest day of year of first infestation were similar to those of the original version of the model even version 3 which was the only version that included the concept of cumulative aphid days sensu matis et al 2009 table 1 and hence was arguably the most distinct of the versions did not generate distinctive areawide infestation patterns thus within the context of areawide aphid management the take home message from ra is that we should shift our modeling priorities from further refinement of the details representing local population dynamics and magnitudes of emigration events to accurate representation of the dispersion and deposition of migrating aphids koralewski et al 2021 wang et al 2020 that is since 1 forecasted time lags between initial infestation and first emigration were both robust to changes in representation of the emigration process and of short duration and 2 time lags between a small initial infestation and populations reaching the lower action threshold for pesticide application also can be of short duration forecasted magnitudes of emigration in addition to being non robust were of marginal utility within an areawide forecasting context we hasten to note that of course details of the terrestrial portion of the aphid life cycle are of the utmost importance from the perspective of modeling local population increase and means of suppression either through managed or natural processes brewer et al 2019 piyaratne et al 2013 natural enemies for example may be effective in suppressing aphid population growth in some local landscapes although not in others elliott et al 2021 considerations related to choice of the spatial temporal and organizational scales at which to model system processes is an area of much

aphid aeroecology one was the robustness of time lags between initial infestation and first emigration which we mentioned above the other was our recognition that the path dependency of model

that we made regarding details of the emigration process constrained subsequent choices and led to a non robust representation of emigration magnitude although there is not a single robust mechanism sensu grimm and berger 2016 in the model responsible for the consistent trend in time lags between initial infestation and first emigration they can be explained directly in terms of the interaction of modelled processes representing population growth in a limited environment these processes are represented differently in the different versions of the model but all implicitly represent the interaction of increasing aphid density and decreasing sorghum quality as aphid habitat note the density independent effects of weather conditions on initiation of migration parry 2013 and references therein were the same in all of our simulations since we used the same time series of environmental variables to drive all simulations finally placing our results within the broader context of simulating long range migration of wind borne pests as a component of adaptive areawide pest management programs we advocate the systematic deconstruction of local scale insect pest models as a matter of habit grimm and berger 2016 have argued convincingly that we have a multitude of different models for almost any class of ecological question and that our failure to systematically deconstruct our models via ra is a major impediment to the identification of robust representations of important system processes details of local scale insect pest models are influenced by both the specific problem context as they should be and by the specific path of model development which is unavoidable systematic deconstruction of local scale models could identify robust simplifications that could facilitate linkages to existing atmospheric transport models and thus increase the transferability of local levels models from one system to another credit authorship contribution statement hsiao hsuan wang

24538,biogeochemical models of vegetation dynamics could potentially be used to complement empirical studies on the effect of plant species richness a key precondition is the simulation of species coexistence while community scale models regularly incorporate respective processes models at the field or landscape scale used for larger scale assessments require additional model development however it is unclear how the particular process description within these models affects simulations of species performance and resulting ecosystem functions we compare simulations of two grassland models of different complexity for monocultures and two species mixtures in a grassland experiment in jena germany by providing an in depth analysis of the models process descriptions we evaluate their ability to simulate the response of different species their interactions and their joint performance to drought and mowing both models simulated similar average above ground biomass agb but showed different intra annual variability generally the models had difficulties representing a balanced species composition in multiple species mixtures and competition for space was the main driver of community composition in both models the resulting communities were dominated by the more competitive species while the weak competitor was only marginally present in most mixtures independent of drought and mowing the competitive strength which we derived from the calibrated parameter sets of the species differed between the models and the agreement on which species dominate specific mixtures was mixed while both models simulated reduced soil water content and above ground biomass in response to drought the strength and duration of these responses differed despite these differences simulated species interactions were barely affected and strong competitors remained dominant mowing had opposing effects on the competition for space in the models which could be attributed to the different representations of plants in the two models the models selected for the comparison are two representatives for local and large scale applications and use widely applied approaches for which our comparison highlighted strengths and weaknesses to enable the investigated models and those with similar complexity to simulate coexistence of multiple species niche differentiation needs to be improved this requires a stricter separation of access to different resources and improved representation of different ecological strategies for which community scale models that are able to simulate coexistence may be an inspiration our approach may serve as an example for other modellers looking for ways to identify important model processes for further model development in the context of species interaction keywords grassland model model comparison process based modelling species interaction species traits drought data accessibility statement the model output data used for this study are openly available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4720262 1 introduction grasslands are a key element of ruminant livestock production systems and provide multiple ecosystem services like carbon sequestration chang et al 2015 erosion control zhu et al 2015 and habitats for pollinators and other fauna dass et al 2018 tribot et al 2018 they strongly affect biogeochemical cycles at different scales moinet et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and lately their carbon storage potential has been controversely discussed in the context of climate change mitigation e g lorenz and lal 2018 yang et al 2019 godde et al 2020 the functions and services provided by grasslands are strongly controlled by the prevailing environmental conditions but also by the specific management tilman et al 2012 the response of a grassland ecosystem to changes in these drivers was shown to be mediated by species richness and community composition vogel et al 2012 craven et al 2016 yin et al 2017 consequently a good understanding of the mechanisms driving grassland dynamics is essential to assess and project future productivity ecosystem services and functions under different stressors such as climate change van oijen et al 2020 1 1 drivers of grassland dynamics in this study we focus on the effect of two important drivers of grassland dynamics decreased water availability resulting from meteorological droughts which can result from climate change and biomass removal by mowing which is a common practice in livestock production 1 1 1 water water availability results from the local balance of inputs through precipitation and losses by transpiration evaporation seepage and runoff during drought precipitation is absent or below water requirements for a longer period either within one season or across multiple years a decrease in precipitation can suppress ecosystem photosynthesis soil respiration and carbon cycling wu et al 2011 beier et al 2012 as well as key soil processes emmett et al 2004 additionally an increase in inter rainfall intervals can lead to reduced net primary production flowering duration and soil co 2 flux in grasslands fay et al 2000 other severe impacts on grassland ecosystems include a rapid loss of biomass plant cover and even species weaver 1942 tilman and el haddi 1992 carroll et al 2021 in addition droughts were shown to influence community composition and diversity patterns of grasslands buckland et al 1997 knapp et al 2008 jung et al 2020 the response of an ecosystem to periods of drought depends on characteristics of the drought itself such as its duration its intensity and its frequency felton et al 2020 denton et al 2017 it also depends on the characteristics of the grassland community as grassland species have developed several strategies to resist and survive droughts blair et al 2014 reich 2014 while annual species often use an escape strategy by completing their life cycle outside the dry season kooyers 2015 norton et al 2016 perennial species use dehydration avoidance or tolerance as a strategy zwicke et al 2015 by regulating their leaf water potential ratzmann et al 2019a b dehydration avoidance is associated with an increase in water uptake or decrease of water losses while dehydration tolerance ensures plant survival by maintaining cell integrity of meristematic tissue ludlow 1989 volaire et al 2009 zwicke et al 2015 additionally species rich communities often better buffer adverse effects of droughts in the long run than low diverse communities as they allow for shifts in their composition towards potentially better adapted species isbell et al 2015 hoover et al 2018 but may also alter environmental conditions reducing drought stress of more vulnerable species wright et al 2021 species rich communities may also benefit from complementarity effects that arise from the use of soil water stored in different soil depths by opposing rooting strategies kulmatiski and beard 2013 guderle et al 2018 klaus et al 2016 1 1 2 mowing in addition to drought the frequent removal of above ground plant biomass through mowing or cutting also affects the composition of grassland communities as well as their productivity which in turn may affect the grassland s resilience to drought events the intensity of mowing is a result of the frequency of mowing and the applied cutting height while the prevailing pedoclimatic conditions restrict grassland productivity via temperature light water and nutrient constraints under similar conditions the highest grassland productivity has been found at intermediate mowing intensities whereas very low or high mowing intensities often decrease productivity hopkins 2000 weigelt et al 2009 at low mowing intensity competition for limiting resources such as water and nutrients drives the community dynamics and thus more competitive species dominate the community smart et al 2006 therefore the community is often shaped by fewer but larger plants compared to grasslands with higher mowing intensities in contrast in grasslands with a very high mowing intensity biomass is removed so frequently that fast growth and high stature traits associated with competitive species are not advantageous but lead to selective removal of these species instead yu et al 2015 yin et al 2017 the resulting community often consists of a high number of small plants this is accompanied by reduced shading and competition for nutrients and increased growth of less competitive species promoting species richness peltzer and wilson 2001 williams et al 2007 pecháčková et al 2010 1 2 plant species richness the grassland ecosystems responses to these two drivers water availability and mowing and the mechanisms involved as well as the role of plant species richness of grassland communities have been studied using field observations and experiments along a diversity gradient e g craven et al 2016 tilman et al 2014 despite the large number of experiments the mechanistic understanding of the processes regulating community responses to drought and mowing especially in species rich communities is still limited weisser et al 2017 while the patterns can be reproduced using mathematical models e g han et al 2019 to dissect the underlying processes of ecosystem dynamics biogeochemical models bgms have the potential to complement empirical studies as they can mechanistically analyse the interacting responses of biotic and abiotic components of grasslands to changing environmental conditions wilcox et al 2020 van oijen et al 2020 however this requires that two preconditions are met first the models need to represent all relevant processes that shape the community under specific environmental and management conditions reasonably well second the models need to represent different ecological strategies enabling the communities to adapt if prevailing conditions change however bgms have not yet been assessed sufficiently with respect to these two preconditions 1 3 biogeochemical models bgms of grasslands have been developed and applied to determine grassland dynamics since the end of the 1980s e g thornley and verberne 1989 coffin and lauenroth 1990 siehoff et al 2011 hunt et al 1991 schapendonk et al 1998 duru et al 2009 these models have been developed for applications at multiple scales and with different levels of represented process detail models at the community scale simulating individual plants with different traits have been used to study the effect of resource availability and disturbance regimes on the community and its member species e g may et al 2009 soussana et al 2012 at the plot or field scale individual based and other models distinguishing traits only between species or functional types have been used to assess productivity and yields for different environmental conditions and management e g taubert et al 2012 höglind et al 2016 at the continental or global scale dynamic global vegetation models have been developed to assess element cycling commonly using only a small number of functional types to simulate grassland ecosystems e g rolinski et al 2018 vuichard et al 2007 the level of detail and the number of resources that are considered for plant growth and competition vary not only with the spatial scale for which models have been developed but also between models applied at similar scales for an extensive review see taubert et al 2012 at the community scale models that simulate the effects of plant species richness and the interactions between species have been developed e g clark et al 2018 turnbull et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 the high detail of the plant interactions is achieved at the expense of detail in biogeochemical process descriptions we refer to these models as plant interaction models pim to distinguish them from bgms the latter still need substantial development to incorporate plant species richness and species interaction in order to enable these models to simulate differently diverse communities and quantitatively assess the effect of plant species richness important processes need to be identified and the appropriateness of potential alternative approaches has to be evaluated an in depth analysis of the interactions between two species can be used to identify the important processes doing such an analysis for model representatives which exemplify a type of model a number of models sharing similar approaches and comparing the performance of multiple model representatives may be used to identify the limitations of current model implementations as well as general knowledge gaps that can inform the next steps of model development the approach can also uncover similarities and differences regarding the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches this knowledge can be used to inform on potential development options for the assessed models as well as other models of the same type 1 4 model intercomparison studies while comparison studies are more common for models of cereal crops e g asseng et al 2019 durand et al 2018 müller et al 2017 only comparably few studies for forage grasses have been published korhonen et al 2018 of these few grassland model intercomparison studies some have used a large model ensemble and cover multiple sites e g sándor et al 2017 2020 ehrhardt et al 2018 while they quantify and discuss the uncertainty within the ensemble a detailed analysis of the processes within each model is beyond their scope in contrast other studies have used a small number of models allowing for a more detailed analysis of model differences at one or multiple sites e g korhonen et al 2018 persson et al 2019 hurtado uria et al 2013 these studies are however limited to one specific species neglecting inter specific competition and differences between parametrizations obtained for multiple species which to our knowledge have only been assessed using pims crawford et al 2021 1 5 research question to expand on this for bgms of different scales and to assess the role of how processes are represented in different models we compared simulated grassland properties for two biogeochemical grassland models grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020a b lpjml schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 rolinski et al 2018 using different scenarios of water availability and management using simulations of monocultures and two species mixtures the grassmind model follows an individual based approach using fixed traits for each species and simulates photosynthesis using light response curves thornley and johnson 1990 while the lpjml model follows an average individual approach and simulates photosynthesis using an adapted farquhar approach haxeltine and prentice 1996 prentice et al 2000 using data from a long term biodiversity experiment weisser et al 2017 the jena experiment we first calibrated and evaluated the models for four species for observed climatic conditions and management subsequently we compared the models for scenarios with no moderate and extreme drought conditions in combination with and without mowing with this study we pursue the following objectives i identify the relevant processes to explain the main similarities and differences between the models outcomes for our scenarios ii assess the effects of mowing and drought in relation to calibrated parameters for the monocultures and the two species mixtures and explain the differences using the processes identified in i and iii discuss our findings from i and ii in the context of other modelling approaches 2 methods we used the vegetation models lpjml schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 rolinski et al 2018 see 2 1 1 and grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020a b see 2 1 2 for our comparison the models were first calibrated and evaluated for four monocultures and subsequently grassland dynamics were assessed for multiple scenarios of management and drought conditions for the monocultures as well as two species mixtures see 2 2 2 1 model description the grassmind and the lpjml models both simulate daily dynamics of grassland vegetation while lpjml is usually applied at large spatial scales for this study it is used as a point model simulating small plots with no further spatial distinction this plot level is the smallest spatial unit for which all dynamics represented in lpjml are simulated whereas in grassmind the smallest spatial units are the single plants which simulate the dynamics on 1 m 2 to represent the plot in both models at each daily timestep the amount of biomass gained by photosynthesis is calculated and allocated to the leaves and roots after subtracting losses from growth and maintenance respiration subsequently the biomass losses from mortality and turnover of biomass into the litter layer are determined the amount of new biomass gained depends on available space soil and climate conditions and management at optimal temperatures sufficiently available space to grow and under adequate radiation water and nitrogen supply higher photosynthesis rates can be achieved while suboptimal resource supply or high vegetation density limit photosynthesis and thus growth this can results in altered competition and community composition both models can account for management measures by irrigation and application of fertilizer can increase biomass gains biomass removal by mowing can be carried out at fixed dates reducing the tissue available for photosynthesis after the mowing event each model considers the environmental factors space not already occupied by vegetation temperature radiation water and nitrogen availability and simulates similar processes to describe biomass gains and losses fig 1 provides a condensed overview of the similarities and differences while a separate depiction is provided in fig si a 1 however the process implementations differ in specific aspects e g in lpjml overcrowding reduces the above ground biomass depending on the excess c o v e r while in grassmind the excess c o v e r determines the number of individuals killed which are then randomly selected si b table 1 while we use the term c o v e r for the comparison of the models throughout this paper it is defined differently in lpjml plant geometry is not simulated and cannot be used to calculate the c o v e r here c o v e r is the foliage projective cover f p c which is calculated from the leaf area index lai in grassmind where plant geometry is simulated c o v e r is calculated as the sum of the individual plants base area this is an important difference between the models and has to be kept in mind when reading sections 3 and 4 in addition a key difference of the models is the representation of the vegetation itself grassland communities consist of several taxonomic groups however only graminoids small and tall herbs are represented in the two models for each modelled species or functional type lpjml simulates one average individual with a given set of traits the dynamics of the average individual are then scaled up to the plot scale neglecting differences between individuals of the same species in contrast grassmind follows an individual based approach explicitly simulating multiple individuals of the same species that have the same set of traits but can differ in size e g plant height and base area both models distinguish the plant compartments leaves and roots but in grassmind leaf tissue is further divided into living and standing senescent tissue while in lpjml senescent tissue is directly added to the litter layer of the soil for a detailed description we refer to schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 and rolinski et al 2018 for the lpjml model and to taubert et al 2020a b and taubert et al 2012 for the grassmind model 2 1 1 lpjml lpjml is a process based bgm of the carbon water and nitrogen cycle developed mainly for global scale applications schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 and has been extended to simulate different grassland management routines rolinski et al 2018 however as the model simulates processes for representative points without an explicit reference to space it is also applicable at the plot scale e g ehrhardt et al 2018 lpjml is representative for several related models e g lpj guess smith et al 2001 lpjfit sakschewski et al 2015 or lpx prentice et al 2000 but also other dgvms e g jules clark et al 2011 or orchidee vuichard et al 2007 the model simulates the dynamics of an average individual of a species or a plant functional type pft with daily timesteps based on the following processes a establishment of new species and reproduction of present species b plant turnover c biomass accumulation based on gross primary production gpp and autotrophic respiration which is limited by environmental conditions and competition for resources between species direct biotic interactions are not simulated 2 1 1 1 photosynthesis lpjml simulates gpp based on a simplification of the farquhar approach in combination with a big leaf approach for which the optimum photosynthetic activity as a trade off between light energy and rubisco availability is derived numerically farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 collatz et al 1991 1992 prentice et al 2000 von bloh et al 2018 a crucial part of the photosynthesis is the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar which is determined using a factor depending on snowcover a biome specific scaling factor and the pft s f p c which is defined as the fraction of ground area covered by a vertical projection of the vegetation s foliage and determines how much of the photosynthetically active radiation par can actually be intercepted by the canopy the f p c of each pft is calculated from the pft s specific lai and light extinction coefficient afterwards the realized f p c of each pft is weighted depending on lai and f p c of all other pfts present in the plot additionally limitations due to water and nitrogen stress are accounted for by comparing resource demand and supply 2 1 1 2 water and nitrogen stress lpjml simulates soil water dynamics in six distinct layers to which plants have access depending on their root distribution schaphoff et al 2018 here we focus on plant water demand supply and uptake to analyse the impacts these processes have on each pft and the entire community in the computation of gpp an estimated canopy conductance under unlimited water supply is used to calculate the atmospheric water demand following monteith 1995 even though plants share the same soil water supply on the plot plant available soil water is calculated separately for each pft depending on its maximum water transport capacity vertical root distribution and f p c if the atmospheric demand is not met canopy conductance is reduced in accordance to the water supply this reduced conductance rate is used to determine actual gpp a similar approach is applied for the nitrogen stress in which the plant available nitrogen supply is compared to the plant s demand in case the leaf nitrogen content is below a threshold the carboxylation capacity is reduced to match the actual nitrogen supply in the leaves since the carboxylation capacity is also used to determine water limitation the actual water demand is updated and gpp is updated to account for both water and nitrogen limitations see von bloh et al 2018 for a detailed description of the nitrogen cycle in lpjml 2 1 1 3 allocation establishment and mortality the assimilated carbon is distributed between leaves and roots considering the discrepancy between the actual and the aspired leaf to root ratio of carbon if the actual leaf to root ratio is larger than the aspired more leaf carbon than root carbon more carbon is allocated to the roots and the other way around under water limited conditions additional carbon is allocated to the roots subsequently the assimilated nitrogen is distributed considering the prescribed range of carbon to nitrogen ratios of leaves and roots if the allocation of nitrogen would exceed the lower limit of these ranges a part of the nitrogen is stored so it can be distributed at a later time if not enough nitrogen is available and the upper limit of the ranges would be exceeded leave and or root carbon is reduced and the excess added to the litter layer afterwards the f p c of all pfts is updated each day the model evaluates the present species and allows for establishment of new species if these can grow under simulated conditions for all species already present and newly established reproduction is calculated based on the equal distribution of available space the more space is available the more reproduction is possible if the total f p c exceeds 1 0 overcrowding mortality reduces the leaf biomass until the f p c is smaller 1 0 all these processes interact and lead to daily changes in the pfts carbon and nitrogen pools the process rates depend on a set of pft specific parameters that resemble plant functional traits it is possible to represent different strategies of particular species using observations of multiple functional traits or measurements from experiments that correspond to a subset of the parameters to calibrate the model a full model description is available in schaphoff et al 2018 and von bloh et al 2018 and the open source version of the model is available at https github com pik lpjml lpjml we use a consolidated version of lpjml5 von bloh et al 2018 extended to simulate daily establishment 2 1 2 grassmind grassmind is an individual and process based grassland model taubert et al 2012 2020a b where plant growth is based on the concept of light response curves that is also used in several other models e g seib dgvm sato et al 2007 the model simulates the daily dynamics of individual plants of different species or pfts at the plot scale e g 1 to 100 m 2 based on the following processes a recruitment and emergence of plant seedlings b plant senescence and mortality c growth of plants based on gpp and autotrophic respiration which can be d limited by environmental conditions or reduced due to competition between plants interactions between plants encompass competition for the resources light space water and nitrogen plant competition depends on plant size and species identity but does not account for the particular spatial locations of a plant gap approach fischer et al 2016 botkin et al 1972 köhler and huth 2004 shugart 1998 each plant species is described by a set of plant traits which determines its performance in the above mentioned processes and its growth form 2 1 2 1 photosynthesis grassmind first calculates a plant s potential gpp using the concept of light response curves thornley and johnson 1990 which is subsequently reduced to account for water nitrogen and temperature limitations the potential gpp is predominantly determined by the photosynthetically active radiation par that the plant receives which is comparable to fapar in lpjml in grassmind this depends on the lai and other factors such as shading by larger plants competition for light is modelled asymmetrically which means that larger plants receive more non attenuated light than smaller plants dependent on species specific traits some species can cope better with lower light levels than others large plants with large leaf area can reach their potential gpp limit as a result of self shading the response of potential gpp to air temperature is similar for all plants but reductions of potential gpp due to soil water deficits nitrogen stress or competition are dependent on species specific traits that control resource demand and supply 2 1 2 2 water and nitrogen stress water carbon and nitrogen dynamics are modelled in 20 equally large soil layers in grassmind using a daily version of the century soil model parton et al 1988 soil water stress is modelled using a linear reduction dependent on soil water content permanent wilting point and field capacity granier et al 1999 species specific differences in water uptake are a result of the water demand of plants using the concept of water use efficiency and their rooting depth in relation to the availability of water in different soil layers a similar approach is used for plant nitrogen stress based on the potential npp which is a balance between possibly limited gpp and autotrophic respiration modelled proportional to plant biomass the plant nitrogen demand is calculated using c n ratios of green and brown leaves and roots species specific model parameters again the potential npp of a plant is reduced linearly dependent on the ratio of nitrogen supply and demand leave senescence can add nitrogen resources to the supply via retranslocation from yellowing to still green leaves the actual gpp is calculated from the potential gpp by accounting for the limitations from temperature water and nitrogen stress using multiplicative factors subsequently the autotrophic respiration is accounted for to obtain the actual npp 2 1 2 3 allocation recruitment and mortality the actual npp is then distributed between shoots stems and leaves roots and reproductive biomass a species specific fraction is allocated to the shoots and the root biomass is updated dependent on this fraction and the shoot root ratio the remaining npp is allocated to the reproduction pool corresponding nitrogen fluxes are calculated according to the respective c n ratios the growth of plants based on an increased net productivity results in an increased plant biomass leaf area rooting depth and root branch length plant height and width dependent on species specific traits recruitment and mortality of plants determine in turn the density of plants on the simulated area recruitment can occur from three sources migration from a surrounding meta community as a constant inflow sowing of seeds at specific times and local reproduction of plants depending on their fitness plants of a higher fitness are able to invest more of their npp into reproduction and can produce more seeds in this study seed ingrowth from a meta community and local recruitment are summarized in one model parameter while seedlings can grow at any time and establish dependent on species traits e g germination rate plant mortality is modelled in terms of a background mortality and a crowding mortality the background mortality is constant but differs between seedlings and mature plants and independent of environmental conditions and overcrowding plants that have reached their expected maximum age die immediately if the total vegetation cover which is calculated based on all plant s width or lateral expansion exceeds an area size of one m 2 crowding mortality reduces the number of individual plants irrespective of size or plant age a full model description of grassmind can be found in taubert et al 2012 2020b and taubert et al 2020a and on www formind org downloads 2 2 site and scenario description both models were applied to plots of the jena experiment which is situated at the northern edge of jena thuringia germany on the floodplain of the saale river 50 55 n 11 35 e 130 m a s l weisser et al 2017 the annual mean temperature and mean annual precipitation between 1980 and 2010 were 9 9 c and 610 mm year respectively hoffmann et al 2014 and the soil is classified as eutric fluvisol roscher et al 2004 for our simulations we used gap filled daily weather data for temperature precipitation and shortwave radiation from 2002 to 2014 mpi 2019 taubert et al 2020a within this period annual precipitation ranged from 368 to 784 mm year with a mean of 526 mm year which is below the 1980 to 2010 average for the use in lpjml we had to normalize leap years 2004 2008 and 2012 to 365 days we chose to remove december 31st in leap years to maintain the seasonality within the years since data on harvest events were only available at monthly resolution weigelt et al 2010 we assumed harvests to occur in the middle of the month 15 t h data on soil bulk density field capacity and permanent wilting point were measured in four blocks set up along a soil texture gradient perpendicular to the river saale roscher et al 2004 in addition to the measurements we derived porosity from soil texture for our simulations we always used the data on soil properties from the block in which our selected species plots were located 2 2 1 species selection at the jena site several experiments were conducted in parallel we use data from two experiments the main experiment roscher et al 2004 which was designed to compare the different diversity levels and the monoculture experiment heisse et al 2007 which was established as a control for example to compare mixture and monoculture yields the species pool of the jena experiment consists of 64 species from four functional groups grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes that grow well under the site conditions weisser et al 2017 monocultures of all 64 species were established in the monoculture experiment while in the main experiment monocultures of only 16 four from each functional group species were sown limiting the number of species available for our study we excluded the tall herb and legume species from our selection because we assumed the small herbs and grasses to be more suitable for usage in both models of the eight remaining species we excluded b perennis because the experimental plots were strongly affected by the rust fungi puccinia coronata and p graminis which led to a decrease in productivity and the abandonment of the plots in later years weisser et al 2017 to reduce the complexity of our comparison we selected only four of the remaining seven species for our simulations we selected three common fodder grasses poa pratensis festuca pratensis and festuca rubra and one very common small herb plantago lanceolata for all selected species data was available in the two experiments allowing us to use the data of the main experiment for the calibration while evaluating the models against the data from the monoculture experiments 2 2 2 calibration and evaluation for model calibration we used the data from the monoculture plots of the main experiment on above ground biomass agb leaf area index lai and vegetation cover for both models as well as vegetation height in addition for grassmind see 2 2 2 we evaluated the performance of both models by using data on agb from the monoculture experiment which consisted of small plots of monocultures of all species used in the main experiment heisse et al 2007 for both calibration and evaluation we used the daily weather data from 2002 to 2014 and the mowing frequency that was reported for the jena experiment where plots were mown twice a year usually in may and september plots of the main and the monoculture experiments were not fertilized therefore we did not add any fertilizer and excluded nitrogen deposition in our simulations the model specific calibration procedures as well as the parameters selected for calibration are described in si a the observed data sets used for the calibration and the evaluation both show a decrease of monoculture productivity over time marquard et al 2013 which results in substantially lower values of agb in the later years additionally for some agb observations the variability of data for one sampling period was large which was also found in other grassland experiments e g vuichard et al 2007 for lpjml a spinup run was conducted to obtain soil carbon nitrogen water and temperature values to initialize the calibration and evaluation simulations spinup conditions are described in si a 2 2 3 simulation scenarios as we were interested in the effects of drought and mowing on modelled processes and on the performance of species in monocultures and the two species mixtures we run three precipitation scenarios baseline moderate drought extreme drought each with and without mowing each scenario was run for 28 years for the first 14 years the baseline scenario was used in all scenarios as a spinup to obtain an equilibrium state of the plant community in grassmind the scenario simulations could be started right away while for lpjml they were based on the initial spinup run also used for calibration and evaluation for the baseline treatment we simply repeated these 14 years for our drought treatments we excluded parts of the rain see below in year 16 but returned to the baseline scenario for years 17 28 all evaluations refer to the years 15 to 28 of our simulations we first generated our baseline scenario in which we reduced the effects of intra annual rainfall variability that could otherwise mask the effects of droughts to obtain the baseline scenario baseline mow time series we grouped the data based on annual and spring precipitation sums into three clusters using euclidean distances and a ward clustering algorithm murtagh and legendre 2014 the hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with r version 3 5 3 using the hclust function from the stats package r core team 2019 we selected the cluster with the medium annual and spring precipitation which contained seven years for the moderate drought scenario modd mow we used the same time series but excluded precipitation in april and may of year 16 we extended the exclusion to march and june for the extreme drought extrd mow by this we reduced the annual precipitation by approximately 20 and 40 respectively we ran simulations for scenarios baseline mow modd mow and extrd mow with limited nitrogen supply and with mowing additionally we ran simulations with the same environmental conditions but without mowing baseline nomow modd nomow and extrd nomow 3 results we analysed model outputs on above ground biomass agb gpp npp lai losses litterfall and mortality c o v e r and water uptake we present the results for agb in the main text and for the other variables only for our baseline scenario baseline mow in the si in section 3 1 we briefly present the results of the calibration and model evaluation subsequently we analyse our results of agb dynamics for monocultures and mixtures for both models for our scenarios in section 3 2 3 1 model calibration and evaluation model calibration was successfully conducted for both models following the procedures described in si a overall both calibrated models reproduced the observed data from monocultures of the main experiment well for agb described as organic dry matter lai and for grassmind height but not for c o v e r agreement with the experimental data varied between the models and for different species fig si a 2 4 we were able to calibrate lpjml and represent four different species modifying only four parameters the parameter sets of the four species were derived during the calibration starting from the same initial parameter values for all species lpjml showed good agreement with data on lai rmse 0 53 to 1 18 m 2 m 2 and moderate agreement with agb observations rmse 46 4 to 245 8 gdm m 2 but data on c o v e r did not agree well rmse 0 24 to 0 59 m 2 m 2 simulated c o v e r values of monocultures in the calibration of lpjml were low compared to observations in lpjml plant size is not explicitly simulated and c o v e r is calculated as foliage projected cover fpc from the lai assuming a strong connection of the two see 2 1 1 using both lai and c o v e r in the calibration results in a trade off in favour of the one that leads to better results for agb furthermore since observed c o v e r was estimated visually we assume lai observations to be more reliable and attribute only minor importance to the fit of c o v e r for lpjml the calibration of grassmind for the four monocultures required the fit of 13 species specific parameters and also included the vegetation height in addition to the observed lai c o v e r and agb good agreement of grassmind was achieved for lai rmse 0 47 to 0 71 m 2 m 2 as well as for vegetation height rmse 0 083 to 0 218 m and agb results agreed moderately with observations rmse 34 0 to 236 6 gdm m 2 as in lpjml grassmind simulations did not agree well with the observed data on c o v e r rmse 0 22 to 0 46 m 2 m 2 but in contrast to lpjml grassmind overestimated vegetation cover in the simulation of grassmind vegetation cover is derived from individual plant sizes and allowed to settle around 100 for the model calibration observed vegetation cover excluding weeds and dead material is therefore compared only with the cover of green leaves of the simulated plants excluding standing senescent leaves note that the calibration here differs from previous calibrations of grassmind taubert et al 2020a to harmonize the study design and simplify the comparison of the two models see si a for a detailed description of the calibration procedure 3 1 1 deviations from observations although agb values agreed only moderately with the observations the agreement with the majority of the data is significantly better because a major share lpjml 51 to 81 and grassmind 57 to 87 of the sum of square errors se can be attributed to only two of the twelve observation dates for each species fig si a 5 7 the observations can be partitioned into high agb and low agb observations for all the plots we used high agb observations were sampled in the early years 2002 to 2004 of the experiment while observations from the later years showed substantially lower agb because of a decrease in productivity marquard et al 2013 a large share of the sum of ses is related to the high agb observations in the early years this high productivity at the beginning of the experiment cannot be reproduced by either model this may be a results of the uncertain initial soil conditions e g soil fertility because of the unknown management history prior to the experiment in jena but may also be related to the obtained parameterizations for both models selected parameter values are static and cannot change over time therefore as long as the environmental conditions and management remain similar the models do not simulate any temporal trends to adequately simulate the high agb levels in the early years of the experiment a different set of parameter values would be needed however since the majority of the data consists of low agb samples collected after the decrease in productivity the calibration procedure returns a set of parameter values which reproduce this subset of the observations well we were able to confirm this with our evaluation fig 2 where we used the agb observations from the monoculture experiments heisse et al 2007 here the rmses of both models were very similar e g 81 7 gdm m 2 for lpjml and 77 8 gdm m 2 for grassmind for p pratensis the data from the monoculture experiment show the same productivity decrease as the main experiment and similar to the calibration a major share of the se 55 and 82 can be attributed to only two observations fig si a 8 3 2 aboveground biomass dynamics and resource competition in our comparison we focus on the differences and similarities in the agb dynamics of both models for the different scenarios we ordered the description of the results so that differences in climatic conditions and management to the baseline scenario increase step by step first we present results for our baseline scenario baseline mow see 3 2 1 which while already using climate data with reduced variability see 2 2 3 is not subject to additional precipitation reduction and uses the standard management as also used in the calibration and evaluation second we compare the result from baseline mow to the drought scenarios modd mow and extrd mow see 3 2 2 in which precipitation reductions are prescribed third we compare baseline mow modd mow and extrd mow to the scenarios without mowing baseline nomow modd nomow and extrd nomow see 3 2 3 3 2 1 simulated dynamics in the baseline scenario with mowing the monoculture simulation experiments under the baseline rainfall treatment with mowing fig 3 a d show similar overall means in agb in both models agb values are highest for f rubra lpjml 126 gdm m 2 and grassmind 106 gdm m 2 and lowest for p pratensis lpjml 41 gdm m 2 and p lanceolata grassmind 36 gdm m 2 however the intra annual dynamics indicate strong differences between lpjml and grassmind the variation of agb between seasons is much more pronounced for grassmind than for lpjml with lower agb in winter but for most species higher agb during the summer months this is connected to the different process implementations in both models that are used to derive npp from gpp and autotrophic respiration and agb losses in the form of turnover and mortality see 2 1 and 4 1 for the two species mixture experiments fig 3 e j the agb dynamics are driven by the dominant species the dominant species can either be the same fig 3 e g with similar differences in mean values as in the monocultures or different fig 3 h j with larger discrepancies in mean values in addition to npp and agb loss from turnover and mortality competition between species affects the agb dynamics while these processes are sufficient to explain the off season agb dynamics the additional reduction from mowing has to be considered for the dynamics within the growing season the effect of mowing strongly differs between the two models fig 3a j and is the underlying reason for the different agb peaks during the growing season in lpjml 47 6 to 207 0 gdm m 2 is on average removed by mowing this amount is significantly smaller in grassmind 1 4 to 31 3 gdm m 2 the large differences in biomass reduction are related to the different implementations of the mowing routines and the representation of the plants themselves in both models the dominant species exploit available resources more efficiently which is related to the parameterization of the species higher parameter values for important traits are directly related to a higher competitive strength fig 4 in lpjml this is related to the calibrated parameters via specific processes while all parameters fig 4 are important to calibrate the simulated agb to the observations the leaf to root ratio l r and stubble density ρ v e g are of minor importance for competition here the light extinction coefficient k b e e r and the specific leaf area s l a which are used to calculate f p c are most important higher values of these two parameters result in higher f p c values and the species utilize space more effectively k b e e r is highest for the most competitive species f rubra and lowest for the least competitive species p pratensis s l a is less important and only influences competitive strength for species with similar k b e e r values f pratensis and p lanceolata in grassmind benefits of a species in the fast and successful establishment of seedlings high germination rate g e r m short time of emergence t e m and low seedling mortality m s e e d also determine the competitive strength of that species in mixtures as for p lanceolata in this case the larger mature plant mortality m b a s i c weighs less than the favourably low seedling mortality m s e e d because plants mature later higher a g e r e p highly productive species higher maximum gross leaf photosynthesis p m a x higher s l a higher shoot root ratio s r can be more competitive in mixtures which however can be altered by self shading high height width ratio h w or shading by other plants low h w by fast leaf senescence low l l s or waterstress related attributes the latter are of specific importance as we show in section 3 2 2 while water use efficiency w u e and allocation rate of net productivity to shoot biomass a l l o c s h o o t are only of minor importance as for p pratensis 3 2 2 effects of rainfall reduction in both models the agb decreased during the drought treatments with mowing fig 5d and si d 1 5d overall effects were qualitatively the same for both the moderate and the extreme drought and just differed in their order of magnitude for both models we compared the lowest agb values during the drought fig 5e and si d 1 5e i e the maximum difference between the baseline and the drought scenarios for both models while the smallest differences between the baseline and drought scenarios are similar between the two models during the moderate and the extreme drought lpjml 13 9 and 23 1 gdm m 2 grassmind 11 5 and 12 0 gdm m 2 in grassmind the largest differences are more extensive 130 5 and 170 7 gdm m 2 than in lpjml 77 2 and 110 5 gdm m 2 the decrease of agb under drought is a result of the reduced water uptake fig 5e and si d 1 5e after soil water resources in the first 20 cm of the soil are depleted this depletion of soil water content is stronger in grassmind 20 fig 5b and si d 1 5b here the permanent wilting point is reached and no water is available for transpiration leading to no plant growth i e gpp at all and a fast decline of agb caused by continued mortality and turnover in lpjml the soil water depletion is less severe 13 to 14 but the reduced water supply also limits gpp the balance of the reduced gpp the respiration which is not affected by the drought and turnover becomes negative and agb decreases compared to grassmind this results in a smaller and slower decline of agb after the end of the drought treatment soil water resources are replenished in both drought scenarios a similar soil water content compared to the baseline scenarios is reached shortly after the end of the drought fig 5b and si d 1 5b however in all scenarios the soil water content remains below field capacity because of the low july precipitation which results in additional water stress fig 5c and si d 1 5c after the end of the treatment vegetation recovers at different speed in both models in grassmind the recovery is fast and the agb reaches a pre treatment level soon after the soil water is replenished fig 5d and si d 1 5d in lpjml recovery is slower and agb two years after the treatment can still be substantially lower than the pre treatment agb after a complete recovery the agb of the scenarios with rainfall reduction treatments and the baseline scenario are the same because of identical environmental and management conditions in lpjml all simulated species suffer from the drought and only start recovering after the end of the drought in grassmind this is similar except for p lanceolata which after a short period of agb losses already gains biomass i e positive gpp during the drought this is the only deep rooting species with higher values of the parameters of the rooting depth power law relationship r d 1 and r d 2 these ensure a good species performance and competition even during the precipitation reduction were p lanceolata takes advantage of water in deeper soil layers fig si d 1 3 and 4 and benefits from the reduced crowding mortality 3 2 3 comparison of mowing effects mowing has very different effects in the two models in the monoculture and mixture simulations for the baseline scenario fig 6a and si e 1 5a in grassmind mean agb values are barely higher in the baseline scenario without mowing than with mowing 1 5 to 4 5 gdm m 2 while in lpjml these are considerably larger 90 6 to 210 7 gdm m 2 as established in section 3 2 1 mowing plays an important role for agb dynamics in grassmind the amount of biomass reduced is not pre determined but linked to the plant height structure of the community i e frequency of large and small plants because only a few individuals exceed the mowing height here 0 1 m the reductions from mowing are small in contrast in lpjml vegetation height is not simulated and mowing directly reduces agb to a predefined threshold the effect of mowing on mean agb also alters the effect of the moderate and extreme precipitation reduction increasing the differences between the models fig 6b c and si e 1 5 b c losses during the reduction treatment are similar to those in the scenarios with mowing in grassmind 7 2 to 160 1 gdm m 2 but strongly increase in lpjml 70 8 to 156 5 gdm m 2 because the generally higher agb leads to higher turnover and respiration fig si c 11 as in the scenarios with mowing community composition was barely affected in the scenarios without mowing regardless of the precipitation reduction treatment fig si c 6 14 15 4 discussion differences in simulated responses of monocultures and two species mixtures to drought and mowing can be related to process representations of above and below ground resource competition as well as of water dynamics and community representation even though we could not test the relevance of individual processes the differences between model results and implemented features can shed some light on the importance of different mechanisms and model features for simulated dynamics 4 1 above ground biomass seasonality the two models show substantially different intra annual agb dynamics for which we identified several underlying mechanisms strongest differences were found during the off season where no data is available from the jena experiment for calibration or evaluation of the models suggesting that the calibration process helped to reduce differences between models 4 1 1 processes determining agb our simulations show that gpp and npp have higher average and peak values for grassmind fig si c 1 2 gains in biomass are resulting from npp which is dependent on gpp both are controlled by lai and c o v e r which also show higher average and peak values for grassmind fig si c 3 4 and together with the amount of absorbed radiation determine the rate of photosynthesis here the models use different process realizations in grassmind vegetation height and lai of each individual determine its gpp from which respiration losses are subtracted to obtain npp in lpjml c o v e r calculated as f p c using lai is used to determine the amount of absorbed radiation and resulting gpp similar to grassmind autotrophic respiration is subtracted to obtain npp both models account for the effect of shading differently grassmind directly via interactions between individuals and lpjml indirectly within the calculation of c o v e r while the high lai values for grassmind result in high productivity the lower lai values for lpjml lead to low c o v e r values and lower productivity the higher productivity of grassmind can only lead to the similar average value of agb we observed for the two models if it is counteracted by higher losses these result from age and overcrowding related mortality and turnover as well as mowing during the growing season fig si c 5 turnover and in the case of grassmind also age mortality constantly contribute to these losses independent of environmental conditions and management but with different magnitudes in both models losses from overcrowding are linked to total plant c o v e r and describe competition for space which can lead to decreased establishment and increased mortality in both models in grassmind c o v e r includes alive and standing senescent biomass here available space is always fully occupied leading to a constant loss of biomass from overcrowding this loss arises from the number of individuals that die from overcrowding which is dependent on the number of individuals present and the total c o v e r of the plot tab si b 1 in grassmind competition for space occurs between conspecifics individuals of the same species and heterospecifics individuals of different species and is therefore also effective in monocultures whereas in lpjml competition for space occurs only between different species so that losses due to overcrowding do not occur in monocultures and observed losses result from turnover fig si c 4 a d 4 1 2 agb dynamics outside and during the growing season the higher winter agb in lpjml compared to grassmind originates in the model specific representation of the leaves in both models agb is the entire amount of standing biomass in lpjml a distinction between photosynthetically active green and already senescent leaves yellow is not made but a constant proportion of the total leaf biomass is transferred to the litter pools each day of the year in grassmind such a distinction is made but yellow agb is constantly transferred to the litter so that agb consists predominantly of green leaf biomass this results in a larger reduction of the agb during the off season therefore agb shows high values during the growing season but low values during the off season in grassmind while in lpjml despite similar gpp and npp agb values are higher these differences are sufficient to explain the off season deviations between the models where biomass losses from overcrowding lead to the lower agb of grassmind however to fully explain the differences within the growing season the additional reduction of agb from mowing has to be considered the effect of mowing strongly differs between the two models fig 3a j in grassmind the vegetative height of the individuals is explicitly simulated and during mowing events only larger individuals are reduced because the simulated height distribution of the community is often skewed towards smaller individuals biomass reductions are small in lpjml height is not simulated explicitly and the amount of extracted biomass is determined as the difference between total agb and a predefined residual biomass this results in the different agb during the peak growing season we are aware that monocultures and two species mixtures are not representative for the diversity of grassland communities and are thus difficult to compare to observations from other grassland ecosystems nevertheless empirical studies that support both types of agb seasonality exist agb dynamics of lpjml are comparable to observations of total agb e g poyda et al 2020 while the dynamics in grassmind are similar to observations of green agb e g inoue et al 2015 4 1 3 processes controlling drought response the comparison to the scenarios with a moderate and extreme drought showed an effect of the drought on agb during and after although water became limiting during the drought competition for space remained strong and the community compositions of the two species mixtures were barely affected in none of the mixtures the subordinate species gained a substantial advantage in either of the models fig si c 12 13 both the moderate and the extreme drought lead to short term reductions of agb followed by a full recovery the drought effect was stronger in grassmind where water uptake is only limited by the available soil water if this falls below a threshold water stress occurs regardless of plant water demand which in reality might still be fulfilled even under a reduced water supply on the contrary in lpjml plant water demand is calculated depending on the potential canopy conductance which is derived from the productivity of the agb and compared to the supply therefore even if the soil water content is low especially species with a low agb may not suffer from water stress even under a reduced soil water content the water stress during the drought directly inhibited growth of new biomass however the losses depicted in section 4 1 1 are only indirectly affected by the environmental conditions through the reduced amount of available biomass or covered area and remain substantial fig si c 16 18 this changes the balance between biomass gains and losses and leads to an overall decline of above ground biomass in grassmind the drought affects the community structure which consists of different individuals leading to different productivity and mortality patterns compared to the baseline scenario in contrast in lpjml the average individuals adjust to the changing conditions and become similar to the baseline scenario after a full recovery 4 1 4 recovery after drought while recovery from drought in grassmind was fast it took up to two years in lpjml drought recovery depends on a number of factors and evidence from observational studies exists supporting the fast recovery e g hofer et al 2016 as well as the slow recovery e g sala et al 2012 however the different model responses to similar conditions suggest drought recovery is not well captured by the models and additional research is needed for this we provide some insight on the mechanisms implemented in both models in grassmind the fast recovery is possible firstly because water stress is only dependent on supply as soon as the soil water supply is replenished while the demand is still lower than before the drought the water stress penalty is removed which allows optimal growth of newly established seedlings secondly plants in grassmind do not change or adapt specific traits in response to drought events like the allocation of npp to above or below ground biomass or the water use efficiency in lpjml recovery takes longer because of two reasons first the loss of vegetation during drought reduces the water demand and limits productivity even after soil water is replenished second water stress triggers an increased resource allocation to the roots i e below ground biomass bgb which is not reversed instantaneously when carbon assimilation or vegetation carbon is low the additional allocation to bgb during and shortly after the drought results in a lower agb implying also reductions of f p c as f p c is used as an estimate of the covered part of the plot and therefore controls the access to resources the calculation of plant available water is reduced to the covered share of the plot 4 2 species interaction and community assembly we identified competition for space as the main driver of species interactions in both models see 4 1 despite the differences in agb the competition for space shows a weak seasonality in both models in lpjml this depends on the lai which shows a weak seasonality and therefore the competition for space is similar within and outside the growing season in grassmind the agb and lai seasonality are more pronounced but both have no effect on the competition for space which is determined from the c o v e r this is high within and outside the growing season and so is competition for space coexistence between species without one species being strongly dominant occurred in grassmind and lpjml only in rare cases of mixtures when species showed similar competitiveness stable coexistence has to be achieved to assess the effects of plant species richness because it is a precondition for long term maintenance of diversity turnbull et al 2013 to achieve this fitness as well as niche differences have to be simulated appropriately chesson 2000 and process representations need to be improved for grassmind additional insights on community dynamics could be gained through the extraction of density dependence functions of the different species mixtures han et al 2019 however for lpjml the density dependence functions would always be constant because only one average individual is simulated to represent an entire species therefore we did not pursue this further but instead focused on identifying key processes by assessing the role of specific parameters 4 2 1 and responses to changes in environmental or management conditions 4 2 2 4 2 1 the role of specific model parameters in both models the species that grow fast higher sla and intercept light more efficiently higher k b e e r are more competitive these two parameters have a strong influence on simulation results which is in line with findings from sensitivity analyses see si a and forkel et al 2019 zaehle et al 2005 taubert et al 2020b hetzer et al 2021 schmid et al 2021 even though the different shoot root ratios between species lead to different overall root carbon competition for below ground resources does not play a major role however in lpjml only the assumed species specific vertical distribution of roots and in grassmind the maximum rooting depth are considered for water uptake neglecting the horizontal branching of root networks in lpjml the vertical root distributions are similar for the simulated species as is the maximum rooting depth in grassmind except for p lanceolata which had access to deeper soil layers than the other species nevertheless competition for space outweighed that for below ground resources 4 2 2 the effect of drought and mowing on competition a moderate or extreme drought leads to major reductions in biomass but does not or only barely change the interaction between the species in neither model root biomass is considered for the calculation of water supply instead lpjml determines the access to soil layers based on the vertical root distribution and uses c o v e r to distribute available water between species grassmind determines access depending on rooting depth assuming roots are equally distributed among accessed layers and uses potential gpp to calculate the individual plants water demand which is reduced by a multiplicative factor under water stress to determine uptake this underpins that competition is driven by above ground processes and emphasizes the necessity to focus future model development on below ground plant organs and processes this may be a challenging task since knowledge on root traits below ground processes and driving forces are distinctively harder to obtain from field experiments and observations polomski and kuhn 2002 delory et al 2017 recent efforts to build a global database for root traits guerrero ramírez et al 2021 may help to better inform parameterization of root distributions and access to soil resources comparing the scenarios with and without mowing revealed not only substantial differences in the effect of mowing on agb but controversially showed that mowing affects competition for space differently for both models in lpjml mowing increases the competition for space this is best illustrated using the mixture of p lanceolata and f pratensis here stable coexistence of two species emerges in the scenarios without mowing but f pratensis dominates in the mown scenarios in lpjml these two species have similar competitive strength see 3 2 1 following this we hypothesize that mowing increases competitive pressure in lpjml and the stronger competitor is dominant even at small differences between two species mowing in lpjml reduces the agb to a species specific residual however this residual is scaled with the species f p c to constrain the total residual biomass of the community when the species have similar agb they constitute a similar f p c and the species with the higher species specific residual ρ v e g has an advantage in the scenario with mowing but not in the scenario without mowing if the competitive strength of the two species differs the dominant species with the higher f p c always has an advantage in grassmind on the other hand competition for space is stronger in the scenarios without mowing because mowing shifts the individuals height to width relationship which leads to increased investments into height growth after a mowing event and a reduced investment into area growth and competition for space between conspecifics and heterospecifics without mowing the individuals can continuously invest more of their productivity into expansion leading to an increased competition for space and overcrowding mortality while we did not observe any changes in community composition in our simulations these can occur if the species have different geometrical properties for example a species producing smaller and wider individuals would outcompete a species producing tall and thin individuals in the scenario with mowing and vice versa in the scenario without mowing 4 3 limitations our model comparison focused on differences and similarities of two grassland models to compare the models we developed a calibration setup using only observation data from monocultures the rare emergence of coexistence between two species in grassmind simulations results from this constraint to monoculture observations included in the calibration and the fixed non adaptive behaviour of plant traits results from a recent study with grassmind taubert et al 2020b showed coexistence of p pratensis and p lanceolata similar to observations calibrating on observational data of monocultures and mixed patches in contrast we only used monoculture data for calibration as plant traits in grassmind are fixed and do not change in response to species interactions the calibration of this study captures predominantly intra specific plant interactions rather than inter specific interactions further we here prescribed similar seed recruitment rates for the analysed monocultures and mixtures which already changes the competitive strength of some species in contrast to taubert et al 2020b the better reproduction of coexistence of species in taubert et al 2020b in comparison to our setup suggests that calibration should be done against data that include inter species interactions which may otherwise be lost in the simulations the more balanced species composition in grassmind may emerge because the individual based approach and the explicit simulations of plant geometry generally allows a broader representation of different ecological strategies competition for space between conspecifics and heterospecifics is simulated depending on the geometry while competition for other resources is more dependent on functional traits in lpjml plant geometry is not simulated and the f p c is extensively used not only in the competition for space but also for other resources such as light and water this contains the assumption that an investment in increased agb leading to an increased f p c will improve both above and below ground resource exploitation similarly while investments in bgb do not yield any advantage this assumption may be valid for productive habitats where only radiation but not below ground resources are limiting and increased investment in bgb has no advantages in these habitats species following a competitive strategy with a fast exploitation of available resources are dominant in other habitats e g where below ground resources are limited a mix of species following different ecological strategies may emerge however controlling the resource exploitation for multiple resources using the same traits precludes the trade offs between different strategies and leads to the dominance of competitive species in all habitats here different resource exploitation strategies and the trade off between resource exploitation and stress tolerance have to be considered the data available from observations additionally limited the calibration setup see 3 1 only two observations per year both within the growing season were available and therefore the seasonality cannot be inferred from the data data for all monocultures show a strong decrease in soil fertility and agb a few years after the start of the experiment weisser et al 2017 this decrease cannot be captured by the models which only capture the low values well additional limitations were introduced by our scenarios first the simulated drought does not consider changes in radiation humidity wind speed and temperature which covary wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 and is therefore comparable to a rainfall exclusion experiment reynolds et al 1999 yahdjian and sala 2002 instead of a real world drought second mowing was conducted at a height of 10 cm at the jena experiment however while in grassmind the height is explicitly simulated and therefore the mowing height can be defined as an input in lpjml this is not possible and the residual biomass after mowing is used as a proxy for mowing height since no data on residual biomass was available from the jena experiment we cannot evaluate whether the mowing simulated in the models is a realistic approximation of the mowing conducted at the jena experiment both models did not reproduce the variability of the observed soil water content see fig 5a and fig s2 1 which for lpjml is in line with a recent study on nitrogen emissions lutz et al 2020 however the importance of these discrepancies for the observed responses of agb and community composition remains unclear and we see the need for an in depth study of soil water dynamics especially considering that other recent studies suggest that the drought response is not well captured in terrestrial biosphere models bastos et al 2020 paschalis et al 2020 4 4 fields of model development our comparison highlighted fields to consider for future model development while the inclusion of other models of grassland dynamics was beyond the scope of our analysis grassmind and lpjml are representative of specific types of models see 1 3 for which comparable model representatives may show similar or additional challenges but also potential solutions when applied to the same research questions and settings as pointed out here the core of numerous models is the productivity in the form of photosynthesis the simplified farquhar photosynthesis model e g in lpjml farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 has a great depth of biochemical detail while the single leaf photosynthesis model e g in grassmind thornley and johnson 1990 uses a more aggregated calculation integrated over the individuals projected area taubert et al 2012 an even simpler approach just uses light use efficiency e g lingra schapendonk et al 1998 in all of these approaches water stress is considered by a reduction of productivity at optimal water supply by either a reduction factor grassmind lingra or an adjustment of the maximum carboxylation rate v m a x lpjml our study shows that both options simulate a response to drought however this is mediated by the interaction with the representation of soil water dynamics which can strongly impact onset duration and recovery time of the drought response additionally the current representation of photosynthesis is aggravating realistic simulations of rainfall exclusion experiments or droughts and future model development should include non stomatal limitation of photosynthesis e g reduced rubisco activity medrano et al 1997 parry et al 2002 during drought zhou et al 2013 furthermore in both models transpiration response to water stress is modelled linearly and transpiration reduction is overestimated for soil water levels close to field capacity experimental data however suggest a nonlinear relationship see verhoef and egea 2014 for a collection of experiments a variety of nonlinear approaches exist however since we did not test their suitability for the different model types we do not give a recommendation but refer to dewar 2002 egea et al 2011 and verhoef and egea 2014 for further reading competition was focused on space and light while below ground processes played a minor role so far only the distribution but not the amount of bgb is used for resource competition and trade offs between higher investments in agb or bgb cannot be represented this may be attributed to the original development for a temperate climate however this missing strategy trade off is one reason why the simulated drought had little impact on competition dynamics additionally drought response could be improved by systematically testing and incorporating drought escape kooyers 2015 norton et al 2016 and tolerance zwicke et al 2015 ratzmann et al 2019a b strategies in the existing model structures or implement hydraulic failure of severely stressed vegetation see e g kennedy et al 2019 sperry et al 2016 the hurley pasture model thornley 1997 1998 follows a resistance approach considering root mass root density and the resistance in the bulk soil thornley 1996 thornley and verberne 1989 that could be feasible for models using a light response function and can likely be adapted for a farquhar approach drought response is not only dependent on the soil hydrology models used but also depends on the models capacity to simulate specific strategies for i water use efficiency ii carbon allocation iii root distribution and iv regeneration of different species after drought van der molen et al 2011 while numerous approaches to improve soil hydrology exist vereecken et al 2019 2016 deckmyn et al 2020 the simulation of coexistence of multiple species and their specific strategies remains challenging see 4 2 to further improve the models and enable the simulation of stable coexistence and therefore plant species richness plant interaction models which were explicitly designed to assess biodiversity effects may serve as additional inspiration for model development a key limitation was the simulation of niche differences which are a necessary condition for stable coexistence in addition to the process improvements suggested above adding a hierarchy that determined resource access for each species and resources was shown to be a feasible approach clark et al 2018 to separate above and below ground niches the below ground space has to be distributed between species or individuals in addition to the above ground space in grassmind a refinement of the below ground geometry non uniform vertical root distribution per plant and hierarchically modelled resource access could be beneficial for lpjml the root biomass within each soil layer and a species specific lateral distribution could be combined to distribute below ground resources 5 conclusion recently empiricists as well as modellers have suggested biogeochemical models as a potential tool to complement empirical research to increase the knowledge on interacting responses of biotic and abiotic components of grasslands to changing environmental conditions and the underlying mechanisms wilcox et al 2020 van oijen et al 2020 currently approaches that prescribe the species share within the community based on environmental factors phenology and management exist confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 however these do not consider the underlying mechanisms explicitly to enable process based models to simulate differently diverse communities and quantitatively assess the effect of plant species richness substantial model development is needed we compared two grassland models that have been developed at different scales under different assumptions and for different purposes but which are representative of several other models despite the differences the models showed similar weaknesses already at low diversity levels monocultures and two species mixtures the models had difficulties to simulate a balanced community in the majority of our scenarios one species contributed almost the entire biomass of the mixture while this can partially be attributed to the study design a considerable part is related to the process representations in the models substantial improvement of these processes is needed to enable models to also simulate communities that are only weakly dominated by one species we identified several responsible processes and suggested potential solutions based on our findings and available literature additionally we found that the outcome of competition in the models was determined by the same processes independent of resource availability drought did barely affect species presence which shows that the representation of trade offs between different ecological strategies also needs improvement as lpjml and grassmind can be seen as typical representations for particular types of models this reveals potential pathways of model development to improve the interaction between species and drought response for similar models for other model types our study may serve as an example for a structured assessment of implemented processes that can be used to identify and address the key parts of the model hindering a more realistic representation of multi species communities or species interaction in a structured way in cases where empirical data is needed to improve the models

24538,biogeochemical models of vegetation dynamics could potentially be used to complement empirical studies on the effect of plant species richness a key precondition is the simulation of species coexistence while community scale models regularly incorporate respective processes models at the field or landscape scale used for larger scale assessments require additional model development however it is unclear how the particular process description within these models affects simulations of species performance and resulting ecosystem functions we compare simulations of two grassland models of different complexity for monocultures and two species mixtures in a grassland experiment in jena germany by providing an in depth analysis of the models process descriptions we evaluate their ability to simulate the response of different species their interactions and their joint performance to drought and mowing both models simulated similar average above ground biomass agb but showed different intra annual variability generally the models had difficulties representing a balanced species composition in multiple species mixtures and competition for space was the main driver of community composition in both models the resulting communities were dominated by the more competitive species while the weak competitor was only marginally present in most mixtures independent of drought and mowing the competitive strength which we derived from the calibrated parameter sets of the species differed between the models and the agreement on which species dominate specific mixtures was mixed while both models simulated reduced soil water content and above ground biomass in response to drought the strength and duration of these responses differed despite these differences simulated species interactions were barely affected and strong competitors remained dominant mowing had opposing effects on the competition for space in the models which could be attributed to the different representations of plants in the two models the models selected for the comparison are two representatives for local and large scale applications and use widely applied approaches for which our comparison highlighted strengths and weaknesses to enable the investigated models and those with similar complexity to simulate coexistence of multiple species niche differentiation needs to be improved this requires a stricter separation of access to different resources and improved representation of different ecological strategies for which community scale models that are able to simulate coexistence may be an inspiration our approach may serve as an example for other modellers looking for ways to identify important model processes for further model development in the context of

are openly available at https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 4720262 1 introduction grasslands are a key element of ruminant livestock production systems and provide multiple ecosystem services like carbon sequestration chang et al 2015 erosion control zhu et al 2015 and habitats for pollinators and other fauna dass et al 2018 tribot et al 2018 they strongly affect biogeochemical cycles at different scales moinet et al 2017 zhou et al 2017 and lately their carbon storage potential has been controversely discussed in the context of climate change mitigation e g lorenz and lal 2018 yang et al 2019 godde et al 2020 the functions and services provided by grasslands are strongly controlled by the prevailing environmental conditions but also by the specific management tilman et al 2012 the response of a grassland ecosystem to changes in these drivers was shown to be mediated by species richness and community composition vogel et al 2012 craven et al 2016 yin et al 2017 consequently a good understanding of the mechanisms driving grassland dynamics is essential to assess and project future productivity ecosystem services and functions under different stressors such as climate change van oijen et al 2020 1 1 drivers of grassland dynamics in this study we focus on the effect of two important drivers of grassland dynamics decreased water availability resulting from meteorological droughts which can result from climate change and biomass removal by mowing which is a common practice in livestock production 1 1 1 water water availability results from the local balance of inputs through precipitation and losses by transpiration evaporation seepage and runoff during drought precipitation is absent or below water requirements for a longer period either within one season or across multiple years a decrease in precipitation can suppress ecosystem photosynthesis soil respiration and carbon cycling wu et al 2011 beier et al 2012 as well as key soil processes emmett et al 2004 additionally an increase in inter rainfall intervals can lead to reduced net primary production flowering duration and soil co 2 flux in grasslands fay et al 2000 other severe impacts on grassland ecosystems include a rapid loss of biomass plant cover and even species weaver 1942 tilman and el haddi 1992 carroll et al 2021 in addition droughts were shown to influence community composition and diversity patterns of grasslands buckland et al 1997 knapp et al 2008 jung et al 2020 the response of an ecosystem to periods of drought depends on characteristics of the drought itself such as its duration its intensity and its frequency felton et al 2020 denton et al 2017 it also depends on the characteristics of the grassland community as grassland species have developed several strategies to resist and survive droughts blair et al 2014 reich 2014 while annual species often use an escape strategy by completing their life cycle outside the dry season kooyers 2015 norton et al 2016 perennial species use dehydration avoidance or tolerance as a strategy zwicke et al 2015 by regulating their leaf water potential ratzmann et al 2019a b dehydration avoidance is associated with an increase in water uptake or decrease of water losses while dehydration tolerance ensures plant survival by maintaining cell integrity of meristematic tissue ludlow 1989 volaire et al 2009 zwicke et al 2015 additionally species rich communities often better buffer adverse effects of droughts in the long run than low diverse communities as they allow for shifts in their composition towards potentially better adapted species isbell et al 2015 hoover et al 2018 but may also alter environmental conditions reducing drought stress of more vulnerable species wright et al 2021 species rich communities may also benefit from complementarity effects that arise from the use of soil water stored in different soil depths by opposing rooting strategies kulmatiski and beard 2013 guderle et al 2018 klaus et al 2016 1 1 2 mowing in addition to drought the frequent removal of above ground plant biomass through mowing or cutting also affects the composition of grassland communities as well as their productivity which in turn may affect the grassland s resilience to drought events the intensity of mowing is a result of the frequency of mowing and the applied cutting height while the prevailing pedoclimatic conditions restrict grassland productivity via temperature light water and nutrient constraints under similar conditions the highest grassland productivity has been found at intermediate mowing intensities whereas very low or high mowing intensities often decrease productivity hopkins 2000 weigelt et al 2009 at low mowing intensity competition for limiting resources such as water and nutrients drives the community dynamics and thus more competitive species dominate the community smart et al 2006 therefore the community is often shaped by fewer but larger plants compared to grasslands with higher mowing intensities in contrast in grasslands with a very high mowing intensity biomass is removed so frequently that fast growth and high stature traits associated with competitive species are not advantageous but lead to selective removal of these species instead yu et al 2015 yin et al 2017 the resulting community often consists of a high number of small plants this is accompanied by reduced shading and competition for nutrients and increased growth of less competitive species promoting species richness peltzer and wilson 2001 williams et al 2007 pecháčková et al 2010 1 2 plant species richness the grassland ecosystems responses to these two drivers water availability and mowing and the mechanisms involved as well as the role of plant species richness of grassland communities have been studied using field observations and experiments along a diversity gradient e g craven et al 2016 tilman et al 2014 despite the large number of experiments the mechanistic understanding of the processes regulating community responses to drought and mowing especially in species rich communities is still limited weisser et al 2017 while the patterns can be reproduced using mathematical models e g han et al 2019 to dissect the underlying processes of ecosystem dynamics biogeochemical models bgms have the potential to complement empirical studies as they can mechanistically analyse the interacting responses of biotic and abiotic components of grasslands to changing environmental conditions wilcox et al 2020 van oijen et al 2020 however this requires that two preconditions are met first the models need to represent all relevant processes that shape the community under specific environmental and management conditions reasonably well second the models need to represent different ecological strategies enabling the communities to adapt if prevailing conditions change however bgms have not yet been assessed sufficiently with respect to these two preconditions 1 3 biogeochemical models bgms of grasslands have been developed and applied to determine grassland dynamics since the end of the 1980s e g thornley and verberne 1989 coffin and lauenroth 1990 siehoff et al 2011 hunt et al 1991 schapendonk et al 1998 duru et al 2009 these models have been developed for applications at multiple scales and with different levels of represented process detail models at the community scale simulating individual plants with different traits have been used to study the effect of resource availability and disturbance regimes on the community and its member species e g may et al 2009 soussana et al 2012 at the plot or field scale individual based and other models distinguishing traits only between species or functional types have been used to assess productivity and yields for different environmental conditions and management e g taubert et al 2012 höglind et al 2016 at the continental or global scale dynamic global vegetation models have been developed to assess element cycling commonly using only a small number of functional types to simulate grassland ecosystems e g rolinski et al 2018 vuichard et al 2007 the level of detail and the number of resources that are considered for plant growth and competition vary not only with the spatial scale for which models have been developed but also between models applied at similar scales for an extensive review see taubert et al 2012 at the community scale models that simulate the effects of plant species richness and the interactions between species have been developed e g clark et al 2018 turnbull et al 2013 weiss et al 2014 the high detail of the plant interactions is achieved at the expense of detail in biogeochemical process descriptions we refer to these models as plant interaction models pim to distinguish them from bgms the latter still need substantial development to incorporate plant species richness and species interaction in order to enable these models to simulate differently diverse communities and quantitatively assess the effect of plant species richness important processes need to be identified and the appropriateness of potential alternative approaches has to be evaluated an in depth analysis of the interactions between two species can be used to identify the important processes doing such an analysis for model representatives which exemplify a type of model a number of models sharing similar approaches and comparing the performance of multiple model representatives may be used to identify the limitations of current model implementations as well as general knowledge gaps that can inform the next steps of model development the approach can also uncover similarities and differences regarding the strengths and weaknesses of specific approaches this knowledge can be used to inform on potential development options for the assessed models as well as other models of the same type 1 4 model intercomparison studies while comparison studies are more common for models of cereal crops e g asseng et al 2019 durand et al 2018 müller et al 2017 only comparably few studies for forage grasses have been published korhonen et al 2018 of these few grassland model intercomparison studies some have used a large model ensemble and cover multiple sites e g sándor et al 2017 2020 ehrhardt et al 2018 while they quantify and discuss the uncertainty within the ensemble a detailed analysis of the processes within each model is beyond their scope in contrast other studies have used a small number of models allowing for a more detailed analysis of model differences at one or multiple sites e g korhonen et al 2018 persson et al 2019 hurtado uria et al 2013 these studies are however limited to one specific species neglecting inter specific competition and differences between parametrizations obtained for multiple species which to our knowledge have only been assessed using pims crawford et al 2021 1 5 research question to expand on this for bgms of different scales and to assess the role of how processes are represented in different models we compared simulated grassland properties for two biogeochemical grassland models grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020a b lpjml schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 rolinski et al 2018 using different scenarios of water availability and management using simulations of monocultures and two species mixtures the grassmind model follows an individual based approach using fixed traits for each species and simulates photosynthesis using light response curves thornley and johnson 1990 while the lpjml model follows an average individual approach and simulates photosynthesis using an adapted farquhar approach haxeltine and prentice 1996 prentice et al 2000 using data from a long term biodiversity experiment weisser et al 2017 the jena experiment we first calibrated and evaluated the models for four species for observed climatic conditions and management subsequently we compared the models for scenarios with no moderate and extreme drought conditions in combination with and without mowing with this study we pursue the following objectives i identify the relevant processes to explain the main similarities and differences between the models outcomes for our scenarios ii assess the effects of mowing and drought in relation to calibrated parameters for the monocultures and the two species mixtures and explain the differences using the processes identified in i and iii discuss our findings from i and ii in the context of other modelling approaches 2 methods we used the vegetation models lpjml schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 rolinski et al 2018 see 2 1 1 and grassmind taubert et al 2012 2020a b see 2 1 2 for our comparison the models were first calibrated and evaluated for four monocultures and subsequently grassland dynamics were assessed for multiple scenarios of management and drought conditions for the monocultures as well as two species mixtures see 2 2 2 1 model description the grassmind and the lpjml models both simulate daily dynamics of grassland vegetation while lpjml is usually applied at large spatial scales for this study it is used as a point model simulating small plots with no further spatial distinction this plot level is the smallest spatial unit for which all dynamics represented in lpjml are simulated whereas in grassmind the smallest spatial units are the single plants which simulate the dynamics on 1 m 2 to represent the plot in both models at each daily timestep the amount of biomass gained by photosynthesis is calculated and allocated to the leaves and roots after subtracting losses from growth and maintenance respiration subsequently the biomass losses from mortality and turnover of biomass into the litter layer are determined the amount of new biomass gained depends on available space soil and climate conditions and management at optimal temperatures sufficiently available space to grow and under adequate radiation water and nitrogen supply higher photosynthesis rates can be achieved while suboptimal resource supply or high vegetation density limit photosynthesis and thus growth this can results in altered competition and community composition both models can account for management measures by irrigation and application of fertilizer can increase biomass gains biomass removal by mowing can be carried out at fixed dates reducing the tissue available for photosynthesis after the mowing event each model considers the environmental factors space not already occupied by vegetation temperature radiation water and nitrogen availability and simulates similar processes to describe biomass gains and losses fig 1 provides a condensed overview of the similarities and differences while a separate depiction is provided in fig si a 1 however the process implementations differ in specific aspects e g in lpjml overcrowding reduces the above ground biomass depending on the excess c o v e r while in grassmind the excess c o v e r determines the number of individuals killed which are then randomly selected si b table 1 while we use the term c o v e r for the comparison of the models throughout this paper it is defined differently in lpjml plant geometry is not simulated and cannot be used to calculate the c o v e r here c o v e r is the foliage projective cover f p c which is calculated from the leaf area index lai in grassmind where plant geometry is simulated c o v e r is calculated as the sum of the individual plants base area this is an important difference between the models and has to be kept in mind when reading sections 3 and 4 in addition a key difference of the models is the representation of the vegetation itself grassland communities consist of several taxonomic groups however only graminoids small and tall herbs are represented in the two models for each modelled species or functional type lpjml simulates one average individual with a given set of traits the dynamics of the average individual are then scaled up to the plot scale neglecting differences between individuals of the same species in contrast grassmind follows an individual based approach explicitly simulating multiple individuals of the same species that have the same set of traits but can differ in size e g plant height and base area both models distinguish the plant compartments leaves and roots but in grassmind leaf tissue is further divided into living and standing senescent tissue while in lpjml senescent tissue is directly added to the litter layer of the soil for a detailed description we refer to schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 and rolinski et al 2018 for the lpjml model and to taubert et al 2020a b and taubert et al 2012 for the grassmind model 2 1 1 lpjml lpjml is a process based bgm of the carbon water and nitrogen cycle developed mainly for global scale applications schaphoff et al 2018 von bloh et al 2018 and has been extended to simulate different grassland management routines rolinski et al 2018 however as the model simulates processes for representative points without an explicit reference to space it is also applicable at the plot scale e g ehrhardt et al 2018 lpjml is representative for several related models e g lpj guess smith et al 2001 lpjfit sakschewski et al 2015 or lpx prentice et al 2000 but also other dgvms e g jules clark et al 2011 or orchidee vuichard et al 2007 the model simulates the dynamics of an average individual of a species or a plant functional type pft with daily timesteps based on the following processes a establishment of new species and reproduction of present species b plant turnover c biomass accumulation based on gross primary production gpp and autotrophic respiration which is limited by environmental conditions and competition for resources between species direct biotic interactions are not simulated 2 1 1 1 photosynthesis lpjml simulates gpp based on a simplification of the farquhar approach in combination with a big leaf approach for which the optimum photosynthetic activity as a trade off between light energy and rubisco availability is derived numerically farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 collatz et al 1991 1992 prentice et al 2000 von bloh et al 2018 a crucial part of the photosynthesis is the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation fapar which is determined using a factor depending on snowcover a biome specific scaling factor and the pft s f p c which is defined as the fraction of ground area covered by a vertical projection of the vegetation s foliage and determines how much of the photosynthetically active radiation par can actually be intercepted by the canopy the f p c of each pft is calculated from the pft s specific lai and light extinction coefficient afterwards the realized f p c of each pft is weighted depending on lai and f p c of all other pfts present in the plot additionally limitations due to water and nitrogen stress are accounted for by comparing resource demand and supply 2 1 1 2 water and nitrogen stress lpjml simulates soil water dynamics in six distinct layers to which plants have access depending on their root distribution schaphoff et al 2018 here we focus on plant water demand supply and uptake to analyse the impacts these processes have on each pft and the entire community in the computation of gpp an estimated canopy conductance under unlimited water supply is used to calculate the atmospheric water demand following monteith 1995 even though plants share the same soil water supply on the plot plant available soil water is calculated separately for each pft depending on its maximum water transport capacity vertical root distribution and f p c if the atmospheric demand is not met canopy conductance is reduced in accordance to the water supply this reduced conductance rate is used to determine actual gpp a similar approach is applied for the nitrogen stress in which the plant available nitrogen supply is compared to the plant s demand in case the leaf nitrogen content is below a threshold the carboxylation capacity is reduced to match the actual nitrogen supply in the leaves since the carboxylation capacity is also used to determine water limitation the actual water demand is updated and gpp is updated to account for both water and nitrogen limitations see von bloh et al 2018 for a detailed description of the nitrogen cycle in lpjml 2 1 1 3 allocation establishment and mortality the assimilated carbon is distributed between leaves and roots considering the discrepancy between the actual and the aspired leaf to root ratio of carbon if the actual leaf to root ratio is larger than the aspired more leaf carbon than root carbon more carbon is allocated to the roots and the other way around under water limited conditions additional carbon is allocated to the roots subsequently the assimilated nitrogen is distributed considering the prescribed range of carbon to nitrogen ratios of leaves and roots if the allocation of nitrogen would exceed the lower limit of these ranges a part of the nitrogen is stored so it can be distributed at a later time if not enough nitrogen is available and the upper limit of the ranges would be exceeded leave and or root carbon is reduced and the excess added to the litter layer afterwards the f p c of all pfts is updated each day the model evaluates the present species and allows for establishment of new species if these can grow under simulated conditions for all species already present and newly established reproduction is calculated based on the equal distribution of available space the more space is available the more reproduction is possible if the total f p c exceeds 1 0 overcrowding mortality reduces the leaf biomass until the f p c is smaller 1 0 all these processes interact and lead to daily changes in the pfts carbon and nitrogen pools the process rates depend on a set of pft specific parameters that resemble plant functional traits it is possible to represent different strategies of particular species using observations of multiple functional traits or measurements from experiments that correspond to a subset of the parameters to calibrate the model a full model description is available in schaphoff et al 2018 and von bloh et al 2018 and the open source version of the model is available at https github com pik lpjml lpjml we use a consolidated version of lpjml5 von bloh et al 2018 extended to simulate daily establishment 2 1 2 grassmind grassmind is an individual and process based grassland model taubert et al 2012 2020a b where plant growth is based on the concept of light response curves that is also used in several other models e g seib dgvm sato et al 2007 the model simulates the daily dynamics of individual plants of different species or pfts at the plot scale e g 1 to 100 m 2 based on the following processes a recruitment and emergence of plant seedlings b plant senescence and mortality c growth of plants based on gpp and autotrophic respiration which can be d limited by environmental conditions or reduced due to competition between plants interactions between plants encompass competition for the resources light space water and nitrogen plant competition depends on plant size and species identity but does not account for the particular spatial locations of a plant gap approach fischer et al 2016 botkin et al 1972 köhler and huth 2004 shugart 1998 each plant species is described by a set of plant traits which determines its performance in the above mentioned processes and its growth form 2 1 2 1 photosynthesis grassmind first calculates a plant s potential gpp using the concept of light response curves thornley and johnson 1990 which is subsequently reduced to account for water nitrogen and temperature limitations the potential gpp is predominantly determined by the photosynthetically active radiation par that the plant receives which is comparable to fapar in lpjml in grassmind this depends on the lai and other factors such as shading by larger plants competition for light is modelled asymmetrically which means that larger plants receive more non attenuated light than smaller plants dependent on species specific traits some species can cope better with lower light levels than others large plants with large leaf area can reach their potential gpp limit as a result of self shading the response of potential gpp to air temperature is similar for all plants but reductions of potential gpp due to soil water deficits nitrogen stress or competition are dependent on species specific traits that control resource demand and supply 2 1 2 2 water and nitrogen stress water carbon and nitrogen dynamics are modelled in 20 equally large soil layers in grassmind using a daily version of the century soil model parton et al 1988 soil water stress is modelled using a linear reduction dependent on soil water content permanent wilting point and field capacity granier et al 1999 species specific differences in water uptake are a result of the water demand of plants using the concept of water use efficiency and their rooting depth in relation to the availability of water in different soil layers a similar approach is used for plant nitrogen stress based on the potential npp which is a balance between possibly limited gpp and autotrophic respiration modelled proportional to plant biomass the plant nitrogen demand is calculated using c n ratios of green and brown leaves and roots species specific model parameters again the potential npp of a plant is reduced linearly dependent on the ratio of nitrogen supply and demand leave senescence can add nitrogen resources to the supply via retranslocation from yellowing to still green leaves the actual gpp is calculated from the potential gpp by accounting for the limitations from temperature water and nitrogen stress using multiplicative factors subsequently the autotrophic respiration is accounted for to obtain the actual npp 2 1 2 3 allocation recruitment and mortality the actual npp is then distributed between shoots stems and leaves roots and reproductive biomass a species specific fraction is allocated to the shoots and the root biomass is updated dependent on this fraction and the shoot root ratio the remaining npp is allocated to the reproduction pool corresponding nitrogen fluxes are calculated according to the respective c n ratios the growth of plants based on an increased net productivity results in an increased plant biomass leaf area rooting depth and root branch length plant height and width dependent on species specific traits recruitment and mortality of plants determine in turn the density of plants on the simulated area recruitment can occur from three sources migration from a surrounding meta community as a constant inflow sowing of seeds at specific times and local reproduction of plants depending on their fitness plants of a higher fitness are able to invest more of their npp into reproduction and can produce more seeds in this study seed ingrowth from a meta community and local recruitment are summarized in one model parameter while seedlings can grow at any time and establish dependent on species traits e g germination rate plant mortality is modelled in terms of a background mortality and a crowding mortality the background mortality is constant but differs between seedlings and mature plants and independent of environmental conditions and overcrowding plants that have reached their expected maximum age die immediately if the total vegetation cover which is calculated based on all plant s width or lateral expansion exceeds an area size of one m 2 crowding mortality reduces the number of individual plants irrespective of size or plant age a full model description of grassmind can be found in taubert et al 2012 2020b and taubert et al 2020a and on www formind org downloads 2 2 site and scenario description both models were applied to plots of the jena experiment which is situated at the northern edge of jena thuringia germany on the floodplain of the saale river 50 55 n 11 35 e 130 m a s l weisser et al 2017 the annual mean temperature and mean annual precipitation between 1980 and 2010 were 9 9 c and 610 mm year respectively hoffmann et al 2014 and the soil is classified as eutric fluvisol roscher et al 2004 for our simulations we used gap filled daily weather data for temperature precipitation and shortwave radiation from 2002 to 2014 mpi 2019 taubert et al 2020a within this period annual precipitation ranged from 368 to 784 mm year with a mean of 526 mm year which is below the 1980 to 2010 average for the use in lpjml we had to normalize leap years 2004 2008 and 2012 to 365 days we chose to remove december 31st in leap years to maintain the seasonality within the years since data on harvest events were only available at monthly resolution weigelt et al 2010 we assumed harvests to occur in the middle of the month 15 t h data on soil bulk density field capacity and permanent wilting point were measured in four blocks set up along a soil texture gradient perpendicular to the river saale roscher et al 2004 in addition to the measurements we derived porosity from soil texture for our simulations we always used the data on soil properties from the block in which our selected species plots were located 2 2 1 species selection at the jena site several experiments were conducted in parallel we use data from two experiments the main experiment roscher et al 2004 which was designed to compare the different diversity levels and the monoculture experiment heisse et al 2007 which was established as a control for example to compare mixture and monoculture yields the species pool of the jena experiment consists of 64 species from four functional groups grasses small herbs tall herbs and legumes that grow well under the site conditions weisser et al 2017 monocultures of all 64 species were established in the monoculture experiment while in the main experiment monocultures of only 16 four from each functional group species were sown limiting the number of species available for our study we excluded the tall herb and legume species from our selection because we assumed the small herbs and grasses to be more suitable for usage in both models of the eight remaining species we excluded b perennis because the experimental plots were strongly affected by the rust fungi puccinia coronata and p graminis which led to a decrease in productivity and the abandonment of the plots in later years weisser et al 2017 to reduce the complexity of our comparison we selected only four of the remaining seven species for our simulations we selected three common fodder grasses poa pratensis festuca pratensis and festuca rubra and one very common small herb plantago lanceolata for all selected species data was available in the two experiments allowing us to use the data of the main experiment for the calibration while evaluating the models against the data from the monoculture experiments 2 2 2 calibration and evaluation for model calibration we used the data from the monoculture plots of the main experiment on above ground biomass agb leaf area index lai and vegetation cover for both models as well as vegetation height in addition for grassmind see 2 2 2 we evaluated the performance of both models by using data on agb from the monoculture experiment which consisted of small plots of monocultures of all species used in the main experiment heisse et al 2007 for both calibration and evaluation we used the daily weather data from 2002 to 2014 and the mowing frequency that was reported for the jena experiment where plots were mown twice a year usually in may and september plots of the main and the monoculture experiments were not fertilized therefore we did not add any fertilizer and excluded nitrogen deposition in our simulations the model specific calibration procedures as well as the parameters selected for calibration are described in si a the observed data sets used for the calibration and the evaluation both show a decrease of monoculture productivity over time marquard et al 2013 which results in substantially lower values of agb in the later years additionally for some agb observations the variability of data for one sampling period was large which was also found in other grassland experiments e g vuichard et al 2007 for lpjml a spinup run was conducted to obtain soil carbon nitrogen water and temperature values to initialize the calibration and evaluation simulations spinup conditions are described in si a 2 2 3 simulation scenarios as we were interested in the effects of drought and mowing on modelled processes and on the performance of species in monocultures and the two species mixtures we run three precipitation scenarios baseline moderate drought extreme drought each with and without mowing each scenario was run for 28 years for the first 14 years the baseline scenario was used in all scenarios as a spinup to obtain an equilibrium state of the plant community in grassmind the scenario simulations could be started right away while for lpjml they were based on the initial spinup run also used for calibration and evaluation for the baseline treatment we simply repeated these 14 years for our drought treatments we excluded parts of the rain see below in year 16 but returned to the baseline scenario for years 17 28 all evaluations refer to the years 15 to 28 of our simulations we first generated our baseline scenario in which we reduced the effects of intra annual rainfall variability that could otherwise mask the effects of droughts to obtain the baseline scenario baseline mow time series we grouped the data based on annual and spring precipitation sums into three clusters using euclidean distances and a ward clustering algorithm murtagh and legendre 2014 the hierarchical cluster analysis was performed with r version 3 5 3 using the hclust function from the stats package r core team 2019 we selected the cluster with the medium annual and spring precipitation which contained seven years for the moderate drought scenario modd mow we used the same time series but excluded precipitation in april and may of year 16 we extended the exclusion to march and june for the extreme drought extrd mow by this we reduced the annual precipitation by approximately 20 and 40 respectively we ran simulations for scenarios baseline mow modd mow and extrd mow with limited nitrogen supply and with mowing additionally we ran simulations with the same environmental conditions but without mowing baseline nomow modd nomow and extrd nomow 3 results we analysed model outputs on above ground biomass agb gpp npp lai losses litterfall and mortality c o v e r and water uptake we present the results for agb in the main text and for the other variables only for our baseline scenario baseline mow in the si in section 3 1 we briefly present the results of the calibration and model evaluation subsequently we analyse our results of agb dynamics for monocultures and mixtures for both models for our scenarios in section 3 2 3 1 model calibration and evaluation model calibration was successfully conducted for both models following the procedures described in si a overall both calibrated models reproduced the observed data from monocultures of the main experiment well for agb described as organic dry matter lai and for grassmind height but not for c o v e r agreement with the experimental data varied between the models and for different species fig si a 2 4 we were able to calibrate lpjml and represent four different species modifying only four parameters the parameter sets of the four species were derived during the calibration starting from the same initial parameter values for all species lpjml showed good agreement with data on lai rmse 0 53 to 1 18 m 2 m 2 and moderate agreement with agb observations rmse 46 4 to 245 8 gdm m 2 but data on c o v e r did not agree well rmse 0 24 to 0 59 m 2 m 2 simulated c o v e r values of monocultures in the calibration of lpjml were low compared to observations in lpjml plant size is not explicitly simulated and c o v e r is calculated as foliage projected cover fpc from the lai assuming a strong connection of the two see 2 1 1 using both lai and c o v e r in the calibration results in a trade off in favour of the one that leads to better results for agb furthermore since observed c o v e r was estimated visually we assume lai observations to be more reliable and attribute only minor importance to the fit of c o v e r for lpjml the calibration of grassmind for the four monocultures required the fit of 13 species specific parameters and also included the vegetation height in addition to the observed lai c o v e r and agb good agreement of grassmind was achieved for lai rmse 0 47 to 0 71 m 2 m 2 as well as for vegetation height rmse 0 083 to 0 218 m and agb results agreed moderately with observations rmse 34 0 to 236 6 gdm m 2 as in lpjml grassmind simulations did not agree well with the observed data on c o v e r rmse 0 22 to 0 46 m 2 m 2 but in contrast to lpjml grassmind overestimated vegetation cover in the simulation of grassmind vegetation cover is derived from individual plant sizes and allowed to settle around 100 for the model calibration observed vegetation cover excluding weeds and dead material is therefore compared only with the cover of green leaves of the simulated plants excluding standing senescent leaves note that the calibration here differs from previous calibrations of grassmind taubert et al 2020a to harmonize the study design and simplify the comparison of the two models see si a for a detailed description of the calibration procedure 3 1 1 deviations from observations although agb values agreed only moderately with the observations the agreement with the majority of the data is significantly better because a major share lpjml 51 to 81 and grassmind 57 to 87 of the sum of square errors se can be attributed to only two of the twelve observation dates for each species fig si a 5 7 the observations can be partitioned into high agb and low agb observations for all the plots we used high agb observations were sampled in the early years 2002 to 2004 of the experiment while observations from the later years showed substantially lower agb because of a decrease in productivity marquard et al 2013 a large share of the sum of ses is related to the high agb observations in the early years this high productivity at the beginning of the experiment cannot be reproduced by either model this may be a results of the uncertain initial soil conditions e g soil fertility because of the unknown management history prior to the experiment in jena but may also be related to the obtained parameterizations for both models selected parameter values are static and cannot change over time therefore as long as the environmental conditions and management remain similar the models do not simulate any temporal trends to adequately simulate the high agb levels in the early years of the experiment a different set of parameter values would be needed however since the majority of the data consists of low agb samples collected after the decrease in productivity the calibration procedure returns a set of parameter values which reproduce this subset of the observations well we were able to confirm this with our evaluation fig 2 where we used the agb observations from the monoculture experiments heisse et al 2007 here the rmses of both models were very similar e g 81 7 gdm m 2 for lpjml and 77 8 gdm m 2 for grassmind for p pratensis the data from the monoculture experiment show the same productivity decrease as the main experiment and similar to the calibration a major share of the se 55 and 82 can be attributed to only two observations fig si a 8 3 2 aboveground biomass dynamics and resource competition in our comparison we focus on the differences and similarities in the agb dynamics of both models for the different scenarios we ordered the description of the results so that differences in climatic conditions and management to the baseline scenario increase step by step first we present results for our baseline scenario baseline mow see 3 2 1 which while already using climate data with reduced variability see 2 2 3 is not subject to additional precipitation reduction and uses the standard management as also used in the calibration and evaluation second we compare the result from baseline mow to the drought scenarios modd mow and extrd mow see 3 2 2 in which precipitation reductions are prescribed third we compare baseline mow modd mow and extrd mow to the scenarios without mowing baseline nomow modd nomow and extrd nomow see 3 2 3 3 2 1 simulated dynamics in the baseline scenario with mowing the monoculture simulation experiments under the baseline rainfall treatment with mowing fig 3 a d show similar overall means in agb in both models agb values are highest for f rubra lpjml 126 gdm m 2 and grassmind 106 gdm m 2 and lowest for p pratensis lpjml 41 gdm m 2 and p lanceolata grassmind 36 gdm m 2 however the intra annual dynamics indicate strong differences between lpjml and grassmind the variation of agb between seasons is much more pronounced for grassmind than for lpjml with lower agb in winter but for most species higher agb during the summer months this is connected to the different process implementations in both models that are used to derive npp from gpp and autotrophic respiration and agb losses in the form of turnover and mortality see 2 1 and 4 1 for the two species mixture experiments fig 3 e j the agb dynamics are driven by the dominant species the dominant species can either be the same fig 3 e g with similar differences in mean values as in the monocultures or different fig 3 h j with larger discrepancies in mean values in addition to npp and agb loss from turnover and mortality competition between species affects the agb dynamics while these processes are sufficient to explain the off season agb dynamics the additional reduction from mowing has to be considered for the dynamics within the growing season the effect of mowing strongly differs between the two models fig 3a j and is the underlying reason for the different agb peaks during the growing season in lpjml 47 6 to 207 0 gdm m 2 is on average removed by mowing this amount is significantly smaller in grassmind 1 4 to 31 3 gdm m 2 the large differences in biomass reduction are related to the different implementations of the mowing routines and the representation of the plants themselves in both models the dominant species exploit available resources more efficiently which is related to the parameterization of the species higher parameter values for important traits are directly related to a higher competitive strength fig 4 in lpjml this is related to the calibrated parameters via specific processes while all parameters fig 4 are important to calibrate the simulated agb to the observations the leaf to root ratio l r and stubble density ρ v e g are of minor importance for competition here the light extinction coefficient k b e e r and the specific leaf area s l a which are used to calculate f p c are most important higher values of these two parameters result in higher f p c values and the species utilize space more effectively k b e e r is highest for the most competitive species f rubra and lowest for the least competitive species p pratensis s l a is less important and only influences competitive strength for species with similar k b e e r values f pratensis and p lanceolata in grassmind benefits of a species in the fast and successful establishment of seedlings high germination rate g e r m short time of emergence t e m and low seedling mortality m s e e d also determine the competitive strength of that species in mixtures as for p lanceolata in this case the larger mature plant mortality m b a s i c weighs less than the favourably low seedling mortality m s e e d because plants mature later higher a g e r e p highly productive species higher maximum gross leaf photosynthesis p m a x higher s l a higher shoot root ratio s r can be more competitive in mixtures which however can be altered by self shading high height width ratio h w or shading by other plants low h w by fast leaf senescence low l l s or waterstress related attributes the latter are of specific importance as we show in section 3 2 2 while water use efficiency w u e and allocation rate of net productivity to shoot biomass a l l o c s h o o t are only of minor importance as for p pratensis 3 2 2 effects of rainfall reduction in both models the agb decreased during the drought treatments with mowing fig 5d and si d 1 5d overall effects were qualitatively the same for both the moderate and the extreme drought and just differed in their order of magnitude for both models we compared the lowest agb values during the drought fig 5e and si d 1 5e i e the maximum difference between the baseline and the drought scenarios for both models while the smallest differences between the baseline and drought scenarios are similar between the two models during the moderate and the extreme drought lpjml 13 9 and 23 1 gdm m 2 grassmind 11 5 and 12 0 gdm m 2 in grassmind the largest differences are more extensive 130 5 and 170 7 gdm m 2 than in lpjml 77 2 and 110 5 gdm m 2 the decrease of agb under drought is a result of the reduced water uptake fig 5e and si d 1 5e after soil water resources in the first 20 cm of the soil are depleted this depletion of soil water content is stronger in grassmind 20 fig 5b and si d 1 5b here the permanent wilting point is reached and no water is available for transpiration leading to no plant growth i e gpp at all and a fast decline of agb caused by continued mortality and turnover in lpjml the soil water depletion is less severe 13 to 14 but the reduced water supply also limits gpp the balance of the reduced gpp the respiration which is not affected by the drought and turnover becomes negative and agb decreases compared to grassmind this results in a smaller and slower decline of agb after the end of the drought treatment soil water resources are replenished in both drought scenarios a similar soil water content compared to the baseline scenarios is reached shortly after the end of the drought fig 5b and si d 1 5b however in all scenarios the soil water content remains below field capacity because of the low july precipitation which results in additional water stress fig 5c and si d 1 5c after the end of the treatment vegetation recovers at different speed in both models in grassmind the recovery is fast and the agb reaches a pre treatment level soon after the soil water is replenished fig 5d and si d 1 5d in lpjml recovery is slower and agb two years after the treatment can still be substantially lower than the pre treatment agb after a complete recovery the agb of the scenarios with rainfall reduction treatments and the baseline scenario are the same because of identical environmental and management conditions in lpjml all simulated species suffer from the drought and only start recovering after the end of the drought in grassmind this is similar except for p lanceolata which after a short period of agb losses already gains biomass i e positive gpp during the drought this is the only deep rooting species with higher values of the parameters of the rooting depth power law relationship r d 1 and r d 2 these ensure a good species performance and competition even during the precipitation reduction were p lanceolata takes advantage of water in deeper soil layers fig si d 1 3 and 4 and benefits from the reduced crowding mortality 3 2 3 comparison of mowing effects mowing has very different effects in the two models in the monoculture and mixture simulations for the baseline scenario fig 6a and si e 1 5a in grassmind mean agb values are barely higher in the baseline scenario without mowing than with mowing 1 5 to 4 5 gdm m 2 while in lpjml these are considerably larger 90 6 to 210 7 gdm m 2 as established in section 3 2 1 mowing plays an important role for agb dynamics in grassmind the amount of biomass reduced is not pre determined but linked to the plant height structure of the community i e frequency of large and small plants because only a few individuals exceed the mowing height here 0 1 m the reductions from mowing are small in contrast in lpjml vegetation height is not simulated and mowing directly reduces agb to a predefined threshold the effect of mowing on mean agb also alters the effect of the moderate and extreme precipitation reduction increasing the differences between the models fig 6b c and si e 1 5 b c losses during the reduction treatment are similar to those in the scenarios with mowing in grassmind 7 2 to 160 1 gdm m 2 but strongly increase in lpjml 70 8 to 156 5 gdm m 2 because the generally higher agb leads to higher turnover and respiration fig si c 11 as in the scenarios with mowing community composition was barely affected in the scenarios without mowing regardless of the precipitation reduction treatment fig si c 6 14 15 4 discussion differences in simulated responses of monocultures and two species mixtures to drought and mowing can be related to process representations of above and below ground resource competition as well as of water dynamics and community representation even though we could not test the relevance of individual processes the differences between model results and implemented features can shed some light on the importance of different mechanisms and model features for simulated dynamics 4 1 above ground biomass seasonality the two models show substantially different intra annual agb dynamics for which we identified several underlying mechanisms strongest differences were found during the off season where no data is available from the jena experiment for calibration or evaluation of the models suggesting that the calibration process helped to reduce differences between models 4 1 1 processes determining agb our simulations show that gpp and npp have higher average and peak values for grassmind fig si c 1 2 gains in biomass are resulting from npp which is dependent on gpp both are controlled by lai and c o v e r which also show higher average and peak values for grassmind fig si c 3 4 and together with the amount of absorbed radiation determine the rate of photosynthesis here the models use different process realizations in grassmind vegetation height and lai of each individual determine its gpp from which respiration losses are subtracted to obtain npp in lpjml c o v e r calculated as f p c using lai is used to determine the amount of absorbed radiation and resulting gpp similar to grassmind autotrophic respiration is subtracted to obtain npp both models account for the effect of shading differently grassmind directly via interactions between individuals and lpjml indirectly within the calculation of c o v e r while the high lai values for grassmind result in high productivity the lower lai values for lpjml lead to low c o v e r values and lower productivity the higher productivity of grassmind can only lead to the similar average value of agb we observed for the two models if it is counteracted by higher losses these result from age and overcrowding related mortality and turnover as well as mowing during the growing season fig si c 5 turnover and in the case of grassmind also age mortality constantly contribute to these losses independent of environmental conditions and management but with different magnitudes in both models losses from overcrowding are linked to total plant c o v e r and describe competition for space which can lead to decreased establishment and increased mortality in both models in grassmind c o v e r includes alive and standing senescent biomass here available space is always fully occupied leading to a constant loss of biomass from overcrowding this loss arises from the number of individuals that die from overcrowding which is dependent on the number of individuals present and the total c o v e r of the plot tab si b 1 in grassmind competition for space occurs between conspecifics individuals of the same species and heterospecifics individuals of different species and is therefore also effective in monocultures whereas in lpjml competition for space occurs only between different species so that losses due to overcrowding do not occur in monocultures and observed losses result from turnover fig si c 4 a d 4 1 2 agb dynamics outside and during the growing season the higher winter agb in lpjml compared to grassmind originates in the model specific representation of the leaves in both models agb is the entire amount of standing biomass in lpjml a distinction between photosynthetically active green and already senescent leaves yellow is not made but a constant proportion of the total leaf biomass is transferred to the litter pools each day of the year in grassmind such a distinction is made but yellow agb is constantly transferred to the litter so that agb consists predominantly of green leaf biomass this results in a larger reduction of the agb during the off season therefore agb shows high values during the growing season but low values during the off season in grassmind while in lpjml despite similar gpp and npp agb values are higher these differences are sufficient to explain the off season deviations between the models where biomass losses from overcrowding lead to the lower agb of grassmind however to fully explain the differences within the growing season the additional reduction of agb from mowing has to be considered the effect of mowing strongly differs between the two models fig 3a j in grassmind the vegetative height of the individuals is explicitly simulated and during mowing events only larger individuals are reduced because the simulated height distribution of the community is often skewed towards smaller individuals biomass reductions are small in lpjml height is not simulated explicitly and the amount of extracted biomass is determined as the difference between total agb and a predefined residual biomass this results in the different agb during the peak growing season we are aware that monocultures and two species mixtures are not representative for the diversity of grassland communities and are thus difficult to compare to observations from other grassland ecosystems nevertheless empirical studies that support both types of agb seasonality exist agb dynamics of lpjml are comparable to observations of total agb e g poyda et al 2020 while the dynamics in grassmind are similar to observations of green agb e g inoue et al 2015 4 1 3 processes controlling drought response the comparison to the scenarios with a moderate and extreme drought showed an effect of the drought on agb during and after although water became limiting during the drought competition for space remained strong and the community compositions of the two species mixtures were barely affected in none of the mixtures the subordinate species gained a substantial advantage in either of the models fig si c 12 13 both the moderate and the extreme drought lead to short term reductions of agb followed by a full recovery the drought effect was stronger in grassmind where water uptake is only limited by the available soil water if this falls below a threshold water stress occurs regardless of plant water demand which in reality might still be fulfilled even under a reduced water supply on the contrary in lpjml plant water demand is calculated depending on the potential canopy conductance which is derived from the productivity of the agb and compared to the supply therefore even if the soil water content is low especially species with a low agb may not suffer from water stress even under a reduced soil water content the water stress during the drought directly inhibited growth of new biomass however the losses depicted in section 4 1 1 are only indirectly affected by the environmental conditions through the reduced amount of available biomass or covered area and remain substantial fig si c 16 18 this changes the balance between biomass gains and losses and leads to an overall decline of above ground biomass in grassmind the drought affects the community structure which consists of different individuals leading to different productivity and mortality patterns compared to the baseline scenario in contrast in lpjml the average individuals adjust to the changing conditions and become similar to the baseline scenario after a full recovery 4 1 4 recovery after drought while recovery from drought in grassmind was fast it took up to two years in lpjml drought recovery depends on a number of factors and evidence from observational studies exists supporting the fast recovery e g hofer et al 2016 as well as the slow recovery e g sala et al 2012 however the different model responses to similar conditions suggest drought recovery is not well captured by the models and additional research is needed for this we provide some insight on the mechanisms implemented in both models in grassmind the fast recovery is possible firstly because water stress is only dependent on supply as soon as the soil water supply is replenished while the demand is still lower than before the drought the water stress penalty is removed which allows optimal growth of newly established seedlings secondly plants in grassmind do not change or adapt specific traits in response to drought events like the allocation of npp to above or below ground biomass or the water use efficiency in lpjml recovery takes longer because of two reasons first the loss of vegetation during drought reduces the water demand and limits productivity even after soil water is replenished second water stress triggers an increased resource allocation to the roots i e below ground biomass bgb which is not reversed instantaneously when carbon assimilation or vegetation carbon is low the additional allocation to bgb during and shortly after the drought results in a lower agb implying also reductions of f p c as f p c is used as an estimate of the covered part of the plot and therefore controls the access to resources the calculation of plant available water is reduced to the covered share of the plot 4 2 species interaction and community assembly we identified competition for space as the main driver of species interactions in both models see 4 1 despite the differences in agb the competition for space shows a weak seasonality in both models in lpjml this depends on the lai which shows a weak seasonality and therefore the competition for space is similar within and outside the growing season in grassmind the agb and lai seasonality are more pronounced but both have no effect on the competition for space which is determined from the c o v e r this is high within and outside the growing season and so is competition for space coexistence between species without one species being strongly dominant occurred in grassmind and lpjml only in rare cases of mixtures when species showed similar competitiveness stable coexistence has to be achieved to assess the effects of plant species richness because it is a precondition for long term maintenance of diversity turnbull et al 2013 to achieve this fitness as well as niche differences have to be simulated appropriately chesson 2000 and process representations need to be improved for grassmind additional insights on community dynamics could be gained through the extraction of density dependence functions of the different species mixtures han et al 2019 however for lpjml the density dependence functions would always be constant because only one average individual is simulated to represent an entire species therefore we did not pursue this further but instead focused on identifying key processes by assessing the role of specific parameters 4 2 1 and responses to changes in environmental or management conditions 4 2 2 4 2 1 the role of specific model parameters in both models the species that grow fast higher sla and intercept light more efficiently higher k b e e r are more competitive these two parameters have a strong influence on simulation results which is in line with findings from sensitivity analyses see si a and forkel et al 2019 zaehle et al 2005 taubert et al 2020b hetzer et al 2021 schmid et al 2021 even though the different shoot root ratios between species lead to different overall root carbon competition for below ground resources does not play a major role however in lpjml only the assumed species specific vertical distribution of roots and in grassmind the maximum rooting depth are considered for water uptake neglecting the horizontal branching of root networks in lpjml the vertical root distributions are similar for the simulated species as is the maximum rooting depth in grassmind except for p lanceolata which had access to deeper soil layers than the other species nevertheless competition for space outweighed that for below ground resources 4 2 2 the effect of drought and mowing on competition a moderate or extreme drought leads to major reductions in biomass but does not or only barely change the interaction between the species in neither model root biomass is considered for the calculation of water supply instead lpjml determines the access to soil layers based on the vertical root distribution and uses c o v e r to distribute available water between species grassmind determines access depending on rooting depth assuming roots are equally distributed among accessed layers and uses potential gpp to calculate the individual plants water demand which is reduced by a multiplicative factor under water stress to determine uptake this underpins that competition is driven by above ground processes and emphasizes the necessity to focus future model development on below ground plant organs and processes this may be a challenging task since knowledge on root traits below ground processes and driving forces are distinctively harder to obtain from field experiments and observations polomski and kuhn 2002 delory et al 2017 recent efforts to build a global database for root traits guerrero ramírez et al 2021 may help to better inform parameterization of root distributions and access to soil resources comparing the scenarios with and without mowing revealed not only substantial differences in the effect of mowing on agb but controversially showed that mowing affects competition for space differently for both models in lpjml mowing increases the competition for space this is best illustrated using the mixture of p lanceolata and f pratensis here stable coexistence of two species emerges in the scenarios without mowing but f pratensis dominates in the mown scenarios in lpjml these two species have similar competitive strength see 3 2 1 following this we hypothesize that mowing increases competitive pressure in lpjml and the stronger competitor is dominant even at small differences between two species mowing in lpjml reduces the agb to a species specific residual however this residual is scaled with the species f p c to constrain the total residual biomass of the community when the species have similar agb they constitute a similar f p c and the species with the higher species specific residual ρ v e g has an advantage in the scenario with mowing but not in the scenario without mowing if the competitive strength of the two species differs the dominant species with the higher f p c always has an advantage in grassmind on the other hand competition for space is stronger in the scenarios without mowing because mowing shifts the individuals height to width relationship which leads to increased investments into height growth after a mowing event and a reduced investment into area growth and competition for space between conspecifics and heterospecifics without mowing the individuals can continuously invest more of their productivity into expansion leading to an increased competition for space and overcrowding mortality while we did not observe any changes in community composition in our simulations these can occur if the species have different geometrical properties for example a species producing smaller and wider individuals would outcompete a species producing tall and thin individuals in the scenario with mowing and vice versa in the scenario without mowing 4 3 limitations our model comparison focused on differences and similarities of two grassland models to compare the models we developed a calibration setup using only observation data from monocultures the rare emergence of coexistence between two species in grassmind simulations results from this constraint to monoculture observations included in the calibration and the fixed non adaptive behaviour of plant traits results from a recent study with grassmind taubert et al 2020b showed coexistence of p pratensis and p lanceolata similar to observations calibrating on observational data of monocultures and mixed patches in contrast we only used monoculture data for calibration as plant traits in grassmind are fixed and do not change in response to species interactions the calibration of this study captures predominantly intra specific plant interactions rather than inter specific interactions further we here prescribed similar seed recruitment rates for the analysed monocultures and mixtures which already changes the competitive strength of some species in contrast to taubert et al 2020b the better reproduction of coexistence of species in taubert et al 2020b in comparison to our setup suggests that calibration should be done against data that include inter species interactions which may otherwise be lost in the simulations the more balanced species composition in grassmind may emerge because the individual based approach and the explicit simulations of plant geometry generally allows a broader representation of different ecological strategies competition for space between conspecifics and heterospecifics is simulated depending on the geometry while competition for other resources is more dependent on functional traits in lpjml plant geometry is not simulated and the f p c is extensively used not only in the competition for space but also for other resources such as light and water this contains the assumption that an investment in increased agb leading to an increased f p c will improve both above and below ground resource exploitation similarly while investments in bgb do not yield any advantage this assumption may be valid for productive habitats where only radiation but not below ground resources are limiting and increased investment in bgb has no advantages in these habitats species following a competitive strategy with a fast exploitation of available resources are dominant in other habitats e g where below ground resources are limited a mix of species following different ecological strategies may emerge however controlling the resource exploitation for multiple resources using the same traits precludes the trade offs between different strategies and leads to the dominance of competitive species in all habitats here different resource exploitation strategies and the trade off between resource exploitation and stress tolerance have to be considered the data available from observations additionally limited the calibration setup see 3 1 only two observations per year both within the growing season were available and therefore the seasonality cannot be inferred from the data data for all monocultures show a strong decrease in soil fertility and agb a few years after the start of the experiment weisser et al 2017 this decrease cannot be captured by the models which only capture the low values well additional limitations were introduced by our scenarios first the simulated drought does not consider changes in radiation humidity wind speed and temperature which covary wilhite 2000 mishra and singh 2010 and is therefore comparable to a rainfall exclusion experiment reynolds et al 1999 yahdjian and sala 2002 instead of a real world drought second mowing was conducted at a height of 10 cm at the jena experiment however while in grassmind the height is explicitly simulated and therefore the mowing height can be defined as an input in lpjml this is not possible and the residual biomass after mowing is used as a proxy for mowing height since no data on residual biomass was available from the jena experiment we cannot evaluate whether the mowing simulated in the models is a realistic approximation of the mowing conducted at the jena experiment both models did not reproduce the variability of the observed soil water content see fig 5a and fig s2 1 which for lpjml is in line with a recent study on nitrogen emissions lutz et al 2020 however the importance of these discrepancies for the observed responses of agb and community composition remains unclear and we see the need for an in depth study of soil water dynamics especially considering that other recent studies suggest that the drought response is not well captured in terrestrial biosphere models bastos et al 2020 paschalis et al 2020 4 4 fields of model development our comparison highlighted fields to consider for future model development while the inclusion of other models of grassland dynamics was beyond the scope of our analysis grassmind and lpjml are representative of specific types of models see 1 3 for which comparable model representatives may show similar or additional challenges but also potential solutions when applied to the same research questions and settings as pointed out here the core of numerous models is the productivity in the form of photosynthesis the simplified farquhar photosynthesis model e g in lpjml farquhar and von caemmerer 1982 has a great depth of biochemical detail while the single leaf photosynthesis model e g in grassmind thornley and johnson 1990 uses a more aggregated calculation integrated over the individuals projected area taubert et al 2012 an even simpler approach just uses light use efficiency e g lingra schapendonk et al 1998 in all of these approaches water stress is considered by a reduction of productivity at optimal water supply by either a reduction factor grassmind lingra or an adjustment of the maximum carboxylation rate v m a x lpjml our study shows that both options simulate a response to drought however this is mediated by the interaction with the representation of soil water dynamics which can strongly impact onset duration and recovery time of the drought response additionally the current representation of photosynthesis is aggravating realistic simulations of rainfall exclusion experiments or droughts and future model development should include non stomatal limitation of photosynthesis e g reduced rubisco activity medrano et al 1997 parry et al 2002 during drought zhou et al 2013 furthermore in both models transpiration response to water stress is modelled linearly and transpiration reduction is overestimated for soil water levels close to field capacity experimental data however suggest a nonlinear relationship see verhoef and egea 2014 for a collection of experiments a variety of nonlinear approaches exist however since we did not test their suitability for the different model types we do not give a recommendation but refer to dewar 2002 egea et al 2011 and verhoef and egea 2014 for further reading competition was focused on space and light while below ground processes played a minor role so far only the distribution but not the amount of bgb is used for resource competition and trade offs between higher investments in agb or bgb cannot be represented this may be attributed to the original development for a temperate climate however this missing strategy trade off is one reason why the simulated drought had little impact on competition dynamics additionally drought response could be improved by systematically testing and incorporating drought escape kooyers 2015 norton et al 2016 and tolerance zwicke et al 2015 ratzmann et al 2019a b strategies in the existing model structures or implement hydraulic failure of severely stressed vegetation see e g kennedy et al 2019 sperry et al 2016 the hurley pasture model thornley 1997 1998 follows a resistance approach considering root mass root density and the resistance in the bulk soil thornley 1996 thornley and verberne 1989 that could be feasible for models using a light response function and can likely be adapted for a farquhar approach drought response is not only dependent on the soil hydrology models used but also depends on the models capacity to simulate specific strategies for i water use efficiency ii carbon allocation iii root distribution and iv regeneration of different species after drought van der molen et al 2011 while numerous approaches to improve soil hydrology exist vereecken et al 2019 2016 deckmyn et al 2020 the simulation of coexistence of multiple species and their specific strategies remains challenging see 4 2 to further improve the models and enable the simulation of stable coexistence and therefore plant species richness plant interaction models which were explicitly designed to assess biodiversity effects may serve as additional inspiration for model development a key limitation was the simulation of niche differences which are a necessary condition for stable coexistence in addition to the process improvements suggested above adding a hierarchy that determined resource access for each species and resources was shown to be a feasible approach clark et al 2018 to separate above and below ground niches the below ground space has to be distributed between species or individuals in addition to the above ground space in grassmind a refinement of the below ground geometry non uniform vertical root distribution per plant and hierarchically modelled resource access could be beneficial for lpjml the root biomass within each soil layer and a species specific lateral distribution could be combined to distribute below ground resources 5 conclusion recently empiricists as well as modellers have suggested biogeochemical models as a potential tool to complement empirical research to increase the knowledge on interacting responses of biotic and abiotic components of grasslands to changing environmental conditions and the underlying mechanisms wilcox et al 2020 van oijen et al 2020 currently approaches that prescribe the species share within the community based on environmental factors phenology and management exist confalonieri 2014 movedi et al 2019 however these do not consider the underlying mechanisms explicitly to enable process based models to simulate differently diverse communities and quantitatively assess the effect of plant species richness substantial model development is needed we compared two grassland models that have been developed at different scales under different assumptions and for different purposes but which are representative of several other models despite the differences the models showed similar weaknesses already at low diversity levels monocultures and two species mixtures the models had difficulties to simulate a balanced community in the majority of our scenarios one species contributed almost the entire biomass of the mixture while this can partially be attributed to the study design a considerable part is related to the process representations in the models substantial improvement of these processes is needed to enable models to also simulate communities that are only weakly dominated by one species we identified several responsible processes and suggested potential solutions based on our findings and available literature additionally we found that the outcome of competition in the models was determined by the same processes independent of resource availability drought did barely affect species presence which shows that the representation of trade offs between different ecological strategies also needs improvement as lpjml and grassmind can be seen as typical representations for particular types of models this reveals potential pathways of model development to improve the interaction between species and drought response for similar models for other model types our study may serve as an example for a structured assessment of implemented processes that can be used to identify and address the key parts of the model hindering a more realistic representation of multi species communities or species interaction in a structured way in cases where empirical data is needed to improve the models

24539,tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species yet the relationship between traits and emergent long term growth patterns is poorly understood here we present a novel 3d forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits individual trees are simulated as 3d functional structural tree models fstms considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light driven carbon assimilation respiration and mortality rates applying principles of the pipe model theory these leaf scale processes are coupled with within tree carbon allocation i e 3d tree growth emerges from low level processes by integrating these fstms into a dynamic forest stand model we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities for model calibration and validation we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern oriented modelling framework at the tree level the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees as well as their size dependent growth rate and shade tolerance trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast growing short lived and shade intolerant to slow growing long lived and shade tolerant trees these emerging patterns resemble well known functional tree types indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long term growth patterns at the forest level a large number of patterns taken from lowland neotropical forests were reproduced indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level and facilitates the development of next generation forest models for species rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits keywords functional structural tree model individual based model leaf economics spectrum tropical forest pipe model theory 3d forest stand model 1 introduction tropical forests provide multiple social ecological and economical services represent the most diverse terrestrial ecosystem and play an important role in the global carbon cycle hassan et al 2005 heywood and watson 1995 malhi and grace 2000 in addition to high tree diversity there are even more plant and animal species that directly or indirectly depend on the resources and habitat provided by trees erwin 1988 nakamura et al 2017 almost 9 of all vascular plant species for instance live as epiphytes on trees predominantly in subtropical or tropical regions zotz et al 2021 ongoing deforestation and potential adverse effects of climate change thus pose a threat to all species associated with tropical forests wright 2005 to assess the impact of a changing environment on tropical biodiversity we thus need a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of these forests e g how they will respond to those changes and how associated species respond to changing forest dynamics a variety of dynamic models are available to predict future changes of tropical forests and to analyze the functioning of these ecosystems these models differ considerably in the level of detail and in temporal and spatial resolution among these models dynamic global vegetation models focus on large scale predictions of vegetation dynamics and carbon cycles but commonly use simplistic forest structures e g cramer et al 2001 purves and pacala 2008 at small to medium scales 1 ha to 100 km2 forest gap models and forest landscape models simulate forest dynamics and tree species composition bugmann 2001 petter et al 2020 such models represent forest structure in more detail by including stems and crowns of individual trees or cohorts allowing simulations of within canopy light attenuation and competition among different species or functional types of trees fischer et al 2016 köhler and huth 1998 even finer structural details can be simulated by functional structural tree models fstms in which trees are represented in 3d space by interconnected structural and functional units such as branches leaves or reproductive organs godin and sinoquet 2005 sievänen et al 2014 these virtual trees explicitly integrate complex mechanistic interactions between tree architecture and physiological processes for instance light dependent within tree carbon acquisition and allocation at the meristem level in growing trees fourcaud et al 2008 sterck et al 2005 fstms are therefore suitable tools to study structural tree growth as an emergent property of lower level ecophysiological processes furthermore integrating fstms into forest stand models can improve our understanding of the fundamental principles that interlink tree and forest dynamics in addition such detailed 3d forest models could be useful for model based studies of the spatio temporal dynamics of canopy dwelling plants and animals cabral et al 2015 petter et al 2021 however only few attempts have been made to couple fstms with forest stand models and these studies focused on growth of even age monocultures over short time periods feng et al 2011 guillemot et al 2014 so far species rich forest models that are based on fstms and simulate all crucial demographic processes over long periods of time i e regeneration growth and mortality are not available extending fstms to tropical forest stands is both computationally and conceptually challenging on the one hand stand scale fstms are computer intensive due to their complexity and thus require efficient modelling techniques to keep simulations feasible on the other hand tropical forests pose particular challenges due to their high species diversity slik et al 2015 ter steege et al 2013 in contrast to temperate forests for which the low number of well studied tree species allows calibrating ecophysiological parameters at the species level e g seidl et al 2012 alternative approaches are required for species rich forests where species specific physiological information is scarce individual based models for tropical forests typically use distinct functional groups aggregating tree species with similar characteristics e g fischer et al 2016 köhler and huth 1998 in the simplest case only light demanding pioneers and shade tolerant climax species are distinguished swaine and whitmore 1988 but a classification into more groups has also been proposed chazdon et al 2010 gourlet fleury et al 2005 while functional group approaches are useful they retain a simplification of the continuum from fast growing short lived pioneer to slow growing long lived shade tolerant species denslow 1987 wright et al 2003 similar trade offs between growth and mortality occur at the leaf scale wright et al 2004 many leaf traits co vary strongly and this variation is largely explained by a single principal axis the leaf economics spectrum les the les runs from leaves with high photosynthetic capacities and low life spans to leaves with low photosynthetic capacities and long life spans hence a relationship between leaf traits and whole tree performance can be assumed and significant relationships were observed for many tropical tree species poorter and bongers 2006 sterck et al 2006 a leaf trait based approach should thus be a promising way to integrate the different life history strategies of trees into forest models however we are not aware of any study in which 3d growth over a tree s entire life span has been modelled as an emergent property of the tree s set of traits here we present a dynamic forest stand model in which trees are represented as 3d functionally and structurally explicit individuals this model simulates the long term forest dynamics 500 1000 years at the plot scale 1 ha with a high level of structural detail and functional diversity branches are considered up to the second order and leaf biomass development is modelled at a resolution of 1 m3 which allows detailed consideration of competition for light and space tree species are characterized by a set of leaf traits under consideration of the trade offs and correlations between traits les wright et al 2004 using the principles of the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 the light driven carbon assimilation at the leaf level and the within tree carbon allocation are coupled we hypothesize that this continuous trait based approach captures essential life history variations across species regarding their growth survival and light demand in addition we hypothesize that the long term dynamics of diverse tropical forest communities can be reproduced by coupling the fstm with a forest stand model in which key demographic processes and between tree competition are simulated e g competition for light and space neutral recruitment to test these hypotheses we contrast emerging growth patterns at the tree level e g diameter growth rates maximum height and life span against observations in addition we simulate forest stands from bare soil over 500 years and test if the model can successfully reproduce multiple attributes of neotropical forests specifically we test if a dynamic equilibrium is reached and if 12 forest attributes e g basal area net primary production mortality rate and several ecological patterns e g diameter and height distribution vertical leaf area distribution resemble field observations our main purpose here is to present the structure parameterization and validation of the model and to explore how trait trade offs at the leaf level are functionally linked to emergent patterns of tree growth and forest stand dynamics our model can form the basis for more detailed future studies of successional dynamics distribution of functional and structural traits and tree diversity in detailed 3d forests or spatiotemporal dynamics of canopy dwellers making it an important tool for forest and canopy ecologists 2 methods the model developed in this study generates 3d structural growth of individual trees and long term dynamics of forest stands at the plot level we term this model a functional structural forest model fsfm this ecophysiological model was implemented using the open source 3d modelling platform groimp growth grammar interactive modeling platform available at https sourceforge net projects groimp in groimp relational growth grammars are implemented in the programming language xl which is a graph based extension of the lindenmayer systems l systems a formal language for the description of plant structure lindenmayer 1968a b the fsfm code and a model manual are available at https github com julianoscabral mof3d 2 1 model description the model description follows the odd protocol for agent based models overview design concepts details see grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 the first block of the protocol overview subdivided into the elements purpose state variables and scales and process overview and scheduling is presented here the full odd model description including all equations and parameters is available in appendix a 2 1 1 purpose the fsfm serves two main purposes first to study the relationship between leaf trait trade offs and life history variation in trees ontogenetic growth patterns maximum height and life span as well as the light dependent growth behavior in our model emerge from continuous plant traits second to generate long term dynamics of forest stands at a high level of structural detail by combining the leaf trait based tree growth with local population and community dynamics emergent patterns can be evaluated with field observations at the forest level our ecophysiological approach to forest dynamics was designed to increase the understanding of bottom up mechanisms controlling forest dynamics and in addition to be useful for follow up studies requiring a detailed 3d representation of forest structure and dynamics 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the fsfm simulates establishment growth and mortality of virtual 3d trees at the plot level the spatial and temporal scale of the forest plot can be defined during experimental design here we simulate forest stands between 0 25 and 1 hectare over 500 to 1000 years in annual time steps the vertical spatial dimension is associated with typical maximum tree heights ca 50 60 m the 3d space is divided into a regular grid of cubic voxels with a side length of 1 m fig 1 a which defines the spatial resolution of both light and leaf area biomass distribution light is the main driver of vegetative growth and is calculated for all voxels based on the 3d distribution of leaf area this model comprises three hierarchical levels tree components individual trees and the forest stand tree components are trunks branches apical meristems and leaf compartments fig 1b each tree consists of one erect trunk described by length and diameter attached to the trunk are branches up to the second order branches are defined at two different scales at the coarse scale branches are described by their total length and diameter while at the fine scale branches are described as topologically connected smaller segments this multi scale approach optimizes both speed of the ecophysiological simulations and visual aspects see appendix a for more details located at the end of each trunk or branch apical meristems sense the local environment and control primary growth leaf compartments are connected with second order branches and are conceptualized as aggregations of leaves within the cubic voxels leaf compartments comprise leaves and active pipes which represent the sapwood connecting leaves and roots this means that leaf compartments form leaf pipe elements following the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 fig 1b each tree component is characterized by state variables table 1 including its absolute 3d position and its topological position within its tree based on this information the 3d structure of each tree can be deduced fig 1c structural tree growth results from creation loss and dynamic changes of tree components structural tree growth is driven by the 3d distribution of light within the forest stand and the functional and the structural traits of trees table 1 while the functional traits regulate light mediated carbon balance the structural traits reflect inherent architectural parameters defining the tree s structural organization this includes for instance branching angles or average internode lengths see appendix a submodel structural growth for more details some functional trait combinations promote effective carbon assimilation under low light conditions allowing growth and survival in the dark understory other trait combinations may be more favorable under high light conditions consequently forest dynamics results from structural growth of individual trees with different traits competing for space and light whose distribution in turn is influenced by the forest structure fig 1d 2 1 3 initialization at the beginning of each simulation a pool of virtual species is generated with the number of species defined by the user each virtual species is characterized by a set of functional and structural traits all species specific traits are listed in table 1 trait correlations have been used in other models to define species or plant functional types e g may et al 2009 in our model while the structural traits are assumed to be uncorrelated and randomly selected from ranges defined during experimental design functional leaf traits integrate between trait correlations following the les marino et al 2010 wright et al 2004 the les quantifies relationships between leaf economics traits such as the sla leaf lifespan or mass based photosynthetic capacity these leaf traits co vary strongly and in multidimensional trait space most of the variation is explained by a single principal axis wright et al 2004 this axis can be considered as a spectrum ranging from leaves with low sla values low photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates but long lifespans to leaves with high sla values high photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates but short lifespans to obtain a set of leaf traits the values for sla are randomly selected from ranges defined during experimental design and the values of the other traits are determined based on between trait correlations meaning that each set of leaf traits thus represents a position on the les furthermore functional traits characterizing specific photosynthetic light response curves are also predicted from the leaf traits of the les following marino et al 2010 appendix a table a 2 2 1 4 process overview and scheduling after initialization light distribution tree establishment tree growth and tree mortality are simulated successively fig 2 the 3d distribution of light intensity is calculated via the lambert beer light extinction law considering the distribution of leaf area see section light distribution in appendix a for details subsequently establishment of tree seedlings is simulated as a neutral process depending on an average user defined neutral germination rate in number of seedlings per ha new seedlings are initialized at random positions each seedling is randomly assigned to a species from the species pool seedlings with unsuitable traits for local voxel conditions may die due to carbon starvation tree growth is simulated in three subsequent sub processes i apical control dominance ii carbon balance iii structural growth fig 2 i controlled by plant hormones carbon allocation to apical meristems can either be inhibited apical control or intensified apical dominance wilson 2000 these processes control how much of the carbon assimilated by photosynthesis is invested into primary growth of branches and the trunk in this model apical control is considered for branches branches inhibit carbon allocation to primary growth when branch apical meristems are 1 deeply shaded i e if the carbon balance under local light conditions at the meristem is negative or 2 when branches from neighboring trees grow into the same voxel hence light and space competition take place at the branch level apical dominance in contrast is considered at the trunk level i e carbon allocation to trunk apical meristems is intensified under shade as a mechanism to quickly reach higher potentially less shaded zones poorter 1999 poorter et al 2011 by influencing the within tree carbon allocation the processes of apical dominance control slightly affect local carbon balance the next tree growth subprocess ii local carbon balance is simulated at the level of leaf compartments apart from the usually only small percentage of carbon assimilated by leaf compartment and allocated to primary growth influenced by apical control dominance leaf compartments are assumed to be independent from each other here we follow the physiological principles of module autonomy stating that different tree parts may be regarded as autonomous modules sprugel et al 1991 this means that no carbon flow occurs between leaf compartments and thus assimilated carbon is locally reinvested local re investment means investments in leaf biomass within the leaf compartment which however are coupled with investments in connected woody pipes following the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 for each new unit of leaf biomass an equivalent unit of pipes connecting leaves and roots has to be grown both construction and respiration costs for leaves and pipes are considered which for the latter depend on the within tree position of the leaf compartment the carbon balance is central for the next and final tree growth sub process structural growth iii in the structural growth sub process secondary and primary growth of branches and trunks are calculated the sum of new pipes over all leaf compartments connected to a branch yields the branch diameter increment and the sum over all leaf compartments of a tree yields the trunk diameter increment primary growth in turn is calculated based on the secondary growth using species specific allometric relationships between diameter and length height primary growth causes the establishment of new apical branch segments and sometimes new lateral branch segments which may be associated with new leaf compartments and apical meristems in addition trees may also shed branches if all photosynthetically active leaf compartments are lost after tree growth tree mortality is simulated via different ecophysiological and environmental processes trees may die due to carbon starvation when they have lost all leaves in addition we integrated a biomass dependent mortality rate according to the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 this rate accounts for processes not explicitly simulated e g herbivory pathogens and assumes that the chance of survival increases non linearly with tree biomass furthermore gap dynamics are also important in tropical forests brokaw 1985 therefore falling dead trees may kill neighboring trees and create gaps after each of the processes illustrated in fig 2 the state variables of all tree components are updated synchronously for more details see appendix a 2 2 outputs the updated state variables can be saved as model outputs in annual time steps at all hierarchical levels tree components individual trees forest stand output data at the lowest hierarchical level contain the state variables including spatial coordinates from these variables outputs at higher hierarchical levels are deduced for instance the crown dimensions of a tree result from size and position of its trunk and branch segments likewise forest attributes e g aboveground biomass or the leaf area index are calculated by aggregating all relevant components of all trees a list of important outputs is given in fig 3 an exhaustive list is available in appendix a table a 5 in addition data on the 3d light distribution tree mortality and species traits may be monitored visualization options are described in appendix a 2 3 experimental design model parameterization and validation our experimental design aimed at finding values of model parameters that yield realistic reproductions of tree and forest structure and dynamics model parameters can be grouped into three categories i global parameters ii functional and structural traits and iii external environmental drivers see appendix a tables a 6 and a 8 for full list of parameters we first defined values for those global parameters whose uncertainty according to literature data was low for the functional and structural traits value ranges instead of single values were identified as simulated forest communities with a reasonable trait space should reflect the trait space of a species rich forest as the natural distribution of functional traits used in this study i e sla and wood density is well studied e g baker et al 2004 patiño et al 2012 and structural traits are easy to interpret characteristics of tree structure such as branching angles or internode lengths reasonable trait spaces could be retrieved from the literature nevertheless 12 parameters with uncertain values remained which were thus treated as free parameters to be calibrated table 2 these free parameters were either global parameters or external environmental drivers i e light conditions site index and for most of these parameters ecologically meaningful value ranges could be identified table 2 we used key ideas of the pattern oriented modelling pom framework to parameterize and validate our model grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 the rationale behind pom is to reduce the uncertainty in model structure and parameters based on a multi criteria assessment i e by comparing model results simultaneously with multiple ecological patterns at different hierarchical levels and scales grimm et al 2005 wang et al 2018 the more patterns reproduced by a model the higher the likelihood that integrated bottom up mechanisms are robust and ecologically meaningful the hierarchical structure of our approach linking tree components individual trees and forest stands suits the pom framework accordingly we included a large number of patterns at the tree and forest stand level and tested if these patterns can be reproduced simultaneously we opted to calibrate the model manually for the following two reasons first we included some qualitative patterns that require visual inspection second we had no access to cluster computers and consequently a full factorial calibration or advanced parameter estimation techniques e g bayesian calibration were not feasible this is because the model runtime scales with the number of tree segments and was approximately 30 min for a 100 year simulation run of a 50 50 m forest in dynamic equilibrium state on an intel i7 quadcore processor 4th generation the model mostly uses a single core i e parallel simulations on multi core processors are possible the manual calibration started by varying each free parameter over its estimated range while keeping the other parameters constant at mean values to assess the influence of the parameter on the ecological patterns as described below based on these results the parameters were fine tuned by recursively adjusting the parameter values and comparing the resulting patterns using the information obtained in each step in the next step this recursive process was repeated until we found an appropriate combination of parameter values that reproduced the ecological pattern at the tree and forest level simultaneously in the following these patterns are described 2 3 1 tree level at the tree level we evaluated simulated growth of individual trees for each parameter combination a visual analysis of ontogenetic tree growth trajectories in combination with an analysis of the changes in height and diameter biomass and productivity during tree ontogeny served as first indicator for the structural realism of 3d tree growth furthermore for each unique combination of global parameters we systematically analyzed how changes in species traits and environmental conditions influence tree growth to cover the trait and environmental space in tropical forests we varied each of these factors within their natural ranges table 2 while keeping the other factors constant at intermediate levels due to the size and longevity of trees controlled experiments on changes in growth rates and morphology over a tree s lifespan are practically impossible consequently data equivalent to our simulation experiment is missing nevertheless based on numerous field and theoretical studies there is an understanding of several qualitative and quantitative patterns during tree ontogeny for instance while the height growth of undisturbed trees is expected to continue at decreasing rates until reaching maximum height diameter growth rates tend to peak at a certain height or age clark and clark 1999 in addition diameter growth rates maximum tree heights and partly also maximum tree ages are well studied chao et al 2008 clark and clark 2001 martı nez ramos and alvarez buylla 1998 2 3 2 stand level at the stand level we evaluated model performance in reproducing the general structure and dynamics of tropical forests comparative studies have shown substantial differences in the characteristics of tropical forests between continents e g feldpausch et al 2011 and in this study we focused on the well studied neotropical lowland forests while typical ranges of attributes of mature lowland forests such as the basal area or net primary production per hectare are relatively well known long term data to which the model could be fitted remain scarce considering this limitation we estimated ranges of 12 important attributes characterizing both forest structure and dynamics based on a literature review see table 3 and appendix a table a 7 for more details we excluded data from climatically extreme or recently disturbed sites the estimated ranges should be representative for average lowland forests in dynamic equilibrium state we assessed model performance by simulating 1 ha forest plots starting from bare soil for 500 years and calculated the model performance criterion αm that tests if the attributes of the simulated forest in dynamic equilibrium state are within the empirical ranges 1 α m i n t m i n t m a x β i t t m a x t m i n n where t min is the time after which an equilibrium state is expected here t min 200 years t max is the total number of years simulated here t max 500 n is the total number of forest attributes here n 12 and β i t is a boolean variable describing for each attribute at each time step if the attribute value is within the estimated range β i t 1 or not β i t 0 the optimal values of α m 1 can be reached if all attributes of the simulated forest are within the estimated ranges continuously from t min to t max this approach assumes that a sufficiently stable equilibrium state is modelled and the time to reach this state when starting from bare soil is thus an additional aspect we considered as validation criterion in addition we evaluated whether our model adequately reproduced more complex patterns at the forest level this mainly involved qualitative comparisons between simulations and observations based on visualized patterns the following patterns were considered i crown architectures of trees in stands usually change markedly with tree height and while the crown area usually shows a non linear relationship with height crown width and branching height are commonly rather linearly correlated with height alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 ii the vertical leaf area density in undisturbed forests within stands often peaks in the upper canopy sometimes with an additional peak in the understory stark et al 2012 taubert et al 2015 iii the height diameter relationship is a typical characteristic of a forest and for the neotropics this relationship is best described using a three parameter exponential equation with an asymptotic maximum height of 38 8 m banin et al 2012 iv the frequency distributions of tree diameter height and age are typically right skewed when considering all trees in a stand campbell et al 1986 worbes et al 2003 when considering only trees above 10 cm in diameter at breast height dbh a normal or slightly right skewed distribution is commonly observed oliveira filho et al 1994 worbes et al 2003 to visualize the patterns we used simulated data after reaching dynamic equilibrium state in intervals of 50 years to avoid temporal autocorrelation 2 3 3 best parameter combination with the best parameter combination we performed 10 replicate simulations for 1 ha forest plots to demonstrate our hypotheses that our fsfm successfully integrates tree level dynamics and species rich forest stands while examining the effects of model inherent stochasticity however as the patterns were consistent across all replicates the results of a single model run are shown here to highlight temporal fluctuations 3 results we found an appropriate combination of parameter values that reproduced the ecological pattern at the tree and forest level simultaneously table 2 appendix a table a 6 the emergent patterns using this best combination of parameter values are described below additionally the effects of variations of the free model parameters and the two main traits sla wood density on forest model results are shown in table 4 3 1 tree level tree level simulations revealed that under constant environmental conditions and without competition tree growth could be divided into three successive life stages fig 4 in early developmental stages there was a rapid increase in height and diameter as well as continuously increasing net primary production rates in this stage all major branches were foliated fig 4a subsequently the lower branches began to shed leaves fig 4a accompanied with lower increments in height and diameter and reduced net primary production fig 4b d this stage ended when the tree reached its maximum height see below for more details on maximum tree height in the subsequent senescence stage height and diameter growth ceased and net primary production decreased via loss of photosynthetically active leaf biomass the leaf loss continued until the tree ultimately died from carbon starvation i e emergent senescence when grown under constant external conditions species generally followed the illustrated tree growth pattern over their life spans however tree traits and environmental conditions had a large influence on all aspects of growth fig 5 species with high sla showed high initial growth rates fig 5c and rapidly reached their maximum height consequently they entered the senescence stage after a shorter time and died at a comparably young age fig 5a d in contrast low sla species had a lower growth rate but were able to maintain their growth rate for a longer time they reached larger maximum heights later and had longer life spans wood density also affected life history growth mainly by influencing maximum height fig 5e h both external factors light and site index affected tree growth in a similar way fig 5k o due to the trade off between carbon gain and carbon costs lower light and site index values also decreased maximum height in contrast to sla variations in external factors influenced maximum height but longevity was only slightly affected fig 5i p the potential maximum height of a tree and the light compensation point for each leaf compartment were emergent properties fig 6 see appendix a eq 41 for details on maximum height calculation both the internal traits of a tree and the external environmental conditions determined the maximum attainable height which generally decreased with increasing sla and wood density fig 6a and increased with light and site conditions fig 6b the light compensation point of each leaf compartment was a function of its pipe length as construction and maintenance costs increased fig 6c with short pipe lengths species with high sla values had a lower light compensation point than those with low sla however the compensation points of high sla species steeply increased with increasing pipe length while the increase was shallower for low sla species fig 6c consequently the latter ones had lower light compensation points already above ca 4 m i e in the understory fig 6c 3 2 stand level starting from bare soil the simulated forest increased in stem number above ground biomass and basal area reaching a dynamic equilibrium after ca 80 100 years fig 7 in this equilibrium state all 12 monitored forest attributes were within the ranges of typical neotropical lowland forest αm 1 see 1 ha stand result in fig 7 fluctuations around the equilibrium increased with decreasing stand area as the relative effect of gap creating mortality events was stronger fig 7 in dynamic equilibrium state tree dbh height and age showed right skewed distributions fig 8 trees reached maximum diameters of 100 cm maximum heights of 50 m and maximum ages of 250 years when only considering stems 10 cm in dbh height and age were nearly normally distributed fig 8b c on log scale tree numbers decreased almost linearly with dbh and age with deviations from this pattern only at large size age classes in contrast tree height peaked between 25 and 35 m fig 8b on log log scale tree height distribution was linear for small individuals but became curvilinear at larger diameters fig 8d crown architectures changed significantly with tree height fig 9 a c there was a positive linear relationship between tree height and crown width fig 9b and an exponential relationship between tree height and branching height fig 9a as well as between tree height and crown area fig 9c however due to differences in functional and structural traits and variations in ontogenetic stages there was substantial scatter around the average trends visualizations of the simulated forest stand illustrate the level of detail and structural realisms of the model fig 9e f the height diameter relationship deviated slightly from the average allometry previously reported for the neotropics banin et al 2012 and overestimated the asymptotic maximum height by 3 m fig 10 a the average leaf area density profile of the simulated forest showed a unimodal distribution in which the leaf area density peaked in the mid canopy between 15 and 25 m fig 10b 4 discussion when comparing our model with other individual or cohort based forest models e g huth and ditzer 2000 köhler and huth 1998 liu and ashton 1998 phillips et al 2004 two main differences emerge first our model simulates 3d tree structures in detail including branch segments up to the second order and within tree leaf distribution at high resolution here at 1 m3 this allows three dimensional light and space competition within and between individuals second tree species are not a priori classified into distinct functional groups e g köhler and huth 1998 tietjen and huth 2006 but drawn from the full continuous trait space of leaf and wood traits here as suggested by wright et al 2004 the leaf investment strategy of each species depends on the position on the continuous les growth rate shade tolerance and maximum height of each tree species typically defined a priori in other models emerge in our approach from the leaf investment strategy by combining functional and structural realism at the level of tree components our model reproduced a high number of real world patterns at the tree and the stand level this demonstrates the suitability of our ecophysiological approach and that life history variation among tree species emerge from their differences in leaf functional strategy 4 1 tree level variations in leaf traits had a strong impact on life history pattern in our model species with a high sla were characterized by faster growth shorter life spans lower potential heights fig 5 and lower shade tolerance fig 6c all of these characteristics are typical for pioneer species which have significantly higher sla than shade tolerant species in nature kitajima 1994 rijkers et al 2000 with decreasing sla life history characteristics changed towards those of climax species several studies indicate that the transition from fast growing short lived pioneers to slow growing long lived shade tolerant species is indeed rather continuous poorter and bongers 2006 wright et al 2003 and our bottom up ecophysiological approach supports the notion that leaf trait trade offs influence the ecological strategy of trees at first glance it may be counterintuitive that pioneer species with their generally high slas are shade intolerant a high sla means a high photosynthetically active leaf area per dry mass investment evans and poorter 2001 and observed growth rates of pioneer seedlings in shade were indeed higher than those of shade tolerant species kitajima 1994 furthermore as shade leaves within individual trees generally have a higher sla than sun leaves markesteijn et al 2007 rozendaal et al 2006 a positive relationship between sla and shade tolerance could be expected however the increased efficiency of light capture with increased sla comes at a cost as such leaves are more susceptible to herbivory and physical damage and hence are short lived coley 1983 wright and cannon 2001 in our approach both such leaf trait correlations and the woody pipes connected with the leaves are considered with construction and maintenance costs increasing with increasing pipe length hence pipe length which is determined by the within tree position of a leaf compartment is an additional factor for resource use efficiency we found that a low sla was more efficient under low light conditions i e had a lower light compensation point as long as pipe length exceeded 4 m fig 6c this means that in line with observations species with low sla emerged as more shade tolerant in our ecophysiological approach wood density influenced tree growth much less than leaf traits the most obvious effect was an increase in maximum height dbh and dbh growth with decreasing wood density fig 5 observed relationships between maximum tree height and wood density are inconsistent across studies and while the trends observed for iberian canopy tree and southeastern asian tree species agree with our simulation results king et al 2006 poorter et al 2012 other studies found no significant relationships wright et al 2010 or even positive trends osunkoya et al 2007 our ecophysiological processes are carbon based and by decreasing the construction and maintenances costs per volume of wood low wood densities are advantageous and allow trees to grow taller additionally to pipe costs pipe reuse might be also key to both dbh growth and allometric height growth thus decreasing pipe reuse might further increase the negative relationship between size and wood density however low wood densities usually decrease mechanical stability and increase vulnerability to hydraulic failure anten and schieving 2010 hacke et al 2001 such trade offs among wood traits influence tree architecture and may have adverse effects on the maximum attainable height van gelder et al 2006 furthermore correlations among wood traits might also explain why increasing mortality rates with decreasing wood density are consistently reported chao et al 2008 visser et al 2016 wright et al 2010 a pattern we did not obtain from the simulations fig 5 thus only considering wood density is not sufficient to reproduce all interspecific differences related to wood traits moreover empirical data on pipe reuse across species might be highly informative consequently our fsfm may be further improved by integrating additional mechanisms such as dynamic reuse or mechanical and hydraulic stability of wood pipes site quality characterized by the dimensionless site index parameter positively influenced tree growth rates and maximum tree heights fig 5i l we were not explicitly integrating water nutrient cycles or temperature dependencies in our fsfm hence the site index represents a proxy for the strength of several factors limiting tree growth such as low water availabilities low temperatures or poor soil conditions such limiting factors are generally associated with decreasing productivity and lower tree canopy heights girardin et al 2010 2013 pan et al 2013 therefore site index variations in our ecophysiological approach generate tree dynamics that are qualitatively in accordance with these observations changing light conditions had a similar effect on tree growth and the increase in growth rates with light intensity emerging from our fsfm is consistent with observed light dependent responses of most tropical species kobe 1999 philipson et al 2014 rüger et al 2011 irrespective of environmental conditions and functional traits tree growth was size dependent with characteristic ontogenetic trajectories figs 4 5 a significant effect of size on growth rates has also been observed for most tree species in field studies e g iida et al 2014 rüger et al 2011 however growth rates may both increase and decrease with diameter rüger et al 2011 2012 or responses may be humped shaped clark and clark 1999 davies 2001 these observed differences may be related to species specific variability biased data towards small sized and young trees or incomplete or unbalanced data sets bowman et al 2013 most recent studies however showed a generalized increase in aboveground biomass production with tree size across several biomes even when the effects of competition were excluded stephenson et al 2014 when comparing the growth trajectories in our model with this observation it should be noted that the entire theoretical life cycle is shown here fig 4 in reality background tree mortality often caused by environmental conditions negative interactions and disturbances arellano et al 2019 das et al 2016 ferreira and laurance 1997 prevents most trees from completing their entire theoretically possible life cycle this means that possible reductions in productivity in the senescence phase might thus be underrepresented in tree growth data from natural forests apart from that the model agrees well with observations in the first stage of tree development meaning that until reaching around 80 of the maxium tree height or dbh the npp increases with tree size fig 4 during this stage the simulated npp increase is linked to an increase in tree s total leaf area which is also regarded as main factor for the generally increasing carbon accumulation with tree size in stephenson et al 2014 however after raching a maximum in our model the total leaf area and the npp decrease figs 4 5 there are two main reasons for this model bahaviour first the trees grow strictly according to their structural traits without optimizing their crown structures according to the light and space conditions second we introduced a parameter that limits the leaf production per leaf compartment a lprodmax with the effect that after reaching this maximum no new leaves are produced even if the environmental conditions are optimal in reality trees use a variety of different strategies to optimize their carbon budget they can activate resting meristems and optimize their crown strucutures wood traits e g pipe costs and pipe reuse and leaf traits e g sla adaptation with light level the lack of such mechanisms in our model may explain why the modelled trees differ from observations and expectations particularly when growing close to their maximum heights when following trees over their entire theoretical life cycle there should most likely be a point in their ontogenetic development when they are not able to increase their growth rates any further and instead show decreasing rates e g clark and clark 1999 hérault et al 2011 however this period of increasing growth rates should be longer than in our model integrating optimization mechanisms into our ecophysiological framework could improve the tree growth trajectories and thus could be considered as scope for future studies 4 2 stand level as first indication for structural realism emerging from the integrated ecophysiological processes a dynamic equilibrium was reached it is generally assumed that under constant environmental conditions carbon gains and losses are relatively balanced in old growth forests resulting in gap driven oscillations around an equilibrium biomass level galbraith et al 2014 whitmore 1990 in accordance with simulations by chambers et al 2013 gap formation produced stronger oscillations in smaller stands fig 7 the time required to reach equilibrium biomass after deforestation differs with environmental conditions ranging from 40 to 60 years in high latitudes puerto rico mitchell aide et al 2000 marin spiotta et al 2007 to 190 years in amazonian forests columbia and venezuela saldarriaga et al 1988 please note that we only consider equilibrium biomass here other aspects such as the composition or size structure of the forest which are typically also linked with a dynamic equilibrium state are ignored hence the time span between 80 and 100 years emerging in our simulations lies within the reported range but may be too fast for equatorial forests in this regard it is noteworthy that our experimental design does not follow typical succession as we seed the plot with all species from the species pool i e plots are seeded at a high functional diversity in fact such strategy of initial seeding with high diversity 50 species and mixed functional types has been successfully used in restoration in neotropical forests with near old growth biomass conditions being reached within 80 85 years see rodrigues et al 2009 for a review furthermore the time needed to reach dynamic equilibrium in a simulation model normally depends on the initial conditions and speed of internal dynamics this is strongly controlled by species trait composition and productivity which in our model is mostly given by the site index and a decreasing site index and decreasing mean sla would slow the dynamics table 4 all these considerations suggest that 100 years to reach equilibrium biomass in a highly productive forest is not unrealistic however please also note that we paid more attention to model calibration in quasi equilibrium state than in the succession period forest succession could be analyzed in detail in a further study our model simulates forests at a relatively high level of detail for validation we used basic ideas of the pom framework and conducted a multi criteria assessment using many patterns at the tree and the forest level as criteria in dynamic equilibrium all 12 important forest attributes fell within the observed ranges of neotropical lowland forests fig 7 and several complex patterns at the forest level could also be realistically reproduced figs 8 10 it has been shown that it is often advantageous to use many different patterns in model calibration and validation even if individual patterns are rather vague and might be represented by ranges instead of exact values using many attributes patterns in reasonable ranges instead of reproducing some attributes with a higher accuracy can reduce uncertainties and result in models with a high level of structural realism wang et al 2018 wiegand et al 2004 our main goal here was to demonstrate the structural realism of our model i e its ability to reproduce general patterns and dynamics of neotropical forests and for this reason we opted for this approach alternatively one could validate our model against observed forest attributes of individual forest plots however there are only few plots with repeated inventories over the decadal timescales relevant here and these focus on only a few key forest attributes e g bradford et al 2014 condit 1995 the smaller number of patterns in the alternative parameterization strategy would have increased the risk of equifinality i e the likelihood that the model would reproduce similar patterns via different parameter combinations and thus of being structurally less realistic the right skewed tree diameter distribution fig 8a is consistent with observations hector et al 2011 oliveira filho et al 1994 simulated normal or slightly skewed distributions for height and age of trees 10 cm in dbh fig 8b c also agree with empirical studies adekunle et al 2013 campbell et al 1986 oliveira filho et al 1994 worbes et al 2003 as diameter height and age are usually correlated similar frequency distribution of these attributes can be expected interestingly the height distribution deviated from the age distribution and showed a slight hump between 25 and 35 m fig 8b we speculate that the crowns of these trees in the upper canopy are well illuminated and less exposed to between crown competition for space consequently mortality by carbon starvation decreases explaining why the otherwise generally negative trend is temporarily stopped in this height class the metabolic theory of ecology predicts a linear decrease in stem diameter frequency on a log log scale muller landau et al 2006 and enquist et al 2009 however found deviations from this theoretical prediction particularly among the larger diameter classes whose frequency was lower than predicted interestingly our model shows similar deviations fig 8d enquist et al 2009 speculated that other sources of mortality than competitive thinning which is the reason for the predicted linear trend for instance wind damages lightning strikes or diseases are particularly severe in larger size classes in our fsfm trees growing at their maximum height enter senescence which inevitably ends with death this emergent behavior increased mortality probability of very large trees and thus is close to observations while still considering metabolic driven mortality the linear increase in crown width with height is in accordance with approximately linear trends observed in many tropical tree species alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 king 1996 interestingly a bulge in the crown width tree height relationship was observed for tall trees 30 m fig 9b indicating a disproportionate increase in crown width when trees rise above the canopy king 1996 made similar observations for larger trees potentially growing above the canopy crown development of such emergent trees is less constrained by competition for space and our approach can reproduce such plastic crown responses with an average crown width of 10 m at a height of 20 m our model only slightly overestimates crown dimension compared to observations which are in a reported range of 7 9 m alves and santos 2002 king 1996 due to the relatively simple integration of space competition in this model particularly ignoring wind driven crown movement the area of overlap between two crowns may be larger than in nature leading to wider crowns branching height showed a slightly curvilinear trend with tree height fig 9a although most studies reported linear species specific relationships e g alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 the average slopes of simulated and observed relationships agree quite well compared with the other crown measures branching height was less strongly correlated with tree height fig 9 in our model branch growth followed the architecture defined by structural traits and branch shedding resulted from physiological processes these processes lead to a distinct species specific branching height during tree ontogeny fig 4 which could be modified however by competition and environmental variables appendix a fig a 10 in real trees branching architecture is a complex trait and the processes of branch growth and shedding are likely related to within tree carbon optimization farnsworth and niklas 1995 for example the complex crowns of emergent trees often develop through light mediated activation of dormant buds barthélémy and caraglio 2007 hallé et al 1978 due to such mechanisms which are not yet integrated in our fsfm the correlation between branching height and tree height is probably stronger in real forests unfortunately we are not aware of any study reporting the strength of correlation between branching height and tree height at stand scale which would allow direct comparisons the simulated leaf area density peaked at 20 m fig 10b which is in accordance with observations of the canopy in neotropical lowland forests on barro colorado island taubert et al 2015 and near manaus stark et al 2012 in the latter study an additional increase in leaf area density near the forest floor was observed probably due to herbaceous vegetation and shrubs which are not included in our model although vertical leaf area profiles have not been as extensively studied as other forest attributes a leaf area maximum in the canopy layer is generally expected for undisturbed old growth forests and our simulations are in line with this expectation interestingly in a lowland forest analyzed by stark et al 2012 the leaf area density peaked in the lower canopy around 10 m these authors considered past disturbances and the resulting non equilibrium forest state as a possible cause of the deviating pattern analyzing the effect of disturbance regimes on the stand level vertical leaf area distribution may thus be an interesting future application of our model the asymptotic height of the diameter height relationship observed here 38 8 m fig 10a is close to the observed mean for neotropical forests 35 8 6 0 m banin et al 2012 however the shape of the simulated relationship differed from the observed average trend and the simulated height at smaller diameter classes was slightly overestimated fig 10a in our model height scales with diameter to the power 2 3 controlled by species specific shape parameters trees only deviate from their species specific relationship under low light conditions increased height growth or at maximum height cessation of height growth in nature trees show a plastic response to environmental factors such as light precipitation or stand density which can alter the specific allometric relationships banin et al 2012 feldpausch et al 2011 trees may for instance cease height growth when growing as emergents under full light including more such mechanism in fsfms may thus improve the emergent allometric scaling 4 3 limitations we were able to find parameter values yielding realistic ecological patterns for our fsfm by manually applying pattern oriented modelling grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 however the problem of equifinality persists i e we cannot rule out the possibility that other parameter value combinations would lead to similarly good or better results inverse modelling techniques such as bayesian approaches e g martínez et al 2011 matsushita et al 2015 could help to explore the entire parameter space more systematically and to quantifying local global minima parameter uncertainties and collinearities among parameters however due to the considerable computation time of our model and the lack of plot data spanning the entire set of variables evaluated here such systematic model calibration is currently challenging future studies could perform global sensitivity analyses if computationally feasible to investigate the effects of parameters on tree and forest patterns and possible nonlinear interactions pianosi et al 2016 nevertheless that fact that we found a suitable parameter value combination indicates that our ecophysiological framework can generate tree and forest structures that are largely realistic still potential functional inconsistencies e g fast senescence and decrease in biomass production might have been affected by optimizing for quasi equilibrium dynamics in this sense follow up studies could concentrate on optimization of both succession and equilibrium patterns as well as forest stand level functional patterns hence further ecophysiological insights might be gained when empirical structural and functional data becomes available at both succession and equilibrium phases and at the same structural level than our fsfm particularly informative data would be time series data for several tree components or for detailed tree and forest attributes of the same forest stands e g via repeated lidar data some ecological patterns were not accurately reproduced by our model for instance trees in natural forests commonly show fast initial height growth rates but when crowns are well illuminated they tend to cease height growth and continue to mostly grow in diameter e g matsushita et al 2015 moreover biomass production rates might increase over a longer period than calibrated here stephenson et al 2014 in this model height and diameter growth are coupled more tightly and the time frame over which high diameter growth rates at large heights can be maintained appears larger in nature clark and clark 1999 than in the ecophysiological dependencies depicted in our framework this deviation may be explained by intra individual trait plasticity in our fsfm each individual is characterized by non variable traits whereas in nature the sla is typically adjusted to local light conditions markesteijn et al 2007 rozendaal et al 2006 furthermore trees can modify their architecture to avoid self shading of branches and to maximize carbon gain in addition activation of dormant buds is regarded as important additional branching mechanism hallé et al 1978 osada 2011 sterck and bongers 2001 if such plastic responses were integrated larger trees would likely use resources more efficiently ultimately maintaining higher growth rates over a longer period and reaching larger diameters and ages 5 conclusion and perspectives the position of leaf traits along the leaf economics spectrum determined the maximum height and age size dependent growth rates and shade tolerance as well as a smooth continuous transition from fast growing short lived pioneers to slow growing long lived climax species as seen in the tree level patterns when varying sla these emergent results were remarkably consistent with well known functional tree types therefore our model reveals a fundamental role of leaf traits in determining a life history growth patterns of trees and b structural functional and temporal dynamics of species rich tropical forests bottom up functional structural tree and forest models thus have the potential to increase our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tree and forest dynamics ecologists are able to empirically measure processes at lower organizational levels e g photosynthesis at the leaf scale or to track some tree variables over a limited time e g diameter growth but it is yet virtually impossible to record 3d tree growth as a whole in this situation functional structural forest models can be helpful tools to test and evaluate the consequences of low level mechanisms on whole tree growth patterns so far fsfms have not received much attention but we indicate that they offer ample opportunities for future studies both at the tree and forest levels the explicit linkage between function and structure allows to represent internal processes like carbon allocation or water transport not yet integrated in our model but also competition for space and light in more detail than in other common forest models while large scale simulations are challenging due to excessive computation time fsfms are well suited for detailed simulation experiments at the stand level for instance the importance of within individual trait plasticity functional or structural on the carbon budget at the tree and stand level could be explored the importance of frequent disturbances for forest stability and stand level trait distribution could also be assessed our model allows to simulate functionally and structurally diverse tree communities representing species rich forests the role of the functional and structural diversity for carbon allocation or other aspects of forest development could be explored further other aspects such as roots and water uptake are currently not integrated but the integration of such missing mechanisms could facilitate the development of next generation predictive forest models in which tree performance emerges directly and exclusively from continuous functional traits moreover coupling fstms with more explicit demographic models e g rüger et al 2020 could also provide valuable insights particularly concerning succesional dynamics finally we highlight the potential of fsfms for future model based studies of canopy dwelling organisms tropical forest canopies harbor numerous arboreal animals and epiphytic plants but accessing their dynamic habitat is logistically challenging fsfms provide information on 3d forest dynamics and microclimatic changes which can be used as input for studies on other organisms for instance our knowledge on long term dynamics of vascular epiphytes is still very scarce and by coupling a fsfms with an epiphyte model the importance of 3d forest dynamics on epiphyte communities could be investigated such integrative modelling studies are particularly timely as tropical forest dynamics are already changing in response to atmospheric changes and a more detailed understanding of the response of canopy dwelling organisms is paramount and urgently needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

24539,tropical forests are the most diverse terrestrial ecosystems and home to numerous tree species competing for resources in space and time functional traits influence the ecophysiological performance of tree species yet the relationship between traits and emergent long term growth patterns is poorly understood here we present a novel 3d forest stand model in which growth patterns of individual trees and forest stands are emergent properties of leaf traits individual trees are simulated as 3d functional structural tree models fstms considering branches up to the second order and leaf dynamics at a resolution of one cubic meter each species is characterized by a set of leaf traits that corresponds to a specific position on the leaf economics spectrum and determines light driven carbon assimilation respiration and mortality rates applying principles of the pipe model theory these leaf scale processes are coupled with within tree carbon allocation i e 3d tree growth emerges from low level processes by integrating these fstms into a dynamic forest stand model we go beyond modern stand models to integrate structurally detailed internal physiological processes with interspecific competition and interactions with the environment in diverse tree communities for model calibration and validation we simultaneously compared a large number of emergent patterns at both the tree and forest levels in a pattern oriented modelling framework at the tree level the specific leaf area and correlated leaf traits determined the maximum height and age of trees as well as their size dependent growth rate and shade tolerance trait variations along the leaf economics spectrum led to a continuous transition from fast growing short lived and shade intolerant to slow growing long lived and shade tolerant trees these emerging patterns resemble well known functional tree types indicating a fundamental impact of leaf traits on long term growth patterns at the forest level a large number of patterns taken from lowland neotropical forests were reproduced indicating that our forest model simulates structurally realistic forests over long time spans our ecophysiological approach improves the understanding of how leaf level processes scale up to the tree and the stand level and facilitates the development of next generation forest models for species rich forests in which tree performance emerges directly from functional traits keywords functional structural tree model individual based model leaf economics spectrum tropical forest pipe model theory 3d forest stand model 1 introduction tropical forests provide multiple social ecological and economical services represent the most diverse terrestrial ecosystem and play an important role in the global carbon cycle hassan et al 2005 heywood and watson 1995 malhi and grace 2000 in addition to high tree diversity there are even more plant and animal species that directly or indirectly depend on the resources and habitat provided by trees erwin 1988 nakamura et al 2017 almost 9 of all vascular plant species for instance live as epiphytes on trees predominantly in subtropical or tropical regions zotz et al 2021 ongoing deforestation and potential adverse effects of climate change thus pose a threat to all species associated with tropical forests wright 2005 to assess the impact of a changing environment on tropical biodiversity we thus need a mechanistic understanding of the functioning of these forests e g how they will respond to those changes and how associated species respond to changing forest dynamics a variety of dynamic models are available to predict future changes of tropical forests and to analyze the functioning of these ecosystems these models differ considerably in the level of detail and in temporal and spatial resolution among these models dynamic global vegetation models focus on large scale predictions of vegetation dynamics and carbon cycles but commonly use simplistic forest structures e g cramer et al 2001 purves and pacala 2008 at small to medium scales 1 ha to 100 km2 forest gap models and forest landscape models simulate forest dynamics and tree species composition bugmann 2001 petter et al 2020 such models represent forest structure in more detail by including stems and crowns of individual trees or cohorts allowing simulations of within canopy light attenuation and competition among different species or functional types of trees fischer et al 2016 köhler and huth 1998 even finer structural details can be simulated by functional structural tree models fstms in which trees are represented in 3d space by interconnected structural and functional units such as branches leaves or reproductive organs godin and sinoquet 2005 sievänen et al 2014 these virtual trees explicitly integrate complex mechanistic interactions between tree architecture and physiological processes for instance light dependent within tree carbon acquisition and allocation at the meristem level in growing trees fourcaud et al 2008 sterck et al 2005 fstms are therefore suitable tools to study structural tree growth as an emergent property of lower level ecophysiological processes furthermore integrating fstms into forest stand models can improve our understanding of the fundamental principles that interlink tree and forest dynamics in addition such detailed 3d forest models could be useful for model based studies of the spatio temporal dynamics of canopy dwelling plants and animals cabral et al 2015 petter et al 2021 however only few attempts have been made to couple fstms with forest stand models and these studies focused on growth of even age monocultures over short time periods feng et al 2011 guillemot et al 2014 so far species rich forest models that are based on fstms and simulate all crucial demographic processes over long periods of time i e regeneration growth and mortality are not available extending fstms to tropical forest stands is both computationally and conceptually challenging on the one hand stand scale fstms are computer intensive due to their complexity and thus require efficient modelling techniques to keep simulations feasible on the other hand tropical forests pose particular challenges due to their high species diversity slik et al 2015 ter steege et al 2013 in contrast to temperate forests for which the low number of well studied tree species allows calibrating ecophysiological parameters at the species level e g seidl et al 2012 alternative approaches are required for species rich forests where species specific physiological information is scarce individual based models for tropical forests typically use distinct functional groups aggregating tree species with similar characteristics e g fischer et al 2016 köhler and huth 1998 in the simplest case only light demanding pioneers and shade tolerant climax species are distinguished swaine and whitmore 1988 but a classification into more groups has also been proposed chazdon et al 2010 gourlet fleury et al 2005 while functional group approaches are useful they retain a simplification of the continuum from fast growing short lived pioneer to slow growing long lived shade tolerant species denslow 1987 wright et al 2003 similar trade offs between growth and mortality occur at the leaf scale wright et al 2004 many leaf traits co vary strongly and this variation is largely explained by a single principal axis the leaf economics spectrum les the les runs from leaves with high photosynthetic capacities and low life spans to leaves with low photosynthetic capacities and long life spans hence a relationship between leaf traits and whole tree performance can be assumed and significant relationships were observed for many tropical tree species poorter and bongers 2006 sterck et al 2006 a leaf trait based approach should thus be a promising way to integrate the different life history strategies of trees into forest models however we are not aware of any study in which 3d growth over a tree s entire life span has been modelled as an emergent property of the tree s set of traits here we present a dynamic forest stand model in which trees are represented as 3d functionally and structurally explicit individuals this model simulates the long term forest dynamics 500 1000 years at the plot scale 1 ha with a high level of structural detail and functional diversity branches are considered up to the second order and leaf biomass development is modelled at a resolution of 1 m3 which allows detailed consideration of competition for light and space tree species are characterized by a set of leaf traits under consideration of the trade offs and correlations between traits les wright et al 2004 using the principles of the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 the light driven carbon assimilation at the leaf level and the within tree carbon allocation are coupled we hypothesize that this continuous trait based approach captures essential life history variations across species regarding their growth survival and light demand in addition we hypothesize that the long term dynamics of diverse tropical forest communities can be reproduced by coupling the fstm with a forest stand model in which key demographic processes and between tree competition are simulated e g competition for light and space neutral recruitment to test these hypotheses we contrast emerging growth patterns at the tree level e g diameter growth rates maximum height and life span against observations in addition we simulate forest stands from bare soil over 500 years and test if the model can successfully reproduce multiple attributes of neotropical forests specifically we test if a dynamic equilibrium is reached and if 12 forest attributes e g basal area net primary production mortality rate and several ecological patterns e g diameter and height distribution vertical leaf area distribution resemble field observations our main purpose here is to present the structure parameterization and validation of the model and to explore how trait trade offs at the leaf level are functionally linked to emergent patterns of tree growth and forest stand dynamics our model can form the basis for more detailed future studies of successional dynamics distribution of functional and structural traits and tree diversity in detailed 3d forests or spatiotemporal dynamics of canopy dwellers making it an important tool for forest and canopy ecologists 2 methods the model developed in this study generates 3d structural growth of individual trees and long term dynamics of forest stands at the plot level we term this model a functional structural forest model fsfm this ecophysiological model was

details see grimm et al 2006 2010 2020 the first block of the protocol overview subdivided into the elements purpose state variables and scales and process overview and scheduling is presented here the full odd model description including all equations and parameters is available in appendix a 2 1 1 purpose the fsfm serves two main purposes first to study the relationship between leaf trait trade offs and life history variation in trees ontogenetic growth patterns maximum height and life span as well as the light dependent growth behavior in our model emerge from continuous plant traits second to generate long term dynamics of forest stands at a high level of structural detail by combining the leaf trait based tree growth with local population and community dynamics emergent patterns can be evaluated with field observations at the forest level our ecophysiological approach to forest dynamics was designed to increase the understanding of bottom up mechanisms controlling forest dynamics and in addition to be useful for follow up studies requiring a detailed 3d representation of forest structure and dynamics 2 1 2 entities state variables and scales the fsfm simulates establishment growth and mortality of virtual 3d trees at the plot level the spatial and temporal scale of the forest plot can be defined during experimental design here we simulate forest stands between 0 25 and 1 hectare over 500 to 1000 years in annual time steps the vertical spatial dimension is associated with typical maximum tree heights ca 50 60 m the 3d space is divided into a regular grid of cubic voxels with a side length of 1 m fig 1 a which defines the spatial resolution of both light and leaf area biomass distribution light is the main driver of vegetative growth and is calculated for all voxels based on the 3d distribution of leaf area this model comprises three hierarchical levels tree components individual trees and the forest stand tree components are trunks branches apical meristems and leaf compartments fig 1b each tree consists of one erect trunk described by length and diameter attached to the trunk are branches up to the second order branches are defined at two different scales at the coarse scale branches are described by their total length and diameter while at the fine scale branches are described as topologically connected smaller segments this multi scale approach optimizes both speed of the ecophysiological simulations and visual aspects see appendix a for more details located at the end of each trunk or branch apical meristems sense the local environment and control primary growth leaf compartments are connected with second order branches and are conceptualized as aggregations of leaves within the cubic voxels leaf compartments comprise leaves and active pipes which represent the sapwood connecting leaves and roots this means that leaf compartments form leaf pipe elements following the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 fig 1b each tree component is characterized by state variables table 1 including its absolute 3d position and its topological position within its tree based on this information the 3d structure of each tree can be deduced fig 1c structural tree growth results from creation loss and dynamic changes of tree components structural tree growth is driven by the 3d distribution of light within the forest stand and the functional and the structural traits of trees table 1 while the functional traits regulate light mediated carbon balance the structural traits reflect inherent architectural parameters defining the tree s structural organization this includes for instance branching angles or average internode lengths see appendix a submodel structural growth for more details some functional trait combinations promote effective carbon assimilation under low light conditions allowing growth and survival in the dark understory other trait combinations may be more favorable under high light conditions consequently forest dynamics results from structural growth of individual trees with different traits competing for space and light whose distribution in turn is influenced by the forest structure fig 1d 2 1 3 initialization at the beginning of each simulation a pool of virtual species is generated with the number of species defined by the user each virtual species is characterized by a set of functional and structural traits all species specific traits are listed in table 1 trait correlations have been used in other models to define species or plant functional types e g may et al 2009 in our model while the structural traits are assumed to be uncorrelated and randomly selected from ranges defined during experimental design functional leaf traits integrate between trait correlations following the les marino et al 2010 wright et al 2004 the les quantifies relationships between leaf economics traits such as the sla leaf lifespan or mass based photosynthetic capacity these leaf traits co vary strongly and in multidimensional trait space most of the variation is explained by a single principal axis wright et al 2004 this axis can be considered as a spectrum ranging from leaves with low sla values low photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates but long lifespans to leaves with high sla values high photosynthetic capacities and respiration rates but short lifespans to obtain a set of leaf traits the values for sla are randomly selected from ranges defined during experimental design and the values of the other traits are determined based on between trait correlations meaning that each set of leaf traits thus represents a position on the les furthermore functional traits characterizing specific photosynthetic light response curves are also predicted from the leaf traits of the les following marino et al 2010 appendix a table a 2 2 1 4 process overview and scheduling after initialization light distribution tree establishment tree growth and tree mortality are simulated successively fig 2 the 3d distribution of light intensity is calculated via the lambert beer light extinction law considering the distribution of leaf area see section light distribution in appendix a for details subsequently establishment of tree seedlings is simulated as a neutral process depending on an average user defined neutral germination rate in number of seedlings per ha new seedlings are initialized at random positions each seedling is randomly assigned to a species from the species pool seedlings with unsuitable traits for local voxel conditions may die due to carbon starvation tree growth is simulated in three subsequent sub processes i apical control dominance ii carbon balance iii structural growth fig 2 i controlled by plant hormones carbon allocation to apical meristems can either be inhibited apical control or intensified apical dominance wilson 2000 these processes control how much of the carbon assimilated by photosynthesis is invested into primary growth of branches and the trunk in this model apical control is considered for branches branches inhibit carbon allocation to primary growth when branch apical meristems are 1 deeply shaded i e if the carbon balance under local light conditions at the meristem is negative or 2 when branches from neighboring trees grow into the same voxel hence light and space competition take place at the branch level apical dominance in contrast is considered at the trunk level i e carbon allocation to trunk apical meristems is intensified under shade as a mechanism to quickly reach higher potentially less shaded zones poorter 1999 poorter et al 2011 by influencing the within tree carbon allocation the processes of apical dominance control slightly affect local carbon balance the next tree growth subprocess ii local carbon balance is simulated at the level of leaf compartments apart from the usually only small percentage of carbon assimilated by leaf compartment and allocated to primary growth influenced by apical control dominance leaf compartments are assumed to be independent from each other here we follow the physiological principles of module autonomy stating that different tree parts may be regarded as autonomous modules sprugel et al 1991 this means that no carbon flow occurs between leaf compartments and thus assimilated carbon is locally reinvested local re investment means investments in leaf biomass within the leaf compartment which however are coupled with investments in connected woody pipes following the pipe model theory shinozaki et al 1964 for each new unit of leaf biomass an equivalent unit of pipes connecting leaves and roots has to be grown both construction and respiration costs for leaves and pipes are considered which for the latter depend on the within tree position of the leaf compartment the carbon balance is central for the next and final tree growth sub process structural growth iii in the structural growth sub process secondary and primary growth of branches and trunks are calculated the sum of new pipes over all leaf compartments connected to a branch yields the branch diameter increment and the sum over all leaf compartments of a tree yields the trunk diameter increment primary growth in turn is calculated based on the secondary growth using species specific allometric relationships between diameter and length height primary growth causes the establishment of new apical branch segments and sometimes new lateral branch segments which may be associated with new leaf compartments and apical meristems in addition trees may also shed branches if all photosynthetically active leaf compartments are lost after tree growth tree mortality is simulated via different ecophysiological and environmental processes trees may die due to carbon starvation when they have lost all leaves in addition we integrated a biomass dependent mortality rate according to the metabolic theory of ecology brown et al 2004 this rate accounts for processes not explicitly simulated e g herbivory pathogens and assumes that the chance of survival increases non linearly with tree biomass furthermore gap dynamics are also important in tropical forests brokaw 1985 therefore falling dead trees may kill neighboring trees and create gaps after each of the processes illustrated in fig 2 the state variables of all tree components are updated synchronously for more details see appendix a 2 2 outputs the updated state variables can be saved as model outputs in annual time steps at all hierarchical levels tree components individual trees forest stand output data at the lowest hierarchical level contain the state variables including spatial coordinates from these variables outputs at higher hierarchical levels are deduced for instance the crown dimensions of a tree result from size and position of its trunk and branch segments likewise forest attributes e g aboveground biomass or the leaf area index are calculated by aggregating all relevant components of all trees a list of important outputs is given in fig 3 an exhaustive list is available in appendix a table a 5 in addition data on the 3d light distribution tree mortality and species traits may be monitored visualization options are described in appendix a 2 3 experimental design model parameterization and validation our experimental design aimed at finding values of model parameters that yield realistic reproductions of tree and forest structure and dynamics model parameters can be grouped into three categories i global parameters ii functional and structural traits and iii external environmental drivers see appendix a tables a 6 and a 8 for full list of parameters we first defined values for those global parameters whose uncertainty according to literature data was low for the functional and structural traits value ranges instead of single values were identified as simulated forest communities with a reasonable trait space should reflect the trait space of a species rich forest as the natural distribution of functional traits used in this study i e sla and wood density is well studied e g baker et al 2004 patiño et al 2012 and structural traits are easy to interpret characteristics of tree structure such as branching angles or internode lengths reasonable trait spaces could be retrieved from the literature nevertheless 12 parameters with uncertain values remained which were thus treated as free parameters to be calibrated table 2 these free parameters were either global parameters or external environmental drivers i e light conditions site index and for most of these parameters ecologically meaningful value ranges could be identified table 2 we used key ideas of the pattern oriented modelling pom framework to parameterize and validate our model grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 the rationale behind pom is to reduce the uncertainty in model structure and parameters based on a multi criteria assessment i e by comparing model results simultaneously with multiple ecological patterns at different hierarchical levels and scales grimm et al 2005 wang et al 2018 the more patterns reproduced by a model the higher the likelihood that integrated bottom up mechanisms are robust and ecologically meaningful the hierarchical structure of our approach linking tree components individual trees and forest stands suits the pom framework accordingly we included a large number of patterns at the tree and forest stand level and tested if these patterns can be reproduced simultaneously we opted to calibrate the model manually for the following two reasons first we included some qualitative patterns that require visual inspection second we had no access to cluster computers and consequently a full factorial calibration or advanced parameter estimation techniques e g bayesian calibration were not feasible this is because the model runtime scales with the number of tree segments and was approximately 30 min for a 100 year simulation run of a 50 50 m forest in dynamic equilibrium state on an intel i7 quadcore processor 4th generation the model mostly uses a single core i e parallel simulations on multi core processors are possible the manual calibration started by varying each free parameter over its estimated range while keeping the other parameters constant at mean values to assess the influence of the parameter on the ecological patterns as described below based on these results the parameters were fine tuned by recursively adjusting the parameter values and comparing the resulting patterns using the information obtained in each step in the next step this recursive process was repeated until we found an appropriate combination of parameter values that reproduced the ecological pattern at the tree and forest level simultaneously in the following these patterns are described 2 3 1 tree level at the tree level we evaluated simulated growth of individual trees for each parameter combination a visual analysis of ontogenetic tree growth trajectories in combination with an analysis of the changes in height and diameter biomass and productivity during tree ontogeny served as first indicator for the structural realism of 3d tree growth furthermore for each unique combination of global parameters we systematically analyzed how changes in species traits and environmental conditions influence tree growth to cover the trait and environmental space in tropical forests we varied each of these factors within their natural ranges table 2 while keeping the other factors constant at intermediate levels due to the size and longevity of trees controlled experiments on changes in growth rates and morphology over a tree s lifespan are practically impossible consequently data equivalent to our simulation experiment is missing nevertheless based on numerous field and theoretical studies there is an understanding of several qualitative and quantitative patterns during tree ontogeny for instance while the height growth of undisturbed trees is expected to continue at decreasing rates until reaching maximum height diameter growth rates tend to peak at a certain height or age clark and clark 1999 in addition diameter growth rates maximum tree heights and partly also maximum tree ages are well studied chao et al 2008 clark and clark 2001 martı nez ramos and alvarez buylla 1998 2 3 2 stand level at the stand level we evaluated model performance in reproducing the general structure and dynamics of tropical forests comparative studies have shown substantial differences in the characteristics of tropical forests between continents e g feldpausch et al 2011 and in this study we focused on the well studied neotropical lowland forests while typical ranges of attributes of mature lowland forests such as the basal area or net primary production per hectare are relatively well known long term data to which the model could be fitted remain scarce considering this limitation we estimated ranges of 12 important attributes characterizing both forest structure and dynamics based on a literature review see table 3 and appendix a table a 7 for more details we excluded data from climatically extreme or recently disturbed sites the estimated ranges should be representative for average lowland forests in dynamic equilibrium state we assessed model performance by simulating 1 ha forest plots starting from bare soil for 500 years and calculated the model performance criterion αm that tests if the attributes of the simulated forest in dynamic equilibrium state are within the empirical ranges 1 α m i n t m i n t m a x β i t t m a x t m i n n where t min is the time after which an equilibrium state is expected here t min 200 years t max is the total number of years simulated here t max 500 n is the total number of forest attributes here n 12 and β i t is a boolean variable describing for each attribute at each time step if the attribute value is within the estimated range β i t 1 or not β i t 0 the optimal values of α m 1 can be reached if all attributes of the simulated forest are within the estimated ranges continuously from t min to t max this approach assumes that a sufficiently stable equilibrium state is modelled and the time to reach this state when starting from bare soil is thus an additional aspect we considered as validation criterion in addition we evaluated whether our model adequately reproduced more complex patterns at the forest level this mainly involved qualitative comparisons between simulations and observations based on visualized patterns the following patterns were considered i crown architectures of trees in stands usually change markedly with tree height and while the crown area usually shows a non linear relationship with height crown width and branching height are commonly rather linearly correlated with height alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 ii the vertical leaf area density in undisturbed forests within stands often peaks in the upper canopy sometimes with an additional peak in the understory stark et al 2012 taubert et al 2015 iii the height diameter relationship is a typical characteristic of a forest and for the neotropics this relationship is best described using a three parameter exponential equation with an asymptotic maximum height of 38 8 m banin et al 2012 iv the frequency distributions of tree diameter height and age are typically right skewed when considering all trees in a stand campbell et al 1986 worbes et al 2003 when considering only trees above 10 cm in diameter at breast height dbh a normal or slightly right skewed distribution is commonly observed oliveira filho et al 1994 worbes et al 2003 to visualize the patterns we used simulated data after reaching dynamic equilibrium state in intervals of 50 years to avoid temporal autocorrelation 2 3 3 best parameter combination with the best parameter combination we performed 10 replicate simulations for 1 ha forest plots to demonstrate our hypotheses that our fsfm successfully integrates tree level dynamics and species rich forest stands while examining the effects of model inherent stochasticity however as the patterns were consistent across all replicates the results of a single model run are shown here to highlight temporal fluctuations 3 results we found an appropriate combination of parameter values that reproduced the ecological pattern at the tree and forest level simultaneously table 2 appendix a table a 6 the emergent patterns using this best combination of parameter values are described below additionally the effects of variations of the free model parameters and the two main traits sla wood density on forest model results are shown in table 4 3 1 tree level tree level simulations revealed that under constant environmental conditions and without competition tree growth could be divided into three successive life stages fig 4 in early developmental stages there was a rapid increase in height and diameter as well as continuously increasing net primary production rates in this stage all major branches were foliated fig 4a subsequently the lower branches began to shed leaves fig 4a accompanied with lower increments in height and diameter and reduced net primary production fig 4b d this stage ended when the tree reached its maximum height see below for more details on maximum tree height in the subsequent senescence stage height and diameter growth ceased and net primary production decreased via loss of photosynthetically active leaf biomass the leaf loss continued until the tree ultimately died from carbon starvation i e emergent senescence when grown under constant external conditions species generally followed the illustrated tree growth pattern over their life spans however tree traits and environmental conditions had a large influence on all aspects of growth fig 5 species with high sla showed high initial growth rates fig 5c and rapidly reached their maximum height consequently they entered the senescence stage after a shorter time and died at a comparably young age fig 5a d in contrast low sla species had a lower growth rate but were able to maintain their growth rate for a longer time they reached larger maximum heights later and had longer life spans wood density also affected life history growth mainly by influencing maximum height fig 5e h both external factors light and site index affected tree growth in a similar way fig 5k o due to the trade off between carbon gain and carbon costs lower light and site index values also decreased maximum height in contrast to sla variations in external factors influenced maximum height but longevity was only slightly affected fig 5i p the potential maximum height of a tree and the light compensation point for each leaf compartment were emergent properties fig 6 see appendix a eq 41 for details on maximum height calculation both the internal traits of a tree and the external environmental conditions determined the maximum attainable height which generally decreased with increasing sla and wood density fig 6a and increased with light and site conditions fig 6b the light compensation point of each leaf compartment was a function of its pipe length as construction and maintenance costs increased fig 6c with short pipe lengths species with high sla values had a lower light compensation point than those with low sla however the compensation points of high sla species steeply increased with increasing pipe length while the increase was shallower for low sla species fig 6c consequently the latter ones had lower light compensation points already above ca 4 m i e in the understory fig 6c 3 2 stand level starting from bare soil the simulated forest increased in stem number above ground biomass and basal area reaching a dynamic equilibrium after ca 80 100 years fig 7 in this equilibrium state all 12 monitored forest attributes were within the ranges of typical neotropical lowland forest αm 1 see 1 ha stand result in fig 7 fluctuations around the equilibrium increased with decreasing stand area as the relative effect of gap creating mortality events was stronger fig 7 in dynamic equilibrium state tree dbh height and age showed right skewed distributions fig 8 trees reached maximum diameters of 100 cm maximum heights of 50 m and maximum ages of 250 years when only considering stems 10 cm in dbh height and age were nearly normally distributed fig 8b c on log scale tree numbers decreased almost linearly with dbh and age with deviations from this pattern only at large size age classes in contrast tree height peaked between 25 and 35 m fig 8b on log log scale tree height distribution was linear for small individuals but became curvilinear at larger diameters fig 8d crown architectures changed significantly with tree height fig 9 a c there was a positive linear relationship between tree height and crown width fig 9b and an exponential relationship between tree height and branching height fig 9a as well as between tree height and crown area fig 9c however due to differences in functional and structural traits and variations in ontogenetic stages there was substantial scatter around the average trends visualizations of the simulated forest stand illustrate the level of detail and structural realisms of the model fig 9e f the height diameter relationship deviated slightly from the average allometry previously reported for the neotropics banin et al 2012 and overestimated the asymptotic maximum height by 3 m fig 10 a the average leaf area density profile of the simulated forest showed a unimodal distribution in which the leaf area density peaked in the mid canopy between 15 and 25 m fig 10b 4 discussion when comparing our model with other individual or cohort based forest models e g huth and ditzer 2000 köhler and huth 1998 liu and ashton 1998 phillips et al 2004 two main differences emerge first our model simulates 3d tree structures in detail including branch segments up to the second order and within tree leaf distribution at high resolution here at 1 m3 this allows three dimensional light and space competition within and between individuals second tree species are not a priori classified into distinct functional groups e g köhler and huth 1998 tietjen and huth 2006 but drawn from the full continuous trait space of leaf and wood traits here as suggested by wright et al 2004 the leaf investment strategy of each species depends on the position on the continuous les growth rate shade tolerance and maximum height of each tree species typically defined a priori in other models emerge in our approach from the leaf investment strategy by combining functional and structural realism at the level of tree components our model reproduced a high number of real world patterns at the tree and the stand level this demonstrates the suitability of our ecophysiological approach and that life history variation among tree species emerge from their differences in leaf functional strategy 4 1 tree level variations in leaf traits had a strong impact on life history pattern in our model species with a high sla were characterized by faster growth shorter life spans lower potential heights fig 5 and lower shade tolerance fig 6c all of these characteristics are typical for pioneer species which have significantly higher sla than shade tolerant species in nature kitajima 1994 rijkers et al 2000 with decreasing sla life history characteristics changed towards those of climax species several studies indicate that the transition from fast growing short lived pioneers to slow growing long lived shade tolerant species is indeed rather continuous poorter and bongers 2006 wright et al 2003 and our bottom up ecophysiological approach supports the notion that leaf trait trade offs influence the ecological strategy of trees at first glance it may be counterintuitive that pioneer species with their generally high slas are shade intolerant a high sla means a high photosynthetically active leaf area per dry mass investment evans and poorter 2001 and observed growth rates of pioneer seedlings in shade were indeed higher than those of shade tolerant species kitajima 1994 furthermore as shade leaves within individual trees generally have a higher sla than sun leaves markesteijn et al 2007 rozendaal et al 2006 a positive relationship between sla and shade tolerance could be expected however the increased efficiency of light capture with increased sla comes at a cost as such leaves are more susceptible to herbivory and physical damage and hence are short lived coley 1983 wright and cannon 2001 in our approach both such leaf trait correlations and the woody pipes connected with the leaves are considered with construction and maintenance costs increasing with increasing pipe length hence pipe length which is determined by the within tree position of a leaf compartment is an additional factor for resource use efficiency we found that a low sla was more efficient under low light conditions i e had a lower light compensation point as long as pipe length exceeded 4 m fig 6c this means that in line with observations species with low sla emerged as more shade tolerant in our ecophysiological approach wood density influenced tree growth much less than leaf traits the most obvious effect was an increase in maximum height dbh and dbh growth with decreasing wood density fig 5 observed relationships between maximum tree height and wood density are inconsistent across studies and while the trends observed for iberian canopy tree and southeastern asian tree species agree with our simulation results king et al 2006 poorter et al 2012 other studies found no significant relationships wright et al 2010 or even positive trends osunkoya et al 2007 our ecophysiological processes are carbon based and by decreasing the construction and maintenances costs per volume of wood low wood densities are advantageous and allow trees to grow taller additionally to pipe costs pipe reuse might be also key to both dbh growth and allometric height growth thus decreasing pipe reuse might further increase the negative relationship between size and wood density however low wood densities usually decrease mechanical stability and increase vulnerability to hydraulic failure anten and schieving 2010 hacke et al 2001 such trade offs among wood traits influence tree architecture and may have adverse effects on the maximum attainable height van gelder et al 2006 furthermore correlations among wood traits might also explain why increasing mortality rates with decreasing wood density are consistently reported chao et al 2008 visser et al 2016 wright et al 2010 a pattern we did not obtain from the simulations fig 5 thus only considering wood density is not sufficient to reproduce all interspecific differences related to wood traits moreover empirical data on pipe reuse across species might be highly informative consequently our fsfm may be further improved by integrating additional mechanisms such as dynamic reuse or mechanical and hydraulic stability of wood pipes site quality characterized by the dimensionless site index parameter positively influenced tree growth rates and maximum tree heights fig 5i l we were not explicitly integrating water nutrient cycles or temperature dependencies in our fsfm hence the site index represents a proxy for the strength of several factors limiting tree growth such as low water availabilities low temperatures or poor soil conditions such limiting factors are generally associated with decreasing productivity and lower tree canopy heights girardin et al 2010 2013 pan et al 2013 therefore site index variations in our ecophysiological approach generate tree dynamics that are qualitatively in accordance with these observations changing light conditions had a similar effect on tree growth and the increase in growth rates with light intensity emerging from our fsfm is consistent with observed light dependent responses of most tropical species kobe 1999 philipson et al 2014 rüger et al 2011 irrespective of environmental conditions and functional traits tree growth was size dependent with characteristic ontogenetic trajectories figs 4 5 a significant effect of size on growth rates has also been observed for most tree species in field studies e g iida et al 2014 rüger et al 2011 however growth rates may both increase and decrease with diameter rüger et al 2011 2012 or responses may be humped shaped clark and clark 1999 davies 2001 these observed differences may be related to species specific variability biased data towards small sized and young trees or incomplete or unbalanced data sets bowman et al 2013 most recent studies however showed a generalized increase in aboveground biomass production with tree size across several biomes even when the effects of competition were excluded stephenson et al 2014 when comparing the growth trajectories in our model with this observation it should be noted that the entire theoretical life cycle is shown here fig 4 in reality background tree mortality often caused by environmental conditions negative interactions and disturbances arellano et al 2019 das et al 2016 ferreira and laurance 1997 prevents most trees from completing their entire theoretically possible life cycle this means that possible reductions in productivity in the senescence phase might thus be underrepresented in tree growth data from natural forests apart from that the model agrees well with observations in the first stage of tree development meaning that until reaching around 80 of the maxium tree height or dbh the npp increases with tree size fig 4 during this stage the simulated npp increase is linked to an increase in tree s total leaf area which is also regarded as main factor for the generally increasing carbon accumulation with tree size in stephenson et al 2014 however after raching a maximum in our model the total leaf area and the npp decrease figs 4 5 there are two main reasons for this model bahaviour first the trees grow strictly according to their structural traits without optimizing their crown structures according to the light and space conditions second we introduced a parameter that limits the leaf production per leaf compartment a lprodmax with the effect that after reaching this maximum no new leaves are produced even if the environmental conditions are optimal in reality trees use a variety of different strategies to optimize their carbon budget they can activate resting meristems and optimize their crown strucutures wood traits e g pipe costs and pipe reuse and leaf traits e g sla adaptation with light level the lack of such mechanisms in our model may explain why the modelled trees differ from observations and expectations particularly when growing close to their maximum heights when following trees over their entire theoretical life cycle there should most likely be a point in their ontogenetic development when they are not able to increase their growth rates any further and instead show decreasing rates e g clark and clark 1999 hérault et al 2011 however this period of increasing growth rates should be longer than in our model integrating optimization mechanisms into our ecophysiological framework could improve the tree growth trajectories and thus could be considered as scope for future studies 4 2 stand level as first indication for structural realism emerging from the integrated ecophysiological processes a dynamic equilibrium was reached it is generally assumed that under constant environmental conditions carbon gains and losses are relatively balanced in old growth forests resulting in gap driven oscillations around an equilibrium biomass level galbraith et al 2014 whitmore 1990 in accordance with simulations by chambers et al 2013 gap formation produced stronger oscillations in smaller stands fig 7 the time required to reach equilibrium biomass after deforestation differs with environmental conditions ranging from 40 to 60 years in high latitudes puerto rico mitchell aide et al 2000 marin spiotta et al 2007 to 190 years in amazonian forests columbia and venezuela saldarriaga et al 1988 please note that we only consider equilibrium biomass here other aspects such as the composition or size structure of the forest which are typically also linked with a dynamic equilibrium state are ignored hence the time span between 80 and 100 years emerging in our simulations lies within the reported range but may be too fast for equatorial forests in this regard it is noteworthy that our experimental design does not follow typical succession as we seed the plot with all species from the species pool i e plots are seeded at a high functional diversity in fact such strategy of initial seeding with high diversity 50 species and mixed functional types has been successfully used in restoration in neotropical forests with near old growth biomass conditions being reached within 80 85 years see rodrigues et al 2009 for a review furthermore the time needed to reach dynamic equilibrium in a simulation model normally depends on the initial conditions and speed of internal dynamics this is strongly controlled by species trait composition and productivity which in our model is mostly given by the site index and a decreasing site index and decreasing mean sla would slow the dynamics table 4 all these considerations suggest that 100 years to reach equilibrium biomass in a highly productive forest is not unrealistic however please also note that we paid more attention to model calibration in quasi equilibrium state than in the succession period forest succession could be analyzed in detail in a further study our model simulates forests at a relatively high level of detail for validation we used basic ideas of the pom framework and conducted a multi criteria assessment using many patterns at the tree and the forest level as criteria in dynamic equilibrium all 12 important forest attributes fell within the observed ranges of neotropical lowland forests fig 7 and several complex patterns at the forest level could also be realistically reproduced figs 8 10 it has been shown that it is often advantageous to use many different patterns in model calibration and validation even if individual patterns are rather vague and might be represented by ranges instead of exact values using many attributes patterns in reasonable ranges instead of reproducing some attributes with a higher accuracy can reduce uncertainties and result in models with a high level of structural realism wang et al 2018 wiegand et al 2004 our main goal here was to demonstrate the structural realism of our model i e its ability to reproduce general patterns and dynamics of neotropical forests and for this reason we opted for this approach alternatively one could validate our model against observed forest attributes of individual forest plots however there are only few plots with repeated inventories over the decadal timescales relevant here and these focus on only a few key forest attributes e g bradford et al 2014 condit 1995 the smaller number of patterns in the alternative parameterization strategy would have increased the risk of equifinality i e the likelihood that the model would reproduce similar patterns via different parameter combinations and thus of being structurally less realistic the right skewed tree diameter distribution fig 8a is consistent with observations hector et al 2011 oliveira filho et al 1994 simulated normal or slightly skewed distributions for height and age of trees 10 cm in dbh fig 8b c also agree with empirical studies adekunle et al 2013 campbell et al 1986 oliveira filho et al 1994 worbes et al 2003 as diameter height and age are usually correlated similar frequency distribution of these attributes can be expected interestingly the height distribution deviated from the age distribution and showed a slight hump between 25 and 35 m fig 8b we speculate that the crowns of these trees in the upper canopy are well illuminated and less exposed to between crown competition for space consequently mortality by carbon starvation decreases explaining why the otherwise generally negative trend is temporarily stopped in this height class the metabolic theory of ecology predicts a linear decrease in stem diameter frequency on a log log scale muller landau et al 2006 and enquist et al 2009 however found deviations from this theoretical prediction particularly among the larger diameter classes whose frequency was lower than predicted interestingly our model shows similar deviations fig 8d enquist et al 2009 speculated that other sources of mortality than competitive thinning which is the reason for the predicted linear trend for instance wind damages lightning strikes or diseases are particularly severe in larger size classes in our fsfm trees growing at their maximum height enter senescence which inevitably ends with death this emergent behavior increased mortality probability of very large trees and thus is close to observations while still considering metabolic driven mortality the linear increase in crown width with height is in accordance with approximately linear trends observed in many tropical tree species alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 king 1996 interestingly a bulge in the crown width tree height relationship was observed for tall trees 30 m fig 9b indicating a disproportionate increase in crown width when trees rise above the canopy king 1996 made similar observations for larger trees potentially growing above the canopy crown development of such emergent trees is less constrained by competition for space and our approach can reproduce such plastic crown responses with an average crown width of 10 m at a height of 20 m our model only slightly overestimates crown dimension compared to observations which are in a reported range of 7 9 m alves and santos 2002 king 1996 due to the relatively simple integration of space competition in this model particularly ignoring wind driven crown movement the area of overlap between two crowns may be larger than in nature leading to wider crowns branching height showed a slightly curvilinear trend with tree height fig 9a although most studies reported linear species specific relationships e g alves and santos 2002 iida et al 2011 the average slopes of simulated and observed relationships agree quite well compared with the other crown measures branching height was less strongly correlated with tree height fig 9 in our model branch growth followed the architecture defined by structural traits and branch shedding resulted from physiological processes these processes lead to a distinct species specific branching height during tree ontogeny fig 4 which could be modified however by competition and environmental variables appendix a fig a 10 in real trees branching architecture is a complex trait and the processes of branch growth and shedding are likely related to within tree carbon optimization farnsworth and niklas 1995 for example the complex crowns of emergent trees often develop through light mediated activation of dormant buds barthélémy and caraglio 2007 hallé et al 1978 due to such mechanisms which are not yet integrated in our fsfm the correlation between branching height and tree height is probably stronger in real forests unfortunately we are not aware of any study reporting the strength of correlation between branching height and tree height at stand scale which would allow direct comparisons the simulated leaf area density peaked at 20 m fig 10b which is in accordance with observations of the canopy in neotropical lowland forests on barro colorado island taubert et al 2015 and near manaus stark et al 2012 in the latter study an additional increase in leaf area density near the forest floor was observed probably due to herbaceous vegetation and shrubs which are not included in our model although vertical leaf area profiles have not been as extensively studied as other forest attributes a leaf area maximum in the canopy layer is generally expected for undisturbed old growth forests and our simulations are in line with this expectation interestingly in a lowland forest analyzed by stark et al 2012 the leaf area density peaked in the lower canopy around 10 m these authors considered past disturbances and the resulting non equilibrium forest state as a possible cause of the deviating pattern analyzing the effect of disturbance regimes on the stand level vertical leaf area distribution may thus be an interesting future application of our model the asymptotic height of the diameter height relationship observed here 38 8 m fig 10a is close to the observed mean for neotropical forests 35 8 6 0 m banin et al 2012 however the shape of the simulated relationship differed from the observed average trend and the simulated height at smaller diameter classes was slightly overestimated fig 10a in our model height scales with diameter to the power 2 3 controlled by species specific shape parameters trees only deviate from their species specific relationship under low light conditions increased height growth or at maximum height cessation of height growth in nature trees show a plastic response to environmental factors such as light precipitation or stand density which can alter the specific allometric relationships banin et al 2012 feldpausch et al 2011 trees may for instance cease height growth when growing as emergents under full light including more such mechanism in fsfms may thus improve the emergent allometric scaling 4 3 limitations we were able to find parameter values yielding realistic ecological patterns for our fsfm by manually applying pattern oriented modelling grimm et al 2005 grimm and railsback 2012 however the problem of equifinality persists i e we cannot rule out the possibility that other parameter value combinations would lead to similarly good or better results inverse modelling techniques such as bayesian approaches e g martínez et al 2011 matsushita et al 2015 could help to explore the entire parameter space more systematically and to quantifying local global minima parameter uncertainties and collinearities among parameters however due to the considerable computation time of our model and the lack of plot data spanning the entire set of variables evaluated here such systematic model calibration is currently challenging future studies could perform global sensitivity analyses if computationally feasible to investigate the effects of parameters on tree and forest patterns and possible nonlinear interactions pianosi et al 2016 nevertheless that fact that we found a suitable parameter value combination indicates that our ecophysiological framework can generate tree and forest structures that are largely realistic still potential functional inconsistencies e g fast senescence and decrease in biomass production might have been affected by optimizing for quasi equilibrium dynamics in this sense follow up studies could concentrate on optimization of both succession and equilibrium patterns as well as forest stand level functional patterns hence further ecophysiological insights might be gained when empirical structural and functional data becomes available at both succession and equilibrium phases and at the same structural level than our fsfm particularly informative data would be time series data for several tree components or for detailed tree and forest attributes of the same forest stands e g via repeated lidar data some ecological patterns were not accurately reproduced by our model for instance trees in natural forests commonly show fast initial height growth rates but when crowns are well illuminated they tend to cease height growth and continue to mostly grow in diameter e g matsushita et al 2015 moreover biomass production rates might increase over a longer period than calibrated here stephenson et al 2014 in this model height and diameter growth are coupled more tightly and the time frame over which high diameter growth rates at large heights can be maintained appears larger in nature clark and clark 1999 than in the ecophysiological dependencies depicted in our framework this deviation may be explained by intra individual trait plasticity in our fsfm each individual is characterized by non variable traits whereas in nature the sla is typically adjusted to local light conditions markesteijn et al 2007 rozendaal et al 2006 furthermore trees can modify their architecture to avoid self shading of branches and to maximize carbon gain in addition activation of dormant buds is regarded as important additional branching mechanism hallé et al 1978 osada 2011 sterck and bongers 2001 if such plastic responses were integrated larger trees would likely use resources more efficiently ultimately maintaining higher growth rates over a longer period and reaching larger diameters and ages 5 conclusion and perspectives the position of leaf traits along the leaf economics spectrum determined the maximum height and age size dependent growth rates and shade tolerance as well as a smooth continuous transition from fast growing short lived pioneers to slow growing long lived climax species as seen in the tree level patterns when varying sla these emergent results were remarkably consistent with well known functional tree types therefore our model reveals a fundamental role of leaf traits in determining a life history growth patterns of trees and b structural functional and temporal dynamics of species rich tropical forests bottom up functional structural tree and forest models thus have the potential to increase our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tree and forest dynamics ecologists are able to empirically measure processes at lower organizational levels e g photosynthesis at the leaf scale or to track some tree variables over a limited time e g diameter growth but it is yet virtually impossible to record 3d tree growth as a whole in this situation functional structural forest models can be helpful tools to test and evaluate the consequences of low level mechanisms on whole tree growth patterns so far fsfms have not received much attention but we indicate that they offer ample opportunities for future studies both at the tree and forest levels the explicit linkage between function and structure allows to represent internal processes like carbon allocation or water transport not yet integrated in our model but also competition for space and light in more detail than in other common forest models while large scale simulations are challenging due to excessive computation time fsfms are well suited for detailed simulation experiments at the stand level for instance the importance of within individual trait plasticity functional or structural on the carbon budget at the tree and stand level could be explored the importance of frequent disturbances for forest stability and stand level trait distribution could also be assessed our model allows to simulate functionally and structurally diverse tree communities representing species rich forests the role of the functional and structural diversity for carbon allocation or other aspects of forest development could be explored further other aspects such as roots and water uptake are currently not integrated but the integration of such missing mechanisms could facilitate the development of next generation predictive forest models in which tree performance emerges directly and exclusively from continuous functional traits moreover coupling fstms with more explicit demographic models e g rüger et al 2020 could also provide valuable insights particularly concerning succesional dynamics finally we highlight the potential of fsfms for future model based studies of canopy dwelling organisms tropical forest canopies harbor numerous arboreal animals and epiphytic plants but accessing their dynamic habitat is logistically challenging fsfms provide information on 3d forest dynamics and microclimatic changes which can be used as input for studies on other organisms for instance our knowledge on long term dynamics of vascular epiphytes is still very scarce and by coupling a fsfms with an epiphyte model the importance of 3d forest dynamics on epiphyte communities could be investigated such integrative modelling studies are particularly timely as tropical forest dynamics are already changing in response to atmospheric changes and a more detailed understanding of the response of canopy dwelling organisms is paramount and urgently needed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
