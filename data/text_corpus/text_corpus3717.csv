18585,using cross sectional data for making ecological inference started as a practical means of pooling data to enable meaningful empirical model development for example limnologists routinely use sample averages from numerous individual lakes to examine patterns across lakes the basic assumption behind the use of cross lake data is often that responses within and across lakes are identical as data from multiple study units across a wide spatiotemporal scale are increasingly accessible for researchers an assessment of this assumption is now feasible in this study we demonstrate that this assumption is usually unjustified due largely to a statistical phenomenon known as the simpson s paradox through comparisons of a commonly used empirical model of the effect of nutrients on algal growth developed using several data sets we discuss the cognitive importance of distinguishing factors affecting lake eutrophication operating at different spatial and temporal scales our study proposes the use of the bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to properly structure the data analysis when data from multiple lakes are employed keywords nla lagosse multilevel hierarchical model chlorophyll a 1 introduction ecologists have a long history of using data from multiple lakes summarized at various levels of spatial and temporal aggregation to estimate empirical models vollenweider 1968 1975 schindler 1977 wagner et al 2011 dillon and rigler 1973 set an early precedent using reported sample averages from a combination of 46 north american lakes lake years and segments of lakes to estimate a simple linear regression model relating chlorophyll a c h l a concentration to total phosphorus tp concentration numerous papers followed applying regression approaches to estimate similar models using data from other lakes sometimes comparing their estimated equations to the equation obtained by dillon and rigler jones and bachmann 1976 canfield and bachmann 1981 canfield 1983 prepas and trew 1983 the practice of estimating models using data from multiple lakes is common fostered by increases in computational capacity and corresponding advances in statistical software which now facilitates the estimation of nonlinear models using large data sets filstrup et al 2014 these approaches are typically based on an implicit assumption that the c h l a and tp means from multiple lakes can be described by a dose response equation e g mccauley et al 1989 such as 1 log μ c h l a β 0 β 1 log μ t p ε where μ c h l a is the mean of chla concentration for a specified time period such as summer of a particular year and lake or lake segment μ t p is the mean tp concentration for a corresponding but not necessarily the same time period spring tp may be related to summer c h l a for example β 0 and β 1 are the intercept and slope parameters respectively and ε is the model error term usually assumed to be normally distributed with a constant variance qian 2016 because the underlying true mean values are always unknown sample averages are typically used as surrogates although occasionally sample medians have been used reckhow 1993 this regression based modeling approach has influenced lake management practices beyond the modeling of the c h l a nutrient relationship for example yuan and pollard 2017 used data from the national lake assessment nla a cross lake data set including randomly selected lakes in all 48 contiguous states of the united states pollard et al 2018 to develop a dose response model to describe the relationship between microcystin mc concentration and total nitrogen tn concentration the resulting model was used to propose a national nitrogen criterion for controlling harmful algal blooms the implicit premise of this approach is that a relationship estimated using sample averages from many lakes can be applied to set criteria for individual lakes because criteria compliance assessment is typically lake specific however we see two potential problems with this supposition 1 using sample averages as surrogates for the true unknown means violates two assumptions of regression analysis the variance of the response variable is constant and the predictor variables are observed without error on the one hand violating the equal variance assumption makes an estimated parameter and model error variances ambiguous it is unclear what uncertainty bands calculated from these values such as 95 confidence or prediction intervals represent on the other hands the consequence of violating the observation error assumption has been well studied it is widely recognized that this errors in variables problem causes slope coefficient estimators to be biased toward zero fuller 1987 carroll et al 2006 2 lake specific factors may cause individual lakes to exhibit differing stressor response relationships jones and bachmann 1976 wagner et al 2011 malve and qian 2006 using aggregated measures such as sample averages to estimate among lake relationships can produce results that poorly represent the individual lakes in the analysis in extreme cases the sign of the estimated slope parameter can be reversed fig 1 an example of simpson s paradox simpson 1951 clearly such a model should not be used to develop lake specific management strategies smith and shapiro 1981 reckhow 1993 liang et al 2018 simpson s paradox is a well discussed topic in social and political sciences an early case was the berkeley graduate admission paradox bickel et al 1975 where the campus wide aggregated graduate admission rate showed a bias against female applicants whereas disaggregated data showed neutral or favorable rates towards female applicants in most departments more recently the apparent switch of allegiance of the two major us political parties blue states are more affluent than red states was contradicted by data showing that wealthy people are more likely to vote for republican candidates gelman 2009 there are numerous statistical studies on the topic with two that are particularly helpful in developing strategies to avoid the paradox lindley and novick 1981 explained the paradox from a statistical inference perspective that is statistical inference is the application of a model developed based on data from the population to a new individual they suggested that the cause of simpson s paradox is that the new individual is not exchangeable with individuals in the population in fig 1 we present two groups of models models for individual lakes and the model of lake means from a statistical inference perspective both groups of models are valid but the models are intended for two different populations individual observations in a particular lake and lake means of c h l a and tp the model developed using lake means may give the false impression that c h l a and tp are inversely correlated such inverse correlations can often be explained by factors not included in the model as suggested by pearl et al 2016 simpson s paradox is a problem of confounding factors and thus can be easily resolved under a causal inference framework where effects of these confounders are explicitly accounted through the use of a causal diagram this conclusion is supported by many cross scale studies for example li et al 2019 show that parameters of a precipitation stream flow model vary by region due to region specific confounding factors in lake eutrophication studies quantifying the effects of nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous on algal growth is almost always the primary concern given that excessive nutrient input is a well established cause of algal proliferation if we can identify important confounding factors of this relationship than adopting the causal inference approach is likely more suitable when analyzing data from multiple lakes as in fig 1 each lake may have different confounding factors statistical inference using a hierarchical modeling approach such as the ones used in cha and stow 2014 may be more effective in this paper we use two large data sets to illustrate the potential hazards of using data from multiple lakes without properly addressing the among lake variation that is often defined as changes in regression model coefficients when the model is fit to data from different lakes the among lake variation can also be reflected in the changes in model coefficients when the same model is fit using two data sets collected using the same protocol even when the number of lakes included in the data is large we illustrate the effects of the among lake variation on regression based lake models by comparing models fit using lake sample averages from several cross sectional datasets we then present a bayesian hierarchical modeling bhm approach for the hierarchical data structure and an empirical bayes interpretation of a bhm s hyper parameter distribution to facilitate the use of cross lake data for lake specific inference as the bhm approach is consistent with the shrinkage estimator of stein s paradox qian et al 2015 our paper provides a stein s paradox solution to a simpson s paradox problem 2 materials and methods 2 1 data we used data from both the national lakes assessment nla conducted by the us environmental protection agency epa u s epa 2009 2016 and the lake multiscaled geospatial and temporal database lagosne soranno et al 2017 to illustrate potential statistical issues that may arise when analyzing large data sets encompassing multiple lakes the nla consists of 1 152 lakes sampled in 2007 nla2007 and 1 099 lakes sampled in 2012 nla2012 data were collected in each year using an identical sampling protocol lakes included in the nla were selected using a probabilistic sampling design in an attempt to accurately represent the overall population of lakes in the united states in contrast to the nla the lagosne database contains information on lakes with monitoring data from federal state or citizen science monitoring programs across 17 states in the northeast of the us we used 27 lakes from lagosne that were also included in nla2007 for detailed analysis these lakes have at least 10 observations in lagosne fig 2 the selection of these 27 lakes was for the purpose of methods comparison only a summary of the data is in table 1 these data sets were used to illustrate 1 the effects of among lake variation on regression based lake modeling and 2 the bayesian hierarchical modeling approach to properly account for the among lake variation the two nla data sets include a large number of lakes and were collected to be representative of lakes in the us using these two data sets we illustrate how the among lake variation may be reflected in regression models developed using the data sets separately and fit to the combined data to contrast the nla which includes only a small number of observations for each lake such that lake means are highly variable we compare the three models fit using nla data sets models developed based on nla2007 nla2012 and nla2007 nla2012 to a model fit to a subset of lagosne that includes 27 lakes that are represented in nla2007 with at least 10 observations in each lake for this comparison we use lake mean concentrations of c h l a tp and tn as the observations for developing the regression model discussed in the next section using data of the 27 lakes in lagosne we show how bayesian hierarchical modeling approach can be used to partially pool data from different lakes to avoid the potential problems of simpson s paradox fig 1 2 2 statistical modeling 2 2 1 illustrating among lake variation in model coefficients we first developed a regression model equation 2 to demonstrate the variability of model coefficients between data sets the model used both tp tn and their interaction as predictor variables 2 log c h l a j β 0 β 1 log t p j β 2 log t n j β 3 log t p j log t n j ε j where c h l a j t p j and t n j are sample average concentrations for chla tp and tn for the jth lake frequently tp is used as the only predictor because phosphorus is usually assumed as the limiting nutrient we did not make that a priori assumption for all the lakes in the data malve and qian 2006 furthermore tp and tn are often correlated which can imply an interaction effect qian 2016 for example an oligotrophic lake may be limited by both phosphorus and nitrogen thus increasing phosphorus may lead to an increased nitrogen demand constituting a positive interaction the most commonly used statistical modeling approach to account for the interaction effect is to include the product of the two predictors known as the interaction term in statistics qian 2016 in the regression model for example in an analysis of finnish lakes malve and qian 2006 and qian 2016 showed that including both tp and tn and their interaction term can lead to a more informative model specifically the magnitude of the coefficient β 3 may be indicative of a lake s trophic level qian 2016 a lake is likely to be oligotrophic when β 3 0 both p and n are limiting mesotrophic when β 3 0 p is likely the limiting nutrient and eutrophic when β 3 0 perhaps neither p nor n is limiting because of the inclusion of the interaction term the effects of t p and t n on c h l a are no longer constants the effect of t p depends on the value of t n and vice versa the meanings of software reported values of β 1 and β 2 are the tp and tn effects for specific values of tn and tp respectively qian 2016 specifically the reported β 1 β 2 is the tp tn effect when log t n 0 log t p 0 in this paper we centered both predictors by subtracting the respective log means of t p and t n such that the reported slopes i e β 1 ˆ and β 2 ˆ are the tp and tn effects when the other predictor value is at the geometric mean of 27 lagosne lakes because the geometric means of 27 lagosne lakes do not have the same reference value for all lakes e g the geometric mean of tp represents a high phosphorus level for some lakes and a low level for other lakes the software reported β 1 and β 2 values are not comparable among lakes consequently we focus on the comparisons of β 0 and β 3 see qian 2016 for more detailed explanations 2 2 2 using bhm to account for among lake variation next we developed a bayesian hierarchical or multilevel model to incorporate the hierarchical structure inherent in multi lake data we constructed a two tier multilevel model at the lake level we use a form of equation 2 3 log c h l a i j β 0 j β 1 j log t p i j β 2 j log t n i j β 3 j log t p i j log t n i j ε i j where the subscript i j represents the ith observation from the jth lake above the individual lake level the bhm captures the variation of among lake specific model coefficients as the regression model represents a basic well studied limnological relationship we expect that the log log linear relationship to hold for all lakes but model coefficients β 0 3 j may differ by lake statistically these lakes are regarded as exchangeable with respect to model coefficients because without additional information we would not know how these coefficients might differ thus the lake specific model coefficients are modeled as random variables from a common distribution 4 β 0 j β 1 j β 2 j β 3 j m v n μ β 0 μ β 1 μ β 2 μ β 3 σ where m v n represents a multivariate normal distribution equations 3 and 4 combined form a two tier hierarchical model the multivariate normal distribution on the right hand side of equation 4 is often known as the hyper parameter distribution the rationale of using the bhm is discussed by qian et al 2015 in the context of estimating mean concentrations of water quality variables for multiple water bodies compared to coefficients estimated using lake specific data one lake at a time bhm estimated model coefficients are more accurate overall more importantly the hierarchical model specified in equations 3 and 4 separates within lake models specified by β 0 3 j from the among lake model μ β 0 3 j as a result a lake specific inference can be made more accurately stow et al 2009 2 3 modeling road map our analyses consist of two parts 1 the model represented by equation 2 was fit to lake sample average c h l a tp and tn concentrations from 1 nla2007 data alone 2 nla2012 alone 3 combined nla2007 and nla2012 data and 4 lagosne to illustrate the variability of the estimated model coefficients as a function of the data set used 2 the hierarchical model of equations 3 and 4 was fit using data from the 27 lakes in lagosne to demonstrate the use of a bhm to properly account for the among lake variation all models were fit with log tp and log tn centered at the respective means of log tp and tn concentrations of the 27 lakes in lagosne as a result the intercept β 0 of these models represents the log mean c h l a concentrations when tp and tn are at the log mean levels of the 27 lakes log tp mean of 3 112 or geometric mean of 22 5 μg l and log tn mean of 6 296 or geometric mean of 542 7 μg l all statistical models were implemented in r r core team 2018 using function lm for linear regression models and the function lmer from package lme4 bates and maechler 2010 for bhm in equations 3 and 4 gelman and hill 2007 annotated r code can be found at github https github com songsqian simpsons 3 results 3 1 variability in model coefficients the linear model fit to the 27 lagosne lakes has a much smaller β ˆ 3 as compared to the same coefficient estimated for the three linear models fit to nla2007 nla2012 and nla2007 nla2012 fig 3 table 2 in addition the lagosne model coefficients have much larger standard errors because the lagosne model is based on 27 sets of lake sample average concentrations n 27 whereas the three nla models are based on sample averages from over 1 000 lakes the estimated model coefficients based on nla2007 and nla2012 also differ and the model coefficients based on the combined nla data are closer to coefficients of the model fit to nla2012 the interpretations of these model coefficients especially the slopes are ambiguous β 0 is the expected log c h l a for lakes with tp and tn concentrations near the respective geometric means of the 27 lagosne lakes however the meanings of the three slopes of these models are no longer clear mathematically β 1 is the expected change in log c h l a for every unit change in log t p while tn is held unchanged by using a regression model we assume that changes in log c h l a due to factors not included in the model will not affect the estimated slope and can be lumped into the error term this assumption however requires that the within lake and among lake relationship between log c h l a and log t p be the same as shown in the four hypothetical lakes in fig 1 this assumption is likely unrealistic the ambiguity of model coefficients manifested in the differences among the estimated coefficients of the four models suggests that the practice of using lake means for developing an empirical model is potentially misleading the difference in the estimated model coefficients from the two data sets collected for the same purposes nla2007 and nla2012 suggests that the best case scenario discussed in the captions of fig 1 is highly unlikely 3 2 bhm for among lake variation the hierarchical model fit to data from the 27 lagosne lakes shows a large among lake variation in model coefficients fig 4 the estimated intercepts β ˆ 0 are the expected log c h l a concentration for these 27 lakes when they all have the same tp and tn concentrations the respective geometric means as such values of β 0 in fig 4 show the relative productivity of the 27 lakes sorted based on their intercept values the visible opposite trends between β 0 and β 3 are indicative of the value of β 3 in understanding a lake s trophic level because the value of β 0 is dependent on the baseline values of tp and tn while the value of β 3 is invariant the interaction slope β 3 is a more direct indicator of a lake s trophic status the wide range of β 3 shows that these lakes have different trophic levels indicating that nutrient effects on lake primary productivity vary by lake the difficulty in interpreting linear regression model slopes disappears when the coefficients are allowed to differ by lake the hierarchical model estimated β 0 3 j are lake specific while the hyper parameters μ β 0 3 are the means of the respective lake specific coefficients consequently the meaning of these estimated coefficients is unambiguous 4 discussion lakes in both nla2007 and nla2012 were selected based on a probabilistic sampling protocol such that analytical results can be extrapolated to national scales pollard et al 2018 it is tempting to interpret the difference in model coefficients between nla2007 and nla2012 e g a decrease in β 0 as a result of improved overall lake condition from 2007 to 2012 because these coefficients were estimated using lake sample average concentrations of c h l a tp and tn we cannot directly interpret the differences in the models as a result of changes in lake conditions over time a more reasonable explanation of these difference is the random sampling variability furthermore the large variability in lake specific model coefficients fig 4 suggests that an overall average model is unlikely to be informative especially for developing management strategies that will be implemented to individual lakes many early lake water quality models were based on simple mechanistic principles and model parameters were estimated using statistical methods reckhow and chapra 1983 these models relied on data from multiple lakes with each lake or lake segment contributing one observation stow and reckhow 1996 as we accumulated a larger amount of data from multiple lakes these simple modeling methods are increasingly being used as the basis for analyzing cross sectional data in the age of fast computers the successful tools of the past can be easily applied to big data our study demonstrates the potential problems of analyzing big multiple lakes data using conventional methods the hierarchical structure in the data i e from individual observations to lake specific features to regional characteristics shared by many lakes should be properly reflected in our empirical models the bayesian hierarchical modeling approach provides a flexible tool for modeling the hierarchical structure inherent to most of our big data when a dominant confounding factor can be identified we can incorporate the confounding factor into the bhm also known as the multilevel model framework tang et al 2019 without properly modeling the hierarchical structure we risk misinterpreting the data e g fig 1 a situation that has long been recognized in statistics as the simpson s paradox simpson 1951 although the mathematics behind the simpson s paradox is straightforward the implications of the paradox are still not widely recognized in our field frequently we do not analyze data at different levels of aggregation thereby we fail to notice the paradoxical phenomenon which can lead to misinterpretation of the results lakes are naturally different fig 4 forcing a single model on all lakes is undesirable developing national nutrient criteria using models based on lake average concentrations is likely counterproductive as nutrient concentrations are only one of many factors affecting a lake s trophic status a national standard would be inevitably too stringent for some lakes and too lenient for others when the among lake variance is considered as in yuan and pollard 2017 the resulting criterion is most likely too stringent and thereby unachievable for most lakes this result is not surprising as the nla program was designed to answer two questions what is the current condition of lakes and how is this condition changing over time that are not directly related to the quantification of the c h l a nutrient relationship pollard et al 2018 the goals of the nla monitoring program are similar to those of epa s environmental monitoring and assessment program emap which is optimized for estimating the mean and variance of individual environmental ecological indicators over a national regional scale or of a stratified subpopulation e g small lakes overton and stehman 1996 these programs are purposefully designed to best support a limited number of objectives messer et al 1991 as a result when data from programs such as emap and nla are used beyond their original design goals we need to incorporate these data collection design parameters and plan our analysis accordingly when developing models for individual lakes mathematical theories show that a bayesian estimator with a proper informative prior is always better compared to a non bayesian estimator in terms of a model s predictive accuracy efron and morris 1977 efron 1978 the difficulty in using a bayesian method is in obtaining proper informative priors the most important contribution of our paper is the recognition that such informative prior can be obtained by analyzing data from multiple lakes the hyper parameter distribution right hand side of equation 4 is naturally such a proper prior in other words an important and valuable result of analyzing data from multiple lakes is the hyper parameter distribution which can be used as a proper informative prior for analyzing data from individual lakes that are not included in the data used to develop the hierarchical model this conclusion is not limited to limnological modeling qian et al 2015 5 conclusions empirical models developed using lake average concentrations of c h l a tp and tn are unlikely coincide with models developed using data from individual lakes a statistical phenomenon known as the simpson s paradox in statistics literature and ecological fallacy in social science literature regional differences in relevant natural e g climate weather watershed soil and cultural e g land use variables are attributed as the cause of the phenomenon these relevant variables are known as confounding factors in causal analysis literature when using

two predictors known as the interaction term in statistics qian 2016 in the regression model for example in an analysis of finnish lakes malve and qian 2006 and qian 2016 showed that including both tp and tn and their interaction term can lead to a more informative model specifically the magnitude of the coefficient β 3 may be indicative of a lake s trophic level qian 2016 a lake is likely to be oligotrophic when β 3 0 both p and n are limiting mesotrophic when β 3 0 p is likely the limiting nutrient and eutrophic when β 3 0 perhaps neither p nor n is limiting because of the inclusion of the interaction term the effects of t p and t n on c h l a are no longer constants the effect of t p depends on the value of t n and vice versa the meanings of software reported values of β 1 and β 2 are the tp and tn effects for specific values of tn and tp respectively qian 2016 specifically the reported β 1 β 2 is the tp tn effect when log t n 0 log t p 0 in this paper we centered both predictors by subtracting the respective log means of t p and t n such that the reported slopes i e β 1 ˆ and β 2 ˆ are the tp and tn effects when the other predictor value is at the geometric mean of 27 lagosne lakes because the geometric means of 27 lagosne lakes do not have the same reference value for all lakes e g the geometric mean of tp represents a high phosphorus level for some lakes and a low level for other lakes the software reported β 1 and β 2 values are not comparable among lakes consequently we focus on the comparisons of β 0 and β 3 see qian 2016 for more detailed explanations 2 2 2 using bhm to account for among lake variation next we developed a bayesian hierarchical or multilevel model to incorporate the hierarchical structure inherent in multi lake data we constructed a two tier multilevel model at the lake level we use a form of equation 2 3 log c h l a i j β 0 j β 1 j log t p i j β 2 j log t n i j β 3 j log t p i j log t n i j ε i j where the subscript i j represents the ith observation from the jth lake above the individual lake level the bhm captures the variation of among lake specific model coefficients as the regression model represents a basic well studied limnological relationship we expect that the log log linear relationship to hold for all lakes but model coefficients β 0 3 j may differ by lake statistically these lakes are regarded as exchangeable with respect to model coefficients because without additional information we would not know how these coefficients might differ thus the lake specific model coefficients are modeled as random variables from a common distribution 4 β 0 j β 1 j β 2 j β 3 j m v n μ β 0 μ β 1 μ β 2 μ β 3 σ where m v n represents a multivariate normal distribution equations 3 and 4 combined form a two tier hierarchical model the multivariate normal distribution on the right hand side of equation 4 is often known as the hyper parameter distribution the rationale of using the bhm is discussed by qian et al 2015 in the context of estimating mean concentrations of water quality variables for multiple water bodies compared to coefficients estimated using lake specific data one lake at a time bhm estimated model coefficients are more accurate overall more importantly the hierarchical model specified in equations 3 and 4 separates within lake models specified by β 0 3 j from the among lake model μ β 0 3 j as a result a lake specific inference can be made more accurately stow et al 2009 2 3 modeling road map our analyses consist of two parts 1 the model represented by equation 2 was fit to lake sample average c h l a tp and tn concentrations from 1 nla2007 data alone 2 nla2012 alone 3 combined nla2007 and nla2012 data and 4 lagosne to illustrate the variability of the estimated model coefficients as a function of the data set used 2 the hierarchical model of equations 3 and 4 was fit using data from the 27 lakes in lagosne to demonstrate the use of a bhm to properly account for the among lake variation all models were fit with log tp and log tn centered at the respective means of log tp and tn concentrations of the 27 lakes in lagosne as a result the intercept β 0 of these models represents the log mean c h l a concentrations when tp and tn are at the log mean levels of the 27 lakes log tp mean of 3 112 or geometric mean of 22 5 μg l and log tn mean of 6 296 or geometric mean of 542 7 μg l all statistical models were implemented in r r core team 2018 using function lm for linear regression models and the function lmer from package lme4 bates and maechler 2010 for bhm in equations 3 and 4 gelman and hill 2007 annotated r code can be found at github https github com songsqian simpsons 3 results 3 1 variability in model coefficients the linear model fit to the 27 lagosne lakes has a much smaller β ˆ 3 as compared to the same coefficient estimated for the three linear models fit to nla2007 nla2012 and nla2007 nla2012 fig 3 table 2 in addition the lagosne model coefficients have much larger standard errors because the lagosne model is based on 27 sets of lake sample average concentrations n 27 whereas the three nla models are based on sample averages from over 1 000 lakes the estimated model coefficients based on nla2007 and nla2012 also differ and the model coefficients based on the combined nla data are closer to coefficients of the model fit to nla2012 the interpretations of these model coefficients especially the slopes are ambiguous β 0 is the expected log c h l a for lakes with tp and tn concentrations near the respective geometric means of the 27 lagosne lakes however the meanings of the three slopes of these models are no longer clear mathematically β 1 is the expected change in log c h l a for every unit change in log t p while tn is held unchanged by using a regression model we assume that changes in log c h l a due to factors not included in the model will not affect the estimated slope and can be lumped into the error term this assumption however requires that the within lake and among lake relationship between log c h l a and log t p be the same as shown in the four hypothetical lakes in fig 1 this assumption is likely unrealistic the ambiguity of model coefficients manifested in the differences among the estimated coefficients of the four models suggests that the practice of using lake means for developing an empirical model is potentially misleading the difference in the estimated model coefficients from the two data sets collected for the same purposes nla2007 and nla2012 suggests that the best case scenario discussed in the captions of fig 1 is highly unlikely 3 2 bhm for among lake variation the hierarchical model fit to data from the 27 lagosne lakes shows a large among lake variation in model coefficients fig 4 the estimated intercepts β ˆ 0 are the expected log c h l a concentration for these 27 lakes when they all have the same tp and tn concentrations the respective geometric means as such values of β 0 in fig 4 show the relative productivity of the 27 lakes sorted based on their intercept values the visible opposite trends between β 0 and β 3 are indicative of the value of β 3 in understanding a lake s trophic level because the value of β 0 is dependent on the baseline values of tp and tn while the value of β 3 is invariant the interaction slope β 3 is a more direct indicator of a lake s trophic status the wide range of β 3 shows that these lakes have different trophic levels indicating that nutrient effects on lake primary productivity vary by lake the difficulty in interpreting linear regression model slopes disappears when the coefficients are allowed to differ by lake the hierarchical model estimated β 0 3 j are lake specific while the hyper parameters μ β 0 3 are the means of the respective lake specific coefficients consequently the meaning of these estimated coefficients is unambiguous 4 discussion lakes in both nla2007 and nla2012 were selected based on a probabilistic sampling protocol such that analytical results can be extrapolated to national scales pollard et al 2018 it is tempting to interpret the difference in model coefficients between nla2007 and nla2012 e g a decrease in β 0 as a result of improved overall lake condition from 2007 to 2012 because these coefficients were estimated using lake sample average concentrations of c h l a tp and tn we cannot directly interpret the differences in the models as a result of changes in lake conditions over time a more reasonable explanation of these difference is the random sampling variability furthermore the large variability in lake specific model coefficients fig 4 suggests that an overall average model is unlikely to be informative especially for developing management strategies that will be implemented to individual lakes many early lake water quality models were based on simple mechanistic principles and model parameters were estimated using statistical methods reckhow and chapra 1983 these models relied on data from multiple lakes with each lake or lake segment contributing one observation stow and reckhow 1996 as we accumulated a larger amount of data from multiple lakes these simple modeling methods are increasingly being used as the basis for analyzing cross sectional data in the age of fast computers the successful tools of the past can be easily applied to big data our study demonstrates the potential problems of analyzing big multiple lakes data using conventional methods the hierarchical structure in the data i e from individual observations to lake specific features to regional characteristics shared by many lakes should be properly reflected in our empirical models the bayesian hierarchical modeling approach provides a flexible tool for modeling the hierarchical structure inherent to most of our big data when a dominant confounding factor can be identified we can incorporate the confounding factor into the bhm also known as the multilevel model framework tang et al 2019 without properly modeling the hierarchical structure we risk misinterpreting the data e g fig 1 a situation that has long been recognized in statistics as the simpson s paradox simpson 1951 although the mathematics behind the simpson s paradox is straightforward the implications of the paradox are still not widely recognized in our field frequently we do not analyze data at different levels of aggregation thereby we fail to notice the paradoxical phenomenon which can lead to misinterpretation of the results lakes are naturally different fig 4 forcing a single model on all lakes is undesirable developing national nutrient criteria using models based on lake average concentrations is likely counterproductive as nutrient concentrations are only one of many factors affecting a lake s trophic status a national standard would be inevitably too stringent for some lakes and too lenient for others when the among lake variance is considered as in yuan and pollard 2017 the resulting criterion is most likely too stringent and thereby unachievable for most lakes this result is not surprising as the nla program was designed to answer two questions what is the current condition of lakes and how is this condition changing over time that are not directly related to the quantification of the c h l a nutrient relationship pollard et al 2018 the goals of the nla monitoring program are similar to those of epa s environmental monitoring and assessment program emap which is optimized for estimating the mean and variance of individual environmental ecological indicators over a national regional scale or of a stratified subpopulation e g small lakes overton and stehman 1996 these programs are purposefully designed to best support a limited number of objectives messer et al 1991 as a result when data from programs such as emap and nla are used beyond their original design goals we need to incorporate these data collection design parameters and plan our analysis accordingly when developing models for individual lakes mathematical theories show that a bayesian estimator with a proper informative prior is always better compared to a non bayesian estimator in terms of a model s predictive accuracy efron and morris 1977 efron 1978 the difficulty in using a bayesian method is in obtaining proper informative priors the most important contribution of our paper is the recognition that such informative prior can be obtained by analyzing data from multiple lakes the hyper parameter distribution right hand side of equation 4 is naturally such a proper prior in other words an important and valuable result of analyzing data from multiple lakes is the hyper parameter distribution which can be used as a proper informative prior for analyzing data from individual lakes that are not included in the data used to develop the hierarchical model this conclusion is not limited to limnological modeling qian et al 2015 5 conclusions empirical models developed using lake average concentrations of c h l a tp and tn are unlikely coincide with models developed using data from individual lakes a statistical phenomenon known as the simpson s paradox in statistics literature and ecological fallacy in social science literature regional differences in relevant natural e g climate weather watershed soil and cultural e g land use variables are attributed as the cause of the phenomenon these relevant variables are known as confounding factors in causal analysis literature when using cross sectional data without detailed information about the confounding factors a bayesian hierarchical modeling approach is an appropriate analytic tool acknowledgement we thank zutao ouyang and

18586,tiny metal sulfide particles are usually generated in the metal sulfide precipitation process and residual dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 generally makes the aggregation and settling performance of these particles worse in this work under strongly acidic conditions with 0 102 m h2so4 the characteristics of cus cds and mixed metal sulfide particles cus and cds produced in strongly acidic wastewater by h2s were initially studied then uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the metal sulfide particles and relevant mechanisms were investigated the results showed that the residual h2s in suspension can deteriorate the settling performance of metal sulfide particles after h2s was removed cus particles exhibited good settling performance but the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles remained poor subsequent studies showed that uv light irradiation effectively improved the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed metal sulfide particles in the presence of h2s after 30 min of uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased approximately 166 fold in the presence of 131 40 mg l h2s and that of mixed sulfide particles increased approximately 105 fold with the existence of 129 30 mg l h2s further study revealed that h2s in suspensions played an important role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation hs generated by the photolysis of h2s oxidized a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles to s2 2 and s0 which resulted in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles finally this study showed that the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles was effectively improved at high initial h2s concentrations under uv irradiation this study provides a clean and effective method to improve the metal sulfide precipitation process for strongly acidic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv light irradiation metal sulfide particles aggregation settling performance strongly acidic wastewater 1 introduction metallurgical industries produce large amounts of strongly acidic wastewater in which certain types of heavy metals are contained ennaassia et al 2002 liu et al 2016 yun et al 2018 according to the concept of waste resource recycling it is important to remove these heavy metals and recycle this type of wastewater as diluted acid agrawal and sahu 2009 sahinkaya et al 2009 sun et al 2015 among the numerous technologies for heavy metal removal from wastewater metal sulfide precipitation has attractive advantages such as a very fast reaction rate between sulfide agents and metal ions and less sludge produced hence metal sulfide precipitation has been widely used in heavy metal removal from acidic wastewater ennaassia et al 2002 fu and wang 2011 lewis 2010 liu et al 2016 additionally because the generated sludge has a high metal content and the acid will not be neutralized during the sulfide precipitation process the sulfide precipitation method has the potential to recover valuable metals from sludge and recycle the acid gharabaghi et al 2012 guo et al 2015 sahinkaya et al 2009 therefore sulfide precipitation has been considered as an effective technology for the resource recycling treatment of strongly acidic wastewater however tiny metal sulfide particles with poor settling performance are usually produced in metal sulfide precipitation processes it has been reported that the particle size distributions of cus and zns particles generated in acidic mine drainage by h2s ranged from 37 μm to 46 μm and from 12 μm to 17 μm respectively sahinkaya et al 2009 moreover a very large number of fine cus 0 1 μm and zns 1 10 μm particles were produced in a sulfide precipitation process using na2s mokone et al 2012b generally h2s hs and s2 in solution can be strongly adsorbed on the surface of metal sulfide particles which makes the metal sulfide particles more likely to carry a significant surface charge and become very stable in suspensions mokone et al 2012a 2010 villa gomez et al 2013 actually to achieve high heavy metal removal efficiency excess sulfide reagents were often added however the residual h2s hs and s would be strongly adsorbed on the surface of the produced metal sulfide particles which might cause difficult aggregation of the particles hence the sulfide precipitation technique inherently has a shortcoming of producing tiny sulfide particles with poor aggregation and settling performance although coagulation is a popular method for destabilizing and agglomerating colloidal particles in suspension dosing coagulant will inevitably introduce impurities such as al3 fe3 fe2 etc into wastewater which may deteriorate the quality of the recycled diluted acid otherwise a high dosage of coagulant will absolutely produce large volumes of sludge ranade and bhandari 2014 lee et al 2014 therefore further technology needs to be developed to enhance the aggregation of metal sulfide particles and improve the sulfide precipitation process previous studies on the aggregation of nanoparticles in aquatic environments have demonstrated that in natural water uv light irradiation can significantly alter the surface physiochemical properties of various particles such as tio2 nanoparticles graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions chowdhury et al 2015 li and lenhart 2012 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2016 for instance the positive charges on the surface of tio2 nanoparticles diminished and the tio2 particles had a higher tendency to aggregate when tio2 nanoparticles in the aquatic environment were irradiated by uv light sun et al 2014 it is reasonable to expect that uv light irradiation can also induce a reduction of the surface charge of particles in wastewater and thus enhance their aggregation in fact our previous study has shown that uv light irradiation greatly enhanced the aggregation of as2s3 particles in strongly acidic wastewater kong et al 2018 generally four types of heavy metal cations namely cu2 cd2 ni2 and zn2 exist in the strongly acidic wastewater from metallurgical industries among them cu2 and cd2 are two types of metal cations that can be precipitated by sulfide agents h2s na2s etc according to the metal sulfide solubilities depending on ph however tiny cus and cds particles were generally produced during sulfide precipitation processes in this paper uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cus and cds tiny particles in strongly acidic wastewater first the characteristics of metal sulfide particles produced by h2s at different residual h2s concentrations in strongly acidic wastewater were studied then the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation in the presence of h2s was investigated and the mechanisms for aggregation improvement were analyzed finally the settling performance of the uv irradiated metal sulfide particles was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents cuso4 5h2o cdso4 8h2o tert butyl alcohol tba 1 1 dimethyl 4 4 bipyridinium salt mv2 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo used in this investigation were analytical grade chemicals and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china pure h2s and n2 were purchased from huayuan gas chemical co ltd beijing china all solutions were prepared using milli q deionized water prior to experiments 2 2 preparation of metal sulfide suspensions first solutions containing cu2 100 mg l or cd2 100 mg l with a h2so4 concentration of 0 102 m as well as solutions containing both cu2 100 mg l and cd2 100 mg l with 0 102 m h2so4 were prepared using 10 g l metal stock solutions and 98 sulfuric acid then 3 l prepared solutions were poured into a cylindrical reactor without a uv lamp fig 1 and h2s was continuously introduced with a flow rate of 0 3 l min for 10 min under this condition according to fig s1 the residual dissolved sulfide in suspensions was h2s rather than hs and s2 the obtained removal efficiencies of cu2 and cd2 were higher than 99 8 after introducing h2s for 10 min and less than 0 2 mg l residual cu2 and cd2 was measured in the suspensions fig s2 when sulfide precipitation processes were completed n2 was purged with a flow rate of 0 3 l min to remove the residual h2s and a 50 ml suspension was taken out at specific time intervals to determine the concentration of residual h2s the zeta potential particle size and settling performance of produced sulfide particles under different h2s concentrations were analyzed 2 3 uv irradiation of metal sulfide particles uv irradiation experiments were conducted in an experimental setup equipped with a 400 w high pressure mercury lamp and a double layer quartz tube with a water jacket filled with cooling water fig 1 the spectral distribution of the lamp is shown in fig s3 first 3 l suspensions containing metal sulfide particles and h2s with different concentrations were irradiated by uv light for 30 min and a 50 ml sample was taken out from the sampling point at selected time intervals for zeta potential particle size and settling performance analysis meanwhile experiments were also conducted under stirring without uv light irradiation at the same h2s concentration finally metal sulfide particles with and without uv irradiation were filtered and freeze dried for x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis 2 4 analytical methods the zeta potential analysis was conducted on a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern co u k and each sample was determined three times to obtain an average value the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern co u k the turbidity during sedimentation processes was measured by a turbidity meter 2100q hach usa the concentration of h2s in suspensions was analyzed using the methylene blue method cline 1969 and the standard curve is shown in fig s4 the concentrations of total cu and cd were detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap q thermo fisher scientific co ltd usa the microscopic images of the metal sulfide particles in suspensions before and after uv light irradiation were characterized by an optical microscope ub2031 coic co china for xrd and xps analysis 200 ml suspensions containing

holland and xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher japan analysis cu 2p cd 3d and s 2p xps spectra were analyzed by xpspeak 41 software ho was determined using an electron spin resonance spectrometer esr jes fa200 jeol japan equipped with a high pressure mercury lamp 100 w before esr analysis 50 μl suspensions with metal sulfide particles and 0 102 m h2so4 in the presence or absence of h2s was taken into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and 40 μl of 0 25 mm dmpo solution was added the mixed suspension samples were drawn by glass capillaries and then placed into an esr spectrometer the instrument settings were as follows sweep width of 5 mt modulation amplitude of 2 g and sweep time of 1 min the esr signals were recorded from the samples for 300 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of generated metal sulfide particles in this work h2s was employed as a sulfide reagent and bubbled through the prepared strongly acidic solutions then insoluble metal sulfide particles were produced by the reactions shown in eqs 1 3 and the characteristics of the generated metal sulfide particles under different concentrations of h2s were subsequently investigated in addition no obvious ph value changes were observed during the sulfide precipitation processes 1 h 2 s g h 2 s l 2 c u 2 h 2 s c u s 2 h 3 c d 2 h 2 s c d s 2 h the obtained xrd patterns fig s5 of the generated cus cds and mixed metal sulfide particles showed that cu2 and cd2 in strongly acidic solutions were precipitated by h2s to generate covellite cus and cadmium sulfide cds and the xps analysis results fig s6 indicated that the valence of cu in the generated covellite cus particles was 1 the s 2p spectra could be assigned to s2 s2 2 and sn 2 and the valences of cd and s in the produced cadmium sulfide cds particles were 2 and 2 respectively this was consistent with previous studies garcia et al 2015 goh et al 2006 pattrick et al 1997 tot westerflier et al 1989 in fact it has been reported that during sulfide precipitation process cu2 in solution was precipitated to form a covellite mineral in which only cu i presented and the covellite mineral was composed of an s2 layer and cu3s cus3 layer alternating structure being expressed as cus pattrick et al 1997 goh et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 a the zeta potential of cus particles decreased from 36 70 mv to 40 80 mv as the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 46 70 mg l while the zeta potential decreased from 22 08 mv to 28 15 mv when the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 48 70 mg l for mixed metal sulfide particles cus and cds the zeta potential decreased from 37 60 mv to 42 00 mv when the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 50 90 mg l it has been reported that residual h2s hs and s2 would be strongly adsorbed on the surface of metal sulfide particles which can make particles negatively charged and more stable in suspensions mokone et al 2012a 2012b 2010 in this work experiments were conducted on the adsorption of h2s in strongly acidic solutions by cus and cds particles fig s7 clearly shows that the h2s concentration decreased during adsorption and that the zeta potentials of these metal sulfides correspondingly decreased these results demonstrated that h2s can be adsorbed by cus and cds particles and the electronegativity of these particles increases accordingly as shown in fig 2b when the concentration of h2s in suspensions increased the average hydrodynamic diameter of cus and cds particles decreased from 42 13 μm to 38 95 μm and from 6 84 μm to 4 83 μm respectively in the case of mixed sulfide particles cus and cds the average hydrodynamic diameter decreased from 18 97 μm to 9 87 μm as the concentration of h2s increased the microscopic images of the generated cus cds and mixed sulfide particles further illustrated that the particle size of cds was much smaller than the other two types of particles and that cus had the largest particle size fig 2c d e the microscopic images also clearly showed that cus and mixed metal sulfides were in a floc like morphology while cds was in a fine granular morphology the settling performance of metal sulfide particles under different h2s concentrations is presented in fig 3 the turbidity of the cus suspensions decreased from 226 00 ntu to 87 70 ntu as the h2s concentration decreased from 83 50 mg l to 0 00 mg l and the residual turbidity after sedimentation correspondingly decreased from 145 00 ntu to 13 70 ntu fig 3a the results indicated that the settling performance of cus particles improved with decreasing of h2s concentration similarly for cds particles better settling performance was observed with the decrease of h2s concentration in suspensions the turbidity decreased from 1182 00 ntu to 868 00 ntu as the h2s concentration decreased from 48 70 mg l to 0 00 mg l and the residual turbidity after sedimentation decreased from 1130 00 ntu to 622 00 ntu fig 3b for mixed particles cus and cds the turbidity of suspensions decreased from 1435 00 ntu to 692 00 ntu and the residual turbidity decreased from 1345 00 ntu to 153 20 ntu after sedimentation when the h2s concentration decreased from 96 70 mg l to 0 00 mg l fig 3c after comparing the settling performance of cus cds and mixed particles at different h2s concentrations we found that cus particles showed good settling performance in the absence of h2s but the settling performance of cds and mixed particles was still very poor in addition these results indicated that the settling characteristic of metal sulfide particles deteriorated with the increase of residual h2s concentration in fact to ensure good heavy metal removal excess sulfide agent must be added which will cause the poor settling performance of the produced metal sulfide particles although the settling performance of cus particles can be improved by removing the residual h2s another method should be developed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles in the following investigation uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed particles cus and cds in strongly acidic wastewater 3 2 aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation as shown in fig 4 the zeta potential and average hydrodynamic diameter of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds obviously increased with the existence of h2s during uv light irradiation processes with 131 40 mg l h2s in suspension the zeta potential of cds particles increased from 26 47 mv to 8 79 mv after uv irradiation but it remained almost unchanged under stirring without uv irradiation fig 4a meanwhile the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased from 5 97 μm to 989 62 μm under uv irradiation but slowly changed from 5 60 μm to 7 80 μm without uv irradiation fig 4b similarly in the case of mixed sulfide particles cus and cds with 129 30 mg l h2s in suspension the zeta potential increased from 47 17 mv to 22 33 mv after uv irradiation fig 4c and the average hydrodynamic diameter increased from 9 13 μm to 962 00 μm fig 4d however the zeta potential of mixed particles changed very slightly from 46 55 mv to 43 90 mv fig 4c and the average hydrodynamic diameter slowly increased from 8 09 μm to 22 40 μm fig 4d without uv irradiation it should be noted that under the conditions employed the volatilization loss of h2s after the wastewater was stirred without uv irradiation for 30 min was only 11 40 fig s8 which indicated that under uv irradiation the increase of zeta potential and particle size of metal sulfide particles is little induced by the volatilization loss of h2s compared with microscopic images of cds and mixed sulfide particles without uv irradiation fig 2d and e the microscopic images of uv irradiated cds and mixed sulfide particles fig 4e and f clearly showed that the particle size of these particles obviously increased after uv irradiation in short uv irradiation not only decreased the electronegativity but also greatly increased the particle size of cds and mixed particles cus and cds under strongly acidic conditions in the presence of h2s additionally under uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameters of cds and the mixed sulfide particles increased more and more obviously and rapidly with the increase of initial h2s concentration in suspensions fig 5 in this work when the h2s concentrations in cds particles and mixed sulfide particle suspensions were less than 21 77 mg l and 15 60 mg l respectively the average hydrodynamic diameter of these metal sulfide particles increased but not significantly however when the h2s concentration increased to a sufficient amount 67 87 mg l for cds particles and 45 30 mg l for mixed sulfide particles the average hydrodynamic diameter of metal sulfide particles was obviously and rapidly increased meanwhile when the concentration of h2s in cds particles and mixed sulfide particle suspensions were less than 21 77 mg l and 15 60 mg l respectively uv irradiation caused the dissolution of the metal sulfide particles and then an increase of the concentration of metal ions which decreased the efficiency of sulfide precipitation fig s9 these results show that h2s in suspensions plays a key role in the improvement of metal sulfide particle aggregation under uv light irradiation according to previous studies with the existence of h2s in solution the reactions shown in eqs 4 7 will successively occur under uv irradiation and hs will be generated during this process lykakis et al 2007 kong et al 2018 peng et al 2018 in this study as shown in fig s10 the signal of hs in the esr spectrum was also detected when 10 mm h2s with mixed cus and cds particles in a strongly acidic solution were irradiated by uv light 4 h 2 s h υ h s h 5 h h 2 s h s h 2 6 2 h s h 2 s 2 7 h 2 s 2 h 2 s s 0 in addition it has been reported that the s0 formed by photolysis of h2s was in the form of α sulfur crystals of cyclooctasulfur s8 which has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst kong et al 2018 liu et al 2012 as shown in fig s11 a signal of dmpo ho spin adducts was detected by esr spectrometry in this study when s0 obtained from the photolysis of h2s in the acidic solution was irradiated by uv light which implied that the reactions shown in eqs 8 11 occurred and ho would be generated by the photocatalysis of s0 8 s 0 h υ h e 9 h h 2 o h o h 10 2 e 2 h 2 o h 2 2 o h 11 h o h 2 s h s h 2 o on the other hand cus and cds have been reported to be effective photocatalysts huang et al 2013 she et al 2018 ho might be generated by the photocatalysis of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds under uv irradiation esr measurements were employed to verify whether cds and mixed sulfide particles can generate ho under uv irradiation under strongly acidic conditions dmpo was employed to capture ho as shown in fig 6 because the reaction rate between ho and h2s is much faster 1 1 1011 m 1 s 1 mills et al 1987 than that between dmpo and ho 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 matuszak et al 1997 ho was not detected in the presence of h2s however under the inexistence of h2s ho was detected during uv irradiation therefore ho can be also generated by the reactions shown in eqs 12 15 12 c d s h υ h e 13 c u s c d s h υ h e 14 h h 2 o h o h 15 2 e 2 h 2 o h 2 2 o h moreover in the absence of h2s the particle size distribution of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds slightly shifted to a larger particle size but no obvious increase in particle size was observed with the addition of tba ho quencher after uv irradiation fig 7 a and b which implied that the generated ho could slightly increase the particle size of these particles and that the ho quencher tba inhibited the particle size increase under uv irradiation however with the existence of h2s the particle size of cus and mixed sulfide particles increased substantially after uv irradiation and the addition of ho quencher tba also slightly inhibited the increase of particle size under uv irradiation fig 7a and b these results indicated that ho was produced in metal sulfide suspensions under uv irradiation in the presence of h2s and that the generated ho played an auxiliary role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles most importantly the results also further proved that the photolysis of h2s played a key role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles to investigate the effect of reactive species hs and ho on the aggregation of metal sulfide particles an effective electron scavenger mv2 was added into metal sulfide particle suspensions under uv irradiation almost complete inhabitation of aggregation was observed in the presence of mv2 by comparing the particle size distribution with that of metal sulfide particles in the presence of mv2 without uv irradiation fig 7c and d the results implied that electron transfer occurred during metal sulfide particle aggregation processes under uv irradiation moreover to investigate the surface variation of metal sulfide particles cds and mixed sulfide particles before and after uv irradiation were characterized by xrd and xps the xrd patterns indicated that the crystal structure of these sulfide particles did not change but a small amount of s0 was generated during uv irradiation fig s12 in addition according to the xps analysis results presented in fig s13 the obtained cd 3d and cu 2p spectra indicated that the valence of cd and cu did not change when these sulfide particles were irradiated by uv light and were 2 and 1 respectively which implied that the electron transfer process was irrelevant to cd and cu however from the s 2p spectra obtained from uv irradiated cds s0 was detected in addition to s2 and s2 2 similarly in uv irradiated mixed sulfide particles in addition to s2 s2 2 and sn 2 s0 was also observed meanwhile the s 2p3 2 analysis results presented in table s1 clearly showed that during uv irradiation a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles transformed to s2 2 and s0 and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles transformed to s2 2 and s0 respectively these results indicated that a portion of s2 on the cds surface and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed particles were oxidized by reactive species hs and ho to higher valence states s2 2 and s0 in the aggregation processes under uv irradiation as stated above under uv irradiation the aggregation process of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds with the existence of h2s in strongly acidic wastewater can be described in fig 8 the hs radical is generated through the photolysis of h2s in suspensions and a portion of hs combines to generate s0 which can then be photocatalyzed to generate ho meanwhile the ho radical is also generated by the photocatalysis of metal sulfide particles a portion of ho reacts with h2s to generate hs finally the generated hs and ho mainly hs attack the surface of metal sulfide particles and then a portion of s2 on the cds surface and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed particles are oxidized to s2 2 and s0 which results in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles 3 3 settling performance of uv irradiated metal sulfide particles the settling performance of irradiated cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds is presented in fig 9 before uv irradiation as the initial h2s concentration increased the residual turbidity of these particles increased after sedimentation which once again proved that h2s made the settling performance of metal sulfide particles worse however when uv irradiation was applied the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles was greatly improved especially under high h2s concentrations in the case of cds particles as shown in fig 9a when the concentration of initial h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 131 40 mg l the residual turbidity after sedimentation without uv irradiation increased from 604 00 ntu to 1253 00 ntu however during uv irradiation processes the decrease of the residual turbidity after sedimentation was more obvious and the residual turbidity of irradiated cds particles decreased from 167 00 ntu to 55 70 ntu indicating that the settling performance of cds particles was greatly improved by uv irradiation as the initial h2s concentration increased for mixed sulfide particles as shown in fig 9b the residual turbidity after sedimentation without uv irradiation increased from 238 00 ntu to 1112 00 ntu as the initial h2s concentration increased from 0 00 mg l to 129 30 mg l however a more obvious decrease of the residual turbidity was observed during uv irradiation processes and the residual turbidity after sedimentation of uv irradiated mixed sulfide particles decreased from 38 30 ntu to 9 02 ntu hence under uv irradiation the improvement of settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds was more obvious with the increase of initial h2s concentrations in suspensions 4 conclusions the residual h2s made the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles worse in strongly acidic wastewater however uv light irradiation can effectively improve the aggregation and settling performance of these particles with the existence of h2s after 30 min of uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased approximately 166 fold in the presence of 131 40 mg l h2s and that of mixed particles cus and cds increased approximately 105 fold with the existence of 129 30 mg l h2s h2s in suspensions played a key role in the improvement of the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation hs generated by the photolysis of h2s in suspensions attacked the surface of metal sulfide particles and caused electron transfer then a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles were oxidized to s2 2 and s0 which resulted in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles in conclusion uv light irradiation introduces no impurities into strongly acidic wastewater and can effectively improve the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles which has great potential to be applied to improve metal sulfide precipitation processes for strongly acidic wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of

18586,tiny metal sulfide particles are usually generated in the metal sulfide precipitation process and residual dissolved sulfide h2s hs and s2 generally makes the aggregation and settling performance of these particles worse in this work under strongly acidic conditions with 0 102 m h2so4 the characteristics of cus cds and mixed metal sulfide particles cus and cds produced in strongly acidic wastewater by h2s were initially studied then uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of the metal sulfide particles and relevant mechanisms were investigated the results showed that the residual h2s in suspension can deteriorate the settling performance of metal sulfide particles after h2s was removed cus particles exhibited good settling performance but the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles remained poor subsequent studies showed that uv light irradiation effectively improved the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed metal sulfide particles in the presence of h2s after 30 min of uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased approximately 166 fold in the presence of 131 40 mg l h2s and that of mixed sulfide particles increased approximately 105 fold with the existence of 129 30 mg l h2s further study revealed that h2s in suspensions played an important role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation hs generated by the photolysis of h2s oxidized a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles to s2 2 and s0 which resulted in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles finally this study showed that the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles was effectively improved at high initial h2s concentrations under uv irradiation this study provides a clean and effective method to improve the metal sulfide precipitation process for strongly acidic wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords uv light irradiation metal sulfide particles aggregation settling performance strongly acidic wastewater 1 introduction metallurgical industries produce large amounts of strongly acidic wastewater in which certain types of heavy metals are contained ennaassia et al 2002 liu et al 2016 yun et al 2018 according to the concept of waste resource recycling it is important to remove these heavy metals and recycle this type of wastewater as diluted acid agrawal and sahu 2009 sahinkaya et al 2009 sun et al 2015 among the numerous technologies for heavy metal removal from wastewater metal sulfide precipitation has attractive advantages such as a very fast reaction rate between sulfide agents and metal ions and less sludge produced hence metal sulfide precipitation has been widely used in heavy metal removal from acidic wastewater ennaassia et al 2002 fu and wang 2011 lewis 2010 liu et al 2016 additionally because the generated sludge has a high metal content and the acid will not be neutralized during the sulfide precipitation process the sulfide precipitation method has the potential to recover valuable metals from sludge and recycle the acid gharabaghi et al 2012 guo et al 2015 sahinkaya et al 2009 therefore sulfide precipitation has been considered as an effective technology for the resource recycling treatment of strongly acidic wastewater however tiny metal sulfide particles with poor settling performance are usually produced in metal sulfide precipitation processes it has been reported that the particle size distributions of cus and zns particles generated in acidic mine drainage by h2s ranged from 37 μm to 46 μm and from 12 μm to 17 μm respectively sahinkaya et al 2009 moreover a very large number of fine cus 0 1 μm and zns 1 10 μm particles were produced in a sulfide precipitation process using na2s mokone et al 2012b generally h2s hs and s2 in solution can be strongly adsorbed on the surface of metal sulfide particles which makes the metal sulfide particles more likely to carry a significant surface charge and become very stable in suspensions mokone et al 2012a 2010 villa gomez et al 2013 actually to achieve high heavy metal removal efficiency excess sulfide reagents were often added however the residual h2s hs and s would be strongly adsorbed on the surface of the produced metal sulfide particles which might cause difficult aggregation of the particles hence the sulfide precipitation technique inherently has a shortcoming of producing tiny sulfide particles with poor aggregation and settling performance although coagulation is a popular method for destabilizing and agglomerating colloidal particles in suspension dosing coagulant will inevitably introduce impurities such as al3 fe3 fe2 etc into wastewater which may deteriorate the quality of the recycled diluted acid otherwise a high dosage of coagulant will absolutely produce large volumes of sludge ranade and bhandari 2014 lee et al 2014 therefore further technology needs to be developed to enhance the aggregation of metal sulfide particles and improve the sulfide precipitation process previous studies on the aggregation of nanoparticles in aquatic environments have demonstrated that in natural water uv light irradiation can significantly alter the surface physiochemical properties of various particles such as tio2 nanoparticles graphene oxide and silver nanoparticles in aqueous suspensions chowdhury et al 2015 li and lenhart 2012 sun et al 2014 wang et al 2016 for instance the positive charges on the surface of tio2 nanoparticles diminished and the tio2 particles had a higher tendency to aggregate when tio2 nanoparticles in the aquatic environment were irradiated by uv light sun et al 2014 it is reasonable to expect that uv light irradiation can also induce a reduction of the surface charge of particles in wastewater and thus enhance their aggregation in fact our previous study has shown that uv light irradiation greatly enhanced the aggregation of as2s3 particles in strongly acidic wastewater kong et al 2018 generally four types of heavy metal cations namely cu2 cd2 ni2 and zn2 exist in the strongly acidic wastewater from metallurgical industries among them cu2 and cd2 are two types of metal cations that can be precipitated by sulfide agents h2s na2s etc according to the metal sulfide solubilities depending on ph however tiny cus and cds particles were generally produced during sulfide precipitation processes in this paper uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cus and cds tiny particles in strongly acidic wastewater first the characteristics of metal sulfide particles produced by h2s at different residual h2s concentrations in strongly acidic wastewater were studied then the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation in the presence of h2s was investigated and the mechanisms for aggregation improvement were analyzed finally the settling performance of the uv irradiated metal sulfide particles was studied 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents cuso4 5h2o cdso4 8h2o tert butyl alcohol tba 1 1 dimethyl 4 4 bipyridinium salt mv2 and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo used in this investigation were analytical grade chemicals and were purchased from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd shanghai china pure h2s and n2 were purchased from huayuan gas chemical co ltd beijing china all solutions were prepared using milli q deionized water prior to experiments 2 2 preparation of metal sulfide suspensions first solutions containing cu2 100 mg l or cd2 100 mg l with a h2so4 concentration of 0 102 m as well as solutions containing both cu2 100 mg l and cd2 100 mg l with 0 102 m h2so4 were prepared using 10 g l metal stock solutions and 98 sulfuric acid then 3 l prepared solutions were poured into a cylindrical reactor without a uv lamp fig 1 and h2s was continuously introduced with a flow rate of 0 3 l min for 10 min under this condition according to fig s1 the residual dissolved sulfide in suspensions was h2s rather than hs and s2 the obtained removal efficiencies of cu2 and cd2 were higher than 99 8 after introducing h2s for 10 min and less than 0 2 mg l residual cu2 and cd2 was measured in the suspensions fig s2 when sulfide precipitation processes were completed n2 was purged with a flow rate of 0 3 l min to remove the residual h2s and a 50 ml suspension was taken out at specific time intervals to determine the concentration of residual h2s the zeta potential particle size and settling performance of produced sulfide particles under different h2s concentrations were analyzed 2 3 uv irradiation of metal sulfide particles uv irradiation experiments were conducted in an experimental setup equipped with a 400 w high pressure mercury lamp and a double layer quartz tube with a water jacket filled with cooling water fig 1 the spectral distribution of the lamp is shown in fig s3 first 3 l suspensions containing metal sulfide particles and h2s with different concentrations were irradiated by uv light for 30 min and a 50 ml sample was taken out from the sampling point at selected time intervals for zeta potential particle size and settling performance analysis meanwhile experiments were also conducted under stirring without uv light irradiation at the same h2s concentration finally metal sulfide particles with and without uv irradiation were filtered and freeze dried for x ray diffraction xrd and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps analysis 2 4 analytical methods the zeta potential analysis was conducted on a zeta potential analyzer zetasizer 2000 malvern co u k and each sample was determined three times to obtain an average value the particle size distribution was measured using a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 malvern co u k the turbidity during sedimentation processes was measured by a turbidity meter 2100q hach usa the concentration of h2s in suspensions was analyzed using the methylene blue method cline 1969 and the standard curve is shown in fig s4 the concentrations of total cu and cd were detected using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp oes thermo scientific icap q thermo fisher scientific co ltd usa the microscopic images of the metal sulfide particles in suspensions before and after uv light irradiation were characterized by an optical microscope ub2031 coic co china for xrd and xps analysis 200 ml suspensions containing sulfide particles with and without uv irradiation were filtered washed with deionized water and freeze dried then the dried solid samples were characterized by xrd x pert pro mpd pan analytical holland and xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher japan analysis cu 2p cd 3d and s 2p xps spectra were analyzed by xpspeak 41 software ho was determined using an electron spin resonance spectrometer esr jes fa200 jeol japan equipped with a high pressure mercury lamp 100 w before esr analysis 50 μl suspensions with metal sulfide particles and 0 102 m h2so4 in the presence or absence of h2s was taken into a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube and 40 μl of 0 25 mm dmpo solution was added the mixed suspension samples were drawn by glass capillaries and then placed into an esr spectrometer the instrument settings were as follows sweep width of 5 mt modulation amplitude of 2 g and sweep time of 1 min the esr signals were recorded from the samples for 300 s 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of generated metal sulfide particles in this work h2s was employed as a sulfide reagent and bubbled through the prepared strongly acidic solutions then insoluble metal sulfide particles were produced by the reactions shown in eqs 1 3 and the characteristics of the generated metal sulfide particles under different concentrations of h2s were subsequently investigated in addition no obvious ph value changes were observed during the sulfide precipitation processes 1 h 2 s g h 2 s l 2 c u 2 h 2 s c u s 2 h 3 c d 2 h 2 s c d s 2 h the obtained xrd patterns fig s5 of the generated cus cds and mixed metal sulfide particles showed that cu2 and cd2 in strongly acidic solutions were precipitated by h2s to generate covellite cus and cadmium sulfide cds and the xps analysis results fig s6 indicated that the valence of cu in the generated covellite cus particles was 1 the s 2p spectra could be assigned to s2 s2 2 and sn 2 and the valences of cd and s in the produced cadmium sulfide cds particles were 2 and 2 respectively this was consistent with previous studies garcia et al 2015 goh et al 2006 pattrick et al 1997 tot westerflier et al 1989 in fact it has been reported that during sulfide precipitation process cu2 in solution was precipitated to form a covellite mineral in which only cu i presented and the covellite mineral was composed of an s2 layer and cu3s cus3 layer alternating structure being expressed as cus pattrick et al 1997 goh et al 2006 as shown in fig 2 a the zeta potential of cus particles decreased from 36 70 mv to 40 80 mv as the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 46 70 mg l while the zeta potential decreased from 22 08 mv to 28 15 mv when the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 48 70 mg l for mixed metal sulfide particles cus and cds the zeta potential decreased from 37 60 mv to 42 00 mv when the concentration of h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 50 90 mg l it has been reported that residual h2s hs and s2 would be strongly adsorbed on the surface of metal sulfide particles which can make particles negatively charged and more stable in suspensions mokone et al 2012a 2012b 2010 in this work experiments were conducted on the adsorption of h2s in strongly acidic solutions by cus and cds particles fig s7 clearly shows that the h2s concentration decreased during adsorption and that the zeta potentials of these metal sulfides correspondingly decreased these results demonstrated that h2s can be adsorbed by cus and cds particles and the electronegativity of these particles increases accordingly as shown in fig 2b when the concentration of h2s in suspensions increased the average hydrodynamic diameter of cus and cds particles decreased from 42 13 μm to 38 95 μm and from 6 84 μm to 4 83 μm respectively in the case of mixed sulfide particles cus and cds the average hydrodynamic diameter decreased from 18 97 μm to 9 87 μm as the concentration of h2s increased the microscopic images of the generated cus cds and mixed sulfide particles further illustrated that the particle size of cds was much smaller than the other two types of particles and that cus had the largest particle size fig 2c d e the microscopic images also clearly showed that cus and mixed metal sulfides were in a floc like morphology while cds was in a fine granular morphology the settling performance of metal sulfide particles under different h2s concentrations is presented in fig 3 the turbidity of the cus suspensions decreased from 226 00 ntu to 87 70 ntu as the h2s concentration decreased from 83 50 mg l to 0 00 mg l and the residual turbidity after sedimentation correspondingly decreased from 145 00 ntu to 13 70 ntu fig 3a the results indicated that the settling performance of cus particles improved with decreasing of h2s concentration similarly for cds particles better settling performance was observed with the decrease of h2s concentration in suspensions the turbidity decreased from 1182 00 ntu to 868 00 ntu as the h2s concentration decreased from 48 70 mg l to 0 00 mg l and the residual turbidity after sedimentation decreased from 1130 00 ntu to 622 00 ntu fig 3b for mixed particles cus and cds the turbidity of suspensions decreased from 1435 00 ntu to 692 00 ntu and the residual turbidity decreased from 1345 00 ntu to 153 20 ntu after sedimentation when the h2s concentration decreased from 96 70 mg l to 0 00 mg l fig 3c after comparing the settling performance of cus cds and mixed particles at different h2s concentrations we found that cus particles showed good settling performance in the absence of h2s but the settling performance of cds and mixed particles was still very poor in addition these results indicated that the settling characteristic of metal sulfide particles deteriorated with the increase of residual h2s concentration in fact to ensure good heavy metal removal excess sulfide agent must be added which will cause the poor settling performance of the produced metal sulfide particles although the settling performance of cus particles can be improved by removing the residual h2s another method should be developed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles in the following investigation uv light irradiation was employed to improve the aggregation and settling performance of cds and mixed particles cus and cds in strongly acidic wastewater 3 2 aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation as shown in fig 4 the zeta potential and average hydrodynamic diameter of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds obviously increased with the existence of h2s during uv light irradiation processes with 131 40 mg l h2s in suspension the zeta potential of cds particles increased from 26 47 mv to 8 79 mv after uv irradiation but it remained almost unchanged under stirring without uv irradiation fig 4a meanwhile the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased from 5 97 μm to 989 62 μm under uv irradiation but slowly changed from 5 60 μm to 7 80 μm without uv irradiation fig 4b similarly in the case of mixed sulfide particles cus and cds with 129 30 mg l h2s in suspension the zeta potential increased from 47 17 mv to 22 33 mv after uv irradiation fig 4c and the average hydrodynamic diameter increased from 9 13 μm to 962 00 μm fig 4d however the zeta potential of mixed particles changed very slightly from 46 55 mv to 43 90 mv fig 4c and the average hydrodynamic diameter slowly increased from 8 09 μm to 22 40 μm fig 4d without uv irradiation it should be noted that under the conditions employed the volatilization loss of h2s after the wastewater was stirred without uv irradiation for 30 min was only 11 40 fig s8 which indicated that under uv irradiation the increase of zeta potential and particle size of metal sulfide particles is little induced by the volatilization loss of h2s compared with microscopic images of cds and mixed sulfide particles without uv irradiation fig 2d and e the microscopic images of uv irradiated cds and mixed sulfide particles fig 4e and f clearly showed that the particle size of these particles obviously increased after uv irradiation in short uv irradiation not only decreased the electronegativity but also greatly increased the particle size of cds and mixed particles cus and cds under strongly acidic conditions in the presence of h2s additionally under uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameters of cds and the mixed sulfide particles increased more and more obviously and rapidly with the increase of initial h2s concentration in suspensions fig 5 in this work when the h2s concentrations in cds particles and mixed sulfide particle suspensions were less than 21 77 mg l and 15 60 mg l respectively the average hydrodynamic diameter of these metal sulfide particles increased but not significantly however when the h2s concentration increased to a sufficient amount 67 87 mg l for cds particles and 45 30 mg l for mixed sulfide particles the average hydrodynamic diameter of metal sulfide particles was obviously and rapidly increased meanwhile when the concentration of h2s in cds particles and mixed sulfide particle suspensions were less than 21 77 mg l and 15 60 mg l respectively uv irradiation caused the dissolution of the metal sulfide particles and then an increase of the concentration of metal ions which decreased the efficiency of sulfide precipitation fig s9 these results show that h2s in suspensions plays a key role in the improvement of metal sulfide particle aggregation under uv light irradiation according to previous studies with the existence of h2s in solution the reactions shown in eqs 4 7 will successively occur under uv irradiation and hs will be generated during this process lykakis et al 2007 kong et al 2018 peng et al 2018 in this study as shown in fig s10 the signal of hs in the esr spectrum was also detected when 10 mm h2s with mixed cus and cds particles in a strongly acidic solution were irradiated by uv light 4 h 2 s h υ h s h 5 h h 2 s h s h 2 6 2 h s h 2 s 2 7 h 2 s 2 h 2 s s 0 in addition it has been reported that the s0 formed by photolysis of h2s was in the form of α sulfur crystals of cyclooctasulfur s8 which has been demonstrated to be an efficient photocatalyst kong et al 2018 liu et al 2012 as shown in fig s11 a signal of dmpo ho spin adducts was detected by esr spectrometry in this study when s0 obtained from the photolysis of h2s in the acidic solution was irradiated by uv light which implied that the reactions shown in eqs 8 11 occurred and ho would be generated by the photocatalysis of s0 8 s 0 h υ h e 9 h h 2 o h o h 10 2 e 2 h 2 o h 2 2 o h 11 h o h 2 s h s h 2 o on the other hand cus and cds have been reported to be effective photocatalysts huang et al 2013 she et al 2018 ho might be generated by the photocatalysis of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds under uv irradiation esr measurements were employed to verify whether cds and mixed sulfide particles can generate ho under uv irradiation under strongly acidic conditions dmpo was employed to capture ho as shown in fig 6 because the reaction rate between ho and h2s is much faster 1 1 1011 m 1 s 1 mills et al 1987 than that between dmpo and ho 3 4 109 m 1 s 1 matuszak et al 1997 ho was not detected in the presence of h2s however under the inexistence of h2s ho was detected during uv irradiation therefore ho can be also generated by the reactions shown in eqs 12 15 12 c d s h υ h e 13 c u s c d s h υ h e 14 h h 2 o h o h 15 2 e 2 h 2 o h 2 2 o h moreover in the absence of h2s the particle size distribution of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds slightly shifted to a larger particle size but no obvious increase in particle size was observed with the addition of tba ho quencher after uv irradiation fig 7 a and b which implied that the generated ho could slightly increase the particle size of these particles and that the ho quencher tba inhibited the particle size increase under uv irradiation however with the existence of h2s the particle size of cus and mixed sulfide particles increased substantially after uv irradiation and the addition of ho quencher tba also slightly inhibited the increase of particle size under uv irradiation fig 7a and b these results indicated that ho was produced in metal sulfide suspensions under uv irradiation in the presence of h2s and that the generated ho played an auxiliary role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles most importantly the results also further proved that the photolysis of h2s played a key role in the aggregation of metal sulfide particles to investigate the effect of reactive species hs and ho on the aggregation of metal sulfide particles an effective electron scavenger mv2 was added into metal sulfide particle suspensions under uv irradiation almost complete inhabitation of aggregation was observed in the presence of mv2 by comparing the particle size distribution with that of metal sulfide particles in the presence of mv2 without uv irradiation fig 7c and d the results implied that electron transfer occurred during metal sulfide particle aggregation processes under uv irradiation moreover to investigate the surface variation of metal sulfide particles cds and mixed sulfide particles before and after uv irradiation were characterized by xrd and xps the xrd patterns indicated that the crystal structure of these sulfide particles did not change but a small amount of s0 was generated during uv irradiation fig s12 in addition according to the xps analysis results presented in fig s13 the obtained cd 3d and cu 2p spectra indicated that the valence of cd and cu did not change when these sulfide particles were irradiated by uv light and were 2 and 1 respectively which implied that the electron transfer process was irrelevant to cd and cu however from the s 2p spectra obtained from uv irradiated cds s0 was detected in addition to s2 and s2 2 similarly in uv irradiated mixed sulfide particles in addition to s2 s2 2 and sn 2 s0 was also observed meanwhile the s 2p3 2 analysis results presented in table s1 clearly showed that during uv irradiation a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles transformed to s2 2 and s0 and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles transformed to s2 2 and s0 respectively these results indicated that a portion of s2 on the cds surface and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed particles were oxidized by reactive species hs and ho to higher valence states s2 2 and s0 in the aggregation processes under uv irradiation as stated above under uv irradiation the aggregation process of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds with the existence of h2s in strongly acidic wastewater can be described in fig 8 the hs radical is generated through the photolysis of h2s in suspensions and a portion of hs combines to generate s0 which can then be photocatalyzed to generate ho meanwhile the ho radical is also generated by the photocatalysis of metal sulfide particles a portion of ho reacts with h2s to generate hs finally the generated hs and ho mainly hs attack the surface of metal sulfide particles and then a portion of s2 on the cds surface and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed particles are oxidized to s2 2 and s0 which results in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles 3 3 settling performance of uv irradiated metal sulfide particles the settling performance of irradiated cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds is presented in fig 9 before uv irradiation as the initial h2s concentration increased the residual turbidity of these particles increased after sedimentation which once again proved that h2s made the settling performance of metal sulfide particles worse however when uv irradiation was applied the settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles was greatly improved especially under high h2s concentrations in the case of cds particles as shown in fig 9a when the concentration of initial h2s increased from 0 00 mg l to 131 40 mg l the residual turbidity after sedimentation without uv irradiation increased from 604 00 ntu to 1253 00 ntu however during uv irradiation processes the decrease of the residual turbidity after sedimentation was more obvious and the residual turbidity of irradiated cds particles decreased from 167 00 ntu to 55 70 ntu indicating that the settling performance of cds particles was greatly improved by uv irradiation as the initial h2s concentration increased for mixed sulfide particles as shown in fig 9b the residual turbidity after sedimentation without uv irradiation increased from 238 00 ntu to 1112 00 ntu as the initial h2s concentration increased from 0 00 mg l to 129 30 mg l however a more obvious decrease of the residual turbidity was observed during uv irradiation processes and the residual turbidity after sedimentation of uv irradiated mixed sulfide particles decreased from 38 30 ntu to 9 02 ntu hence under uv irradiation the improvement of settling performance of cds and mixed sulfide particles cus and cds was more obvious with the increase of initial h2s concentrations in suspensions 4 conclusions the residual h2s made the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles worse in strongly acidic wastewater however uv light irradiation can effectively improve the aggregation and settling performance of these particles with the existence of h2s after 30 min of uv irradiation the average hydrodynamic diameter of cds particles increased approximately 166 fold in the presence of 131 40 mg l h2s and that of mixed particles cus and cds increased approximately 105 fold with the existence of 129 30 mg l h2s h2s in suspensions played a key role in the improvement of the aggregation of metal sulfide particles under uv irradiation hs generated by the photolysis of h2s in suspensions attacked the surface of metal sulfide particles and caused electron transfer then a portion of s2 on the surface of cds particles and a portion of s2 and sn 2 on the surface of mixed sulfide particles were oxidized to s2 2 and s0 which resulted in a decrease of negative charge and an enhanced aggregation of these particles in conclusion uv light irradiation introduces no impurities into strongly acidic wastewater and can effectively improve the aggregation and settling performance of metal sulfide particles which has great potential to be applied to improve metal sulfide precipitation processes for strongly acidic wastewater treatment acknowledgments this work was supported by the national natural science foundation of

18587,the environmental transformation of nanoparticles results in significant changes in their structure properties and toxicity which are imperative for assessing their environmental impact and health risks little is known about the toxicity alteration of fullerene nanoparticles c60 after water disinfection processes considering their potential application in antimicrobial control in water treatment ultimately ending in sewage treatment plants we showed that c60 aggregates nc60 were converted to more oxidized forms via commonly used water disinfection processes i e phototransformation and photochlorination treatment the light irradiated nanoparticles uv nc60 exhibited mitigated cytotoxicity relative to nc60 whereas photochlorinated nc60 uv cl nc60 showed an exacerbated outcome we revealed a distinct toxic mechanism occurring at the nano bio interface for which electrons were shuttled by c60 nanoparticles from membrane bound nadph oxidase to extracellular molecular oxygen resulting in the production of various extracellular reactive oxygen species ros uv cl nc60 showed the highest electron shuttling activity due to its high carbonyl content and more than 2 4 fold higher level of extracellular hydroxyl radicals were detected relative to that in untreated cells although uv nc60 possessed a somewhat higher carbonyl content than nc60 it showed a weaker adhesion to the cell membrane which compromised the electron transfer process the intrinsic ros generation quenching capabilities and oxidative potentials of the various nanoparticles were also systematically compared overall this report highlights the importance of understanding environmental transformations in risk assessment and uncovers an overlooked mechanism through which nc60 derivatives can modulate the electron transfer process at the nano bio interface via acting as electron shuttles graphical abstract image 1 keywords fullerene environmental transformation cytotoxicity electron

can potentially be used as alternative disinfectants or in conjunction with existing technologies such as ultraviolet uv irradiation to enhance the disinfection efficacy in water treatment thus c60 nanomaterials are globally produced on the order of 1500 tons per year zhang et al 2012 which increases the likelihood of their environmental release dong et al 2019 floris et al 2016 and possibly ends in sewage and water treatment plants zhang et al 2012 troester et al 2016 considering the substantial alteration of toxic behaviors of other carbon nanomaterials e g graphene oxide carbon

distinct toxicity of water disinfection byproducts with halogen substitutions e g halobenzoquinones and haloacetaldehydes li et al 2016 jeong et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no such study has been conducted to evaluate c60 toxicity with chloride derivatization c60 undergoes evident structural changes during water treatment processes the commonly adopted disinfection methods include light irradiation chlorination photochlorination and ozonation etc wang et al 2018 guo et al 2018 the photochemical transformation of c60 results in surface oxygenation and hydroxylation lee et al 2009b 2009c and depending on the reaction conditions e g light intensity duration and chosen wavelength the products vary in the types and contents of functional groups c60 was also subjected to apparent transformation when reacting with chlorine under uv irradiation wu et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2012 resulting in the formation of c60 derivatives rich in chloride epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups wang et al 2012 the oxidation of c60 also occurs by reaction with ozone forming a series of oxygen containing groups i e hydroxyl epoxyl and carbonyl carboxyl groups fortner et al 2007 the structure related toxicity of c60 has not been fully explored both ros dependent and independent mechanisms have been suggested the capability of ros generation either in the dark sayes et al 2004 or in the presence of light lee et al 2007 has been linked to factors such as its surface functional groups sayes et al 2004 aggregation status lee et al 2007 and structural defects hou et al 2010 hou and jafvert 2009a in an ros independent mechanism c60 behaved as an oxidant upon contact with cells and disrupted energy transduction with no detectable ros production lyon and alvarez 2008 moreover the radical quenching capability of c60 derivative complicates its effect on biological systems and is also interrelated with the extent and or type of functionalization however in a potentially overlooked mechanism c60 and its derivatives can mediate ros production via electron shuttling activity and the nanoparticle itself may not produce perceptible ros for instance fullerol polyhydroxylated c60 mediated electron transfer from light activated rhodamine b dye to oxygen forming hydroxyl radicals oh and achieving simultaneous dye decolorization and 4 chlorophenol degradation lim et al 2016 recently we reported the electron shuttling effect of graphene oxide at the nano bio interface promoting extracellular ros formation zhao et al 2018 theoretically in the same manner c60 nanomaterials may interact with the cell membrane and mediate ros generation which in turn impairs cell viability to date little effort has been directed toward evaluating this catalytic activity related cytotoxicity the objective of this study was to explore the possible alteration of c60 cytotoxicity after conventional water disinfection processes with a particular emphasis on catalytic reactions occurring at the nano bio interface overall our findings substantiate the importance of understanding environmental transformation induced toxicity change and also provide new insight into

upon phototransformation or photochlorination treatment the transformation processes are depicted in fig 1 and nc60 treated with uv irradiation or photochlorination was named uv nc60 and uv cl nc60 respectively xps adsorption spectra fig 2 a b and the corresponding chemical compositions clearly demonstrated the oxidation of nc60 after both treatments the c o ratio of nc60 decreased from 7 7 to 3 6 and 3 8 after phototransformation and photochlorination treatment respectively moreover the types of oxygenated functional groups varied among treatments for nc60 as a result of hydroxylation and oxidation during preparation certain amounts of c o 5 5 at 284 6 ev hwang and li 2010 and oc o 2 4 at 289 1 ev wu et al 2014 carbon were observed after disinfection treatments increased levels of c o 22 4 for uv nc60 and 10 3 for uv cl nc60 and varied levels of oc o 4 5 for uv nc60 and 2 7 for uv cl nc60 were detected interestingly elevated levels of carbonyl content co at 288 0 ev wu et al 2014 were noted for uv nc60 2 0 and uv cl nc60 11 2 compared with those for nc60 additionally the appearance of 1 8 cl content under photochlorination indicated chlorinated carbon formation a close look at the xps spectra fig 2c showed the cl peak split into two peaks cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 located at 202 6 ev and 201 0 ev respectively which indicates that c cl moieties are linked by a covalent bond du et al 2017 wu et al 2016a 2016b generally the oxygen containing functional groups detected in this study were similar to those reported for nc60 lee et al 2009c hwang and li 2010 wu et al 2014 and products of photochemical transformation lee et al 2009c hwang and li 2010 hou and jafvert 2009b and photochlorination wu et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2012 an additional extraction process was used to rule out the potential presence of byproducts the oxidation of nc60 and variation of functional groups upon different treatments were further observed by ftir analysis fig 2d the c c vibration modes of nc60 exhibited characteristic peaks at 526 577 1180 and 1430 cm 1 wang et al 2012 which confirmed the integrity of the carbon cage carbon oxidation upon treatments was supported by augmented peak intensity within 1000 1250 cm 1 centered at 1110 cm 1 c o stretching and 1684 1830 cm 1 centered at 1720 cm 1 carbonyl stretch vibration of carboxylic group wu et al 2016b in support of the above xps analysis the peak at 1630 cm 1 which was naturally attributed to the carbonyl stretching frequency and or the conjugated double bond of a quinone like structure sauvain and rossi 2016 became more discernible after disinfection treatments for uv cl nc60 c cl bond formation was evidenced through the appearance of new peaks at 665 and 604 cm 1 wu et al 2016b the alteration of surface functional groups resulted in changes in surface charge uv cl nc60 was less negatively charged than nc60 or uv nc60 both in the culture medium and in water table 1 the hydrodynamic diameters of the transformed products were comparable to those of unaltered nc60 table 1 and all three nanoparticles were fairly stable in culture medium over a 24 h incubation period table s3 3 2 phototransformation mitigated nanoparticle cytotoxicity while photochlorination exacerbated this effect macrophages are the most crucial cells in the response to intruding nanoparticles in vivo thus the toxic effects of nanoparticles on macrophages were evaluated as visualized by confocal microscopy fig 3 a 20 more apoptotic and 85 more necrotic cell death was observed after uv cl nc60 exposure than after nc60 fig 3b whereas apoptotic and necrotic cell death both decreased by approximately 30 after uv nc60 exposure the observed magnitude of nanomaterial induced toxicity followed the order uv cl nc60 nc60 uv nc60 to rule out the potential interference of c60 with assay methods patsoukis et al 2005 cell viability was also analyzed by wst 1 and trypan blue and consistent results were obtained fig s5a b in agreement with these observations the effects of nanoparticles on membrane integrity shown by ldh release in fig 3c and metabolic activity as indicated by the atp content in fig 3d followed the same trend showing that uv nc60 markedly alleviated outcomes while uv cl nc60 exacerbated them the degree of damage was also determined according to morphological changes visualized by tem fig 3e the most dramatic morphological change was observed upon uv cl nc60 exposure the cells shrank and the nuclei condensed and fragmented in conjunction with the emergence of a great number of filopodia clear signs of apoptosis under oxidative stress fulda et al 2010 by contrast very few morphological changes were observed after uv nc60 exposure although there are no published reports on the cytotoxicity of uv cl nc60 a few studies have suggested that the nc60 nanomaterial is more toxic than polyhydroxylated c60 possibly due to its intrinsically potent generation of ros referred to as an ros dependent mechanism sayes et al 2004 kamat et al 2000 however in this study no obvious ros production i e o2 h2o2 and oh was detected in various nanoparticle suspensions under cell free conditions fig s6a c possible reasons for this inconsistency include different preparation procedures i e sonication versus continuous stirring nanoparticle concentrations and incubation conditions which would inevitably influence the particles chemical reactivity the oxidation of cell membrane directly by nanoparticles referred to as an ros independent mechanism was also evaluated fig s7a the maximum oxidative potential of c60 particles was less than that of 0 05 mm h2o2 whereas no cytotoxic effect was observed upon exposure to this dose of h2o2 fig s7b therefore neither intrinsic ros production nor direct oxidation of membrane by the particle itself was responsible for the different toxic effects of nanoparticles 3 3 intercellular oxidative stress was induced by extracellular ros accumulation it is quite interesting to see that although c60 nanoparticles cannot produce ros abiotically under test conditions the significant induction of intracellular oxidative stress was evident fig 4 a the level of intracellular oxidative stress followed the same pattern as cytotoxicity in the order uv cl nc60 nc60 uv nc60 fig 4b specifically a more than 2 4 fold higher level of ros relative to that in the untreated cells was detected inside cells upon uv cl nc60 exposure in comparison to the 36 and 58 increases after uv nc60 and nc60 treatment respectively the oxidative damage was also verified by an increase in the lipid peroxidation fig 4c and depletion of the intracellular gsh content fig 4d the rescue effect of vitamin c addition as an antioxidant on cell viability confirmed the important contribution of intracellular oxidative stress to cellular death fig s8 the intracellular oxidative stress was primarily induced by extracellular ros which was corroborated by the following evidence first the extracellular levels of ros i e o2 h2o2 and oh were directly monitored as shown in fig 4e g which were generally consistent with the observed degrees of oxidative damage interestingly only a slight increase in o2 a moderate increase in h2o2 and a sharp rise in oh content were noted for instance uv cl nc60 increased extracellular oh production by approximately 150 compared to the amount in untreated cells whereas the increase in o2 production was approximately 20 second the correcting effect of antioxidant enzyme addition to the extracellular environment further demonstrated the toxic effect of extracellular ros with the extracellular supplementation of sod which are known to scavenge o2 a significant reduction in intracellular oxidative stress visualized in fig 4a and quantified in fig s9a and subsequent enhancement of cell viability fig s9b were observed the effect was more pronounced for uv cl nc60 treated cells and intracellular ros content decreased from 310 to 152 relative to untreated cells with the addition of 0 1 mg l sod a consistent rescue effect was observed with the extracellular addition of catalase to remove h2o2 fig s9c finally no cytotoxicity was identified if the incubation system was kept under anaerobic conditions under which no extracellular ros can form fig s9d this experimental result also suggested that physical puncture penetration by c60 nanoparticles was not a concern in cytotoxicity evaluation the induction of intracellular oxidative stress by c60 nanoparticles has been reported in several studies sayes et al 2004 2005 skivka et al 2018 but none of them described extracellular ros formation 3 4 extracellular o2 formation due to the electron shuttling effect of c60 nanoparticles considering the lack of ros generation by nanoparticles alone cellular activity must be involved in generating extracellular ros macrophages can release extracellular o2 via membrane bound nadph oxidases which transport electrons from cytoplasmic nadph across biological membranes to extracellular oxygen forming o2 cathcart 2004 adam et al 2001 holevinsky and nelson 1995 in view of the reported electron shuttling effect of c60 nanomaterials markovic and trajkovic 2008 guldi and asmus 1999 we postulated that c60 nanomaterials might mediate the electron transfer process boosting extracellular o2 generation as depicted in fig 5 a we used cellular membrane fragments as a source of nadph oxidase and nadph as substrate to test the mediating effect of various nanoparticles under cell free conditions as shown in fig 5b the absorbance at 470 nm due to reduced xtt formation via reacting with o2 increased markedly upon nanoparticle addition clearly confirming more rapid formation of o2 in the presence of c60 nanoparticles a dose dependent facilitative effect was found for uv cl nc60 treatment fig 5c the electron shuttling activity of various c60 nanoparticles was quantified by comparing their abilities to accelerate the decolorization process of methyl blue fig s10 since all particles dispersed well in test solution the decolorization due to absorption adsorption onto nanoparticle and subsequent removal by precipitation was ruled out as shown in fig 5d the electron shuttling activity decreased in the order uv cl nc60 uv nc60 nc60 which correlated well with the carbonyl co contents of the c60 structures fig 2b previous studies have revealed that the quinone structure plays an important mediating role in the electron shuttling process uchimiya and stone 2009 millerick et al 2013 therefore we added aqds a known redox mediator with a typical quinone structure to the uv cl nc60 suspension to evaluate the contribution of this specific structure in the presence of aqds the electron transfer activity further increased in a dose dependent manner fig 5d corroborating this finding the peak intensity at 470 nm in the uv vis spectra further increased when aqds was added in addition to uv cl nc60 fig 5b together c60 nanoparticles can shuttle electrons at the nano bio interface promoting extracellular o2 formation which was strongly dependent on the carbonyl content 3 5 extracellular oh radical was generated via haber weiss and fenton reactions bearing in mind the extremely high magnitude of extracellular oh production upon nanoparticle treatment fig 4g we examined the possible involvement of haber weiss and fenton reactions fig 6 a the h2o2 accumulation may occur through spontaneous disproportionation of o2 the availability of fe2 as catalyst which was low in medium may result from o2 oxidizing iron sulfur proteins on the cell membrane imlay 2006 we thus examined the extracellular content of total iron after nanoparticle incubation and observed a maximal 20 increase upon uv cl nc60 exposure fig 6b which agreed well with the extracellular o2 level the concurrent conversion and assumption of o2 explained the lowest concentration detected among three ros and oh accumulated as the final product fig 4e g one may argue that the diverse levels of extracellular ros may be attributed to the differential radical quenching abilities of three nanoparticles we also tested oh removal efficacy by three nanoparticles via epr fig 6c d all three nanoparticles exhibited certain quenching capabilities while the greatest performance was observed for nc60 this observation agreed well with previous reports that the reactivity toward oh addition decreases with increasing functionalization on c60 markovic and trajkovic 2008 this decreased antioxidant activity may partially account for the highest extracellular ros level upon uv cl nc60 exposure however although uv nc60 possessed higher shuttling activity and lower scavenging activity relative to nc60 the former imposed less oxidative stress on macrophages than the latter which will be explained by the following affinity assay 3 6 discrepant effect of uv nc60 was ascribed to its weakest association with the cell membrane the electron shuttling efficiency of nanoparticles at the nano bio interface is essentially determined by the affinity of the nanoparticles for the cell membrane thus the extent of macrophage association with various c60 nanoparticles was quantified by flow cytometry fig 7 a the lowest ssc value was detected for uv nc60 treated cells p 0 05 which was attributed to the apparently decreased hydrophobicity of uv nc60 relative to nc60 as indexed by the classic water octanol partition coefficient kow fig 7b it is well recognized that hydrophobicity is a crucial factor that determines the partitioning behavior of molecules toward biological membranes despite its reduced hydrophobicity uv cl nc60 showed similar affinity to membrane as nc60 one possible reason is that with the addition of more electron withdrawing functional groups i e cl co cooh the carbon cage of uv cl nc60 becomes more electron deficient which facilitates its interaction with negatively charged cell membrane uv cl nc60 was also less negatively charged as a whole than nc60 and uv nc60 table 1 additional studies are needed to elucidate the interaction network among c60 nanoparticles water and membrane and the interconnection of bioactivity with nanoparticle surface functionalization 4 conclusion our results demonstrated that water disinfection processes greatly modified c60 structures thus altering their cytotoxicity dependent on the structural carbonyl content c60 nanoparticles acted as an electron shuttling mediator boosting extracellular ros formation and consequently inducing intracellular oxidative stress the overall toxic mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 our results reveal the potential adverse effect of the application of c60 in water disinfection processes and emphasize the importance of environmental transformation while assessing the risk and impact of this approach additionally we discuss a potentially overlooked mechanism catalytic interactions occurring at the nano bio interface which is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism of nanotoxicity and to ensure safe nanotechnology conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no competing

18587,the environmental transformation of nanoparticles results in significant changes in their structure properties and toxicity which are imperative for assessing their environmental impact and health risks little is known about the toxicity alteration of fullerene nanoparticles c60 after water disinfection processes considering their potential application in antimicrobial control in water treatment ultimately ending in sewage treatment plants we showed that c60 aggregates nc60 were converted to more oxidized forms via commonly used water disinfection processes i e phototransformation and photochlorination treatment the light irradiated nanoparticles uv nc60 exhibited mitigated cytotoxicity relative to nc60 whereas photochlorinated nc60 uv cl nc60 showed an exacerbated outcome we revealed a distinct toxic mechanism occurring at the nano bio interface for which electrons were shuttled by c60 nanoparticles from membrane bound nadph oxidase to extracellular molecular oxygen resulting in the production of various extracellular reactive oxygen species ros uv cl nc60 showed the highest electron shuttling activity due to its high carbonyl content and more than 2 4 fold higher level of extracellular hydroxyl radicals were detected relative to that in untreated cells although uv nc60 possessed a somewhat higher carbonyl content than nc60 it showed a weaker adhesion to the cell membrane which compromised the electron transfer process the intrinsic ros generation quenching capabilities and oxidative potentials of the various nanoparticles were also systematically compared overall this report highlights the importance of understanding environmental transformations in risk assessment and uncovers an overlooked mechanism through which nc60 derivatives can modulate the electron transfer process at the nano bio interface via acting as electron shuttles graphical abstract image 1 keywords fullerene environmental transformation cytotoxicity electron

can potentially be used as alternative disinfectants or in conjunction with existing technologies such as ultraviolet uv irradiation to enhance the disinfection efficacy in water treatment thus c60 nanomaterials are globally produced on the order of 1500 tons per year zhang et al 2012 which increases the likelihood of their environmental release dong et al 2019 floris et al 2016 and possibly ends in sewage and water treatment plants zhang et al 2012 troester et al 2016 considering the substantial alteration of toxic behaviors of other carbon nanomaterials e g graphene oxide carbon nanotubes after environmental transformation zhang et al 2018 liu et al 2015 it is critical to assess changes in c60 toxicity after water treatment processes abundant studies have reported the distinct toxicity of water disinfection byproducts with halogen substitutions e g halobenzoquinones and haloacetaldehydes li et al 2016 jeong et al 2015 however to the best of our knowledge no such study has been conducted to evaluate c60 toxicity with chloride derivatization c60 undergoes evident structural changes during water treatment processes the commonly adopted disinfection methods include light irradiation chlorination photochlorination and ozonation etc wang et al 2018 guo et al 2018 the photochemical transformation of c60 results in surface oxygenation and hydroxylation lee et al 2009b 2009c and depending on the reaction conditions e g light intensity duration and chosen wavelength the products vary in the types and contents of functional groups c60 was also subjected to apparent transformation when reacting with chlorine under uv irradiation wu et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2012 resulting in the formation of c60 derivatives rich in chloride epoxy and hydroxyl functional groups wang et al 2012 the oxidation of c60 also occurs by reaction with ozone forming a series of oxygen containing groups i e hydroxyl epoxyl and carbonyl carboxyl groups fortner et al 2007 the structure related toxicity of c60 has not been fully explored both ros dependent and independent mechanisms have been suggested the capability of ros generation either in the dark sayes et al 2004 or in the presence of light lee et al 2007 has been linked to factors such as its surface functional groups sayes et al 2004 aggregation status lee et al 2007 and structural defects hou et al 2010 hou and jafvert 2009a in an ros independent mechanism c60 behaved as an oxidant upon contact with cells and disrupted energy transduction with no detectable ros production lyon and alvarez 2008 moreover the radical quenching capability of c60 derivative complicates its effect on biological systems and is also interrelated with the extent and or type of functionalization however in a potentially overlooked mechanism c60 and its derivatives can mediate ros production via electron shuttling activity and the nanoparticle itself may not produce perceptible ros for instance fullerol polyhydroxylated c60 mediated electron transfer from light activated rhodamine b dye to oxygen forming hydroxyl radicals oh and achieving simultaneous dye decolorization and 4 chlorophenol degradation lim et al 2016 recently we reported the electron shuttling effect of graphene oxide at the nano bio interface promoting extracellular ros formation zhao et al 2018 theoretically in the same manner c60 nanomaterials may interact with the cell membrane and mediate ros generation which in turn impairs cell viability to date little effort has been directed toward evaluating this catalytic activity related cytotoxicity the objective of this study was to explore the possible alteration of c60 cytotoxicity after conventional water disinfection processes with a particular emphasis on catalytic reactions occurring at the nano bio interface overall our findings substantiate the importance of understanding environmental transformation induced toxicity change and also provide new insight into

upon phototransformation or photochlorination treatment the transformation processes are depicted in fig 1 and nc60 treated with uv irradiation or photochlorination was named uv nc60 and uv cl nc60 respectively xps adsorption spectra fig 2 a b and the corresponding chemical compositions clearly demonstrated the oxidation of nc60 after both treatments the c o ratio of nc60 decreased from 7 7 to 3 6 and 3 8 after phototransformation and photochlorination treatment respectively moreover the types of oxygenated functional groups varied among treatments for nc60 as a result of hydroxylation and oxidation during preparation certain amounts of c o 5 5 at 284 6 ev hwang and li 2010 and oc o 2 4 at 289 1 ev wu et al 2014 carbon were observed after disinfection treatments increased levels of c o 22 4 for uv nc60 and 10 3 for uv cl nc60 and varied levels of oc o 4 5 for uv nc60 and 2 7 for uv cl nc60 were detected interestingly elevated levels of carbonyl content co at 288 0 ev wu et al 2014 were noted for uv nc60 2 0 and uv cl nc60 11 2 compared with those for nc60 additionally the appearance of 1 8 cl content under photochlorination indicated chlorinated carbon formation a close look at the xps spectra fig 2c showed the cl peak split into two peaks cl 2p1 2 and cl 2p3 2 located at 202 6 ev and 201 0 ev respectively which indicates that c cl moieties are linked by a covalent bond du et al 2017 wu et al 2016a 2016b generally the oxygen containing functional groups detected in this study were similar to those reported for nc60 lee et al 2009c hwang and li 2010 wu et al 2014 and products of photochemical transformation lee et al 2009c hwang and li 2010 hou and jafvert 2009b and photochlorination wu et al 2016a 2016b wang et al 2012 an additional extraction process was used to rule out the potential presence of byproducts the oxidation of nc60 and variation of functional groups upon different treatments were further observed by ftir analysis fig 2d the c c vibration modes of nc60 exhibited characteristic peaks at 526 577 1180 and 1430 cm 1 wang et al 2012 which confirmed the integrity of the carbon cage carbon oxidation upon treatments was supported by augmented peak intensity within 1000 1250 cm 1 centered at 1110 cm 1 c o stretching and 1684 1830 cm 1 centered at 1720 cm 1 carbonyl stretch vibration of carboxylic group wu et al 2016b in support of the above xps analysis the peak at 1630 cm 1 which was naturally attributed to the carbonyl stretching frequency and or the conjugated double bond of a quinone like structure sauvain and rossi 2016 became more discernible after disinfection treatments for uv cl nc60 c cl bond formation was evidenced through the appearance of new peaks at 665 and 604 cm 1 wu et al 2016b the alteration of surface functional groups resulted in changes in surface charge uv cl nc60 was less negatively charged than nc60 or uv nc60 both in the culture medium and in water table 1 the hydrodynamic diameters of the transformed products were comparable to those of unaltered nc60 table 1 and all three nanoparticles were fairly stable in culture medium over a 24 h incubation period table s3 3 2 phototransformation mitigated nanoparticle cytotoxicity while photochlorination exacerbated this effect macrophages are the most crucial cells in the response to intruding nanoparticles in vivo thus the toxic effects of nanoparticles on macrophages were evaluated as visualized by confocal microscopy fig 3 a 20 more apoptotic and 85 more necrotic cell death was observed after uv cl nc60 exposure than after nc60 fig 3b whereas apoptotic and necrotic cell death both decreased by approximately 30 after uv nc60 exposure the observed magnitude of nanomaterial induced toxicity followed the order uv cl nc60 nc60 uv nc60 to rule out the potential interference of c60 with assay methods patsoukis et al 2005 cell viability was also analyzed by wst 1 and trypan blue and consistent results were obtained fig s5a b in agreement with these observations the effects of nanoparticles on membrane integrity shown by ldh release in fig 3c and metabolic activity as indicated by the atp content in fig 3d followed the same trend showing that uv nc60 markedly alleviated outcomes while uv cl nc60 exacerbated them the degree of damage was also determined according to morphological changes visualized by tem fig 3e the most dramatic morphological change was observed upon uv cl nc60 exposure the cells shrank and the nuclei condensed and fragmented in conjunction with the emergence of a great number of filopodia clear signs of apoptosis under oxidative stress fulda et al 2010 by contrast very few morphological changes were observed after uv nc60 exposure although there are no published reports on the cytotoxicity of uv cl nc60 a few studies have suggested that the nc60 nanomaterial is more toxic than polyhydroxylated c60 possibly due to its intrinsically potent generation of ros referred to as an ros dependent mechanism sayes et al 2004 kamat et al 2000 however in this study no obvious ros production i e o2 h2o2 and oh was detected in various nanoparticle suspensions under cell free conditions fig s6a c possible reasons for this inconsistency include different preparation procedures i e sonication versus continuous stirring nanoparticle concentrations and incubation conditions which would inevitably influence the particles chemical reactivity the oxidation of cell membrane directly by nanoparticles referred to as an ros independent mechanism was also evaluated fig s7a the maximum oxidative potential of c60 particles was less than that of 0 05 mm h2o2 whereas no cytotoxic effect was observed upon exposure to this dose of h2o2 fig s7b therefore neither intrinsic ros production nor direct oxidation of membrane by the particle itself was responsible for the different toxic effects of nanoparticles 3 3 intercellular oxidative stress was induced by extracellular ros accumulation it is quite interesting to see that although c60 nanoparticles cannot produce ros abiotically under test conditions the significant induction of intracellular oxidative stress was evident fig 4 a the level of intracellular oxidative stress followed the same pattern as cytotoxicity in the order uv cl nc60 nc60 uv nc60 fig 4b specifically a more than 2 4 fold higher level of ros relative to that in the untreated cells was detected inside cells upon uv cl nc60 exposure in comparison to the 36 and 58 increases after uv nc60 and nc60 treatment respectively the oxidative damage was also verified by an increase in the lipid peroxidation fig 4c and depletion of the intracellular gsh content fig 4d the rescue effect of vitamin c addition as an antioxidant on cell viability confirmed the important contribution of intracellular oxidative stress to cellular death fig s8 the intracellular oxidative stress was primarily induced by extracellular ros which was corroborated by the following evidence first the extracellular levels of ros i e o2 h2o2 and oh were directly monitored as shown in fig 4e g which were generally consistent with the observed degrees of oxidative damage interestingly only a slight increase in o2 a moderate increase in h2o2 and a sharp rise in oh content were noted for instance uv cl nc60 increased extracellular oh production by approximately 150 compared to the amount in untreated cells whereas the increase in o2 production was approximately 20 second the correcting effect of antioxidant enzyme addition to the extracellular environment further demonstrated the toxic effect of extracellular ros with the extracellular supplementation of sod which are known to scavenge o2 a significant reduction in intracellular oxidative stress visualized in fig 4a and quantified in fig s9a and subsequent enhancement of cell viability fig s9b were observed the effect was more pronounced for uv cl nc60 treated cells and intracellular ros content decreased from 310 to 152 relative to untreated cells with the addition of 0 1 mg l sod a consistent rescue effect was observed with the extracellular addition of catalase to remove h2o2 fig s9c finally no cytotoxicity was identified if the incubation system was kept under anaerobic conditions under which no extracellular ros can form fig s9d this experimental result also suggested that physical puncture penetration by c60 nanoparticles was not a concern in cytotoxicity evaluation the induction of intracellular oxidative stress by c60 nanoparticles has been reported in several studies sayes et al 2004 2005 skivka et al 2018 but none of them described extracellular ros formation 3 4 extracellular o2 formation due to the electron shuttling effect of c60 nanoparticles considering the lack of ros generation by nanoparticles alone cellular activity must be involved in generating extracellular ros macrophages can release extracellular o2 via membrane bound nadph oxidases which transport electrons from cytoplasmic nadph across biological membranes to extracellular oxygen forming o2 cathcart 2004 adam et al 2001 holevinsky and nelson 1995 in view of the reported electron shuttling effect of c60 nanomaterials markovic and trajkovic 2008 guldi and asmus 1999 we postulated that c60 nanomaterials might mediate the electron transfer process boosting extracellular o2 generation as depicted in fig 5 a we used cellular membrane fragments as a source of nadph oxidase and nadph as substrate to test the mediating effect of various nanoparticles under cell free conditions as shown in fig 5b the absorbance at 470 nm due to reduced xtt formation via reacting with o2 increased markedly upon nanoparticle addition clearly confirming more rapid formation of o2 in the presence of c60 nanoparticles a dose dependent facilitative effect was found for uv cl nc60 treatment fig 5c the electron shuttling activity of various c60 nanoparticles was quantified by comparing their abilities to accelerate the decolorization process of methyl blue fig s10 since all particles dispersed well in test solution the decolorization due to absorption adsorption onto nanoparticle and subsequent removal by precipitation was ruled out as shown in fig 5d the electron shuttling activity decreased in the order uv cl nc60 uv nc60 nc60 which correlated well with the carbonyl co contents of the c60 structures fig 2b previous studies have revealed that the quinone structure plays an important mediating role in the electron shuttling process uchimiya and stone 2009 millerick et al 2013 therefore we added aqds a known redox mediator with a typical quinone structure to the uv cl nc60 suspension to evaluate the contribution of this specific structure in the presence of aqds the electron transfer activity further increased in a dose dependent manner fig 5d corroborating this finding the peak intensity at 470 nm in the uv vis spectra further increased when aqds was added in addition to uv cl nc60 fig 5b together c60 nanoparticles can shuttle electrons at the nano bio interface promoting extracellular o2 formation which was strongly dependent on the carbonyl content 3 5 extracellular oh radical was generated via haber weiss and fenton reactions bearing in mind the extremely high magnitude of extracellular oh production upon nanoparticle treatment fig 4g we examined the possible involvement of haber weiss and fenton reactions fig 6 a the h2o2 accumulation may occur through spontaneous disproportionation of o2 the availability of fe2 as catalyst which was low in medium may result from o2 oxidizing iron sulfur proteins on the cell membrane imlay 2006 we thus examined the extracellular content of total iron after nanoparticle incubation and observed a maximal 20 increase upon uv cl nc60 exposure fig 6b which agreed well with the extracellular o2 level the concurrent conversion and assumption of o2 explained the lowest concentration detected among three ros and oh accumulated as the final product fig 4e g one may argue that the diverse levels of extracellular ros may be attributed to the differential radical quenching abilities of three nanoparticles we also tested oh removal efficacy by three nanoparticles via epr fig 6c d all three nanoparticles exhibited certain quenching capabilities while the greatest performance was observed for nc60 this observation agreed well with previous reports that the reactivity toward oh addition decreases with increasing functionalization on c60 markovic and trajkovic 2008 this decreased antioxidant activity may partially account for the highest extracellular ros level upon uv cl nc60 exposure however although uv nc60 possessed higher shuttling activity and lower scavenging activity relative to nc60 the former imposed less oxidative stress on macrophages than the latter which will be explained by the following affinity assay 3 6 discrepant effect of uv nc60 was ascribed to its weakest association with the cell membrane the electron shuttling efficiency of nanoparticles at the nano bio interface is essentially determined by the affinity of the nanoparticles for the cell membrane thus the extent of macrophage association with various c60 nanoparticles was quantified by flow cytometry fig 7 a the lowest ssc value was detected for uv nc60 treated cells p 0 05 which was attributed to the apparently decreased hydrophobicity of uv nc60 relative to nc60 as indexed by the classic water octanol partition coefficient kow fig 7b it is well recognized that hydrophobicity is a crucial factor that determines the partitioning behavior of molecules toward biological membranes despite its reduced hydrophobicity uv cl nc60 showed similar affinity to membrane as nc60 one possible reason is that with the addition of more electron withdrawing functional groups i e cl co cooh the carbon cage of uv cl nc60 becomes more electron deficient which facilitates its interaction with negatively charged cell membrane uv cl nc60 was also less negatively charged as a whole than nc60 and uv nc60 table 1 additional studies are needed to elucidate the interaction network among c60 nanoparticles water and membrane and the interconnection of bioactivity with nanoparticle surface functionalization 4 conclusion our results demonstrated that water disinfection processes greatly modified c60 structures thus altering their cytotoxicity dependent on the structural carbonyl content c60 nanoparticles acted as an electron shuttling mediator boosting extracellular ros formation and consequently inducing intracellular oxidative stress the overall toxic mechanism is illustrated in fig 8 our results reveal the potential adverse effect of the application of c60 in water disinfection processes and emphasize the importance of environmental transformation while assessing the risk and impact of this approach additionally we discuss a potentially overlooked mechanism catalytic interactions occurring at the nano bio interface which is crucial for understanding the molecular mechanism of nanotoxicity and to ensure safe nanotechnology conflicts of interest the authors declare that there are no competing

18588,dissolved organic matter dom is widely present in aqueous environments and plays a significant role in pollutant mitigation and transformation so far excitation emission matrix eem fluorescence

because the dom concentration is unknown the intensity of dom s fluorescence is unknown also but should be estimated from the total fluorescence unfortunately the presence of unknown contaminants might interfere the dom quantification making it impossible to obtain the concentration of dom and the eems of unknown contaminants secondly conventional parafac needs a set of eems for correct

contaminants are present because of the change of the factor number this eem will be treated as an outlier and be removed to maintain the right number of components stedmon and bro 2008 thirdly the optical properties of humic like substances might result from charge transfer thus in parafac the assumption that all components absorb and emit light independently is highly questionable sharpless

overlaps with the eem of dom the incapability of handling the samples with unexpected contaminants remains a major defect for parafac analysis to on line monitor dom in aqueous environments therefore to quantify single eem of fluorescent dom with contaminants in aqueous environments two problems should be resolved first the eem of contaminants should be detected second the target compounds should

data processing procedures 2 2 fluorescence data of ha and simulated fluorescence data acquisition ha was purchased from sigma aldrich co usa deionized water with a resistivity higher than 18 2 mω cm at 25 c was used the tested concentration was 10 mg l eem spectra were recorded using an aqualog spectrometer horiba co japan the measured emission spectra ranged from 211 to 618 nm with a 3 8 nm step increase while the excitation wavelength increased sequentially from 264 to 600 nm with a 3 nm step to examine the impact of the fluorescence intensity of interfering fluorophores the eem of ha was normalized with the maximum fluorescence intensity as 100 to simulate the eem of ha with contaminants two dimensional gaussian peaks were added to the eem of ha as the eem of ha with unexpected

dimensional gaussian function 1 f x y m exp x x 0 2 2 σ x 2 y y 0 2 2 σ y 2 where the coefficient m is the amplitude indicating the fluorescence intensity of contaminants ranging from 0 to 400 we presume that x and y represent the em and ex wavelength with the same size of the eem of ha x o y o is the center satisfying 230 nm y o x o 600 nm because em is always larger than ex σ x and σ y are the standard deviations of x and y respectively ranging from 0 to 10 nm which control the shape of contaminants to simulate the actual eem data as closely as possible random noise was added to the eem

parafac analysis was also tested as comparison the tested sample contained contaminants which means that it should be an outlier thus split half analysis is not a good option to determine the right number of components stedmon and bro 2008 thus assuming that the suitable component number n was the number of interfering peaks adding ha the sum of number of targets and interfering peaks the three models with n 1 n and n 1 factor numbers were investigated 2 3 fluorescence data of the mixture of ha fa and 1 2 naphthoquinone 4 sulfonic acid sodium salt nqs nqs was selected as a contaminant because its eem is highly overlapped with that of ha fig s1 the tested concentrations were from 0 to 25 mg l for ha and from 0 to 40 mg l for nqs suwannee river fulvic acid standard i was also tested the tested concentrations were in the range of 0 45 mg l for fa and 0 40 mg l for nqs the measured emission spectra ranged from 211 to 618 nm with a 3 8 nm step increase while the excitation

f corrected f experiment 10 a ex a em 2 where f experiment and f corrected are the measured and corrected fluorescent intensities respectively and a ex and a em are the absorbance at the excitation

shown in figs s1a c in addition 5 mg l of 1 2 1 3 and 1 4 dihydroxybenzene sulfanilamide 1 4 benzoquinone riboflavin and salicylic acid was added in 10 mg l ha solution as unexpected contaminants to simulate the water source for drinking water treatment plants usually 2 3 mg l a mixture of low concentration ciprofloxacin cipro 18 100 μg l bovine serum albumin bsa 0 7 4 0 mg l and nqs 0 7 4 0 mg l with ha 0 2 2 0 mg l was also tested pld was used to analyze these spiked samples without the eems of the contaminants as they cannot be predicted under actual conditions 2 4 fluorescence data of natural waters samples two sample sets from natural sources with different contamination degrees and a sample set from a wwtp were tested samples from chaohu lake 31 32 081 n 117 38 845 e anhui province china representing lowly contaminated natural water were collected monthly from chaohu lake from march 2015 to january 2016 the second sample series was collected from the nanfeihe river anhui province china with a spatial distribution from 31 53 178 n 117 13 074 e to 31 43 050 n 117 24 246 e and was selected to represent highly contaminated natural water li et al 2012 liu et al 2012 these two sample series are respectively referred to as the lake sample and the river sample in the following discussion fig s2 the third sample series was collected from the wangtang wwtp hefei china for each sample the measurement was conducted in triplicate since the composition of the lake samples 10 125 113 the river sample 25 125 113 and the wwtp sample 20 125 113 were unknown parallel factor framework clustering analysis pffca was used to estimate the composition of each dataset qian et al 2017 pffca was used to identify the composition before quantification only because the eems of the target compounds were needed for pld three contaminants i e bsa cipro and nqs were used with various concentrations bsa was selected as the eem of protein like substances is identical to that of bsa thus spiked samples did not have additional fluorescent peaks and could be used to simulate the variation of protein like substances in environmental samples fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used antibiotics in china and cipro is the most commonly used fluoroquinolones for animals in china 4882 t year zhang et al 2015 the tested concentrations were 1 5 3 and 6 mg l for cipro and 10 20 and 40 mg l for bsa and nqs the concentrations of contaminants used in the experiments were higher than those in the environment as the method can be validated in a broader concentration range since the average concentration of cipro in environments is near 100 ng l zhang et al 2015 cipro with low concentrations 10 100 ng l is also spiked into lake samples the eem landscapes of bsa 40 mg l and cipro 6 mg l are respectively shown in figs s1d and e each natural sample randomly contains three interfering substances with different concentration levels and a total of 165 contaminated samples were prepared and tested 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance comparison of pld with parafac in treating a simulated dataset simulated datasets were firstly analyzed to provide a statistical result and avoid the impact of specific contaminants using the pld method for total 1000 tests of the simulated dataset the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were 99 9 100 and 97 7 with one two and three interfering peaks i e fluorescence of contaminants respectively fig 2 demonstrating that the pld method can provide accurate quantification in most cases parafac analysis was also tested as a comparison resulting in a much higher standard deviation of parafac than that of pld in all cases fig 2 the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were lower than 69 0 for all three models in all three datasets suggesting that less than 69 of cases could be quantified correctly using parafac when contaminants were present since the factor number affects the estimation accuracy of parafac choosing the right factor number might improve the performance of parafac however the best model of parafac in which the estimated fluorescence intensity was the closest to the actual fluorescence intensity blue boxes in fig 2 cannot provide a precise estimation the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were 76 3 79 5 and 76 8 for the one two and three interfering peak datasets respectively indicating that more than 20 of samples could not be correctly quantified using parafac regardless of how many factor numbers were chosen in this aspect the pld method is superior to conventional parafac analysis in the presence of contaminants 3 2 quantification of ha and fa in synthetic water samples we further investigated the capability of pld for quantifying and diagnosizing the mixture of ha and nqs the estimated and actual concentrations of ha in the presence of nqs were close to each other with an average relative error of 2 6 using pld fig 3 a the 2 3 and 4 factor models were tested for parafac and all of the factors are shown in fig 3b d when the ha concentration was high and the nqs concentration was low samples 1 to 30 one of the factors in the 2 factor model was highly correlated with ha concentration however when the concentration of nqs was higher than that of ha the concentration of ha was underestimated fig 3b in 3 and 4 factor models there was no factor corresponding to the ha concentration steadily indicating that these models are not appropriate fig 3c and d the average relative errors of parafac were over 48 4 67 0 and 40 6 for the 2 3 and 4 factor models respectively they were substantially higher than those of pld p 0 005 indicating that pld provided more accurate estimations the eem and fluorescence intensity of contaminants estimated by pld were also checked fig 3e the eem of nqs fig s1c and the estimated interfering component were almost identical indicating that pld can successfully separate the eem of contaminants from that of mixture samples and providing a clue for recognizing unexpected contaminants in addition pld also provided the fluorescence intensity of the contaminant relating to its contents in the sample fig 3f suggesting that pld could be used to evaluate the relative concentration of the interfering substance parafac could not provide the eem of interfering substance directly if one of the factors from parafac model corresponds with interfering component parafac is also able to identify the contaminant unfortunately none of the eems of factors from the 2 3 and 4 factor models was identical with the eem of nqs figs s1c and s4 indicating that parafac was unable to provide a clue for recognizing contaminants in addition the scores of these factors were not identical with the concentrations of nqs confirming that parafac was not able to analyze eems with unexpected contaminants effectively we further verified the contaminant diagnosis of pld with the mixtures of ha and several contaminants fig 4 three dihydroxybenzene isomerides with similar eems were tested fig 4a c the maximum excitation wavelength of 1 4 dihydroxybenzene was longer than those of 1 2 and 1 3 dihydroxybenzene 1 2 dihydroxybenzene had a higher fluorescent intensity at 300 350 nm than 1 3 dihydroxybenzene the eems of the contaminants estimated from the mixture using pld fig 4d f were identical with the eems of the spiked reference materials fig 4a c the differences between three the estimated eems of the contaminants also corresponded to the differences of the three isomerides this result confirms that pld was able to provide the eems of the unexpected contaminants which can be used to distinguish the contaminants with similar eems the eems of sulfanilamide and 1 4 benzoquinone were similar to that of dihydroxybenzene however the eems estimated in the spiked samples were identical with their reference materials fig 4g h j k and could be distinguished from the eems of dihydroxybenzene fig 4a c riboflavin fig 4i and salicylic acid fig 4m could also be well detected fig 4l n even their eems highly overlapped with that of ha fig s1a the concentrations of ha with and without contaminants were identical fig 4 confirming the feasibility of pld in analyzing ha with diverse contaminants fa from suwannee river and nqs mixtures were also tested using pld the estimated and actual concentrations of fa in the presence of nqs were close to each confirming that pld was robust for monitoring dom fig s4a the eem of nqs fig s1c and the estimated interfering component fig s4b were almost identical also confirming that pld was able to successfully separate the eem of contaminants from that of the mixture samples and providing a clue for recognizing unexpected contaminants the low concentration of ha 0 2 2 mg l with bsa 0 7 4 mg l cipro 18 100 μg l and nqs 0 7 4 mg l were also tested the result showed that ha can be quantified precisely and the estimated eem of bsa nqs and that of their standard substances were identical fig s5 for cipro although the concentrations of ha were well estimated p 0 28 the eems of cipro under 38 μg l were undetectable because the intensity of low concentration cipro was weak signal to noise ratio snr were under 3 however by increasing the integral time from 11 s to 113 s per eem the eem of 18 ng l was detectable with pld method fig s6 this result showed that the impact of concentration can be eliminated by using a longer integral time implying that pld method was feasible to handle the eem of samples with low concentration 3 3 quantification in natural water samples since the composition of fluorescent substances in natural water samples was unknown the first step was to decompose the samples and determine the target compound two components were determined by pffca representing protein and humic like substance the humic like substance was chosen as the target compound because it is complex and often overlaps with other substances making the quantification susceptible to the interference the fluorescence intensity was used to represent the relative concentration because the actual concentration was unknown bsa cipro and nqs were chosen as the contaminants pld was used to analyze the spiked samples without the eems of the contaminants as they cannot be predicted under actual conditions the relationships between the estimated fluorescence intensity with and without contaminants are shown in fig 5 the slopes were close to 1 1 04 0 95 and 1 05 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively indicating that the three contaminants did not have a notable impact on the quantification of humic like substance the average relative errors were 3 4 5 3 and 4 8 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively however by using a 2 factor model in parafac the slopes were 0 81 0 60 and 0 55 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively indicating that parafac cannot provide precise estimations compared to pld when parafac was used the average relative errors were 38 1 133 7 and 156 4 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively since the excitation emission wavelengths of cipro and nqs are highly overlapped with ha the average relative errors were substantially higher than those for pld confirming that pld provided more accurate estimations than parafac the 95 simultaneous observation bounds indicated that we have a 95 chance that the new observation is contained within the lower and upper prediction bounds the simultaneous observation bounds of pld were narrower than that of parafac indicating that pld is able to provide a more precise estimation of the concentration of dom than parafac the 2 factor model parafac was used because when using a 3 factor model the humic like component was split into two parts it was confusing to decide which part should be used to represent the humic like substance the values of r 2 were close to 1 using pld analysis 0 961 and 0 972 for cipro and nqs respectively demonstrating that the estimated and actual fluorescence intensities were highly correlated in contrast the values of r 2 were 0 09 and 0 04 for cipro and nqs respectively when using parafac indicating that the estimated and actual fluorescence intensities might be uncorrelated this might be because the eem of cipro and nqs are highly overlapped with humic substance the estimated fluorescence intensity of the humic like substance with different interfering levels using parafac is shown in fig s7 the value of r 2 of each interfering level was higher than that of the whole dataset because the fluorescence intensity of contaminant was constant in each level meaning that the estimated fluorescence intensities were only a function of actual fluorescence intensities however compared with the estimation of pld green crosses in fig s7 the result was overestimated by parafac when using cipro or nqs as the unexpected contaminant therefore the unexpected contaminants severely affect the estimated fluorescence intensity if the interfering peaks are not efficiently eliminated in contrast bsa is less overlapped with humic substances even when the interference of bsa was not completely eliminated the estimated fluorescence intensities were less affected than that with cipro and nqs samples with bsa as the contaminants had only one interfering component detected while cipro and nqs had two this is because that the bsa was overlapped with the original protein like component and they were treated as one component the two estimated contaminants in the sample containing cipro nqs correspond well with the original protein like substances and cipro nqs reference materials fig 6 this result also suggests that pld is still applicable in the presence of multiple contaminants and the strategy of contaminant determination is reliable since the estimated average cipro in river is near 100 ng l the low concentration cipro 10 100 ng l was spiked in the lake sample with a longer integral time 113 s per eem the eem of cipro can be estimated precisely when its concentration was over 40 ng l fig s8 when the concentration of cipro was under 40 ng l the fluorescence of cipro was undistinguishable from the humic like substance since the snr was low the presence of cipro did not interfere the quantification of humic like substance extracellular polymeric substances samples spiked with cipro and nqs also confirmed the above results detailed in supplementary material section 4 the average recover was 94 4 confirming that pld method was feasible to handle the eems of samples with low concentration 4 conclusions a new method pld is developed in this work by using this data handling strategy the concentration of fluorescent dom can be accurately and quickly determined even when unexpected contaminants exist in addition this method provides the eem of the contaminants which helps to identify the source of possible illegal wastewater discharge since single eem analysis e g the eem from on line monitoring is not applicable for parafac pld performs as a better alternative method for quickly and accurately revealing the changes of the target substances this work yields new insights into the decomposition process and a robust way to detect and eliminate interfering signals in eem applications in addition to the fluorescent dom in natural aqueous environments fluorescent substances in soluble microbial products and microbial extracellular polymeric substances from biological wastewater treatment plants as well as other fluorescent pollutants could also be monitored by using pld therefore such a method has a promising applicability for on line monitoring fluorescent substances in aqueous environments declaration of

with ha 0 2 2 0 mg l was also tested pld was used to analyze these spiked samples without the eems of the contaminants as they cannot be predicted under actual conditions 2 4 fluorescence data of natural waters samples two sample sets from natural sources with different contamination degrees and a sample set from a wwtp were tested samples from chaohu lake 31 32 081 n 117 38 845 e anhui province china representing lowly contaminated natural water were collected monthly from chaohu lake from march 2015 to january 2016 the second sample series was collected from the nanfeihe river anhui province china with a spatial distribution from 31 53 178 n 117 13 074 e to 31 43 050 n 117 24 246 e and was selected to represent highly contaminated natural water li et al 2012 liu et al 2012 these two sample series are respectively referred to as the lake sample and the river sample in the following discussion fig s2 the third sample series was collected from the wangtang wwtp hefei china for each sample the measurement was conducted in triplicate since the composition of the lake samples 10 125 113 the river sample 25 125 113 and the wwtp sample 20 125 113 were unknown parallel factor framework clustering analysis pffca was used to estimate the composition of each dataset qian et al 2017 pffca was used to identify the composition before quantification only because the eems of the target compounds were needed for pld three contaminants i e bsa cipro and nqs were used with various concentrations bsa was selected as the eem of protein like substances is identical to that of bsa thus spiked samples did not have additional fluorescent peaks and could be used to simulate the variation of protein like substances in environmental samples fluoroquinolones are the most commonly used antibiotics in china and cipro is the most commonly used fluoroquinolones for animals in china 4882 t year zhang et al 2015 the tested concentrations were 1 5 3 and 6 mg l for cipro and 10 20 and 40 mg l for bsa and nqs the concentrations of contaminants used in the experiments were higher than those in the environment as the method can be validated in a broader concentration range since the average concentration of cipro in environments is near 100 ng l zhang et al 2015 cipro with low concentrations 10 100 ng l is also spiked into lake samples the eem landscapes of bsa 40 mg l and cipro 6 mg l are respectively shown in figs s1d and e each natural sample randomly contains three interfering substances with different concentration levels and a total of 165 contaminated samples were prepared and tested 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance comparison of pld with parafac in treating a simulated dataset simulated datasets were firstly analyzed to provide a statistical result and avoid the impact of specific contaminants using the pld method for total 1000 tests of the simulated dataset the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were 99 9 100 and 97 7 with one two and three interfering peaks i e fluorescence of contaminants respectively fig 2 demonstrating that the pld method can provide accurate quantification in most cases parafac analysis was also tested as a comparison resulting in a much higher standard deviation of parafac than that of pld in all cases fig 2 the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were lower than 69 0 for all three models in all three datasets suggesting that less than 69 of cases could be quantified correctly using parafac when contaminants were present since the factor number affects the estimation accuracy of parafac choosing the right factor number might improve the performance of parafac however the best model of parafac in which the estimated fluorescence intensity was the closest to the actual fluorescence intensity blue boxes in fig 2 cannot provide a precise estimation the percentages for the relative errors within 5 were 76 3 79 5 and 76 8 for the one two and three interfering peak datasets respectively indicating that more than 20 of samples could not be correctly quantified using parafac regardless of how many factor numbers were chosen in this aspect the pld method is superior to conventional parafac analysis in the presence of contaminants 3 2 quantification of ha and fa in synthetic water samples we further investigated the capability of pld for quantifying and diagnosizing the mixture of ha and nqs the estimated and actual concentrations of ha in the presence of nqs were close to each other with an average relative error of 2 6 using pld fig 3 a the 2 3 and 4 factor models were tested for parafac and all of the factors are shown in fig 3b d when the ha concentration was high and the nqs concentration was low samples 1 to 30 one of the factors in the 2 factor model was highly correlated with ha concentration however when the concentration of nqs was higher than that of ha the concentration of ha was underestimated fig 3b in 3 and 4 factor models there was no factor corresponding to the ha concentration steadily indicating that these models are not appropriate fig 3c and d the average relative errors of parafac were over 48 4 67 0 and 40 6 for the 2 3 and 4 factor models respectively they were substantially higher than those of pld p 0 005 indicating that pld provided more accurate estimations the eem and fluorescence intensity of contaminants estimated by pld were also checked fig 3e the eem of nqs fig s1c and the estimated interfering component were almost identical indicating that pld can successfully separate the eem of contaminants from that of mixture samples and providing a clue for recognizing unexpected contaminants in addition pld also provided the fluorescence intensity of the contaminant relating to its contents in the sample fig 3f suggesting that pld could be used to evaluate the relative concentration of the interfering substance parafac could not provide the eem of interfering substance directly if one of the factors from parafac model corresponds with interfering component parafac is also able to identify the contaminant unfortunately none of the eems of factors from the 2 3 and 4 factor models was identical with the eem of nqs figs s1c and s4 indicating that parafac was unable to provide a clue for recognizing contaminants in addition the scores of these factors were not identical with the concentrations of nqs confirming that parafac was not able to analyze eems with unexpected contaminants effectively we further verified the contaminant diagnosis of pld with the mixtures of ha and several contaminants fig 4 three dihydroxybenzene isomerides with similar eems were tested fig 4a c the maximum excitation wavelength of 1 4 dihydroxybenzene was longer than those of 1 2 and 1 3 dihydroxybenzene 1 2 dihydroxybenzene had a higher fluorescent intensity at 300 350 nm than 1 3 dihydroxybenzene the eems of the contaminants estimated from the mixture using pld fig 4d f were identical with the eems of the spiked reference materials fig 4a c the differences between three the estimated eems of the contaminants also corresponded to the differences of the three isomerides this result confirms that pld was able to provide the eems of the unexpected contaminants which can be used to distinguish the contaminants with similar eems the eems of sulfanilamide and 1 4 benzoquinone were similar to that of dihydroxybenzene however the eems estimated in the spiked samples were identical with their reference materials fig 4g h j k and could be distinguished from the eems of dihydroxybenzene fig 4a c riboflavin fig 4i and salicylic acid fig 4m could also be well detected fig 4l n even their eems highly overlapped with that of ha fig s1a the concentrations of ha with and without contaminants were identical fig 4 confirming the feasibility of pld in analyzing ha with diverse contaminants fa from suwannee river and nqs mixtures were also tested using pld the estimated and actual concentrations of fa in the presence of nqs were close to each confirming that pld was robust for monitoring dom fig s4a the eem of nqs fig s1c and the estimated interfering component fig s4b were almost identical also confirming that pld was able to successfully separate the eem of contaminants from that of the mixture samples and providing a clue for recognizing unexpected contaminants the low concentration of ha 0 2 2 mg l with bsa 0 7 4 mg l cipro 18 100 μg l and nqs 0 7 4 mg l were also tested the result showed that ha can be quantified precisely and the estimated eem of bsa nqs and that of their standard substances were identical fig s5 for cipro although the concentrations of ha were well estimated p 0 28 the eems of cipro under 38 μg l were undetectable because the intensity of low concentration cipro was weak signal to noise ratio snr were under 3 however by increasing the integral time from 11 s to 113 s per eem the eem of 18 ng l was detectable with pld method fig s6 this result showed that the impact of concentration can be eliminated by using a longer integral time implying that pld method was feasible to handle the eem of samples with low concentration 3 3 quantification in natural water samples since the composition of fluorescent substances in natural water samples was unknown the first step was to decompose the samples and determine the target compound two components were determined by pffca representing protein and humic like substance the humic like substance was chosen as the target compound because it is complex and often overlaps with other substances making the quantification susceptible to the interference the fluorescence intensity was used to represent the relative concentration because the actual concentration was unknown bsa cipro and nqs were chosen as the contaminants pld was used to analyze the spiked samples without the eems of the contaminants as they cannot be predicted under actual conditions the relationships between the estimated fluorescence intensity with and without contaminants are shown in fig 5 the slopes were close to 1 1 04 0 95 and 1 05 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively indicating that the three contaminants did not have a notable impact on the quantification of humic like substance the average relative errors were 3 4 5 3 and 4 8 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively however by using a 2 factor model in parafac the slopes were 0 81 0 60 and 0 55 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively indicating that parafac cannot provide precise estimations compared to pld when parafac was used the average relative errors were 38 1 133 7 and 156 4 for bsa cipro and nqs respectively since the excitation emission wavelengths of cipro and nqs are highly overlapped with ha the average relative errors were substantially higher than those for pld confirming that pld provided more accurate estimations than parafac the 95 simultaneous observation bounds indicated that we have a 95 chance that the new observation is contained within the lower and upper prediction bounds the simultaneous observation bounds of pld were narrower than that of parafac indicating that pld is able to provide a more precise estimation of the concentration of dom than parafac the 2 factor model parafac was used because when using a 3 factor model the humic like component was split into two parts it was confusing to decide which part should be used to represent the humic like substance the values of r 2 were close to 1 using pld analysis 0 961 and 0 972 for cipro and nqs respectively demonstrating that the estimated and actual fluorescence intensities were highly correlated in contrast the values of r 2 were 0 09 and 0 04 for cipro and nqs respectively when using parafac indicating that the estimated and actual fluorescence intensities might be uncorrelated this might be because the eem of cipro and nqs are highly overlapped with humic substance the estimated fluorescence intensity of the humic like substance with different interfering levels using parafac is shown in fig s7 the value of r 2 of each interfering level was higher than that of the whole dataset because the fluorescence intensity of contaminant was constant in each level meaning that the estimated fluorescence intensities were only a function of actual fluorescence intensities however compared with the estimation of pld green crosses in fig s7 the result was overestimated by parafac when using cipro or nqs as the unexpected contaminant therefore the unexpected contaminants severely affect the estimated fluorescence intensity if the interfering peaks are not efficiently eliminated in contrast bsa is less overlapped with humic substances even when the interference of bsa was not completely eliminated the estimated fluorescence intensities were less affected than that with cipro and nqs samples with bsa as the contaminants had only one interfering component detected while cipro and nqs had two this is because that the bsa was overlapped with the original protein like component and they were treated as one component the two estimated contaminants in the sample containing cipro nqs correspond well with the original protein like substances and cipro nqs reference materials fig 6 this result also suggests that pld is still applicable in the presence of multiple contaminants and the strategy of contaminant determination is reliable since the estimated average cipro in river is near 100 ng l the low concentration cipro 10 100 ng l was spiked in the lake sample with a longer integral time 113 s per eem the eem of cipro can be estimated precisely when its concentration was over 40 ng l fig s8 when the concentration of cipro was under 40 ng l the fluorescence of cipro was undistinguishable from the humic like substance since the snr was low the presence of cipro did not interfere the quantification of humic like substance extracellular polymeric substances samples spiked with cipro and nqs also confirmed the above results detailed in supplementary material section 4 the average recover was 94 4 confirming that pld method was feasible to handle the eems of samples with low concentration 4 conclusions a new method pld is developed in this work by using this data handling strategy the concentration of fluorescent dom can be accurately and quickly determined even when unexpected contaminants exist in addition this method provides the eem of the contaminants which helps to identify the source of possible illegal wastewater discharge since single eem analysis e g the eem from on line monitoring is not applicable for parafac pld performs as a better alternative method for quickly and accurately revealing the changes of the target substances this work yields new insights into the decomposition process and a robust way to detect and eliminate interfering signals in eem applications in addition to the fluorescent dom in natural aqueous environments fluorescent substances in soluble microbial products and microbial extracellular polymeric substances from biological wastewater treatment plants as well as other fluorescent pollutants could also be monitored by using pld therefore such a method has a promising applicability for on line monitoring fluorescent substances in aqueous environments declaration of

18589,ammonium nh4 can be recovered from water for fertiliser production or even energy production purposes because nh4 recovery is more effective at increased concentrations electrodialysis ed can be used to concentrate nh4 from side streams such as sludge reject water and simultaneously achieve high nh4 removal efficiencies however the effect of osmosis and back diffusion increases when the nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate stream increases resulting in a limitation of the concentration factor and an increase in energy consumption for nh4 removal in this study we showed that operation at dynamic current density dcd reduced the effect of osmosis and back diffusion due to a 75 decrease of the operational run time compared to operation at a fixed current density fcd the concentration factor increased from 4 5 for an fcd to 6 7 for dcd while the energy consumption of 90 nh4 removal from synthetic sludge reject water at dcd remained stable at 5 4 mj kg n 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrodialysis ammonium current efficiency back diffusion osmosis electro osmosis 1 introduction 1 1 current side stream ammonia treatment after organic protein degradation ammonia nh3 ultimately ends up in wastewater streams in the form of ammonium nh4 which is an aqueous pollutant because the excessive discharge of nh4 to receiving water bodies leads to eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion traditionally nh4 removal in wastewater treatment plants is achieved by the energy intensive nitrification denitrification process by means of side stream treatment of the liquid fraction of sludge digestate reject water by the more energy efficient anammox process the total nh4 load to the nitrification denitrification can be reduced by 15 25 resulting in a reduction of the total energy consumption of the wastewater treatment plant compared to no reject water treatment van hulle et al 2010 lackner et al 2014 in the review of magri et al 2013 it is mentioned that the side stream removal of nh4 requires 57 mj kg n 1 by means of nitrification denitrification via nitrite and that partial nitrification anammox requires 19 mj kg n 1 furthermore lackner et al 2014 later reported that the energy consumption of side stream nh4 removal in full scale partial nitrification anammox installations ranges only 3 15 mj kg n 1 in the last two decades there has been a growing interest for the recovery of nh4 from residual waste waters as a resource for fertilisers using mature technologies such as struvite precipitation and air stripping mehta et al 2015 in addition bio electrochemical technologies such as microbial fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells and electrochemical cells are widely studied for recovery of nh4 from side streams such as reject water and urine according to the review of kuntke et al 2018 who reported on more than thirty studies on electrochemical nh4 recovery however the recovery of nh4 from side streams still faces many challenges low nh4 transport fluxes and limited nh4 removal efficiencies for bio electrochemical systems and high energy and chemical consumption for the mature technologies and electrochemical cells mehta et al 2015 kuntke et al 2018 1 2 ammonia as an energy source interestingly nh3 was recently identified as a suitable energy carrier being an alternative to carbon based energy carriers ispt 2017 the chemically bound energy in nh3 21 mj kg n 1 lower heating value at t 700 c can be converted into electricity and heat by internal nh3 cracking and subsequent hydrogen oxidation in a solid oxide fuel cell sofc with nitrogen gas and water as final products wojcik et al 2003 the sofc is recognised as a very efficient technology to convert chemical energy to electrical energy with an electrical efficiency of 60 while an additional 30 of the converted chemical energy can be used as high quality heat stambouli and traversa 2002 1 3 need to concentrate ammonium the use of nh3 as a fuel for sofcs opens opportunities for energy production from nh3 recovered from residual waters however to convert the chemically stored energy in nh3 it must firstly be stripped from the water nh3 stripping is more effective at higher feed concentrations and when the medium ph is increased commonly done by chemical addition or co2 stripping converting nh4 to nh3 pka 9 25 after ph increase nh3 stripping can be achieved by vacuum membrane stripping vms allowing for direct recovery of gaseous nh3 literature on vacuum membrane stripping of nh3 shows that at higher concentrations of nh3 in the liquid feed higher mass fractions of nh3 in the gaseous permeate can be obtained el bourawi et al 2007 he et al 2018 in addition literature reports that in sofcs higher mass fractions of nh3 gaseous feed lead to higher power densities cinti et al 2016 therefore to allow for better stripping of nh3 for fertiliser production or energy production purposes nh4 in side streams should be concentrated 1 4 concentrating ammonium by electrodialysis in this study electrodialysis ed is used to concentrate nh4 because it simultaneously concentrates nh4 in the concentrate stream and achieves high nh4 removal efficiencies in the diluate stream the feed water pronk et al 2006 removed nh4 for 85 from source separated urine for nutrient recovery purposes and concentrated nh4 by a factor of 3 2 with an energy consumption of 96 mj kg n 1 in addition mondor et al 2008 and ippersiel et al 2012 used ed for nh4 recovery from digested swine manure and removed 75 and 87 respectively while achieving a concentration factor for nh4 of 2 8 and 5 6 respectively the energy consumption for removing and concentrating nh4 in these two studies ranged 18 71 mj kg n 1 furthermore wang et al 2015 achieved full removal of nh4 from sludge reject water by ed for nutrient recovery purposes and obtained a concentration factor of 18 however the energy consumption was much higher than the other reported studies 202 258 mj kg n 1 finally ward et al 2018 used ed to recover nh4 from sludge reject water on pilot scale achieving a concentration factor of 8 5 for nh4 however the removal of nh4 from the sludge reject water was limited to 23 while the energy consumption for nh4 removal was competitive to anammox 18 mj kg n 1 1 5 problems with concentrating ammonium with electrodialysis the concentration factor for concentrating ions by ed is limited by water transport pronk et al 2006 mondor et al 2008 rottiers et al 2014 ward et al 2018 the ion concentration gradient that establishes across the membranes between the diluate and concentrate causes osmosis strathmann 2004a resulting in dilution of the concentrate in addition the ion concentration gradient causes the concentrated ions to diffuse from the concentrate back to the diluate back diffusion strathmann 2004b the diffused ions need to be transported back and forth requiring an additional supply of electrical charge and thus consumed energy back diffusion therefore results in a decrease in current efficiency strathmann 2004b and an increase in energy consumption the reported studies on concentrating nh4 by ed either applied a fixed voltage or a fixed current density fcd when a fixed voltage is applied the limiting current density lcd may be exceeded at low ion concentrations in the diluate water dissociates into h and oh when the lcd is exceeded resulting in a decreased current efficiency and an increase in energy consumption strathmann 2010 when an fcd is applied a current density equal to or lower than the lcd of the aimed diluate ion concentration is applied however the application of low current densities leads to low ion transport fluxes indicating inefficient use of membranes and high operational run times by decreasing the operational run time the effect of osmosis and back diffusion can be decreased because an ion concentration gradient will inevitably establish when concentrating ions such as nh4 1 6 objective previous research has shown that ed can effectively be applied to remove nh4 from side streams in this study we propose to operate ed at dynamic current density dcd to more efficiently use ion exchange membranes reduce the required membrane area to increase the concentration factor and reduce the energy consumption for dcd operation the current density is dynamically adjusted in agreement with the decreasing ion concentration of the diluate without exceeding the lcd the effect of the current density on the concentration factor and energy consumption was studied by assessing the water transport and the nh4 current efficiency during sequencing batch experiments at both the application of an fcd and dcd 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fig 1 presents a schematic representation of the used experimental set up we used a bench scale pc cell 64002 ed cell consisting of a pt ir coated titanium anode and a v4a steel cathode with an electrode area of 8 8 cm2 in between the electrodes a ten cell pair membrane stack was placed consisting of two pca sc cation exchange end ceem ten pca sa standard anion exchange aem and nine pca sk standard cation exchange membranes cem pca 2016 the membrane stack contained polyethylene silicone spacers to separate the electrodes and membranes creating electrode rinse diluate and concentrate channels the spacers had a thickness of 0 5 mm and a void fraction of 59 the lay out of the electrodes flow channels and membranes is schematically represented in fig 2 the diluate and concentrate solutions were recirculated through the ed cell at a cross flow velocity of 2 cm s 1 following the recommendations of strathmann 2010 the cross flow velocity was controlled by using a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 520s pump at a flow rate of 19 l h 1 the electrodes were rinsed with an electrode rinse solution at the same flow rate used for the diluate and concentrate separate watson marlow 323 pump heads were used for each solution for the application of electrical current a tenma 72 2535 power supply with an electrical current and electrical potential range of 0 001 3 000 a and 0 01 30 00 v respectively was used the electrical conductivity ec and ph of the electrode rinse diluate and concentrate were measured in the respective solution bottles using two calibrated tetracon 925 ec sensors and a calibrated ids sentix 940 ph sensors respectively on a wtw multi 3630 ids multi meter nh4 concentrations were measured with machery nagel nanocolor ammonium 200 range 0 04 0 2 g l 1 and 2000 range 0 4 2 0 g l 1 test kits solution volumes were determined using calibrated volumetric cylinders initial diluate and concentrate solutions consisting of 6 6 g l 1 nh4hco3 were used equal to an nh4 concentration of 1 5 g l 1 simulating nh4 concentrations commonly present in sludge reject waters we used synthetic solutions to be able to study the effect of back diffusion and electro osmosis as function of the nh4 concentration gradient on the concentration factor and energy consumption at different current density operations the initial electrode rinse solutions consisted of 1 m nano3 the salts were of analytical grade sigma aldrich reagent plus 99 and were added to 1 l of demi water the experiments were conducted at room temperature t 22 1 c 2 2 performance indicators to assess water transport we determined how much water was transported from the diluate to the concentrate by relating the water transport to the initial water mass the relative water transport was determined eq 1 water transport to the electrode rinse was neglected since only one diluate and concentrate channel were in contact with the electrode chambers besides extra thick ceems were placed next to electrode

diluate to the concentrate in addition water transport is caused by the application of electrical current which causes water transport in the hydration shell of the transported ions from the diluate to the concentrate electro osmosis the electro osmotic water transport eq 2 was determined based on the amount of transported ions and their respective water transport numbers strathmann 2004a we assumed that for every transported mole of nh4 1 mol of hco3 was transported to maintain charge balance in the diluate and concentrate flow channels based on the hydration numbers amount of moles of water in the first hydration shell per mole of ions determined in the studies of brugé et al 1999 and leung et al 2007 water transport numbers of four and seven were used for nh4 and hco3 respectively agreeing with the range of four to eight of strathmann 2004a the osmotic water transport was determined based on the mass balance of water transport eq 3 2 θ h 2 o e o n n h 4 d t w n h 4 t w h c o 3

determined the relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd to this end various dilutions of the initial diluate 1 0 9 0 8 0 75 0 6 0 5 0 25 0 05 and 0 01 were prepared subsequently the current density was increased with steps of 1 5 a m 2 while the electrical current and electrical potential were logged automatically to determine the lcd for each dilution following the method of cowan and brown 1959 to avoid water dissociation in local ion depleted zones strathmann 2004d recommends using a safety factor sf 1 for the application of lcd operating at dcd is thus similar to the application of lcd in batch mode while using a safety factor we determined a safety factor for the lcd to apply dcd representing an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption to find an optimum for these quantities with different units we normalised the operational run time eq 6 and energy consumption eq 7 for sf 1 we assigned equal weights to operational and energy consumption while in practice different weights can be assigned to determine an economical cost based optimum safety factor strathmann 2004d safety factors of 0 5 0 75 and 1 were used to experimentally determine the safety factor that represents an optimum between the operational run time and energy consumption according to theory the operational run time to transport a fixed amount of charge as ions is minimal for sf 1 and increases reciprocally for lower safety factors see s i the normalised operational run time as a function of the safety factor is therefore described by α sf 1 1 contrarily the energy consumption to transport a certain amount of charge as ions has a maximum at sf 1 and decreases linearly for lower safety factors see s i therefore the normalised energy consumption as a function of the safety factor can be described by β sf 6 α t s f t s f 1 t s f 1 7 β e s f e s f 1 where α normalised operational run time unitless and β normalised energy consumption unitless to dynamically set the electrical current we developed a python script that calculated the electrical current based on the real time diluate ec the used safety factor and the determined relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd the diluate ec measurements were logged on a laptop every 5 s and subsequently the laptop controlled the power supply automatically to apply the electrical current electrical current and electrical potential data logged every 5 s on the laptop the data of the concentrate ec was stored on a multimeter and the ph of all solutions was manually measured before and after each run for the three chosen safety factors duplicate runs with fresh solutions were conducted in which the diluate ec was always decreased to 1 ms cm 1 finally we conducted sequencing batch experiments sbes in duplicate to assess the water transport and nh4 current efficiency and study the effect of the current density an fcd and dcd on the concentration factor and the energy consumption for the first batch fresh diluate concentrate and electrode rinse solutions were used and the nh4 concentrations and volumes of all solutions were measured after that the diluate ec was again decreased to 1 ms cm 1 and the nh4 concentration and volume of all solutions were measured to make water and nh4 balances for the subsequent nine batches the diluate was replaced for a fresh diluate solution and the concentrate and electrode rinse solutions of the previous batch were reused the electrical current during the dcd sbe was again applied using the automated control based on the python script 3 results 3 1 determination of current densities we found a linear r2 0 92 relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd at a cross flow velocity of 2 cm s 1 fig 3 a which was used to determine the current densities for the application of an fcd and dcd in the sbes subsequently we determined an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption by using a safety factor of 0 5 0 75 and 1 for the lcd fig 3b depicts the experimentally determined α and β as a function of the safety factor the experimentally determined α had a minimum at sf 1 and increased for lower safety factors on the contrary the experimentally determined β had a maximum at sf 1 and decreased for lower safety factors by means of fitting trend lines for the experimentally determined α and β an optimum for the safety factor at 0 62 was found 3 2 sequencing batch experiment at a fixed current density for the fcd sbe a current density of 16 a m 2 was applied based on the lcd of the final diluate ec 1 ms cm 1 and a safety factor of 0 62 fig 4 a presents the diluate and concentrate ec over the cumulative amount of consumed energy during the fcd sbe the operational run time to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 increased by 58 over the number of batches from 158 min for the first batch to 250 min for the tenth batch because the concentrate was recirculated during the sbe the concentrate ec increased but reached a plateau at 32 ms cm 1 from the nh4 concentrations during the fcd sbe experiment fig 4b it follows that 91 1 avg std of the nh4 from the diluate was removed for all batches the nh4 concentration in the concentrate reached a plateau at 6 8 g l 1 corresponding to a concentration factor of 4 5 the difference in concentration factor between the duplicate fcd sbes was 5 the increase in nh4 concentration of the concentrate resulted in an increase in the nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and concentrate over the number of batches the nh4 concentration gradient was 2 4 g l 1 for the first batch and increased to 6 6 g l 1 for the tenth batch in addition to the diluate and concentrate nh4 concentrations fig 4b also presents the nh4 concentration in the electrode rinse showing that 21 3 of the nh4 transported from each diluate batch was transported to and accumulated in the electrode rinse the energy consumption increased over the number of batches from 3 6 mj kg n 1 for the first batch to 6 1 mj kg n 1 for the tenth batch 3 3 continuous batch experiment at dynamic current density for the dcd sbe a safety factor of 0 62 was used in combination with a variable current density based on the lcd of the decreasing diluate ec fig 5 a presents the diluate and concentrate ec over the cumulative amount of consumed energy during the dcd sbe similar to the fcd sbe the operational run time increased over the number of batches however the operational run time increased only by 29 from 49 min for the first batch to 63 min for the tenth batch the application of dcd resulted in a reduction of 69 75 of the operational run time with respect to the application of an fcd the reduced operational run time can be translated to a decreased in required membrane area to treat a certain volume of feed water in addition the concentrate ec did not reach a plateau and reached 40 ms cm 1 after ten batches during the dcd sbe 90 1 of the nh4 from the diluate was removed for each sequencing batch as follows from fig 5b however in contrast to the fcd sbe the concentration of nh4 in the concentrate did not reach a plateau but increased linearly to 10 g l 1 after ten batches corresponding to a concentration factor of 6 7 the difference in concentration factor between the replicate dcd sbes was negligible 1 the nh4 concentration gradient increased from 2 4 g l 1 for the first batch to 9 8 g l 1 for the final batch similar to the fcd sbe 24 7 of nh4 transported from the diluate accumulated in the electrode rinse during the dcd sbe in contrast to the increasing energy consumption during the fcd sbe the energy consumption during the dcd sbe remained stable at 5 4 0 4 mj kg n 1 the energy consumption of the tenth batch was lower for the application of dcd 5 9 mj kg n 1 than for the application of an fcd 6 1 mj kg n 1 while the nh4 concentration gradient was actually higher for the application of dcd 9 8 g l 1 than for an fcd 6 6 g l 1 4 discussion 4 1 determination of current densities the found linear relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd corresponds with strathmann 2004c who reported that the lcd is linearly related to the diluate ion concentration for a specific flow channel geometry and cross flow velocity in addition an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption was experimentally found at a safety factor of 0 62 fig 3b also presents the theoretical α and β similar to the experimentally determined α and β a theoretical optimum was found at a safety factor of 0 62 by equating the theoretical expressions for α and β 4 2 sequencing batch experiment at a fixed current density the plateau of the nh4 concentration in the concentrate and thus the limitation of the concentration factor was caused by water transport from the diluate to the concentrate fig 6 a shows how much water was transported during each batch by electro osmosis and osmosis as a function of the nh4 concentration gradient for the fcd sbe osmosis was the dominant mechanism of water transport the electro osmotic water transport remained constant at 1 5 of the diluate throughout the sbe because always the same amount of nh4 was removed from the diluate 1 34 0 02 g the removal of nh4 was constant because the diluate ec of the fresh solutions was always decreased to 1 ms cm 1 the osmotic water transport increased from 2 5 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 to 10 5 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 6 6 g l 1 the increase in osmotic water transport was caused by two factors because the nh4 concentration gradient increased the driving force for osmosis was higher and because the operational run time increased more time was available to allow osmosis to take place nh4 accumulation in the electrode rinse was caused by transport of nh4 from the diluate through a cation exchange end membrane ending up in the electrode rinse at the cathode side of the membrane stack at the anode side of the membrane stack an equivalent amount of charge migrated as cations from the electrode rinse to the concentrate however because the electrode rinse consisted of 1 m nano3 the transported charge not only consisted of nh4 but also of na this phenomenon is schematically presented in fig 2 by taking into account the accumulated nh4 in the electrode rinse solution the nh4 mass balances fitted within 5 while previous researchers assigned a 17 28 nh4 loss to volatilisation of nh3 from the diluate concentrate and electrode rinse mondor et al 2008 ward et al 2018 fig 7a presents the nh4 current efficiency over the nh4 concentration gradient during the fcd sbe the nh4 current efficiency was 76 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 and decreased to 48 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 6 6 g l 1 in general current efficiency in ed is mainly affected by water dissociation at current densities higher than the lcd the transport of other ions than the target ion and back diffusion strathmann 2004b pronk et al 2006 because during the fcd sbe the lcd was never exceeded due to the application of the safety factor the effect of water dissociation on the nh4 current efficiency was negligible besides the ph ranged 7 8 8 8 throughout the entire sbe at ph 7 8 h represented only 1 5 10 3 c as charge while nh4 in the initial diluate represented approximately 7500 c in addition na is transported from the electrode rinse solution to the concentrate and is therefore assumed not to be relevant for the assessment of the nh4 current efficiency therefore also the effect of the transport of other cations such as h and na on the nh4 current efficiency was negligible according to rottiers et al 2014 the ion concentration gradient and back diffusion are linearly related because during the fcd sbe the nh4 current efficiency decreased over the increasing nh4 concentration gradient the decrease in the nh4 current efficiency is assigned to back diffusion also in line with pronk et al 2006 during the fcd sbe the nh4 concentration gradient increased resulting in a higher driving force for back diffusion for each sequencing batch because back diffusion took place from the concentrate to the diluate nh4 needed to be transported back and forth to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 resulting in an increase in the operational run time the transport of back diffused nh4 was at the expense of more supplied electrical charge which led to a decrease in the nh4 current efficiency because for each batch more back diffusion took place over the number of batches more electrical energy was required to transport nh4 to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 the energy consumption increased from 3 6 mj kg n 1 to 6 1 mj kg n 1 when the nh4 concentration gradient increased from 2 4 g l 1 to 6 6 g l 1 as presented in fig 7 b 4 3 continuous batch experiment at dynamic current density fig 6b depicts the water transport during the dcd sbe for the first batches electro osmosis was dominant and only for later batches osmosis became the dominant water transport mechanism the electro osmotic water transport of 1 6 was constant during the dcd sbe and was similar to the electro osmotic water transport during the fcd sbe 1 5 the osmotic water transport was only 0 1 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 and increased to 3 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 9 8 g l 1 since the osmotic driving force was higher during the dcd sbe than the during fcd sbe the decrease in osmotic water transport is caused by the decreased operational run time due to the application of dcd results indicate that due to the decrease in the operational run time by means of the application of dcd less osmosis took place resulting in a higher concentration factor with respect to an fcd fig 7a presents the nh4 current efficiency over the nh4 concentration gradient for the dcd sbe if na from the electrolyte ended up in the diluate and was transported to the concentrate it would account for a 24 loss in the nh4 current efficiency however the nh4 current efficiency for the first batch was 96 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 this high nh4 current efficiency supports our claim that the nh4 current efficiency was not affected by the transport of other ions than nh4 such as h and na throughout the sbe the nh4 current efficiency decreased to 83 in the tenth batch at an nh4 concentration gradient of 9 8 g l 1 similar to the fcd sbe more back diffusion took place due to the increase in nh4 concentration gradient and the increase in operational run time however the effect of back diffusion on the nh4 current efficiency only caused a decrease in nh4 current efficiency of 13 during the dcd sbe compared to a decrease in nh4 current efficiency of 28 during the fcd sbe since the nh4 concentration gradient was even higher for the dcd sbe than for the fcd sbe the higher current efficiencies and the lower decrease in nh4 current efficiency are assigned to the decreased operational run times during the dcd sbe apparently decreasing the operational run time by the application of dcd results in less back diffusion compared to an fcd leading to a higher nh4 current efficiency the increase in operational run time and nh4 concentration gradient did not affect the energy consumption for the application of dcd 5 4 0 4 mj kg n 1 in contrast to an fcd the increase in energy consumption due to back diffusion was countered by the decrease of the electrical resistance because the ec of the concentrate increased 4 4 perspectives and outlook the application of dcd led to a decrease in operational run time compared to an fcd and therefore decreased the effect of osmosis and back diffusion as a result the nh4 concentration factor increased and the energy consumption was lower compared to the application of an fcd if the water permeability of the ion exchange membranes could be decreased the effect of osmotic water transport can be further decreased while an increase in electrical resistance of the ion exchange membrane should be avoided the electrical resistance of the membrane stack can in fact be reduced when spacers with a low thickness or with a high void fraction are used besides nh4 accumulation in the electrode rinse limited the concentration factors for both the application of fcd and dcd by replacing the na in the initial electrode rinse with nh4 accumulation of nh4 in the electrode rinse can be avoided resulting in a further increase in the concentration factor in addition the use of anion exchange end membranes might also prevent the accumulation of nh4 in the electrode rinse based on the current results we expect that ed can be used to remove and concentrate nh4 from side streams such as reject water at an energy consumption competitive to anammox since there is no bio chemical conversion recovery of nh4 for e g fertiliser production or even energy production will be possible calculations show that less electrical energy was used to remove and concentrate nh4 5 4 mj kg n 1 than an sofc may produce using nh3 as fuel 13 mj kg n 1 assuming an electric conversion efficiency of 60 the combination of ed stripping and a solid oxide fuel cell could therefore potentially lead to energy positive nh4 removal from side streams 5 conclusions concentrating nh4 by ed resulted in an nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate stream the increasing gradient subsequently resulted in increased mass transfer by osmosis and back diffusion the increased back diffusion of nh4 decreased the nh4 current efficiency from 76 to 48 when applying an fcd and the energy consumption for the removal of 90 nh4 increased from 3 6 mj kg n 1 to 6 1 mj kg n 1 when a dcd was applied the operational run time to remove 90 nh4 decreased by 75 which can be translated to a reduction in required membrane area the application of dcd resulted in a decrease in osmotic water transport compared to an fcd leading to an increased concentration factor of 6 7 when applying a dcd the nh4 current efficiency only slightly dropped over the nh4 concentration gradient i e from 96 to 83 and eventually 90 nh4 was removed at the expense of a stable energy consumption of 5 4 mj kg n 1 the results clearly show that the application of dcd allows for a lower operational run time a higher concentration factor and a lower energy consumption to concentrate nh4 by ed compared to an fcd author contributions the manuscript was written through the contributions of all authors n van linden designed and performed the

18589,ammonium nh4 can be recovered from water for fertiliser production or even energy production purposes because nh4 recovery is more effective at increased concentrations electrodialysis ed can be used to concentrate nh4 from side streams such as sludge reject water and simultaneously achieve high nh4 removal efficiencies however the effect of osmosis and back diffusion increases when the nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate stream increases resulting in a limitation of the concentration factor and an increase in energy consumption for nh4 removal in this study we showed that operation at dynamic current density dcd reduced the effect of osmosis and back diffusion due to a 75 decrease of the operational run time compared to operation at a fixed current density fcd the concentration factor increased from 4 5 for an fcd to 6 7 for dcd while the energy consumption of 90 nh4 removal from synthetic sludge reject water at dcd remained stable at 5 4 mj kg n 1 graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrodialysis ammonium current efficiency back diffusion osmosis electro osmosis 1 introduction 1 1 current side stream ammonia treatment after organic protein degradation ammonia nh3 ultimately ends up in wastewater streams in the form of ammonium nh4 which is an aqueous pollutant because the excessive discharge of nh4 to receiving water bodies leads to eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion traditionally nh4 removal in wastewater treatment plants is achieved by the energy intensive nitrification denitrification process by means of side stream treatment of the liquid fraction of sludge digestate reject water by the more energy efficient anammox process the total nh4 load to the nitrification denitrification can be reduced by 15 25 resulting in a reduction of the total energy consumption of the wastewater treatment plant compared to no reject water treatment van hulle et al 2010 lackner et al 2014 in the review of magri et al 2013 it is mentioned that the side stream removal of nh4 requires 57 mj kg n 1 by means of nitrification denitrification via nitrite and that partial nitrification anammox requires 19 mj kg n 1 furthermore lackner et al 2014 later reported that the energy consumption of side stream nh4 removal in full scale partial nitrification anammox installations ranges only 3 15 mj kg n 1 in the last two decades there has been a growing interest for the recovery of nh4 from residual waste waters as a resource for fertilisers using mature technologies such as struvite precipitation and air stripping mehta et al 2015 in addition bio electrochemical technologies such as microbial fuel cells microbial electrolysis cells and electrochemical cells are widely studied for recovery of nh4 from side streams such as reject water and urine according to the review of kuntke et al 2018 who reported on more than thirty studies on electrochemical nh4 recovery however the recovery of nh4 from side streams still faces many challenges low nh4 transport fluxes and limited nh4 removal efficiencies for bio electrochemical systems and high energy and chemical consumption for the mature technologies and electrochemical cells mehta et al 2015 kuntke et al 2018 1 2 ammonia as an energy source interestingly nh3 was recently identified as a suitable energy carrier being an alternative to carbon based energy carriers ispt 2017 the chemically bound energy in nh3 21 mj kg n 1 lower heating value at t 700 c can be converted into electricity and heat by internal nh3 cracking and subsequent hydrogen oxidation in a solid oxide fuel cell sofc with nitrogen gas and water as final products wojcik et al 2003 the sofc is recognised as a very efficient technology to convert chemical energy to electrical energy with an electrical efficiency of 60 while an additional 30 of the converted chemical energy can be used as high quality heat stambouli and traversa 2002 1 3 need to concentrate ammonium the use of nh3 as a fuel for sofcs opens opportunities for energy production from nh3 recovered from residual waters however to convert the chemically stored energy in nh3 it must firstly be stripped from the water nh3 stripping is more effective at higher feed concentrations and when the medium ph is increased commonly done by chemical addition or co2 stripping converting nh4 to nh3 pka 9 25 after ph increase nh3 stripping can be achieved by vacuum membrane stripping vms allowing for direct recovery of gaseous nh3 literature on vacuum membrane stripping of nh3 shows that at higher concentrations of nh3 in the liquid feed higher mass fractions of nh3 in the gaseous permeate can be obtained el bourawi et al 2007 he et al 2018 in addition literature reports that in sofcs higher mass fractions of nh3 gaseous feed lead to higher power densities cinti et al 2016 therefore to allow for better stripping of nh3 for fertiliser production or energy production purposes nh4 in side streams should be concentrated 1 4 concentrating ammonium by electrodialysis in this study electrodialysis ed is used to concentrate nh4 because it simultaneously concentrates nh4 in the concentrate stream and achieves high nh4 removal efficiencies in the diluate stream the feed water pronk et al 2006 removed nh4 for 85 from source separated urine for nutrient recovery purposes and concentrated nh4 by a factor of 3 2 with an energy consumption of 96 mj kg n 1 in addition mondor et al 2008 and ippersiel et al 2012 used ed for nh4 recovery from digested swine manure and removed 75 and 87 respectively while achieving a concentration factor for nh4 of 2 8 and 5 6 respectively the energy consumption for removing and concentrating nh4 in these two studies ranged 18 71 mj kg n 1 furthermore wang et al 2015 achieved full removal of nh4 from sludge reject water by ed for nutrient recovery purposes and obtained a concentration factor of 18 however the energy consumption was much higher than the other reported studies 202 258 mj kg n 1 finally ward et al 2018 used ed to recover nh4 from sludge reject water on pilot scale achieving a concentration factor of 8 5 for nh4 however the removal of nh4 from the sludge reject water was limited to 23 while the energy consumption for nh4 removal was competitive to anammox 18 mj kg n 1 1 5 problems with concentrating ammonium with electrodialysis the concentration factor for concentrating ions by ed is limited by water transport pronk et al 2006 mondor et al 2008 rottiers et al 2014 ward et al 2018 the ion concentration gradient that establishes across the membranes between the diluate and concentrate causes osmosis strathmann 2004a resulting in dilution of the concentrate in addition the ion concentration gradient causes the concentrated ions to diffuse from the concentrate back to the diluate back diffusion strathmann 2004b the diffused ions need to be transported back and forth requiring an additional supply of electrical charge and thus consumed energy back diffusion therefore results in a decrease in current efficiency strathmann 2004b and an increase in energy consumption the reported studies on concentrating nh4 by ed either applied a fixed voltage or a fixed current density fcd when a fixed voltage is applied the limiting current density lcd may be exceeded at low ion concentrations in the diluate water dissociates into h and oh when the lcd is exceeded resulting in a decreased current efficiency and an increase in energy consumption strathmann 2010 when an fcd is applied a current density equal to or lower than the lcd of the aimed diluate ion concentration is applied however the application of low current densities leads to low ion transport fluxes indicating inefficient use of membranes and high operational run times by decreasing the operational run time the effect of osmosis and back diffusion can be decreased because an ion concentration gradient will inevitably establish when concentrating ions such as nh4 1 6 objective previous research has shown that ed can effectively be applied to remove nh4 from side streams in this study we propose to operate ed at dynamic current density dcd to more efficiently use ion exchange membranes reduce the required membrane area to increase the concentration factor and reduce the energy consumption for dcd operation the current density is dynamically adjusted in agreement with the decreasing ion concentration of the diluate without exceeding the lcd the effect of the current density on the concentration factor and energy consumption was studied by assessing the water transport and the nh4 current efficiency during sequencing batch experiments at both the application of an fcd and dcd 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials fig 1 presents a schematic representation of the used experimental set up we used a bench scale pc cell 64002 ed cell consisting of a pt ir coated titanium anode and a v4a steel cathode with an electrode area of 8 8 cm2 in between the electrodes a ten cell pair membrane stack was placed consisting of two pca sc cation exchange end ceem ten pca sa standard anion exchange aem and nine pca sk standard cation exchange membranes cem pca 2016 the membrane stack contained polyethylene silicone spacers to separate the electrodes and membranes creating electrode rinse diluate and concentrate channels the spacers had a thickness of 0 5 mm and a void fraction of 59 the lay out of the electrodes flow channels and membranes is schematically represented in fig 2 the diluate and concentrate solutions were recirculated through the ed cell at a cross flow velocity of 2 cm s 1 following the recommendations of strathmann 2010 the cross flow velocity was controlled by using a calibrated peristaltic watson marlow 520s pump at a flow rate of 19 l h 1 the electrodes were rinsed with an electrode rinse solution at the same flow rate used for the diluate and concentrate separate watson marlow 323 pump heads were used for each solution for the application of electrical current a tenma 72 2535 power supply with an electrical current and electrical potential range of 0 001 3 000 a and 0 01 30 00 v respectively was used the electrical conductivity ec and ph of the electrode rinse diluate and concentrate were measured in the respective solution bottles using two calibrated tetracon 925 ec sensors and a calibrated ids sentix 940 ph sensors respectively on a wtw multi 3630 ids multi meter nh4 concentrations were measured with machery nagel nanocolor ammonium 200 range 0 04 0 2 g l 1 and 2000 range 0 4 2 0 g l 1 test kits solution volumes were determined using calibrated volumetric cylinders initial diluate and concentrate solutions consisting of 6 6 g l 1 nh4hco3 were used equal to an nh4 concentration of 1 5 g l 1 simulating nh4 concentrations commonly present in sludge reject waters we used synthetic solutions to be able to study the effect of back diffusion and electro osmosis as function of the nh4 concentration gradient on the concentration factor and energy consumption at different current density operations the initial electrode rinse solutions consisted of 1 m nano3 the salts were of analytical grade sigma aldrich reagent plus 99 and were added to 1 l of demi water the experiments were conducted at room temperature t 22 1 c 2 2 performance indicators to assess water transport we determined how much water was transported from the diluate to the concentrate by relating the water transport to the initial water mass the relative water transport was determined eq 1 water transport to the electrode rinse was neglected since only one diluate and concentrate channel were in contact with the electrode chambers besides extra thick ceems were placed next to electrode

diluate to the concentrate in addition water transport is caused by the application of electrical current which causes water transport in the hydration shell of the transported ions from the diluate to the concentrate electro osmosis the electro osmotic water transport eq 2 was determined based on the amount of transported ions and their respective water transport numbers strathmann 2004a we assumed that for every transported mole of nh4 1 mol of hco3 was transported to maintain charge balance in the diluate and concentrate flow channels based on the hydration numbers amount of moles of water in the first hydration shell per mole of ions determined in the studies of brugé et al 1999 and leung et al 2007 water transport numbers of four and seven were used for nh4 and hco3 respectively agreeing with the range of four to eight of strathmann 2004a the osmotic water transport was determined based on the mass balance of water transport eq 3 2 θ h 2 o e o n n h 4 d t w n h 4 t w h c o 3

determined the relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd to this end various dilutions of the initial diluate 1 0 9 0 8 0 75 0 6 0 5 0 25 0 05 and 0 01 were prepared subsequently the current density was increased with steps of 1 5 a m 2 while the electrical current and electrical potential were logged automatically to determine the lcd for each dilution following the method of cowan and brown 1959 to avoid water dissociation in local ion depleted zones strathmann 2004d recommends using a safety factor sf 1 for the application of lcd operating at dcd is thus similar to the application of lcd in batch mode while using a safety factor we determined a safety factor for the lcd to apply dcd representing an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption to find an optimum for these quantities with different units we normalised the operational run time eq 6 and energy consumption eq 7 for sf 1 we assigned equal weights to operational and energy consumption while in practice different weights can be assigned to determine an economical cost based optimum safety factor strathmann 2004d safety factors of 0 5 0 75 and 1 were used to experimentally determine the safety factor that represents an optimum between the operational run time and energy consumption according to theory the operational run time to transport a fixed amount of charge as ions is minimal for sf 1 and increases reciprocally for lower safety factors see s i the normalised operational run time as a function of the safety factor is therefore described by α sf 1 1 contrarily the energy consumption to transport a certain amount of charge as ions has a maximum at sf 1 and decreases linearly for lower safety factors see s i therefore the normalised energy consumption as a function of the safety factor can be described by β sf 6 α t s f t s f 1 t s f 1 7 β e s f e s f 1 where α normalised operational run time unitless and β normalised energy consumption unitless to dynamically set the electrical current we developed a python script that calculated the electrical current based on the real time diluate ec the used safety factor and the determined relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd the diluate ec measurements were logged on a laptop every 5 s and subsequently the laptop controlled the power supply automatically to apply the electrical current electrical current and electrical potential data logged every 5 s on the laptop the data of the concentrate ec was stored on a multimeter and the ph of all solutions was manually measured before and after each run for the three chosen safety factors duplicate runs with fresh solutions were conducted in which the diluate ec was always decreased to 1 ms cm 1 finally we conducted sequencing batch experiments sbes in duplicate to assess the water transport and nh4 current efficiency and study the effect of the current density an fcd and dcd on the concentration factor and the energy consumption for the first batch fresh diluate concentrate and electrode rinse solutions were used and the nh4 concentrations and volumes of all solutions were measured after that the diluate ec was again decreased to 1 ms cm 1 and the nh4 concentration and volume of all solutions were measured to make water and nh4 balances for the subsequent nine batches the diluate was replaced for a fresh diluate solution and the concentrate and electrode rinse solutions of the previous batch were reused the electrical current during the dcd sbe was again applied using the automated control based on the python script 3 results 3 1 determination of current densities we found a linear r2 0 92 relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd at a cross flow velocity of 2 cm s 1 fig 3 a which was used to determine the current densities for the application of an fcd and dcd in the sbes subsequently we determined an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption by using a safety factor of 0 5 0 75 and 1 for the lcd fig 3b depicts the experimentally determined α and β as a function of the safety factor the experimentally determined α had a minimum at sf 1 and increased for lower safety factors on the contrary the experimentally determined β had a maximum at sf 1 and decreased for lower safety factors by means of fitting trend lines for the experimentally determined α and β an optimum for the safety factor at 0 62 was found 3 2 sequencing batch experiment at a fixed current density for the fcd sbe a current density of 16 a m 2 was applied based on the lcd of the final diluate ec 1 ms cm 1 and a safety factor of 0 62 fig 4 a presents the diluate and concentrate ec over the cumulative amount of consumed energy during the fcd sbe the operational run time to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 increased by 58 over the number of batches from 158 min for the first batch to 250 min for the tenth batch because the concentrate was recirculated during the sbe the concentrate ec increased but reached a plateau at 32 ms cm 1 from the nh4 concentrations during the fcd sbe experiment fig 4b it follows that 91 1 avg std of the nh4 from the diluate was removed for all batches the nh4 concentration in the concentrate reached a plateau at 6 8 g l 1 corresponding to a concentration factor of 4 5 the difference in concentration factor between the duplicate fcd sbes was 5 the increase in nh4 concentration of the concentrate resulted in an increase in the nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and concentrate over the number of batches the nh4 concentration gradient was 2 4 g l 1 for the first batch and increased to 6 6 g l 1 for the tenth batch in addition to the diluate and concentrate nh4 concentrations fig 4b also presents the nh4 concentration in the electrode rinse showing that 21 3 of the nh4 transported from each diluate batch was transported to and accumulated in the electrode rinse the energy consumption increased over the number of batches from 3 6 mj kg n 1 for the first batch to 6 1 mj kg n 1 for the tenth batch 3 3 continuous batch experiment at dynamic current density for the dcd sbe a safety factor of 0 62 was used in combination with a variable current density based on the lcd of the decreasing diluate ec fig 5 a presents the diluate and concentrate ec over the cumulative amount of consumed energy during the dcd sbe similar to the fcd sbe the operational run time increased over the number of batches however the operational run time increased only by 29 from 49 min for the first batch to 63 min for the tenth batch the application of dcd resulted in a reduction of 69 75 of the operational run time with respect to the application of an fcd the reduced operational run time can be translated to a decreased in required membrane area to treat a certain volume of feed water in addition the concentrate ec did not reach a plateau and reached 40 ms cm 1 after ten batches during the dcd sbe 90 1 of the nh4 from the diluate was removed for each sequencing batch as follows from fig 5b however in contrast to the fcd sbe the concentration of nh4 in the concentrate did not reach a plateau but increased linearly to 10 g l 1 after ten batches corresponding to a concentration factor of 6 7 the difference in concentration factor between the replicate dcd sbes was negligible 1 the nh4 concentration gradient increased from 2 4 g l 1 for the first batch to 9 8 g l 1 for the final batch similar to the fcd sbe 24 7 of nh4 transported from the diluate accumulated in the electrode rinse during the dcd sbe in contrast to the increasing energy consumption during the fcd sbe the energy consumption during the dcd sbe remained stable at 5 4 0 4 mj kg n 1 the energy consumption of the tenth batch was lower for the application of dcd 5 9 mj kg n 1 than for the application of an fcd 6 1 mj kg n 1 while the nh4 concentration gradient was actually higher for the application of dcd 9 8 g l 1 than for an fcd 6 6 g l 1 4 discussion 4 1 determination of current densities the found linear relationship between the diluate ec and the lcd corresponds with strathmann 2004c who reported that the lcd is linearly related to the diluate ion concentration for a specific flow channel geometry and cross flow velocity in addition an optimum between the operational run time and the energy consumption was experimentally found at a safety factor of 0 62 fig 3b also presents the theoretical α and β similar to the experimentally determined α and β a theoretical optimum was found at a safety factor of 0 62 by equating the theoretical expressions for α and β 4 2 sequencing batch experiment at a fixed current density the plateau of the nh4 concentration in the concentrate and thus the limitation of the concentration factor was caused by water transport from the diluate to the concentrate fig 6 a shows how much water was transported during each batch by electro osmosis and osmosis as a function of the nh4 concentration gradient for the fcd sbe osmosis was the dominant mechanism of water transport the electro osmotic water transport remained constant at 1 5 of the diluate throughout the sbe because always the same amount of nh4 was removed from the diluate 1 34 0 02 g the removal of nh4 was constant because the diluate ec of the fresh solutions was always decreased to 1 ms cm 1 the osmotic water transport increased from 2 5 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 to 10 5 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 6 6 g l 1 the increase in osmotic water transport was caused by two factors because the nh4 concentration gradient increased the driving force for osmosis was higher and because the operational run time increased more time was available to allow osmosis to take place nh4 accumulation in the electrode rinse was caused by transport of nh4 from the diluate through a cation exchange end membrane ending up in the electrode rinse at the cathode side of the membrane stack at the anode side of the membrane stack an equivalent amount of charge migrated as cations from the electrode rinse to the concentrate however because the electrode rinse consisted of 1 m nano3 the transported charge not only consisted of nh4 but also of na this phenomenon is schematically presented in fig 2 by taking into account the accumulated nh4 in the electrode rinse solution the nh4 mass balances fitted within 5 while previous researchers assigned a 17 28 nh4 loss to volatilisation of nh3 from the diluate concentrate and electrode rinse mondor et al 2008 ward et al 2018 fig 7a presents the nh4 current efficiency over the nh4 concentration gradient during the fcd sbe the nh4 current efficiency was 76 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 and decreased to 48 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 6 6 g l 1 in general current efficiency in ed is mainly affected by water dissociation at current densities higher than the lcd the transport of other ions than the target ion and back diffusion strathmann 2004b pronk et al 2006 because during the fcd sbe the lcd was never exceeded due to the application of the safety factor the effect of water dissociation on the nh4 current efficiency was negligible besides the ph ranged 7 8 8 8 throughout the entire sbe at ph 7 8 h represented only 1 5 10 3 c as charge while nh4 in the initial diluate represented approximately 7500 c in addition na is transported from the electrode rinse solution to the concentrate and is therefore assumed not to be relevant for the assessment of the nh4 current efficiency therefore also the effect of the transport of other cations such as h and na on the nh4 current efficiency was negligible according to rottiers et al 2014 the ion concentration gradient and back diffusion are linearly related because during the fcd sbe the nh4 current efficiency decreased over the increasing nh4 concentration gradient the decrease in the nh4 current efficiency is assigned to back diffusion also in line with pronk et al 2006 during the fcd sbe the nh4 concentration gradient increased resulting in a higher driving force for back diffusion for each sequencing batch because back diffusion took place from the concentrate to the diluate nh4 needed to be transported back and forth to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 resulting in an increase in the operational run time the transport of back diffused nh4 was at the expense of more supplied electrical charge which led to a decrease in the nh4 current efficiency because for each batch more back diffusion took place over the number of batches more electrical energy was required to transport nh4 to decrease the diluate ec to 1 ms cm 1 the energy consumption increased from 3 6 mj kg n 1 to 6 1 mj kg n 1 when the nh4 concentration gradient increased from 2 4 g l 1 to 6 6 g l 1 as presented in fig 7 b 4 3 continuous batch experiment at dynamic current density fig 6b depicts the water transport during the dcd sbe for the first batches electro osmosis was dominant and only for later batches osmosis became the dominant water transport mechanism the electro osmotic water transport of 1 6 was constant during the dcd sbe and was similar to the electro osmotic water transport during the fcd sbe 1 5 the osmotic water transport was only 0 1 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 and increased to 3 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 9 8 g l 1 since the osmotic driving force was higher during the dcd sbe than the during fcd sbe the decrease in osmotic water transport is caused by the decreased operational run time due to the application of dcd results indicate that due to the decrease in the operational run time by means of the application of dcd less osmosis took place resulting in a higher concentration factor with respect to an fcd fig 7a presents the nh4 current efficiency over the nh4 concentration gradient for the dcd sbe if na from the electrolyte ended up in the diluate and was transported to the concentrate it would account for a 24 loss in the nh4 current efficiency however the nh4 current efficiency for the first batch was 96 at an nh4 concentration gradient of 2 4 g l 1 this high nh4 current efficiency supports our claim that the nh4 current efficiency was not affected by the transport of other ions than nh4 such as h and na throughout the sbe the nh4 current efficiency decreased to 83 in the tenth batch at an nh4 concentration gradient of 9 8 g l 1 similar to the fcd sbe more back diffusion took place due to the increase in nh4 concentration gradient and the increase in operational run time however the effect of back diffusion on the nh4 current efficiency only caused a decrease in nh4 current efficiency of 13 during the dcd sbe compared to a decrease in nh4 current efficiency of 28 during the fcd sbe since the nh4 concentration gradient was even higher for the dcd sbe than for the fcd sbe the higher current efficiencies and the lower decrease in nh4 current efficiency are assigned to the decreased operational run times during the dcd sbe apparently decreasing the operational run time by the application of dcd results in less back diffusion compared to an fcd leading to a higher nh4 current efficiency the increase in operational run time and nh4 concentration gradient did not affect the energy consumption for the application of dcd 5 4 0 4 mj kg n 1 in contrast to an fcd the increase in energy consumption due to back diffusion was countered by the decrease of the electrical resistance because the ec of the concentrate increased 4 4 perspectives and outlook the application of dcd led to a decrease in operational run time compared to an fcd and therefore decreased the effect of osmosis and back diffusion as a result the nh4 concentration factor increased and the energy consumption was lower compared to the application of an fcd if the water permeability of the ion exchange membranes could be decreased the effect of osmotic water transport can be further decreased while an increase in electrical resistance of the ion exchange membrane should be avoided the electrical resistance of the membrane stack can in fact be reduced when spacers with a low thickness or with a high void fraction are used besides nh4 accumulation in the electrode rinse limited the concentration factors for both the application of fcd and dcd by replacing the na in the initial electrode rinse with nh4 accumulation of nh4 in the electrode rinse can be avoided resulting in a further increase in the concentration factor in addition the use of anion exchange end membranes might also prevent the accumulation of nh4 in the electrode rinse based on the current results we expect that ed can be used to remove and concentrate nh4 from side streams such as reject water at an energy consumption competitive to anammox since there is no bio chemical conversion recovery of nh4 for e g fertiliser production or even energy production will be possible calculations show that less electrical energy was used to remove and concentrate nh4 5 4 mj kg n 1 than an sofc may produce using nh3 as fuel 13 mj kg n 1 assuming an electric conversion efficiency of 60 the combination of ed stripping and a solid oxide fuel cell could therefore potentially lead to energy positive nh4 removal from side streams 5 conclusions concentrating nh4 by ed resulted in an nh4 concentration gradient between the diluate and the concentrate stream the increasing gradient subsequently resulted in increased mass transfer by osmosis and back diffusion the increased back diffusion of nh4 decreased the nh4 current efficiency from 76 to 48 when applying an fcd and the energy consumption for the removal of 90 nh4 increased from 3 6 mj kg n 1 to 6 1 mj kg n 1 when a dcd was applied the operational run time to remove 90 nh4 decreased by 75 which can be translated to a reduction in required membrane area the application of dcd resulted in a decrease in osmotic water transport compared to an fcd leading to an increased concentration factor of 6 7 when applying a dcd the nh4 current efficiency only slightly dropped over the nh4 concentration gradient i e from 96 to 83 and eventually 90 nh4 was removed at the expense of a stable energy consumption of 5 4 mj kg n 1 the results clearly show that the application of dcd allows for a lower operational run time a higher concentration factor and a lower energy consumption to concentrate nh4 by ed compared to an fcd author contributions the manuscript was written through the contributions of all authors n van linden designed and performed the
