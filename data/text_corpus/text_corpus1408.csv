7040,in this work we conducted two laboratory column experiments on an undisturbed sandy soil the first deals with a percolation drainage experiment whereas the second deals with an infiltration of a constant water flux at the surface of the unsaturated soil a bayesian assessment of the soil parameters is performed for both experiments with the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method using measurements of pressure head inside the column and cumulative outflow collected during the experiments the results show that both experiments can be well reproduced with the mathematical model based on the richards equation and the van genchten mualem models furthermore the inversion of the two laboratory experiments yields similar results in terms of mean estimated parameter values but strong discrepancies occur between confidence intervals used to quantify uncertainty on the estimated parameters compared to the percolation drainage experiment the infiltration experiment yields more accurate parameters with narrower uncertainty regions keywords infiltration experiment drainage experiment richards equation markov chain monte carlo uncertainty ranges 1 introduction accurate

and omits the associated uncertainties in this work we are concerned with the comparison of the quality of parameter estimate both in terms of mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty ranges between two types of laboratory experiments carried out on the same undisturbed sandy soil column the first experiment deals with a multi step outflow experiment where water is extracted from the initially saturated soil column by applying different suctions at the lower soil boundary the second experiment deals with the infiltration of a constant water flux at the surface of the initially unsaturated soil for both experiments the cumulative outflow and the pressure head in three locations inside the column are monitored the cumulative outflow and pressure head data were shown to be

governed by the richards equation and the standard mualem van genuchten models mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 then the hydraulic soil properties are sought in a bayesian framework using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler based on the metropolis hastings hastings 1970 metropolis et al 1953 lee 2004 algorithm the results of the two experiments are then confronted in terms of mean estimated parameter values and uncertainty ranges 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments a cylindrical soil column length 44 cm diameter 15 cm was carefully extracted from the bekalta province located in the east center of tunisia 35 35 24 3 n 11 00 15 8 e by inserting in the soil a 60 cm rigid pvc tube beveled to form a cutting edge the soil is composed of 93 sand 2 0 05 mm 5 silt 0 05 0 002 mm and 2 clay particles 0 002 mm the soil column is set on a container filled with gravel fig 1 the container is sealed to the pvc column with the exception of an orifice located face to the soil bottom and connected to a pressure reservoir which allows to fix the pressure head h l at the column lower boundary the first laboratory experiment fig 1 is similar to the extended multistep outflow experiment proposed in durner and iden 2011 initially the soil is progressively saturated from the bottom until reaching a ponding of 3 cm to avoid disturbance of the soil the saturation was carried out during a long period of 24 h by slowly increasing the pressure head at the bottom of the column using the pressure reservoir three pressure sensors monitored the pressure head near the top z1 3 5 cm middle z2 18 5 cm and bottom of the column z3 33 5 cm z is the vertical downward axis with the origin located at the soil surface the accuracies of the tensiometers meter t5 tensiometers were approximately 2 cm the cumulative outflow was measured with an accuracy of 2 g using a digital balance error measurements for the two data series are assumed to be independently and normally distributed with zero means and variances σ h 1 cm for the pressure head and σ q 1 g for the cumulative outflow during the first 80 min the head h h z at the lower boundary of the column was fixed to 3 cm by placing the pressure reservoir 3 cm upper the soil surface to prevent evaporation the upper end of the pvc column is sealed with the exception of a small orifice to allow equilibrium with atmospheric pressure then six head steps corresponding to a head h of 0 5 5 10 19 30 and 43 cm at respectively t 1 80 t 2 752 t 3 888 t 4 968 t 5 1066 and t 6 1164 min were successively applied at the bottom of the soil column by moving down the pressure reservoir during percolation the ponding was filmed with a camera to monitor the water level decrease at the surface of the soil the column remained saturated during the first 741 min during this saturated phase the ponding decreases exponentially durner and iden 2011 until it vanishes after that the drainage process replaces the percolation process the second laboratory experiment fig 2 deals with an infiltration experiment the lower boundary condition is maintained at a head of 44 cm cm i e a zero pressure head h is fixed at the bottom of the column during the whole experiment by maintain the pressure reservoir at the same level than the soil bottom initial conditions correspond to hydrostatic equilibrium i e the value of the suction given by each tensiometer corresponds to its distance to the bottom of the column then a constant water flow rate of 20 cm3 min was applied to the top surface of the soil using a masterflex l s peristaltic pump cotton fiber wicks were applied at the surface of the column to allow a uniform distribution of the flow rate over the area of the column the three pressure sensors were located far from the surface at z1 18 5 cm z2 23 5 cm and z3 33 5 cm to insure a relatively uniform distribution of water across the area of the column the infiltration occurs during a period of 57 5 min it starts at t 17 5 min and was stopped at t 75 min the tensiometric data and the cumulative outflow were monitored until t 117 5 min 3 numerical model the saturated unsaturated water flow through the cylindrical soil column is assumed to be one dimensional and governed by the following richards equation re 1 θ t c h s s θ θ s h t q z q k h h z 1 where θ l3 l 3 is the water content t t

water content k s l t 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity m 1 1 n α l 1 and n are the mualem van genuchten shape parameters in eq 2 the pore connectivity parameter is fixed to 0 5 since we deal with a sandy soil for general soils this parameter could be taken unknown and its value estimated from the bayesian inversion as in mara et al 2016 the system of eqs 1 and 2 is solved with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions for the percolation drainage experiment the initial condition is a hydrostatic pressure distribution corresponding to the pressure head of 3 cm at the surface of the column the boundary conditions are as follows at the upper boundary a dirichlet condition corresponding to the measured ponding for the percolation phase t 741 followed by a neumann condition with a zero flux for the drainage phase at the lower boundary a dirichlet condition at the bottom column corresponding to the five applied pressure head steps for the infiltration experiment the initial condition is a hydrostatic pressure distribution with a zero pressure at the bottom of the column the upper boundary condition is a neumann condition with a zero flux except during the irrigation period 17 5 min t 117 5 min where the upper flux is q inj 0 115 cm min the lower boundary condition is of dirichlet type with a zero pressure head maintained at the bottom of the column during the whole experiment the system 1 2 with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions is solved using the standard finite volume method for the spatial discretization a mesh independent solution is obtained using a uniform mesh of 215 cells of 0 2 cm the high order method of lines mol is used for the temporal discretization of the h form of the re via the dlsodis double precision livermore solver for ordinary differential equations implicit form and sparse matrix time solver hindmarsh 1980 mol is well suited for solving the nonlinear re e g younes et al 2009 fahs et al 2011 farthing and ogden 2017 since it allows variable time step and variable order integration with time error control miller et al 2006 the algebraic nonlinear system is solved with the modified newton iteration method radhakrishnan and hindmarsh 1993 4 bayesian parameter inference two types of observations were collected during the experiments the tensiometers provided the pressure head at three different locations inside the column the digital balance provided the cumulative outflow at the column output hence the vector of observations y mes is formed by these two types of data all unsaturated soil parameters are sought by inverse modeling except the saturated water content which was accurately measured by weighing the saturated soil θ s 0 417 cm3 cm 3 a very small value is used for the specific storage s s 10 8 cm 1 hence the vector of unknowns is ξ k s θ r α n these parameters are estimated using a bayesian approach where the observations are merged with the prior parameter knowledge to define the joint posterior probability distribution function jpdf of the parameters in this work the jpdfs are evaluated using the dream zs software laloy and vrugt 2012 relaying on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler the mcmc method has been largely used in hydrogeology e g vrugt et al 2008 laloy and vrugt 2012 moreira et al 2016 linde et al 2017 younes et al 2017 hayek et al 2018 with mcmc the generated random sequences of parameter sets converge asymptotically toward the target distribution gelman et al 1997 the statistical measures of the parameters such as the mean estimated values and the variances are then computed using the converged sets using the bayes theorem the probability density function of the parameters conditioned onto observations write 3 p ξ y mes p y mes ξ p ξ with p ξ y mes the likelihood function measuring how well the model outputs are in agreement with the observations y mes and p ξ is the prior information on the parameters in this work independent uniform distributions are assumed for all parameters the non informative uniform distributions are used here to express the absence of prior information which makes all possible values of the parameter equally likely the parameter intervals table 1 are based on the literature and are chosen large enough to reflect our poor prior knowledge of the model parameter values under the assumption that the error measurements for the two data series are independently and normally distributed the joint posterior distribution matches the likelihood function that is 4 p ξ y mes σ h n h σ q n q exp s s h ξ 2 σ h 2 s s q ξ 2 σ q 2 where s s h ξ and s s q ξ are the sums of the squared differences between the modeled and observed data of the pressure head and cumulative outflow respectively for instance s s h ξ k 1 n h h mes k h mod k ξ 2 resp s s q which includes the observed h mes k resp q mes k and predicted h mod k resp q mod k pressure head resp cumulative outflow at time t k for the number of cumulative outflow resp concentration observations n h resp n q the mcmc sampler is based on the metropolis hasting inference in the latter a new candidate ξ i is generated at the ith iteration from a proposal distribution q ξ i ξ i 1 which only depends on the previous accepted candidate the new candidate is accepted or rejected depending on the associated hasting ratio defined as 5 α min 1 p ξ i y mes q ξ i ξ i 1 p ξ i 1 y mes q ξ i 1 ξ i the last 25 sets when the chains have converged adequately fit the model onto observations these sets are then used to assess the mean estimated parameter values and the associated confidence intervals in this work three parallel chains were used with the dream zs mcmc sampler the posterior distribution is considered stationary if the gelman and rubin 1992 criterion is less than 1 2 and the chains are not autocorrelated 5 results and discussion in this section identifiability of the parameters is investigated for the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments the mcmc results in term of mean estimated parameter values and confidence intervals are depicted in table 2 for the percolation drainage experiment and in table 3 for the infiltration experiment the results of the two experiments show a good agreement between the mean estimated values for the parameters k s θ r and α for the parameter n a reasonable agreement with a difference of around 30 is observed between the two experiments the obtained mean estimated values are then used to simulate the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments fig 3 shows the simulated and measured pressure head by the three tensiometers for the percolation drainage experiment in this figure the pressure head curve of each tensiometer starts at a hydrostatic pressure and then decreases by step due to the different suctions applied at the bottom of the column a very good agreement can be observed between simulated and measured pressure heads for the three tensiometers in the fig 4 the cumulative outflow displays a parabolic behavior during the percolation phase followed by an increase by step due to the suction caused by the different pressure head levels applied at the lower boundary the results of fig 4 show a good agreement between the simulated and measured cumulative outflow therefore the figs 3 and 4 show that using the mean estimated parameter values the mathematical model based on the richards equation and the mualem van genuchten models reproduces relatively well the saturated unsaturated flow processes occurring during the percolation drainage experiment through the studied undisturbed soil in the case of the infiltration experiment an increase of the pressure head is observed when the infiltration front reaches the tensiometers followed by a decrease in the wake of the end of the surface injection fig 5 during the injection the pressure head measured by the tensiometers is almost constant a good agreement is observed between the calculated using mean estimated parameter values and the measured pressure heads by the three tensiometers fig 5 fig 6 shows that the cumulative outflow starts to increase when the infiltration front reaches the bottom of the column and shows a linear behavior until the end of the period of injection a very good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated cumulative outflow hence the results of the figs 5 and 6 confirm that the used mathematical model is reliable to reproduce the infiltration experiment on the investigated undisturbed soil at first sight and based on the comparison between the mean estimated parameter values one could think that a similar quality of estimation is obtained from the two experiments in order to further analyze the quality of the estimation we compare in the following the results of the two experiments in terms of uncertainty associated to each estimated parameter for the parameter θ r the results of tables 2 and 3 show that both the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments yield posterior intervals similar to the prior interval in table 1 this indicates that the residual water content is not identified with neither of the experiments this non identifiability is due to the very low sensitivity of the pressure head and the cumulative outflow to θ r indeed the results of simulations of the two experiments using different values of θ r yield similar pressure head and cumulative outflow curves this weak sensitivity is due to the fact that the residual water content was not attained during neither of the laboratory experiments the parameter α is well estimated from the two experiments indeed a narrow uncertainty region is associated to this parameter due to its high influence on the model outputs for both experiments the influence of α on the pressure head is especially observable during the transition to dry conditions at t 1200 min right after the last pressure head step applied at the lower boundary fig 7 shows the simulated pressure head of the second tensiometer at 18 5 cm from the soil surface and the cumulative outflow at t 1200 min for different values of α taken from the interval 0 005 0 1 cm 1 all the other parameters were fixed to their mean estimated values obtained from mcmc results a similar behavior is observed for the effect of α on the pressure head of the other tensiometers the results of fig 7 show that the pressure head is weakly sensitive to α in the region surrounding the mean estimated value α fig 7a whereas the cumulative outflow is highly sensitive to α in that region fig 7b this suggests that the cumulative outflow measurements contribute the most to the identifiability of α for the percolation drainage experiment the influence of the parameter α for the infiltration experiment is especially noticeable during the transition to dry conditions at t 80 min just after stopping the injection fig 8 shows the marginal effect of the parameter α on the pressure head fig 8a and the cumulative outflow at t 80 min fig 8b the cumulative outflow is weakly sensitive to α in the region surrounding α whereas the pressure head is highly sensitive to α in that region this suggests that the pressure head measurements contribute the most to the identifiability of α for the infiltration experiment the parameter n is not well estimated from the percolation drainage experiment indeed the mcmc sampler yielded a mean estimated value of n 1 9 with a large confidence interval 1 34 3 12 fig 9 shows that the pressure head is weakly sensitive to n fig 9a whereas the cumulative outflow is almost not sensitive to n in the region surrounding n fig 9b the infiltration experiment yielded a mean estimated value n 2 7 with a reduced confidence interval 2 4 2 9 for this experiment both pressure head fig 10 a and cumulative outflow fig 10b are sensitive to n in the region surrounding n the pressure head is highly influenced by the value of the parameter n for instance the variation of n from 2 1 to 3 1 induces a variation of 2 4 cm in the pressure head whereas the same variation of n induced only a variation of 0 11 cm in the pressure head in the case of the percolation drainage experiment it is interesting to note that the large confidence interval 1 34 3 12 for the parameter n from the percolation drainage experiment involves the reduced confidence interval 2 4 2 9 obtained from the infiltration experiment finally the inversion of the percolation drainage experiment yielded a hydraulic conductivity k s 0 22 cm min with a large uncertainty region since the confidence interval is 0 13 1 24 cm min this large uncertainty region can be explained by the weak sensitivity of the cumulative outflow and the pressure head inside the column to the value of k s for instance fig 11 shows the simulated pressure head at the location of the second tensiometer at 18 5 cm from the soil surface at t 1200 min for different k s values taken from its prior interval 0 1 2 cm min this figure shows a weak sensitivity of the pressure head around k s indeed a variation of k s from 0 2 to 0 3 cm min induces only a variation of 0 2 cm of the pressure head furthermore the simulation with the different values of k s yielded similar cumulative outflow curves not shown which indicates that k s is an irrelevant parameter for the cumulative outflow in this case these results are in agreement with those of durner 1994 and schaap and van genuchten 2005 who noted that the determination of k s with multi step outflow experiments can be highly uncertain in particular for structured soils on the other hand the inversion of the infiltration experiment yielded a hydraulic conductivity of k s 0 21 cm min with a very narrow uncertainty region since the confidence interval is 0 2 0 22 cm min therefore k s is 50 times more accurate than obtained from the percolation drainage experiment this phenomenon is due to the high sensitivity of the pressure head inside the column to the value of k s in the case of the infiltration experiment note that the cumulative outflow depends only on the inflow rate q inj and was not sensitive to k s the sensitivity of the plateau region reached by the pressure head at 18 5 cm from the soil surface during the injection is shown in fig 12 this figure is obtained by simulating the pressure head at t 50 min for different k s values inside its prior interval 0 1 2 cm min the results of fig 12 confirm that the pressure head is highly sensitive to k s in the region surrounding k s indeed the variation of k s from 0 2 to 0 3 cm min induces a variation of about 5 cm of the pressure head note that the slope of the curve in fig 12 is weak for high values of k s this means that if the sought value k s is high the sensitivity of the pressure head to k s can be weak to increase the sensitivity to k s in these situations and therefore improve identifiability of k s we should use a higher inflow rate indeed the applied inflow rate at the surface of the column should not be very small compared to k s fig 12 suggests that an inflow rate around 50 of k s is preferential very high sensitivity but the zone of high sensitivity involves inflow rate ranging until 6 times less than k s finally we note that although the results of both experiments concerning the estimation of k s are different they remain in agreement since the narrow 0 2 0 22 cm min confidence interval of k s from the infiltration experiment is included in the large 0 13 1 24 cm min confidence interval of k s from the percolation drainage experiment to summarize the results of the bayesian inversion show that although the two laboratory experiments yield a good agreement between the mean estimated parameter values the quality of estimation in terms of uncertainty associated to the estimated parameters shows strong disagreement indeed for the investigated undisturbed soil the infiltration experiment yielded better quality of hydraulic soil parameter estimation with narrower uncertainty regions compared to the percolation drainage experiment this can be explained by the higher sensitivity of the model outputs to the hydraulic parameters in the case of the infiltration experiment the results of the mcmc sampler for the infiltration experiment are shown in fig 13 in this figure the on diagonal plots display the parameter distributions whereas the off diagonal plots show the correlations between parameters in the mcmc sample this figure shows that the parameter θ r cannot be identified the parameters k s α and n are well estimated their intervals of variation are strongly reduced and they essentially display bell shaped distributions moderate correlations are observed between k s and n r 0 73 θ r and n r 0 76 and α and n r 0 74 6 conclusions in this work a laboratory percolation drainage and an infiltration experiments were conducted on an undisturbed soil column hydraulic soil parameters have then been investigated by inverse modeling using pressure head and cumulative outflow measurements the saturated hydraulic conductivity the residual water content and the mualem van genuchten shape parameters α and n have been estimated in a bayesian framework using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler the results reveal the following conclusions 1 saturated unsaturated flow through the investigated undisturbed soil is well described by the re combined with the mualem van genuchten models the estimated hydraulic soil parameters allow to fit relatively well to the measurements of pressure head and cumulative outflow for both experiments 2 similar mean estimated soil parameter values were obtained from the inversion of the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments however significant differences were observed between uncertainties associated to the estimated parameters 3 the residual water content was not identified with neither of the experiments since dry conditions were not attained during the two laboratory experiments 4 because of its high influence on the model outputs the parameter α is well estimated with a narrow uncertainty region from both experiments 5 the parameters n and k s are much better estimated with much narrower uncertainty regions using the infiltration experiment than using the percolation experiment this phenomenon is due to the high sensitivity of the pressure head to these parameters in the case of the infiltration experiment whereas this sensitivity is weak in the case of the percolation drainage experiment 6 in the case of infiltration experiment the injected inflow rate at the surface of the column should not be very small compared to the sought value of saturated conductivity in order to insure a high sensitivity of the pressure head to k s for practical applications this last point suggests that before fixing the inflow rate we should have a rough idea about the value of k s this can be easily obtained by varying the inflow rate since a ponding can be observed if q inj k s acknowledgments the author s express

with a sandy soil for general soils this parameter could be taken unknown and its value estimated from the bayesian inversion as in mara et al 2016 the system of eqs 1 and 2 is solved with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions for the percolation drainage experiment the initial condition is a hydrostatic pressure distribution corresponding to the pressure head of 3 cm at the surface of the column the boundary conditions are as follows at the upper boundary a dirichlet condition corresponding to the measured ponding for the percolation phase t 741 followed by a neumann condition with a zero flux for the drainage phase at the lower boundary a dirichlet condition at the bottom column corresponding to the five applied pressure head steps for the infiltration experiment the initial condition is a hydrostatic pressure distribution with a zero pressure at the bottom of the column the upper boundary condition is a neumann condition with a zero flux except during the irrigation period 17 5 min t 117 5 min where the upper flux is q inj 0 115 cm min the lower boundary condition is of dirichlet type with a zero pressure head maintained at the bottom of the column during the whole experiment the system 1 2 with the corresponding initial and boundary conditions is solved using the standard finite volume method for the spatial discretization a mesh independent solution is obtained using a uniform mesh of 215 cells of 0 2 cm the high order method of lines mol is used for the temporal discretization of the h form of the re via the dlsodis double precision livermore solver for ordinary differential equations implicit form and sparse matrix time solver hindmarsh 1980 mol is well suited for solving the nonlinear re e g younes et al 2009 fahs et al 2011 farthing and ogden 2017 since it allows variable time step and variable order integration with time error control miller et al 2006 the algebraic nonlinear system is solved with the modified newton iteration method radhakrishnan and hindmarsh 1993 4 bayesian parameter inference two types of observations were collected during the experiments the tensiometers provided the pressure head at three different locations inside the column the digital balance provided the cumulative outflow at the column output hence the vector of observations y mes is formed by these two types of data all unsaturated soil parameters are sought by inverse modeling except the saturated water content which was accurately measured by weighing the saturated soil θ s 0 417 cm3 cm 3 a very small value is used for the specific storage s s 10 8 cm 1 hence the vector of unknowns is ξ k s θ r α n these parameters are estimated using a bayesian approach where the observations are merged with the prior parameter knowledge to define the joint posterior probability distribution function jpdf of the parameters in this work the jpdfs are evaluated using the dream zs software laloy and vrugt 2012 relaying on the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler the mcmc method has been largely used in hydrogeology e g vrugt et al 2008 laloy and vrugt 2012 moreira et al 2016 linde et al 2017 younes et al 2017 hayek et al 2018 with mcmc the generated random sequences of parameter sets converge asymptotically toward the target distribution gelman et al 1997 the statistical measures of the parameters such as the mean estimated values and the variances are then computed using the converged sets using the bayes theorem the probability density function of the parameters conditioned onto observations write 3 p ξ y mes p y mes ξ p ξ with p ξ y mes the likelihood function measuring how well the model outputs are in agreement with the observations y mes and p ξ is the prior information on the parameters in this work independent uniform distributions are assumed for all parameters the non informative uniform distributions are used here to express the absence of prior information which makes all possible values of the parameter equally likely the parameter intervals table 1 are based on the literature and are chosen large enough to reflect our poor prior knowledge of the model parameter values under the assumption that the error measurements for the two data series are independently and normally distributed the joint posterior distribution matches the likelihood function that is 4 p ξ y mes σ h n h σ q n q exp s s h ξ 2 σ h 2 s s q ξ 2 σ q 2 where s s h ξ and s s q ξ are the sums of the squared differences between the modeled and observed data of the pressure head and cumulative outflow respectively for instance s s h ξ k 1 n h h mes k h mod k ξ 2 resp s s q which includes the observed h mes k resp q mes k and predicted h mod k resp q mod k pressure head resp cumulative outflow at time t k for the number of cumulative outflow resp concentration observations n h resp n q the mcmc sampler is based on the metropolis hasting inference in the latter a new candidate ξ i is generated at the ith iteration from a proposal distribution q ξ i ξ i 1 which only depends on the previous accepted candidate the new candidate is accepted or rejected depending on the associated hasting ratio defined as 5 α min 1 p ξ i y mes q ξ i ξ i 1 p ξ i 1 y mes q ξ i 1 ξ i the last 25 sets when the chains have converged adequately fit the model onto observations these sets are then used to assess the mean estimated parameter values and the associated confidence intervals in this work three parallel chains were used with the dream zs mcmc sampler the posterior distribution is considered stationary if the gelman and rubin 1992 criterion is less than 1 2 and the chains are not autocorrelated 5 results and discussion in this section identifiability of the parameters is investigated for the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments the mcmc results in term of mean estimated parameter values and confidence intervals are depicted in table 2 for the percolation drainage experiment and in table 3 for the infiltration experiment the results of the two experiments show a good agreement between the mean estimated values for the parameters k s θ r and α for the parameter n a reasonable agreement with a difference of around 30 is observed between the two experiments the obtained mean estimated values are then used to simulate the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments fig 3 shows the simulated and measured pressure head by the three tensiometers for the percolation drainage experiment in this figure the pressure head curve of each tensiometer starts at a hydrostatic pressure and then decreases by step due to the different suctions applied at the bottom of the column a very good agreement can be observed between simulated and measured pressure heads for the three tensiometers in the fig 4 the cumulative outflow displays a parabolic behavior during the percolation phase followed by an increase by step due to the suction caused by the different pressure head levels applied at the lower boundary the results of fig 4 show a good agreement between the simulated and measured cumulative outflow therefore the figs 3 and 4 show that using the mean estimated parameter values the mathematical model based on the richards equation and the mualem van genuchten models reproduces relatively well the saturated unsaturated flow processes occurring during the percolation drainage experiment through the studied undisturbed soil in the case of the infiltration experiment an increase of the pressure head is observed when the infiltration front reaches the tensiometers followed by a decrease in the wake of the end of the surface injection fig 5 during the injection the pressure head measured by the tensiometers is almost constant a good agreement is observed between the calculated using mean estimated parameter values and the measured pressure heads by the three tensiometers fig 5 fig 6 shows that the cumulative outflow starts to increase when the infiltration front reaches the bottom of the column and shows a linear behavior until the end of the period of injection a very good agreement is observed between the measured and simulated cumulative outflow hence the results of the figs 5 and 6 confirm that the used mathematical model is reliable to reproduce the infiltration experiment on the investigated undisturbed soil at first sight and based on the comparison between the mean estimated parameter values one could think that a similar quality of estimation is obtained from the two experiments in order to further analyze the quality of the estimation we compare in the following the results of the two experiments in terms of uncertainty associated to each estimated parameter for the parameter θ r the results of tables 2 and 3 show that both the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments yield posterior intervals similar to the prior interval in table 1 this indicates that the residual water content is not identified with neither of the experiments this non identifiability is due to the very low sensitivity of the pressure head and the cumulative outflow to θ r indeed the results of simulations of the two experiments using different values of θ r yield similar pressure head and cumulative outflow curves this weak sensitivity is due to the fact that the residual water content was not attained during neither of the laboratory experiments the parameter α is well estimated from the two experiments indeed a narrow uncertainty region is associated to this parameter due to its high influence on the model outputs for both experiments the influence of α on the pressure head is especially observable during the transition to dry conditions at t 1200 min right after the last pressure head step applied at the lower boundary fig 7 shows the simulated pressure head of the second tensiometer at 18 5 cm from the soil surface and the cumulative outflow at t 1200 min for different values of α taken from the interval 0 005 0 1 cm 1 all the other parameters were fixed to their mean estimated values obtained from mcmc results a similar behavior is observed for the effect of α on the pressure head of the other tensiometers the results of fig 7 show that the pressure head is weakly sensitive to α in the region surrounding the mean estimated value α fig 7a whereas the cumulative outflow is highly sensitive to α in that region fig 7b this suggests that the cumulative outflow measurements contribute the most to the identifiability of α for the percolation drainage experiment the influence of the parameter α for the infiltration experiment is especially noticeable during the transition to dry conditions at t 80 min just after stopping the injection fig 8 shows the marginal effect of the parameter α on the pressure head fig 8a and the cumulative outflow at t 80 min fig 8b the cumulative outflow is weakly sensitive to α in the region surrounding α whereas the pressure head is highly sensitive to α in that region this suggests that the pressure head measurements contribute the most to the identifiability of α for the infiltration experiment the parameter n is not well estimated from the percolation drainage experiment indeed the mcmc sampler yielded a mean estimated value of n 1 9 with a large confidence interval 1 34 3 12 fig 9 shows that the pressure head is weakly sensitive to n fig 9a whereas the cumulative outflow is almost not sensitive to n in the region surrounding n fig 9b the infiltration experiment yielded a mean estimated value n 2 7 with a reduced confidence interval 2 4 2 9 for this experiment both pressure head fig 10 a and cumulative outflow fig 10b are sensitive to n in the region surrounding n the pressure head is highly influenced by the value of the parameter n for instance the variation of n from 2 1 to 3 1 induces a variation of 2 4 cm in the pressure head whereas the same variation of n induced only a variation of 0 11 cm in the pressure head in the case of the percolation drainage experiment it is interesting to note that the large confidence interval 1 34 3 12 for the parameter n from the percolation drainage experiment involves the reduced confidence interval 2 4 2 9 obtained from the infiltration experiment finally the inversion of the percolation drainage experiment yielded a hydraulic conductivity k s 0 22 cm min with a large uncertainty region since the confidence interval is 0 13 1 24 cm min this large uncertainty region can be explained by the weak sensitivity of the cumulative outflow and the pressure head inside the column to the value of k s for instance fig 11 shows the simulated pressure head at the location of the second tensiometer at 18 5 cm from the soil surface at t 1200 min for different k s values taken from its prior interval 0 1 2 cm min this figure shows a weak sensitivity of the pressure head around k s indeed a variation of k s from 0 2 to 0 3 cm min induces only a variation of 0 2 cm of the pressure head furthermore the simulation with the different values of k s yielded similar cumulative outflow curves not shown which indicates that k s is an irrelevant parameter for the cumulative outflow in this case these results are in agreement with those of durner 1994 and schaap and van genuchten 2005 who noted that the determination of k s with multi step outflow experiments can be highly uncertain in particular for structured soils on the other hand the inversion of the infiltration experiment yielded a hydraulic conductivity of k s 0 21 cm min with a very narrow uncertainty region since the confidence interval is 0 2 0 22 cm min therefore k s is 50 times more accurate than obtained from the percolation drainage experiment this phenomenon is due to the high sensitivity of the pressure head inside the column to the value of k s in the case of the infiltration experiment note that the cumulative outflow depends only on the inflow rate q inj and was not sensitive to k s the sensitivity of the plateau region reached by the pressure head at 18 5 cm from the soil surface during the injection is shown in fig 12 this figure is obtained by simulating the pressure head at t 50 min for different k s values inside its prior interval 0 1 2 cm min the results of fig 12 confirm that the pressure head is highly sensitive to k s in the region surrounding k s indeed the variation of k s from 0 2 to 0 3 cm min induces a variation of about 5 cm of the pressure head note that the slope of the curve in fig 12 is weak for high values of k s this means that if the sought value k s is high the sensitivity of the pressure head to k s can be weak to increase the sensitivity to k s in these situations and therefore improve identifiability of k s we should use a higher inflow rate indeed the applied inflow rate at the surface of the column should not be very small compared to k s fig 12 suggests that an inflow rate around 50 of k s is preferential very high sensitivity but the zone of high sensitivity involves inflow rate ranging until 6 times less than k s finally we note that although the results of both experiments concerning the estimation of k s are different they remain in agreement since the narrow 0 2 0 22 cm min confidence interval of k s from the infiltration experiment is included in the large 0 13 1 24 cm min confidence interval of k s from the percolation drainage experiment to summarize the results of the bayesian inversion show that although the two laboratory experiments yield a good agreement between the mean estimated parameter values the quality of estimation in terms of uncertainty associated to the estimated parameters shows strong disagreement indeed for the investigated undisturbed soil the infiltration experiment yielded better quality of hydraulic soil parameter estimation with narrower uncertainty regions compared to the percolation drainage experiment this can be explained by the higher sensitivity of the model outputs to the hydraulic parameters in the case of the infiltration experiment the results of the mcmc sampler for the infiltration experiment are shown in fig 13 in this figure the on diagonal plots display the parameter distributions whereas the off diagonal plots show the correlations between parameters in the mcmc sample this figure shows that the parameter θ r cannot be identified the parameters k s α and n are well estimated their intervals of variation are strongly reduced and they essentially display bell shaped distributions moderate correlations are observed between k s and n r 0 73 θ r and n r 0 76 and α and n r 0 74 6 conclusions in this work a laboratory percolation drainage and an infiltration experiments were conducted on an undisturbed soil column hydraulic soil parameters have then been investigated by inverse modeling using pressure head and cumulative outflow measurements the saturated hydraulic conductivity the residual water content and the mualem van genuchten shape parameters α and n have been estimated in a bayesian framework using the markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampler the results reveal the following conclusions 1 saturated unsaturated flow through the investigated undisturbed soil is well described by the re combined with the mualem van genuchten models the estimated hydraulic soil parameters allow to fit relatively well to the measurements of pressure head and cumulative outflow for both experiments 2 similar mean estimated soil parameter values were obtained from the inversion of the percolation drainage and the infiltration experiments however significant differences were observed between uncertainties associated to the estimated parameters 3 the residual water content was not identified with neither of the experiments since dry conditions were not attained during the two laboratory experiments 4 because of its high influence on the model outputs the parameter α is well estimated with a narrow uncertainty region from both experiments 5 the parameters n and k s are much better estimated with much narrower uncertainty regions using the infiltration experiment than using the percolation experiment this phenomenon is due to the high sensitivity of the pressure head to these parameters in the case of the infiltration experiment whereas this sensitivity is weak in the case of the percolation drainage experiment 6 in the case of infiltration experiment the injected inflow rate at the surface of the column should not be very small compared to the sought value of saturated conductivity in order to insure a high sensitivity of the pressure head to k s for practical applications this last point suggests that before fixing the inflow rate we should have a rough idea about the value of k s this can be easily obtained by varying the inflow rate since a ponding can be observed if q inj k s acknowledgments the author s express

huffman et al 2007 2010 the trmm tmpa 3b43 is the latest version of the trmm monthly precipitation product the tmpa has a global coverage between 50 n and 50 s from 1998 through 2015 with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 roughly 26 28 km in india the tmpa products have been produced based on radar infrared and microwave sensors on trmm core observatory microwave and infrared data from multiple geostationary satellites and ground based precipitation measurements the tmpa products give the best estimates of quasi global precipitation as it is benefiting from many infrared and microwave sensors of geostationary satellites and the ground based gauge observations huffman et al 2007 2010 the cmorph data applies motion based techniques for rainfall estimation the rapid refresh of motion

similarities between tmpa and persiann products while the river basins of 4 and 19 showed no similarity between these two datasets less variation was observed between tmpa persiann and mswep in basins 12 16 18 and 22 24 the basic statistics mean standard deviation sd and covariance for imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep annual datasets of all studied basins are presented in fig 3b mean precipitation and sd of all datasets were high in the eastern part of india basins 4 5 6 and 7 and low in the northwest basins 1 and 2 cmorph showed lower mean precipitation and sd in most of the basins relative to other datasets the positive covariance was observed in south southwest and west basins 17 21 and 23 25 of all datasets and the rest of the basins showed negative covariance the spatial precipitation distribution of imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep and their differences in percentage in the studied basins are presented in fig 4 the annual precipitation amount in all datasets showed decrease from east to west northwest india and northern part of india also indicated low precipitation the western and northwestern part of india was comparatively dry hence river basins along this side showed less rainfall in all datasets highest precipitation was observed in the east northeast basins 4 7 8 11 and along the west coast basin 19 in all datasets except cmorph the northeastern part received the heaviest rainfall that indicates higher rainfall over the river basins in this part during monsoon season in all datasets percentage differences of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep relative to imd were also calculated for 1998 2015 period fig 4 the cmorph data underestimated imd data in major parts of the country except in the east coast basin 11 west basin 1 and south basins 15 18 all datasets underestimated the imd data in the north and west coast except mswep the average annual difference in precipitation was similar in the tmpa and mswep data a comparison of average monthly precipitation from 1998 to 2015 between tmpa cmorph persiann mswep and imd datasets is shown in fig 5 all datasets showed higher amount of precipitation from june to september relative to the rest of the year the precipitation in the wet period varied from around 125 to 274 mm month 1 tmpa overestimated the imd measurements for almost all months except for june july and august cmorph underestimated the imd measurements in all months except for march april and may persiann overestimated imd measurements in all months except for january february march and december mswep overestimated imd values in all the months the rmse distribution indicated similar pattern in all dataset relative to imd high rmse was observed along the west coast basins 19 and part of 17 20 east and extreme east basins 4 7 and in the north part of basin 1 the monthly cc between tmpa persiann mswep and imd showed cc of above 0 80 in all parts of india except extreme north part of basin 1 and in entire basin 2 south part of basins 12 17 18 and 20 and east part of basin 4 cc of cmorph showed the same pattern but in majority of the basins the value is above 0 6 or comparatively lower cc than other datasets fig 6 the mk mann kendall and mmk modified mann kendall tests were performed for all datasets to determine the trends and their significance levels z statistic figs 7 and 8 according to the z test values the annual and monsoon analysis of mk test for all datasets showed similar positive and negative trends significant or non significant positive significant trend was observed along the north and western border of upper part of the country in some parts of basins 1 2 3 and 25 negative significant trend was observed in the east india in basins 3 and 4 however in most of the cases cmorph showed a minimum negative significant trend in precipitation the pre monsoon season indicated positive significant trend of precipitation in the south in all datasets in some parts of the basin 20 in the post monsoon season positive significant trend was only observed in the basin 1 and 2 in the north in cmorph and in a very small area in the north in tmpa and persiann majority of india during this season indicated non significant negative trend during the winter season positive significant trend was observed various parts of the basins 1 and 3 negative significant trend in the cmorph data was found in basins 11 24 and 25 major parts of india showed non significant positive trend for all datasets the mmk test z values indicated similar pattern of trend distribution in all datasets detail statistics of mk and mmk tests are presented in table 1 the average z statistic mk and mmk for different river basins in india are shown in appendix a tables 1 and 2 the sen s slope or magnitude of the precipitation trend of imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep datasets is illustrated in fig 9 the annual and monsoon magnitude of slope indicated increasing trend 10 mm year 1 in the northern and western parts of india basins 1 2 22 25 in all datasets high intensity decreasing trend basins 3 7 was observed in the east 30 mm year 1 in all datasets except in the cmorph during the pre monsoon season a similar intensity of increase and decrease magnitude of slope was found in the imd tmpa and persiann datasets while cmorph and mswep showed similar intensity of decrease in the east and central india during the post monsoon season maximum areas showed decrease 0 10 mm year 1 but northern part of india basins 1 and 2 indicated increased intensity of precipitation 0 10 mm year 1 during the winter season most of the country showed increasing intensity of precipitation except a few river basins mostly located in the east in basins 4 7 and 12 5 discussion a wide variation in the precipitation distribution was observed from the analysis of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep products relative to imd measurements during 1998 2015 which was considered as the base dataset in this study the difference in percentage of precipitation distribution patterns positive or negative is similar in imd tmpa and imd mswep comparisons for all basins except basins of 1 20 and 25 in imd cmorph comparison 4 basins namely 1 16 17 were overestimated by cmorph in imd tmpa basins that were underestimated by tmpa were 1 4 and 19 it was observed that the tmpa persiann and mswep satellite based products underestimated the river basins characterized by hill and mountainous terrain in comparison with imd only few hilly regions in a part of north india showed overestimation by mswep similarly bharti et al 2016 stated that the tmpa product underestimated the measured precipitation imd in hilly regions of india during 1998 2013 according to prakash et al 2015a there were larger systematic errors in the tmpa product 2000 2013 over the northeast region of india the cc and rmse were used for better understanding of the actual quality of the satellite based products relative to the ground based data duhan and pandey 2015 kundu et al 2017a as for the tmpa and imd relationship basins 2 and 18 showed a lower cc value and basins 4 7 and 19 showed high rmse value these river basins are located in the northern western southwestern and the eastern part of the country a similar observations can be found in other studies e g prakash et al 2014b prakash et al 2015a the basins with the higher rmse are mostly located in the areas with precipitation of more than 1500 mm year 1 sunilkumar et al 2015 stated that basins 4 5 and 19 show larger rmse between the cmorph tmpa and persiann and imd measurements which conforms to the present study assuming that the imd is the reference dataset the average rmse 69 mm and cc 0 829 were minimum and maximum respectively between tmpa and imd for entire india implying highest relevance between these two datasets average rmse 95 3 mm and cc 0 70 were maximum and minimum respectively for cmorph for entire india indicating the lowest relationship between these two datasets the mswep dataset showed lower rmse and higher cc 70 76 mm and 0 825 respectively than the persiann dataset 81 19 mm and 0 81 respectively spatial distribution of trend pattern positive negative and no trend of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep relative to imd indicated similarity and non similarity in different parts of india the annual analysis showed highest similarity between persiann and imd 67 76 minimum similarity was observed between cmorph and imd 60 36 both the tmpa and mswep gave similar percentage of matched data with imd about 66 pre monsoon and monsoon seasons followed similar pattern as the annual comparison the tmpa showed better trend performance in the post monsoon 69 86 and winter seasons 68 91 relative to imd the similar trend between imd and other datasets varied from 56 20 mswep in pre monsoon to 69 86 tmpa in post monsoon the annual and monsoon analysis showed similarity or matched areas in the north and northwest in all datasets where precipitation was 1000 mm the eastern part of india ganga basin also showed similarity in precipitation trend between imd and all datasets except cmorph other areas showed scattered distribution of matched areas according to the literature most of the precipitation trend analysis have been conducted at regional or local scale in india however only very few studies considered entire india jain and kumar 2012 mondal et al 2015 using aggregated data non gridded for trend detection according to our findings generally all datasets showed increasing trend in northwest and southern india while central and eastern parts of india showed decreasing trend from 1998 to 2015 using mk and mmk methods similar precipitation trend pattern were reported by researchers kumar et al 2010 and mondal et al 2015 on annual time scale dash et al 2007 reported the highest decline in nagaland manipur mizoram and tripura located in the eastern part of india jain and kumar 2012 observed increasing trend in basins 15 17 while they observed decreasing trend in basins 4 12 20 and 21 in the pre monsoon season decreasing trend pattern was observed in the eastern part of india basins 4 7 that conforms to the work of mondal et al 2015 the monsoon precipitation trend indicated decrease in the east and north central of india in different sets of data similar observations of negative precipitation trend along the eastern part of india were found in the works of kishore et al 2016 and mondal et al 2015 negative precipitation trends in the ganga river basin bisht et al 2018 also conforms to the present study except for the cmorph data increasing trend was observed along the eastern boundary central part and northwest that conforms to the study of mondal et al 2015 and kishore et al 2016 the monsoon season is associated with the enso el nino southern oscillation phenomena enso and himalayan snow are suggested to play a major role in the indian monsoon by a few researchers kripalani et al 2003 ramesh kumar et al 2009 the el niño causes weaker monsoon while the la niña phase strengthens the monsoon less winter snow is considered as favorable for the monsoon kripalani et al 2003 goswami et al 2006 showed a noticeable rise in the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall events during the monsoon and latif et al 2017 indicated that july and august were the most active monsoon months that conforms to the present study however kumar et al 1999 showed that the relationship between monsoon and enso has weakened in recent decades the negative trend in central and northeast parts of india in the post monsoon and positive trend in west central part in the winter was observed in all datasets similar trend pattern was also noted by kundu et al 2014b 6 conclusions the satellite based hrpps were compared with the ground based imd measurements for the river basins of india from 1998 to 2015 the annual average distribution of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep precipitation relative to imd showed that the satellite based precipitation data underestimate the ground based data covering the total area of 30 25 70 11 28 49 and 3 45 respectively tmpa and persiann products underestimated 20 the imd precipitation in the basins that are located in a relatively high elevation in northern india the trend patterns of mk and mmk positive negative and no trend were similar taking into account both annual and seasonal time scales in all datasets imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep the tmpa and mswep products showed better performance than persiann and cmorph based on the accuracy relative to imd hence suitable to be used in hydrometeorological studies in the data poor region of the country the trend analysis implied small variations among the tmpa persiann and mswep data however persiann dataset showed best similarity to imd in annual and monsoon trend analysis accordingly these three satellite based products are more reliable to be used in ungauged areas and in complex terrain where in situ precipitation measurement is scarce the annual and monsoon trend pattern showed higher variations over large river basins where both positive and negative trends were noted basins 3 12 and 20 many countries in the southeast asia have similar rainfall characteristics and have an annual dependence on precipitation for water resources that forms a backbone of livelihood society and economy of those countries this work has an impact that is larger than the extent of the study the comparisons of the data sets viz in situ model outputs and satellite based precipitation provide a framework for similar analysis in other large countries where a in situ data are generally not publicly available b in situ gauge data are sparse and cannot capture the spatial variability of the precipitation and c establish a climatology for future changes and planning for water resource management in view of above it can be concluded that before using satellite based products in various hydrometeorological applications it is essential to improve the satellite data quality e g gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 hashemi et al 2017 then the improved data can be used for the ungauged or poorly gauged basins acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the support of dr bradley doorn program manager water resources applied sciences program award

trend and the change is detected by sen s slope using all datasets for annual and seasonal time periods variation in precipitation is high 20 in the northern part of india in all datasets all these basins located at the elevations above 2000 m the annual and monsoon trend pattern for tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep matched with imd data in the north northwest and central part in 1 2 22 25 and parts of 3 12 and 21 river basins 1998 2015 the calculated results implied that the tmpa precipitation product in terms of accuracy and persiann in terms of annual and monsoon trend show a better agreement with imd and they can be used in climate studies and hydrological simulation in locations river basins where the number of rain gauges is not adequate to quantify the spatial variability of precipitation keywords precipitation imd trmm cmorph persiann mswep modified mann kendall trend analysis 1 introduction precipitation is an essential component for hydrological studies it plays a crucial role in water resources planning and management and directly links to agriculture disaster mitigation and preparedness prakash et al 2015a recently it was determined that the spatial and temporal distributions of precipitation are important factors in climate change studies vincent et al 2005 li et al 2013 hence reliable precipitation data are essential for model calibration validation and forecasting collins et al 2013 kumar et al 2014 rain gauge data collection is challenging in many parts of the world due to a variety of administrative and technical reasons many river basins have few rain gauges and short length of records which introduces uncertainty in the spatial and temporal distribution of measured precipitation errors are involved in data transmission instrument operation human operators and outages for various reasons kneis et al 2014 to avoid these problems various precipitation datasets have been established during the last two decades which might be better capable for hydrological modeling and climate change studies li et al 2013 these datasets include the global precipitation climatology project gpcp huffman et al 2001 the tropical

cmorph persian trmm and the naval research laboratory nrl blended with imd data from 2004 to 2009 on a daily scale for the summer monsoon season june to september in india similarly sunilkumar et al 2015 used cmorph persian trmm cpc and global precipitation climatology project gpcp for comparison with imd data during 2000 2010 at 1 1 grid size kumar et al 2016 studied the gandak river basin india using trmm and cmorph product from 2005 to 2010 for monsoon season in all the above mentioned studies some have used the older version of the tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep products for comparison with the imd dataset for a specific river basin some other used the recent version of tmpa and 0 25 resolution of imd data but only for some specific parts or seasons in india in this study seasonal and annual comparison for 18 years data length 1998 2015 of multisatellite high resolution precipitation products hrpps tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep and gauge data imd over different river basins of entire india were carried out it is noted that during the development validation of the trmm precipitation product around 125 130 rain gages in the gpcc set out of the 6955 rain gages were used for creating the gridded in situ precipitation product these constitute less than 2 of the total number of gages the study is unique with respect to spatial and temporal coverage over india one of the hallmarks of the current study is a full time period for trmm precipitation data set 1998 2015 rather than shorter time periods b complete coverage of india as compared to some studies that do partial spatial coverage c spatial trend analysis of all datasets the overall objective of the paper was to analyse and compare the trend pattern of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep precipitation products with 0 25 0 25 gauge based imd data for different river basins covering entire india this was accomplished by comparing at the seasonal four seasons and annual scales for the river basins of india at the end the overall performance of the satellite based relative to imd measurement over india was assessed 2 study area water resources information system wris has recently published the river basin atlas of india accordingly there are in total 25 river basins and 103 sub basins among the river basins twelve basins are considered as major river basins in india that cover an area of 2 53 million km2 the other large river basins of india include the indus mahanadi krishna and godavari in the summer season ganga brahmaputra and indus rivers are fed by water from snowmelt while the other basins are entirely dependent on monsoon rainfall there are seven medium sized river basins including narmada mahi tapi subarnarekha brahmani baitarani sabarmati and cauvery that cover 15 of the drainage area of india kumar and jain 2011 four types of seasonal variability were examined in this study pre monsoon march may monsoon june september post monsoon october november and winter december february the elevation across india varies widely from 0 to more than 4000 m above mean sea level amsl with higher elevation in the northern part of the country generally flow in many indian rivers is typically dependent on direct precipitation except for a few rivers in northern india where the source of water is from snow or glacial melting fig 1 3 datasets and methodology the trmm satellite carried five instruments which are the visible infrared radiometer virs the trmm microwave imager tmi the precipitation radar pr the cloud and earth radiant energy sensor ceres and the lightning imaging sensor lis huffman et al 2007 2010 the trmm tmpa 3b43 is the latest version of the trmm monthly precipitation product the tmpa has a global coverage between 50 n and 50 s from 1998 through 2015 with the spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 roughly 26 28 km in india the tmpa products have been produced based on radar infrared and microwave sensors on trmm core observatory microwave and infrared data from multiple geostationary satellites and ground based precipitation measurements the tmpa products give the best estimates of quasi global precipitation as it is benefiting from many infrared and microwave sensors of geostationary satellites and the ground based gauge observations huffman et al 2007 2010 the cmorph data applies motion based techniques for rainfall estimation the rapid refresh of motion vectors obtained from the geostationary satellites infrared images gives rainfall estimation by passive microwave measurements with ground based observation joyce et al 2004 during the time of microwave sensor scan by the time weighted linear interpolation the intensity and shape of the rainfall are morphed precipitation estimation is primarily derived from passive microwave sensors however precipitation is estimated from the infrared retrievals when passive microwave sensors are unavailable dmsp 13 15 ssm l noaa 15 18 amsu b amser e and tmi aboard nasa s aqua and trmm spacecraft therefore this product combines higher accuracy retrievals from microwave and higher temporal and spatial resolution of infrared measurements the resolution of the product is 0 25 0 25 the algorithm is very flexible for precipitation estimation and allows data incorporation from any microwave satellite sensor the persiann cdr precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using

daily gauge based gridded precipitation data were generated at 0 25 resolution by imd using 6955 rain gauges across india bharti et al 2016 pai et al 2014 2015 the rain gauges are evenly distributed all over the country except for some areas over the northern india jammu kashmir state precipitation data from ground based imd and satellite based tmpa cmorph persiann and research quality product mswep were processed for twenty five river basins of india from 1998 to 2015 gridwise all data were up to 2015 but mswep was available only up to 2014 spatial variation and differences between the ground based and satellite based and research quality based data in various river basins were analyzed comparison between the ground based and satellite based datasets was assessed using two indices including root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient cc e g kundu et al 2014a 2017a mondal et al 2017 the non parametric trend analysis methods including the mann kendall mk and modified mann kendall mmk tests were applied using both datasets for the annual and seasonal time series kendall 1975 hamed and rao 1998 chandniha et al 2017 the last two statistical tests mk and mmk were used to detect the actual pattern of change positive negative and no trend of the precipitation in imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep from 1998 to 2015 the magnitude of change was estimated by the theil and sen s slope estimator test theil 1950 sen 1968 xu et al 2003 stated that in the case of long term precipitation trend analysis the mk test performs better than the parametric tests the mk test mann 1945 kendall 1975 checks the existence of a trend increase or decrease in a series against the null hypothesis of no trend a modified version of the mk test on the basis of modified variance is considered to be robust in the presence of autocorrelation hamed and rao 1998 hence in this study both mk and mmk tests were implemented trend magnitude was computed by the theil sen s estimator theil

2018 a flow chart illustrating the methodology used in this study is depicted in fig 2 4 results the comparison of total annual precipitation derived from imd and hrpps for different major river basins of india from 1998 to 2015 is illustrated in fig 3a results showed that cmoprh product mostly underestimates the imd tmpa persiann and mswep in all river basins except for basins number 1 8 11 13 14 16 18 and 25 similar patterns of precipitation variability were observed in all datasets except in the basin 2 for the entire study period river basins number 2 3 7 12 18 20 21 22 and 25 showed similarities between tmpa and persiann products while the river basins of 4 and 19 showed no similarity between these two datasets less variation was observed between tmpa persiann and mswep in basins 12 16 18 and 22 24 the basic statistics mean standard deviation sd and covariance for imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep annual datasets of all studied basins are presented in fig 3b mean precipitation and sd of all datasets were high in the eastern part of india basins 4 5 6 and 7 and low in the northwest basins 1 and 2 cmorph showed lower mean precipitation and sd in most of the basins relative to other datasets the positive covariance was observed in south southwest and west basins 17 21 and 23 25 of all datasets and the rest of the basins showed negative covariance the spatial precipitation distribution of imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep and their differences in percentage in the studied basins are presented in fig 4 the annual precipitation amount in all datasets showed decrease from east to west northwest india and northern part of india also indicated low precipitation the western and northwestern part of india was comparatively dry hence river basins along this side showed less rainfall in all datasets highest precipitation was observed in the east northeast basins 4 7 8 11 and along the west coast basin 19 in all datasets except cmorph the northeastern part received the heaviest rainfall that indicates higher rainfall over the river basins in this part during monsoon season in all datasets percentage differences of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep relative to imd were also calculated for 1998 2015 period fig 4 the cmorph data underestimated imd data in major parts of the country except in the east coast basin 11 west basin 1 and south basins 15 18 all datasets underestimated the imd data in the north and west coast except mswep the average annual difference in precipitation was similar in the tmpa and mswep data a comparison of average monthly precipitation from 1998 to 2015 between tmpa cmorph persiann mswep and imd datasets is shown in fig 5 all datasets showed higher amount of precipitation from june to september relative to the rest of the year the precipitation in the wet period varied from around 125 to 274 mm month 1 tmpa overestimated the imd measurements for almost all months except for june july and august cmorph underestimated the imd measurements in all months except for march april and may persiann overestimated imd measurements in all months except for january february march and december mswep overestimated imd values in all the months the rmse distribution indicated similar pattern in all dataset relative to imd high rmse was observed along the west coast basins 19 and part of 17 20 east and extreme east basins 4 7 and in the north part of basin 1 the monthly cc between tmpa persiann mswep and imd showed cc of above 0 80 in all parts of india except extreme north part of basin 1 and in entire basin 2 south part of basins 12 17 18 and 20 and east part of basin 4 cc of cmorph showed the same pattern but in majority of the basins the value is above 0 6 or comparatively lower cc than other datasets fig 6 the mk mann kendall and mmk modified mann kendall tests were performed for all datasets to determine the trends and their significance levels z statistic figs 7 and 8 according to the z test values the annual and monsoon analysis of mk test for all datasets showed similar positive and negative trends significant or non significant positive significant trend was observed along the north and western border of upper part of the country in some parts of basins 1 2 3 and 25 negative significant trend was observed in the east india in basins 3 and 4 however in most of the cases cmorph showed a minimum negative significant trend in precipitation the pre monsoon season indicated positive significant trend of precipitation in the south in all datasets in some parts of the basin 20 in the post monsoon season positive significant trend was only observed in the basin 1 and 2 in the north in cmorph and in a very small area in the north in tmpa and persiann majority of india during this season indicated non significant negative trend during the winter season positive significant trend was observed various parts of the basins 1 and 3 negative significant trend in the cmorph data was found in basins 11 24 and 25 major parts of india showed non significant positive trend for all datasets the mmk test z values indicated similar pattern of trend distribution in all datasets detail statistics of mk and mmk tests are presented in table 1 the average z statistic mk and mmk for different river basins in india are shown in appendix a tables 1 and 2 the sen s slope or magnitude of the precipitation trend of imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep datasets is illustrated in fig 9 the annual and monsoon magnitude of slope indicated increasing trend 10 mm year 1 in the northern and western parts of india basins 1 2 22 25 in all datasets high intensity decreasing trend basins 3 7 was observed in the east 30 mm year 1 in all datasets except in the cmorph during the pre monsoon season a similar intensity of increase and decrease magnitude of slope was found in the imd tmpa and persiann datasets while cmorph and mswep showed similar intensity of decrease in the east and central india during the post monsoon season maximum areas showed decrease 0 10 mm year 1 but northern part of india basins 1 and 2 indicated increased intensity of precipitation 0 10 mm year 1 during the winter season most of the country showed increasing intensity of precipitation except a few river basins mostly located in the east in basins 4 7 and 12 5 discussion a wide variation in the precipitation distribution was observed from the analysis of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep products relative to imd measurements during 1998 2015 which was considered as the base dataset in this study the difference in percentage of precipitation distribution patterns positive or negative is similar in imd tmpa and imd mswep comparisons for all basins except basins of 1 20 and 25 in imd cmorph comparison 4 basins namely 1 16 17 were overestimated by cmorph in imd tmpa basins that were underestimated by tmpa were 1 4 and 19 it was observed that the tmpa persiann and mswep satellite based products underestimated the river basins characterized by hill and mountainous terrain in comparison with imd only few hilly regions in a part of north india showed overestimation by mswep similarly bharti et al 2016 stated that the tmpa product underestimated the measured precipitation imd in hilly regions of india during 1998 2013 according to prakash et al 2015a there were larger systematic errors in the tmpa product 2000 2013 over the northeast region of india the cc and rmse were used for better understanding of the actual quality of the satellite based products relative to the ground based data duhan and pandey 2015 kundu et al 2017a as for the tmpa and imd relationship basins 2 and 18 showed a lower cc value and basins 4 7 and 19 showed high rmse value these river basins are located in the northern western southwestern and the eastern part of the country a similar observations can be found in other studies e g prakash et al 2014b prakash et al 2015a the basins with the higher rmse are mostly located in the areas with precipitation of more than 1500 mm year 1 sunilkumar et al 2015 stated that basins 4 5 and 19 show larger rmse between the cmorph tmpa and persiann and imd measurements which conforms to the present study assuming that the imd is the reference dataset the average rmse 69 mm and cc 0 829 were minimum and maximum respectively between tmpa and imd for entire india implying highest relevance between these two datasets average rmse 95 3 mm and cc 0 70 were maximum and minimum respectively for cmorph for entire india indicating the lowest relationship between these two datasets the mswep dataset showed lower rmse and higher cc 70 76 mm and 0 825 respectively than the persiann dataset 81 19 mm and 0 81 respectively spatial distribution of trend pattern positive negative and no trend of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep relative to imd indicated similarity and non similarity in different parts of india the annual analysis showed highest similarity between persiann and imd 67 76 minimum similarity was observed between cmorph and imd 60 36 both the tmpa and mswep gave similar percentage of matched data with imd about 66 pre monsoon and monsoon seasons followed similar pattern as the annual comparison the tmpa showed better trend performance in the post monsoon 69 86 and winter seasons 68 91 relative to imd the similar trend between imd and other datasets varied from 56 20 mswep in pre monsoon to 69 86 tmpa in post monsoon the annual and monsoon analysis showed similarity or matched areas in the north and northwest in all datasets where precipitation was 1000 mm the eastern part of india ganga basin also showed similarity in precipitation trend between imd and all datasets except cmorph other areas showed scattered distribution of matched areas according to the literature most of the precipitation trend analysis have been conducted at regional or local scale in india however only very few studies considered entire india jain and kumar 2012 mondal et al 2015 using aggregated data non gridded for trend detection according to our findings generally all datasets showed increasing trend in northwest and southern india while central and eastern parts of india showed decreasing trend from 1998 to 2015 using mk and mmk methods similar precipitation trend pattern were reported by researchers kumar et al 2010 and mondal et al 2015 on annual time scale dash et al 2007 reported the highest decline in nagaland manipur mizoram and tripura located in the eastern part of india jain and kumar 2012 observed increasing trend in basins 15 17 while they observed decreasing trend in basins 4 12 20 and 21 in the pre monsoon season decreasing trend pattern was observed in the eastern part of india basins 4 7 that conforms to the work of mondal et al 2015 the monsoon precipitation trend indicated decrease in the east and north central of india in different sets of data similar observations of negative precipitation trend along the eastern part of india were found in the works of kishore et al 2016 and mondal et al 2015 negative precipitation trends in the ganga river basin bisht et al 2018 also conforms to the present study except for the cmorph data increasing trend was observed along the eastern boundary central part and northwest that conforms to the study of mondal et al 2015 and kishore et al 2016 the monsoon season is associated with the enso el nino southern oscillation phenomena enso and himalayan snow are suggested to play a major role in the indian monsoon by a few researchers kripalani et al 2003 ramesh kumar et al 2009 the el niño causes weaker monsoon while the la niña phase strengthens the monsoon less winter snow is considered as favorable for the monsoon kripalani et al 2003 goswami et al 2006 showed a noticeable rise in the magnitude and frequency of extreme rainfall events during the monsoon and latif et al 2017 indicated that july and august were the most active monsoon months that conforms to the present study however kumar et al 1999 showed that the relationship between monsoon and enso has weakened in recent decades the negative trend in central and northeast parts of india in the post monsoon and positive trend in west central part in the winter was observed in all datasets similar trend pattern was also noted by kundu et al 2014b 6 conclusions the satellite based hrpps were compared with the ground based imd measurements for the river basins of india from 1998 to 2015 the annual average distribution of tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep precipitation relative to imd showed that the satellite based precipitation data underestimate the ground based data covering the total area of 30 25 70 11 28 49 and 3 45 respectively tmpa and persiann products underestimated 20 the imd precipitation in the basins that are located in a relatively high elevation in northern india the trend patterns of mk and mmk positive negative and no trend were similar taking into account both annual and seasonal time scales in all datasets imd tmpa cmorph persiann and mswep the tmpa and mswep products showed better performance than persiann and cmorph based on the accuracy relative to imd hence suitable to be used in hydrometeorological studies in the data poor region of the country the trend analysis implied small variations among the tmpa persiann and mswep data however persiann dataset showed best similarity to imd in annual and monsoon trend analysis accordingly these three satellite based products are more reliable to be used in ungauged areas and in complex terrain where in situ precipitation measurement is scarce the annual and monsoon trend pattern showed higher variations over large river basins where both positive and negative trends were noted basins 3 12 and 20 many countries in the southeast asia have similar rainfall characteristics and have an annual dependence on precipitation for water resources that forms a backbone of livelihood society and economy of those countries this work has an impact that is larger than the extent of the study the comparisons of the data sets viz in situ model outputs and satellite based precipitation provide a framework for similar analysis in other large countries where a in situ data are generally not publicly available b in situ gauge data are sparse and cannot capture the spatial variability of the precipitation and c establish a climatology for future changes and planning for water resource management in view of above it can be concluded that before using satellite based products in various hydrometeorological applications it is essential to improve the satellite data quality e g gebregiorgis and hossain 2015 hashemi et al 2017 then the improved data can be used for the ungauged or poorly gauged basins acknowledgements the authors wish to acknowledge the support of dr bradley doorn program manager water resources applied sciences program award

7042,physically based models are important tools for evaluating the hydraulic behaviour of urban drainage systems and more specifically assessing flood risk while it is well known that such models should be calibrated and validated with monitoring data overland runoff information is seldom available for this purpose this study investigates the potential of using surveillance camera footage to measure surface flow velocity thanks to an lspiv based method called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv seven real scale experiments conducted in a specialized flood training facility were used to test the ssiv method under varied and challenging conditions ssiv performance was evaluated by benchmarking bulk mean velocity against that measured by a conventional sensor array in the best conditions tested ssiv and conventional flow sensors differed by only 1 7 0 1 standard deviation while the method proved sensitive to light conditions our results suggest that infrared lighting could be used to increase measurement consistency our study concludes that for measuring overland flow velocity in urban areas surveillance and traffic cameras can be considered as a low maintenance and easy to install alternative to conventional sensor systems keywords ssiv surface structure image velocimetry particle image velocimetry urban runoff flood monitoring 1 introduction 1 1 urban overland flow measurement challenges due to changes in climate continuously growing impervious areas due to urbanisation and the small return periods considered when designing sewer systems in many countries the hydraulic capacity of existing storm water drainage systems may no longer be sufficient leading to an increased likelihood of surface flooding as well as to more severe consequences united nations department of economic and social affairs 2014 hydraulic models are useful tools for simulating the hydraulic behaviour of drainage systems during moderate rainfall events but also and perhaps more interestingly during flood events urban drainage models need to be calibrated in order to provide results that accurately represent the real conditions however data to calibrate the overland flow part of drainage models are generally not available as they are difficult and risky to obtain conventional flow sensors i e those developed for measuring flow inside storm water sewers are not suitable for measuring overland runoff they are expensive to operate due to cleaning and repairing requirements yang and kang 2017 as most of these sensors would need to be in contact with the flow and would be exposed to all sorts of interactions with the public e g vandalism also ad hoc data collection during a flood event usually involves risks to field data collection workers e g muste et al 2008 the most commonly available data of overland flow are maximum water level marks resulting from flood events e g on building walls or other structures such as bridge pillars lo et al 2015 however these marks are only available after exceptional events i e floods by not providing the time at which the peak was reached the possibilities for model calibration are very limited and real time data assimilation is impossible in addition to water depth flow velocity is also key when estimating flood risk smith 2012 the lack of overland flow data can lead to erroneous results when the objective of the model is to accurately represent flow conditions in an urban area it is thus clear that novel non intrusive data sources are required hunter et al 2008 if flood characteristics such as water depth and flow velocity are to be accurately modelled 1 2 particle image velocimetry piv to measure flow velocity particle image velocimetry adrian 1991 is a non intrusive method for measuring flow velocity in laboratory conditions piv uses cross correlation methods on consecutive image frames of a known time interval to enable cross correlation the fluid is seeded with suspended tracer particles which are assumed to follow the flow paths a variant of piv known as large scale piv lspiv was proposed by fujita et al 1998 to measure flow velocity using tracers or reflections on the surface of the flow thus making it much more useful in real world applications lewis and rhoads 2015 such as hydrology some lspiv implementations were proposed to address some of the challenges found in the real world such as the absence of suspended particles or the difficulty of seeding the flow with artificial tracers benetazzo et al 2016 additionally light conditions cannot be controlled cameras can rarely be placed perpendicularly to the flow and video image quality is variable muste et al 2008 under the right conditions lspiv has been shown to provide reliable surface and bulk average flow velocities in the laboratory fujita et al 1998 observed errors of less than 5 between the lspiv and reference flow velocity measurements despite the relatively low resolution images used in two review articles muste et al 2008 2011 analysed the potential of lspiv for hydrology and hydraulic applications from the various studies they found that lspiv errors can go up to 3 5 and 16 in laboratory and field conditions respectively these two studies also point to future directions for the improvement of lspiv algorithms since its inception lspiv is being continuously improved e g to make the method more suitable for real time monitoring with small camera tilt angles and in absence of artificial tracers fujita and aya 2000 benetazzo et al 2016 the potential value of lspiv in the context of urban hydrology is well recognized a study by guillén et al 2017 investigates flood vulnerability taking into account the flood flow velocity measured with lspiv and flood depth extracted from the images collected by public observers from a practical point of view lspiv is well suited to the urban environment contactless measurement means that the sensor is safe from vehicles on the road and as for most image based measurement principles camera placement is flexible because most lspiv research focused on river hydrology there are only a few studies that have investigated the reliability of lspiv in the context of shallow water flows weitbrecht et al 2002 meselhe et al 2004 and muste et al 2014 found that in shallow water flow conditions mean velocities obtained using lspiv were accurate although the experiments were conducted in laboratory with controlled lighting and seeded flow when it comes to shallow and low velocity flows in an urban context only a single publication branisavljević and prodanović 2006 is known although the results were inconclusive and obtained using artificial tracers which is not transferable to city scale monitoring applications 1 3 leveraging alternative data sources to support lspiv based flow velocity measurement in urban areas in the past years a number of social and technological changes have taken place three of which could potentially support the need for urban flood monitoring data with the help of lspiv processing the most recent development is that of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs which have become much more accessible over the past 5 10 years detert and weitbrecht 2015 investigated the potential of using low cost uavs a quadcopter in this case to estimate river flow characteristics based on lspiv the results they obtained were promising it is worth noting however that the experiment included adding artificial tracers to the river flow which improved the lspiv accuracy but at the same time can be considered as a limitation of the lspiv applicability in two other recent studies tauro et al 2015 2016 the applicability of combining lspiv methods and uavs to characterise flow velocities was investigated their findings show that for the tested conditions outdoor and fully controlled flow the lspiv velocity measurements are more similar to benchmark values than traditional lspiv platforms although some adjustments would need to be made the same concepts presented in tauro et al 2015 2016 studies can be explored to measure overland flow velocity in urban environments since the early 2000s social media platforms such as youtube facebook instagram and twitter have become a large resource of photos and videos some of which have the potential to be used for estimating urban overland flow needed for urban flood model calibration le boursicaud et al 2016 investigated the applicability of lspiv using data from youtube their study showed that videos available from youtube can be a good source of data as demonstrated in another study le coz et al 2016 the challenges of using these data sources to measure flow velocity using lspiv are primarily related to the constant camera movement during video recording other difficulties can result from inconsistencies in photo or video geo and time stamping which may create difficulties in applying these data in model calibration or real time urban drainage system operation the final and most mature development is the proliferation of surveillance cameras installed by government institutions and home or business owners in urban areas the surveillance cameras are mainly intended to ensure citizen safety and asset security and support road traffic management but can also be used to obtain overland flow information in a recent study lo et al 2015 successfully investigated the use of surveillance cameras to measure water levels in rivers and inform flood alert systems some of the advantages of considering surveillance cameras to measure overland flow in urban areas are i the number and location of existing cameras is known a priori so the installation of new cameras can be conducted in an optimal way to fulfil specific objectives ii the videos provided by these cameras are usually stable and have unique large viewing angles and iii because their locations are fixed the accurate calibration of the cameras becomes possible the downsides are that data are not necessarily easily accessible due to data protection legal reasons that some of the existing cameras are not necessarily located where flooding occurs in contrast with social media data and that frame rate of surveillance camera videos might be too low or have automatic frame rate sample selection based on image content or light conditions 1 4 objectives of the study we postulate that given reasonably placed surveillance cameras lspiv could provide valuable information on overland flow including during urban floods however before lspiv can be recommended for routine use with surveillance cameras in urban areas it is essential to understand the method s nominal operating conditions and accuracy as should be done for all novel sensing techniques tauro et al 2018 in the present study we use an improved lspiv based method called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv to elucidate the factors pertaining to successful lspiv implementation specifically for shallow flows over paved surfaces more specifically we present the results of a sensitivity analysis to assess how light conditions camera positioning video properties and water depth assumptions affect lspiv performance in the context of shallow urban runoff the analysis is based on video recordings from real scale flooding experiments which were monitored with a state of the art radar based flow sensor this study based on shallow water flow experiments is a good indication of the potential of lspiv for measuring flow velocity during flood events in urban areas as shallow flow conditions present additional challenges when compared to flows with larger water depths muste et al 2014 i e flow during flood events in comparison to previous studies investigating lspiv the present work is novel in the following ways shallow overland flow velocity is measured in absence of artificial tracers lspiv performance is evaluated under a variety of light conditions including infrared light for conducting night time measurements as well as for a variety of operating conditions and the cameras used in this study are regular surveillance cameras in opposition to lspiv dedicated cameras used in previous studies on lspiv applications to estimate flow velocity 2 ssiv method and flow velocity measurement in this work we use a flavour of lspiv called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv designed for operational uses while the overall measurement procedure is similar to that of lspiv ssiv introduces some improvements to mitigate the negative influence of two factors known to compromise lspiv performance muste et al 2008 i glare and shadows on the water surface and ii lack of traceable features in the flow with these improvements ssiv is exceptionally robust in challenging measurement situations in a previous study lüthi et al 2014 ssiv was integrated in a smartphone app discharge photrack et al 2018 to measure flow velocity and discharge hansen et al 2017 showed the good performance of ssiv in measuring flow velocity in a continuous manner in three different applications a 30 m wide river a channelled river and a channel in a wastewater treatment plant it must be noted that in hansen et al 2017 the water level is also measured by an image processing technique the ssiv measurement procedure is conducted on 5 second segments of video segment duration selected based on the authors experience with the method and consists of the following steps camera view calibration camera calibration requires the coordinates of at least six markers distributed over the camera view i e not clustered and the coordinates of the camera in order to determine the camera s external and internal parameters which involve angle and distance to flow plane focal length and radial distortion flexibility of the camera position is one of the advantages of image based measurements muste et al 2008 mentioned that 10 degrees is an acceptable limit for the camera tilt angle during calibration a local three dimensional reference system is defined in such a way that the first dimension x is in the principal direction of flow as determined by the geometry of the channel see fig 1 a flow surface structure filtering lspiv requires image processing adjustments to mitigate strong illumination and shadows on the water surface muste et al 2008 as well as artificial tracers or strong turbulence driven ripples boiling on the free surface muste et al 2011 the filter applied in ssiv mitigates these negative effects by filtering shadows and immovable objects like the river bottom in the video and enhances structures that are present on the free flow surface to filter out shadows and immovable obstacles and enhance the flow surface structures ssiv applies a simple image subtraction process in which the images are subtracted by an image created from a set of temporal averaged images image orthorectification lspiv methods are characterized by images covering large areas and by cameras located at narrow angles to the flow surface which makes it necessary to orthorectify the images this step also needs to be performed when using ssiv image cross correlation as in all piv based methods pixel displacement is calculated by applying a cross correlation technique to the interrogation windows on which the image is subdivided adrian 1991 fujita et al 1998 muste et al 2008 in this study interrogation windows of 32 64 pixels of size approximately 0 2 of the image size with a spacing between the window centres of 16x32 pixels were kept constant irrespective of the different video frame rates or resolutions tested this step results in a regular grid of pixel displacement vectors and is repeated for all consecutive image frames within each 5 second video segment surface velocity calculation to transform the pixel displacement into surface velocities the camera matrix derived from the camera calibration is used in the process of transforming the pixel displacement into surface velocities the assumed or measured water depth is taken into account this is relevant because if for example the water depth is over estimated i e assumed closer to the camera than it actually is the surface velocity will consequently be under estimated surface velocity filtering velocity vectors from the cross correlation can be erroneous because of wrong matching patterns many lspiv implementations follow the method proposed by fujita and kaizu 1995 to correct such erroneous vectors with ssiv the erroneous vectors are not corrected but rather filtered according to the flow conditions the filtering is performed in two steps the first step is a so called local filtering procedure where each velocity vector is compared with up to eight neighbours if the vector does deviate significantly in direction and magnitude from the eight neighbouring vectors then it is simply discarded i e no interpolation is carried out the second filtering step employs a so called global filtering each velocity vector is validated by checking if its magnitude and direction does not deviate significantly from the global mean after outlier removal each interrogation window will usually have many velocity vectors due to the 5 second analysis period so in each window a histogram is computed and the vector with the mode velocity value in the x direction is retained the result is a grid of velocity vectors representative of the 5 second period that can be visualised as in fig 1a bulk velocity calculation the x component of the flow velocity vectors from the previous step red points in fig 1b are then grouped by cross sectional position and used to fit a surface velocity profile blue line in fig 1b from this surface velocity profile there are two ways of computing the bulk flow velocity the first one is based on the classical flow velocity coefficient rantz et al 1982 for which a value of 0 85 is typically used the second one uses a roughness dependent mixing length model absi 2006 which is dependent on bottom roughness and water depth in this study the flow velocity coefficient 0 574 was used to calculate the bulk velocity 3 experiment description 3 1 objectives and design the objective of this study is to elucidate the factors influencing the performance of ssiv for shallow flows without tracers as would be expected in urban applications as indicated in section 2 ssiv operates on the principle of cross correlation of visual patterns created by water surface structure in consecutive video frames the success of the method therefore depends on the success of two intermediate steps surface pattern extraction and frame to frame pattern matching beyond the algorithmic implementation of pattern extraction and cross correlation the success of ssiv is also influenced by environmental and technical factors in this study we analyse the influence of i light conditions ii video frame rate iii camera positioning iv video resolution and v water depth assumptions in absence of measured data other factors such as water turbidity and flow turbulence for froude numbers higher than one standing waves or slowly moving waves can represent a problem on the other hand for low froude numbers not having enough surface patterns is also challenging may also affect the performance of ssiv but are not considered in this study to investigate the influence of the aforementioned factors we conducted a one at a time sensitivity analysis i e varying each factor while keeping the others constant the variations were made either by changing an experimental variable by degrading the video quality or by modifying the ssiv input table 1 3 1 1 light conditions the characteristics of the light source highly influence the visibility of water surface structures we tested the ssiv method with experiments conducted under a range of daytime and night time light conditions 3 1 2 video frame rate the video frame rate defines the time step from image to image between which surface displacement is estimated lower frame rates correspond to greater temporal differences between images which in the case of a moving scene translates into a worse correlation it can therefore be expected that for a given camera configuration and flow regime there is a minimum frame rate for which ssiv succeeds in the present study we test the ssiv method by varying video frame rate from 26 to 10 frames per second fps see appendix a1 3 1 3 camera positioning the position and angle of the camera relative to the flow is a determining factor for the visibility of structure on the surface of the water while flat viewing angles tend to increase the number of reflections the strength of the reflections can be decreased in the absence of a light source which can be reflected in this study we compare two very different camera perspectives that share a portion of their views both cameras have tilt angles significantly larger than the 10 degrees limit suggested by for example muste et al 2008 see fig 1 and table 4 3 1 4 video resolution the video resolution defines the level of detail from which patterns can be extracted a reduction of the image resolution is assumed to have a similar effect as increasing the distance of the camera to the flow or having a wider angle lens image distortions potentially created due to using wide angle cameras would not create issues for ssiv analysis as the distortions can be compensated during the image ortho rectification step in this study we compare seven different video resolutions from 1280 720 pixels to 120 68 pixels the video resolution was downgraded using the command presented in appendix a1 the variation in video resolution is analogous to varying the distance between camera and flow by a factor of 10 7 as presented in appendix a2 3 1 5 water depth assumptions as explained in section 2 the transformation from pixel s 1 to m s 1 depends on the distance between the camera and the flow plane and also the water depth however it is most likely that information about water depth will not be available when analysing videos recorded by a surveillance camera in the present study we evaluate the impact of assuming a fixed water depth of 2 cm 5 cm and 10 cm in the context of shallow flows on bulk velocity measurements using ssiv 3 2 surface flow experiments the data for this work 1 the data sets used in this study are freely available in a zenodo data repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1256007 1 were collected in the floodx project moy de vitry et al 2017a all the data is open access and free of copyright in the floodx project large scale urban flash flood experiments were conducted in a facility operated by the swiss federal office for defence procurement armasuisse and specially designed for flood response training the facility is a paved 25x25 m area surrounded by concrete walls containing a small building and a configurable drainage network flood water can be fed into the facility via different pathways leading from a 450 m3 reservoir the floodx project is a stage for multiple investigations in urban flood metrology of which the evaluation of ssiv for urban surface flow is one the portion of the floodx setup relevant to the present study is described in the following paragraphs the experiment area mimics a street curb and consists of a channel 1 1 m wide by 4 6 m long bordered with a granite curb on one side and a wood lined sandbag wall on the other fig 1 upstream a shallow pond with an area of 7 8 m2 receives water from an overflowing manhole and a lateral channel the water flows out of the area and is funnelled into the experiment channel the experiment channel is slightly uneven in the area where velocity is measured the ground on the curb side is at first about 1 3 cm lower than on the sandbag side a bit further downstream the ground dips a bit and the sandbag side is about 0 5 cm lower than the curb side moy de vitry et al 2017b additionally the water used was completely transparent bereft of suspended or floating particles which provided a clear view of the channel bed the water purity increases the difficulty of detecting surface structure and creates a greater reliance on light reflections which are influenced by lighting conditions real flood water often has strong surface structures and or particles leading to higher flow velocity measurement accuracy as such the results presented in this section should be viewed as conservative estimates of ssiv performance in real world applications of the experiments conducted within floodx a selection of seven flood events was made for the present work table 2 these flood events were selected for the variety of light conditions and event sizes the maximum and mean froude numbers are very close to 1 critical flow this makes the evaluation of the accuracy of the ssiv flow velocity measurements for different light conditions independent of the experiment hydrograph 3 3 camera setup five consumer grade surveillance cameras of the same brand and model were installed at floodx two of which were selected for the present study fig 3 the technical specifications of the camera model and of the two cameras cam1 and cam2 installation characteristics are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively the location of cam1 and cam2 in relation to the flow channel are illustrated in fig 2 3 4 reference measurements reference flow bulk velocity and water depth measurements were collected with a radar based sensor and ultrasonic sensor respectively the specification of the sensors used to obtain reference flow velocity and water depth are presented in table 5 water depth is also used as a secondary input for ssiv to derive flow bulk velocity from flow surface velocity the area used for the radar based sensor was adjusted to be the same as the area used to measure flow surface velocity with ssiv the flow velocity measurements provided by the radar based sensor were used to compare the ssiv velocity measurements graphically and statistically for the statistics comparison the mean error eq 1 and the standard deviation sd of the error were computed by comparing the ssiv velocity and reference velocity measurements at each time interval 5 s in this case 1 me t 0 n v ssiv t v ref t n where vssiv t is the ssiv flow velocity vref t is the reference flow velocity and n is the time steps 4 results and discussion in this section the results of the analysis of the factors influencing ssiv performance are presented specifically we selected an experiment to use as a baseline experiment e1 camera cam1 and investigate how ssiv measurements are affected by light conditions section 4 1 video frame rate section 4 2 camera positioning section 4 3 video resolution section 4 4 and variation of the water depth assumptions section 4 5 in each case the results are compared to the reference measurements the reference measurement from the radar sensor corresponds to the bulk velocity derived from surface velocities and water level but the transformation method used has not been revealed by the manufacturer as mentioned in section 2 the flow velocity coefficient method implemented in ssiv was used with the coefficient equal to 0 574 obtained using a simple optimising tool available in excel solver the coefficient was kept constant for all experiments this value is lower than that normally used in riverine environments 0 78 0 93 according to muste et al 2008 however in small channels with shallow water flow flow velocity coefficient values of around 0 55 have been found to be representative of flow conditions e g genç et al 2015 besides the reference measurement a simple test was conducted to validate the accuracy of the surface velocity obtained with ssiv the velocity of a leaf floating in the water in experiment e1 was estimated by counting the number of video frames that it took to move between two known points the estimated velocity based on the leaf displacement was 0 97 m s 1 while the average ssiv velocity measurement for the same stretch was 1 0 m s 1 this clearly shows the accuracy of ssiv flow surface velocity measurements 4 1 influence of light conditions this section investigates the influence of various daytime and night time light conditions on the quality of the flow velocity measurements obtained using ssiv 4 1 1 daylight conditions direct light and overcast velocity measurements from ssiv are in overall agreement with the reference measurements especially for experiments e1 and e2 fig 4 in experiment e3 where lighting was diffuse due to overcast skies some temporary but systematic deviations from the reference can be observed and are caused by insufficient visibility of flow surface structure for which lighting is partly responsible this result shows that lighting conditions can have a significant impact on the detectability of surface structure and the derived velocity measurement in otherwise similar flow conditions in fig 4 the ssiv measurements appear to systematically start at a velocity of around 0 4 m s 1 this is because the flow enters the system abruptly like a wave as illustrated in fig 2 and the ssiv sampling frequency is not high enough to capture the velocity front figs 4 and 5 also suggest that there is a lower limit for which ssiv can measure flow velocity in this case around 0 1 m s 1 this threshold is linked to the absence of visible patterns on the water surface for low velocities and water depths since no tracers are used the low visibility of surface patterns is accentuated by water transparency as explained in the experiments description section 3 2 in table 6 the results of the statistical analysis show that the mean error between ssiv and reference measurements is lower than 20 which can be qualified as good the standard deviation of the errors is negligible for the three experiments 4 1 2 night artificial light conditions visible and infrared light as can be seen in fig 6 ssiv was not always able to generate velocity estimates during the night especially for experiments e4 e6 and e7 in all cases the measurement gaps usually occur when the flow velocity is much higher or lower than 0 5 m s 1 the measurement gaps that occur during lower flow velocities may be due to the limited visibility of surface structure at low flow regimes similarly to what was observed for the daytime experiments but aggravated by poor lighting and image quality of the night time footage on the other hand the measurement gaps that occur during higher velocities in experiment e7 are probably due to insufficient video framerate indeed the cameras used in this study automatically reduced their frame rate when recording in infrared mode the adjusted frame rate is encoded in the video metadata and was found to be a constant 13 fps over the duration of experiments e6 and e7 it is therefore possible that the peak in flow velocity of around 0 75 m s 1 results in a displacement that is too large to be detected with ssiv a way to overcome this difficulty would be to adjust the size of the interrogation windows based on video frame rate however as described in section 2 this was not the case in this study nevertheless when ssiv is able to produce a signal the values are usually in agreement with the reference measurements for both visible and infrared light from the scatterplots in fig 7 ssiv appears to slightly underestimate flow velocity both with visible and infrared light this could be linked to the poor documentation of the frame rate by the camera although further experiments are needed for confirmation fig 7 also suggests a lower limit around 0 4 m s 1 below which ssiv provides only few and often wrong measurements in the case of visible light this limit combined with the fact that the actual velocity was often around 0 5 m s 1 causes the scatterplots to look artificially clustered the statistical analysis presented in table 7 confirms that when ssiv is able to generate a velocity estimate the agreement with reference measurements is fair and the mean of the residuals is below 10 the mean and standard deviation for experiment e6 are particularly good and suggest that infrared light 850 nm wavelenght conditions could be a promising means of obtaining good results at night in conclusion light conditions have a significant impact on ssiv performance as could be expected daytime light conditions are most favourable although the specific type of light still impacts results at night ssiv works surprisingly well given the poor lighting and image quality of the experiments in particular infrared lighting shows promise for future applications 4 2 influence of video frame rate to isolate the possible effect of low frame rate observed in the night time footage in the previous section footage from camera cam1 in experiment e1 was downgraded via video processing as explained in section 3 1 and appendix a1 as can be seen in fig 8 decreasing the frame rate is indeed detrimental to ssiv performance in fact the measurements obtained with frame rates of 15 and 10 fps would not be usable in practice since ssiv fails to process large portions of the time series ssiv only succeeds for six data points at 10 fps this failure was also observed for night time experiments e4 and e6 and is probably due to strong visual differences and lack of correspondence between frames another impact of lowering the frame rate is that the level of noise in the ssiv measurement appears to increase as is especially evident between 25 and 20 fps the statistical analysis results presented in table 8 should be taken in perspective despite the small and similar mean error values obtained for the 10 fps video when compared to the values of the other videos the analysis is not significant in this specific case because only six points with ssiv velocity were available in conclusion videos with frame rates as low as 20 fps can still provide complete and meaningful flow velocity information although a slight noise increase can be expected 4 3 influence of camera perspective from experiment e1 in fig 9 the change in camera perspective appears to change ssiv performance completely while the signal appears to coincide with the reference measurement at the very beginning the correlation rapidly disintegrates and the rest of the ssiv signal appears random additionally the noise level is much higher than for previous measurements as reflected in the high relative standard deviation of the residuals in table 9 the situation in experiment e4 however is more moderate there is little difference between the results of camera cam1 and cam2 according to previous studies camera tilt angle is one factor determining the accuracy of piv based flow velocity measurements for example kim et al 2008 recommend a minimum limit of 10 degrees however since the tilting angle of camera cam2 is far above this limit we assume that the tilting angle in itself does not play a significant role in the experiment unfortunately the data obtained during the experiments do not include videos with cameras at the same or a very similar locations but with different tilting angles so it is not possible to make a definite conclusion in this respect another difference between the two camera positioning is their distance from the flow camera cam1 is 3 2 m away from the flow location whereas camera cam2 is 9 7 m away this difference translates directly to differences in the effective ground sampling distance a factor that is explored in section 4 4 as mentioned above experiment e4 shows that location itself does not fully determine ssiv measurement quality this discrepancy is also visible in the statistical analysis presented in table 9 and again suggests that light conditions could be the major driving factor for ssiv success 4 4 influence of video resolution as discussed earlier in section 3 1 artificially downgrading the video resolution can be related to the distance between the camera and the flow plane see appendix a2 which consequently can be translated into changing image ground sampling distance this means that the results described here for the video resolution can also be discussed in terms of ground sampling distance see table a1 in appendix 2 for the correspondence as can be seen in the plots of fig 10 a and b a progressive decrease of video resolution down to 256 144 pixels hardly affects the ssiv flow velocity measurements for the video resolution of 160 90 pixels the signal becomes much noisier and the correlation is less strong at 120 68 pixels the ssiv measurement is practically meaningless for a video resolution of 160 90 pixels distances around 38 m see appendix a2 ssiv still seems to produce meaningful results the mean error is less than 0 1 m s 1 however the mean error is already around 10 times higher than the one obtained using the original video for 120 68 pixels i e a camera located at approximately 51 m from the flow plane see appendix a2 the mean error increased significantly to almost 0 4 m s 1 this less accurate velocity measurements can be explained by a smaller number of interrogation windows used in this study the size of the interrogation windows remained unchanged 32 64 pixel for all experiments another factor which was also not considered in the present study is the dimensions of visible structures on the flow surface when these structures are large they are also more visible from afar and should therefore have a positive impact on the ssiv measurements based on these results it seems to be possible to achieve meaningful ssiv flow velocity measurements with hd cameras minimum of 1280 720 pixels by definition located at a maximum of 25 m from the flow plane of course other factors discussed in the previous sections such as light conditions and video frame rate also seem to influence the quality of ssiv measurements table 10 4 5 influence of water depth assumptions as mentioned in section 2 when transforming the velocity from pixel frame 1 to m s 1 it is necessary to define the horizontal plane of the velocity which depends on the water level in order to evaluate the error committed by assuming a fixed water depth footage for experiment e1 from camera cam1 was processed three times with a fixed water depth of 2 5 and 10 cm in fig 11 the three time series are plotted alongside the ssiv measurement obtained with real time varying water depth and the reference measurement the fixed water depth assumption adds a bias to measurement depending on whether the assumed value is above or below the true mean water depth of 2 9 cm from this set of ssiv runs it can be concluded that as expected water depth has limited impact on flow velocity measurements from the statistical analysis of residuals table 11 it can be concluded that the error mean and standard deviation of the errors between ssiv and reference flow velocity measurements is approximately constant this conclusion is valid and can be explained by the small ration between the flow depth and the distance between the camera and the flow surface in the case of shallow water flow 5 conclusions the findings obtained suggest that with ssiv even consumer grade surveillance cameras can provide reliable velocity measurements for shallow urban overland runoff with such an approach we could circumvent the need for installing dedicated flow sensors and possibly make use of existing surveillance infrastructure to gather data in a cost efficient and highly scalable manner this new source of data would not only bring much needed information for drainage model development but also provide rare insights into the phenomenon of shallow overland flow it is important to note that ssiv in absence of water level information provides flow velocity and not discharge such water level information can be obtained from a dedicated sensor or via image analysis though the task is non trivial in complex urban environments the findings also exposed some critical features of surveillance camera based flow velocity measurement which must be taken into consideration when applying ssiv in practice overall the visibility of structure on the water surface is the most influential factor determining ssiv accuracy we found that structure visibility depends not only on lighting conditions but also on the relative position of the camera to the flow and the presence of objects that affect light reflection on the water therefore the use of artificial light sources such as the ones tested in our experiments should be considered a means of obtaining consistent results in practice frame rate is another parameter critical to ssiv success we found that below 20 frames per second measurements became intermittent in terms of measurement range ssiv was not capable of reliably measuring velocities lower than 0 1 m s 1 during the day and 0 5 m s 1 at night in our experiments which was partially due to the high transparency of the water used nevertheless ssiv provides robust measurements for images with a resolution as low as 256 144 pixels the cameras used in this study used a lossy compression standard that reduces video quality to optimize file size but which can negatively impact the ssiv velocity measurements while the effect of video compression was not evaluated in this study this potential issue is easily resolved by using cameras that encode footage with a lossless video format it is worth noting that the flow regimes of the seven flood experiments were always near critical froude numbers in average slightly below one because of this the challenges created by strong sub critical not enough surface patterns or super critical standing waves flows were not present and therefore not investigated in this study this work demonstrates not only the potential of ssiv for measuring urban runoff but also the substantial influence of environmental factors on ssiv performance in a next step the positive results obtained in this study should be validated with videos captured by surveillance cameras installed in real urban environments i e in city locations where flooding has occurred future studies should also investigate how factors such as rainfall disturbances from moving vehicles and complex surface geometries affect ssiv performance acknowledgements this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation snf grant number 169630 calibration of coupled urban flood models with experimental surface runoff data calico appendix a video processing and camera distance analysis a1 video processing the sensitivity of ssiv to image resolution and video frame rate was assessed by evaluating ssiv performance using modified video the ffmpeg software ffmpeg 2017 was used to perform the pre processing in this study we took videos with 26 fps and downgraded them to 25 20 15 and 10 fps using the following ffmpeg command that simply removes video frames from the original video to achieve the defined downgraded video frame rate hence not creating artificial frames by for example image interpolation ffmpeg y i original video filename r 25 s output frame rate c v libx264 b v 3 m strict 2 movflags faststart output video filename the following ffmpeg command scale was used to decrease the video resolution it uses the constant rate factor crf rate control mode that aims at maintaining the video quality small video loss the video loss is controlled by the crf scale 0 51 where 0 is lossless and 51 is low quality to downgrade the video resolution in this study the crf value used was 17 which is considered to achieve visually lossless quality ffmpeg i original video filename c v libx264 preset slow crf 17 scale output video resolution 1 c a copy output video filename a2 analysis of distance between camera and flow surface the video resolution range applied to camera cam1 simulates a variation of the distance d between the camera and the flow surface of up to 51 m table a1 the virtual distance d between the camera and the flow surface plane was calculated using eq a 2 under the assumption that the video resolution r was constant and equal to 1280 720 pixels while varying the ground sampling distance the ground sampling distance for each video resolution gsd was calculated in a previous step using eq a 1 varying the video resolution while maintaining the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane d constant and equal to 4 8 m the virtual distances in table a1 are approximate values which are only accurate for the centre of the flow plane from which the distance d is measured a1 g s d d w f r where f is the camera focal length equal to 8 mm w is the camera sensor width equal to 8 4667 mm r is the downgraded video resolution d is the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane a2 d d r r where d is the virtual distance between the camera and the flow surface plane d is the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane and r and r are the real and downgraded video resolutions respectively based on the figures of table a1 and the theoretical limits of ssiv 1 pixel frame 1 it can be concluded that for velocities of 0 5 m s 1 and 25 fps video the minimum video resolution to produce meaningful ssiv results is around 256 144 pixels this result was confirmed in the analyses presented in this study 
7042,physically based models are important tools for evaluating the hydraulic behaviour of urban drainage systems and more specifically assessing flood risk while it is well known that such models should be calibrated and validated with monitoring data overland runoff information is seldom available for this purpose this study investigates the potential of using surveillance camera footage to measure surface flow velocity thanks to an lspiv based method called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv seven real scale experiments conducted in a specialized flood training facility were used to test the ssiv method under varied and challenging conditions ssiv performance was evaluated by benchmarking bulk mean velocity against that measured by a conventional sensor array in the best conditions tested ssiv and conventional flow sensors differed by only 1 7 0 1 standard deviation while the method proved sensitive to light conditions our results suggest that infrared lighting could be used to increase measurement consistency our study concludes that for measuring overland flow velocity in urban areas surveillance and traffic cameras can be considered as a low maintenance and easy to install alternative to conventional sensor systems keywords ssiv surface structure image velocimetry particle image velocimetry urban runoff flood monitoring 1 introduction 1 1 urban overland flow measurement challenges due to changes in climate continuously growing impervious areas due to urbanisation and the small return periods considered when designing sewer systems in many countries the hydraulic capacity of existing storm water drainage systems may no longer be sufficient leading to an increased likelihood of surface flooding as well as to more severe consequences united nations department of economic and social affairs 2014 hydraulic models are useful tools for simulating the hydraulic behaviour of drainage systems during moderate rainfall events but also and perhaps more interestingly during flood events urban drainage models need to be calibrated in order to provide results that accurately represent the real conditions however data to calibrate the overland flow part of drainage models are generally not available as they are difficult and risky to obtain conventional flow sensors i e those developed for measuring flow inside storm water sewers are not suitable for measuring overland runoff they are expensive to operate due to cleaning and repairing requirements yang and kang 2017 as most of these sensors would need to be in contact with the flow and would be exposed to all sorts of interactions with the public e g vandalism also ad hoc data collection during a flood event usually involves risks to field data collection workers e g muste et al 2008 the most commonly available data of overland flow are maximum water level marks resulting from flood events e g on building walls or other structures such as bridge pillars lo et al 2015 however these marks are only available after exceptional events i e floods by not providing the time at which the peak was reached the possibilities for model calibration are very limited and real time data assimilation is impossible in addition to water depth flow velocity is also key when estimating flood risk smith 2012 the lack of overland flow data can lead to erroneous results when the objective of the model is to accurately represent flow conditions in an urban area it is thus clear that novel non intrusive data sources are required hunter et al 2008 if flood characteristics such as water depth and flow velocity are to be accurately modelled 1 2 particle image velocimetry piv to measure flow velocity particle image velocimetry adrian 1991 is a non intrusive method for measuring flow velocity in laboratory conditions piv uses cross correlation methods on consecutive image frames of a known time interval to enable cross correlation the fluid is seeded with suspended tracer particles which are assumed to follow the flow paths a variant of piv known as large scale piv lspiv was proposed by fujita et al 1998 to measure flow velocity using tracers or reflections on the surface of the flow thus making it much more useful in real world applications lewis and rhoads 2015 such as hydrology some lspiv implementations were proposed to address some of the challenges found in the real world such as the absence of suspended particles or the difficulty of seeding the flow with artificial tracers benetazzo et al 2016 additionally light conditions cannot be controlled cameras can rarely be placed perpendicularly to the flow and video image quality is variable muste et al 2008 under the right conditions lspiv has been shown to provide reliable surface and bulk average flow velocities in the laboratory fujita et al 1998 observed errors of less than 5 between the lspiv and reference flow velocity measurements despite the relatively low resolution images used in two review articles muste et al 2008 2011 analysed the potential of lspiv for hydrology and hydraulic applications from the various studies they found that lspiv errors can go up to 3 5 and 16 in laboratory and field conditions respectively these two studies also point to future directions for the improvement of lspiv algorithms since its inception lspiv is being continuously improved e g to make the method more suitable for real time monitoring with small camera tilt angles and in absence of artificial tracers fujita and aya 2000 benetazzo et al 2016 the potential value of lspiv in the context of urban hydrology is well recognized a study by guillén et al 2017 investigates flood vulnerability taking into account the flood flow velocity measured with lspiv and flood depth extracted from the images collected by public observers from a practical point of view lspiv is well suited to the urban environment contactless measurement means that the sensor is safe from vehicles on the road and as for most image based measurement principles camera placement is flexible because most lspiv research focused on river hydrology there are only a few studies that have investigated the reliability of lspiv in the context of shallow water flows weitbrecht et al 2002 meselhe et al 2004 and muste et al 2014 found that in shallow water flow conditions mean velocities obtained using lspiv were accurate although the experiments were conducted in laboratory with controlled lighting and seeded flow when it comes to shallow and low velocity flows in an urban context only a single publication branisavljević and prodanović 2006 is known although the results were inconclusive and obtained using artificial tracers which is not transferable to city scale monitoring applications 1 3 leveraging alternative data sources to support lspiv based flow velocity measurement in urban areas in the past years a number of social and technological changes have taken place three of which could potentially support the need for urban flood monitoring data with the help of lspiv processing the most recent development is that of the use of unmanned aerial vehicles uavs which have become much more accessible over the past 5 10 years detert and weitbrecht 2015 investigated the potential of using low cost uavs a quadcopter in this case to estimate river flow characteristics based on lspiv the results they obtained were promising it is worth noting however that the experiment included adding artificial tracers to the river flow which improved the lspiv accuracy but at the same time can be considered as a limitation of the lspiv applicability in two other recent studies tauro et al 2015 2016 the applicability of combining lspiv methods and uavs to characterise flow velocities was investigated their findings show that for the tested conditions outdoor and fully controlled flow the lspiv velocity measurements are more similar to benchmark values than traditional lspiv platforms although some adjustments would need to be made the same concepts presented in tauro et al 2015 2016 studies can be explored to measure overland flow velocity in urban environments since the early 2000s social media platforms such as youtube facebook instagram and twitter have become a large resource of photos and videos some of which have the potential to be used for estimating urban overland flow needed for urban flood model calibration le boursicaud et al 2016 investigated the applicability of lspiv using data from youtube their study showed that videos available from youtube can be a good source of data as demonstrated in another study le coz et al 2016 the challenges of using these data sources to measure flow velocity using lspiv are primarily related to the constant camera movement during video recording other difficulties can result from inconsistencies in photo or video geo and time stamping which may create difficulties in applying these data in model calibration or real time urban drainage system operation the final and most mature development is the proliferation of surveillance cameras installed by government institutions and home or business owners in urban areas the surveillance cameras are mainly intended to ensure citizen safety and asset security and support road traffic management but can also be used to obtain overland flow information in a recent study lo et al 2015 successfully investigated the use of surveillance cameras to measure water levels in rivers and inform flood alert systems some of the advantages of considering surveillance cameras to measure overland flow in urban areas are i the number and location of existing cameras is known a priori so the installation of new cameras can be conducted in an optimal way to fulfil specific objectives ii the videos provided by these cameras are usually stable and have unique large viewing angles and iii because their locations are fixed the accurate calibration of the cameras becomes possible the downsides are that data are not necessarily easily accessible due to data protection legal reasons that some of the existing cameras are not necessarily located where flooding occurs in contrast with social media data and that frame rate of surveillance camera videos might be too low or have automatic frame rate sample selection based on image content or light conditions 1 4 objectives of the study we postulate that given reasonably placed surveillance cameras lspiv could provide valuable information on overland flow including during urban floods however before lspiv can be recommended for routine use with surveillance cameras in urban areas it is essential to understand the method s nominal operating conditions and accuracy as should be done for all novel sensing techniques tauro et al 2018 in the present study we use an improved lspiv based method called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv to elucidate the factors pertaining to successful lspiv implementation specifically for shallow flows over paved surfaces more specifically we present the results of a sensitivity analysis to assess how light conditions camera positioning video properties and water depth assumptions affect lspiv performance in the context of shallow urban runoff the analysis is based on video recordings from real scale flooding experiments which were monitored with a state of the art radar based flow sensor this study based on shallow water flow experiments is a good indication of the potential of lspiv for measuring flow velocity during flood events in urban areas as shallow flow conditions present additional challenges when compared to flows with larger water depths muste et al 2014 i e flow during flood events in comparison to previous studies investigating lspiv the present work is novel in the following ways shallow overland flow velocity is measured in absence of artificial tracers lspiv performance is evaluated under a variety of light conditions including infrared light for conducting night time measurements as well as for a variety of operating conditions and the cameras used in this study are regular surveillance cameras in opposition to lspiv dedicated cameras used in previous studies on lspiv applications to estimate flow velocity 2 ssiv method and flow velocity measurement in this work we use a flavour of lspiv called surface structure image velocimetry ssiv designed for operational uses while the overall measurement procedure is similar to that of lspiv ssiv introduces some improvements to mitigate the negative influence of two factors known to compromise lspiv performance muste et al 2008 i glare and shadows on the water surface and ii lack of traceable features in the flow with these improvements ssiv is exceptionally robust in challenging measurement situations in a previous study lüthi et al 2014 ssiv was integrated in a smartphone app discharge photrack et al 2018 to measure flow velocity and discharge hansen et al 2017 showed the good performance of ssiv in measuring flow velocity in a continuous manner in three different applications a 30 m wide river a channelled river and a channel in a wastewater treatment plant it must be noted that in hansen et al 2017 the water level is also measured by an image processing technique the ssiv measurement procedure is conducted on 5 second segments of video segment duration selected based on the authors experience with the method and consists of the following steps camera view calibration camera calibration requires the coordinates of at least six markers distributed over the camera view i e not clustered and the coordinates of the camera in order to determine the camera s external and internal parameters which involve angle and distance to flow plane focal length and radial distortion flexibility of the camera position is one of the advantages of image based measurements muste et al 2008 mentioned that 10 degrees is an acceptable limit for the camera tilt angle during calibration a local three dimensional reference system is defined in such a way that the first dimension x is in the principal direction of flow as determined by the geometry of the channel see fig 1 a flow surface structure filtering lspiv requires image processing adjustments to mitigate strong illumination and shadows on the water surface muste et al 2008 as well as artificial tracers or strong turbulence driven ripples boiling on the free surface muste et al 2011 the filter applied in ssiv mitigates these negative effects by filtering shadows and immovable objects like the river bottom in the video and enhances structures that are present on the free flow surface to filter out shadows and immovable obstacles and enhance the flow surface structures ssiv applies a simple image subtraction process in which the images are subtracted by an image created from a set of temporal averaged images image orthorectification lspiv methods are characterized by images covering large areas and by cameras located at narrow angles to the flow surface which makes it necessary to orthorectify the images this step also needs to be performed when using ssiv image cross correlation as in all piv based methods pixel displacement is calculated by applying a cross correlation technique to the interrogation windows on which the image is subdivided adrian 1991 fujita et al 1998 muste et al 2008 in this study interrogation windows of 32 64 pixels of size approximately 0 2 of the image size with a spacing between the window centres of 16x32 pixels were kept constant irrespective of the different video frame rates or resolutions tested this step results in a regular grid of pixel displacement vectors and is repeated for all consecutive image frames within each 5 second video segment surface velocity calculation to transform the pixel displacement into surface velocities the camera matrix derived from the camera calibration is used in the process of transforming the pixel displacement into surface velocities the assumed or measured water depth is taken into account this is relevant because if for example the water depth is over estimated i e assumed closer to the camera than it actually is the surface velocity will consequently be under estimated surface velocity filtering velocity vectors from the cross correlation can be erroneous because of wrong matching patterns many lspiv implementations follow the method proposed by fujita and kaizu 1995 to correct such erroneous vectors with ssiv the erroneous vectors are not corrected but rather filtered according to the flow conditions the filtering is performed in two steps the first step is a so called local filtering procedure where each velocity vector is compared with up to eight neighbours if the vector does deviate significantly in direction and magnitude from the eight neighbouring vectors then it is simply discarded i e no interpolation is carried out the second filtering step employs a so called global filtering each velocity vector is validated by checking if its magnitude and direction does not deviate significantly from the global mean after outlier removal each interrogation window will usually have many velocity vectors due to the 5 second analysis period so in each window a histogram is computed and the vector with the mode velocity value in the x direction is retained the result is a grid of velocity vectors representative of the 5 second period that can be visualised as in fig 1a bulk velocity calculation the x component of the flow velocity vectors from the previous step red points in fig 1b are then grouped by cross sectional position and used to fit a surface velocity profile blue line in fig 1b from this surface velocity profile there are two ways of computing the bulk flow velocity the first one is based on the classical flow velocity coefficient rantz et al 1982 for which a value of 0 85 is typically used the second one uses a roughness dependent mixing length model absi 2006 which is dependent on bottom roughness and water depth in this study the flow velocity coefficient 0 574 was used to calculate the bulk velocity 3 experiment description 3 1 objectives and design the objective of this study is to elucidate the factors influencing the performance of ssiv for shallow flows without tracers as would be expected in urban applications as indicated in section 2 ssiv operates on the principle of cross correlation of visual patterns created by water surface structure in consecutive video frames the success of the method therefore depends on the success of two intermediate steps surface pattern extraction and frame to frame pattern matching beyond the algorithmic implementation of pattern extraction and cross correlation the success of ssiv is also influenced by environmental and technical factors in this study we analyse the influence of i light conditions ii video frame rate iii camera positioning iv video resolution and v water depth assumptions in absence of measured data other factors such as water turbidity and flow turbulence for froude numbers higher than one standing waves or slowly moving waves can represent a problem on the other hand for low froude numbers not having enough surface patterns is also challenging may also affect the performance of ssiv but are not considered in this study to investigate the influence of the aforementioned factors we conducted a one at a time sensitivity analysis i e varying each factor while keeping the others constant the variations were made either by changing an experimental variable by degrading the video quality or by modifying the ssiv input table 1 3 1 1 light conditions the characteristics of the light source highly influence the visibility of water surface structures we tested the ssiv method with experiments conducted under a range of daytime and night time light conditions 3 1 2 video frame rate the video frame rate defines the time step from image to image between which surface displacement is estimated lower frame rates correspond to greater temporal differences between images which in the case of a moving scene translates into a worse correlation it can therefore be expected that for a given camera configuration and flow regime there is a minimum frame rate for which ssiv succeeds in the present study we test the ssiv method by varying video frame rate from 26 to 10 frames per second fps see appendix a1 3 1 3 camera positioning the position and angle of the camera relative to the flow is a determining factor for the visibility of structure on the surface of the water while flat viewing angles tend to increase the number of reflections the strength of the reflections can be decreased in the absence of a light source which can be reflected in this study we compare two very different camera perspectives that share a portion of their views both cameras have tilt angles significantly larger than the 10 degrees limit suggested by for example muste et al 2008 see fig 1 and table 4 3 1 4 video resolution the video resolution defines the level of detail from which patterns can be extracted a reduction of the image resolution is assumed to have a similar effect as increasing the distance of the camera to the flow or having a wider angle lens image distortions potentially created due to using wide angle cameras would not create issues for ssiv analysis as the distortions can be compensated during the image ortho rectification step in this study we compare seven different video resolutions from 1280 720 pixels to 120 68 pixels the video resolution was downgraded using the command presented in appendix a1 the variation in video resolution is analogous to varying the distance between camera and flow by a factor of 10 7 as presented in appendix a2 3 1 5 water depth assumptions as explained in section 2 the transformation from pixel s 1 to m s 1 depends on the distance between the camera and the flow plane and also the water depth however it is most likely that information about water depth will not be available when analysing videos recorded by a surveillance camera in the present study we evaluate the impact of assuming a fixed water depth of 2 cm 5 cm and 10 cm in the context of shallow flows on bulk velocity measurements using ssiv 3 2 surface flow experiments the data for this work 1 the data sets used in this study are freely available in a zenodo data repository https doi org 10 5281 zenodo 1256007 1 were collected in the floodx project moy de vitry et al 2017a all the data is open access and free of copyright in the floodx project large scale urban flash flood experiments were conducted in a facility operated by the swiss federal office for defence procurement armasuisse and specially designed for flood response training the facility is a paved 25x25 m area surrounded by concrete walls containing a small building and a configurable drainage network flood water can be fed into the facility via different pathways leading from a 450 m3 reservoir the floodx project is a stage for multiple investigations in urban flood metrology of which the evaluation of ssiv for urban surface flow is one the portion of the floodx setup relevant to the present study is described in the following paragraphs the experiment area mimics a street curb and consists of a channel 1 1 m wide by 4 6 m long bordered with a granite curb on one side and a wood lined sandbag wall on the other fig 1 upstream a shallow pond with an area of 7 8 m2 receives water from an overflowing manhole and a lateral channel the water flows out of the area and is funnelled into the experiment channel the experiment channel is slightly uneven in the area where velocity is measured the ground on the curb side is at first about 1 3 cm lower than on the sandbag side a bit further downstream the ground dips a bit and the sandbag side is about 0 5 cm lower than the curb side moy de vitry et al 2017b additionally the water used was completely transparent bereft of suspended or floating particles which provided a clear view of the channel bed the water purity increases the difficulty of detecting surface structure and creates a greater reliance on light reflections which are influenced by lighting conditions real flood water often has strong surface structures and or particles leading to higher flow velocity measurement accuracy as such the results presented in this section should be viewed as conservative estimates of ssiv performance in real world applications of the experiments conducted within floodx a selection of seven flood events was made for the present work table 2 these flood events were selected for the variety of light conditions and event sizes the maximum and mean froude numbers are very close to 1 critical flow this makes the evaluation of the accuracy of the ssiv flow velocity measurements for different light conditions independent of the experiment hydrograph 3 3 camera setup five consumer grade surveillance cameras of the same brand and model were installed at floodx two of which were selected for the present study fig 3 the technical specifications of the camera model and of the two cameras cam1 and cam2 installation characteristics are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively the location of cam1 and cam2 in relation to the flow channel are illustrated in fig 2 3 4 reference measurements reference flow bulk velocity and water depth measurements were collected with a radar based sensor and ultrasonic sensor respectively the specification of the sensors used to obtain reference flow velocity and water depth are presented in table 5 water depth is also used as a secondary input for ssiv to derive flow bulk velocity from flow surface velocity the area used for the radar based sensor was adjusted to be the same as the area used to measure flow surface velocity with ssiv the flow velocity measurements provided by the radar based sensor were used to compare the ssiv velocity measurements graphically and statistically for the statistics comparison the mean error eq 1 and the standard deviation sd of the error were computed by comparing the ssiv velocity and reference velocity measurements at each time interval 5 s in this case 1 me t 0 n v ssiv t v ref t n where vssiv t is the ssiv flow velocity vref t is the reference flow velocity and n is the time steps 4 results and discussion in this section the results of the analysis of the factors influencing ssiv performance are presented specifically we selected an experiment to use as a baseline experiment e1 camera cam1 and investigate how ssiv measurements are affected by light conditions section 4 1 video frame rate section 4 2 camera positioning section 4 3 video resolution section 4 4 and variation of the water depth assumptions section 4 5 in each case the results are compared to the reference measurements the reference measurement from the radar sensor corresponds to the bulk velocity derived from surface velocities and water level but the transformation method used has not been revealed by the manufacturer as mentioned in section 2 the flow velocity coefficient method implemented in ssiv was used with the coefficient equal to 0 574 obtained using a simple optimising tool available in excel solver the coefficient was kept constant for all experiments this value is lower than that normally used in riverine environments 0 78 0 93 according to muste et al 2008 however in small channels with shallow water flow flow velocity coefficient values of around 0 55 have been found to be representative of flow conditions e g genç et al 2015 besides the reference measurement a simple test was conducted to validate the accuracy of the surface velocity obtained with ssiv the velocity of a leaf floating in the water in experiment e1 was estimated by counting the number of video frames that it took to move between two known points the estimated velocity based on the leaf displacement was 0 97 m s 1 while the average ssiv velocity measurement for the same stretch was 1 0 m s 1 this clearly shows the accuracy of ssiv flow surface velocity measurements 4 1 influence of light conditions this section investigates the influence of various daytime and night time light conditions on the quality of the flow velocity measurements obtained using ssiv 4 1 1 daylight conditions direct light and overcast velocity measurements from ssiv are in overall agreement with the reference measurements especially for experiments e1 and e2 fig 4 in experiment e3 where lighting was diffuse due to overcast skies some temporary but systematic deviations from the reference can be observed and are caused by insufficient visibility of flow surface structure for which lighting is partly responsible this result shows that lighting conditions can have a significant impact on the detectability of surface structure and the derived velocity measurement in otherwise similar flow conditions in fig 4 the ssiv measurements appear to systematically start at a velocity of around 0 4 m s 1 this is because the flow enters the system abruptly like a wave as illustrated in fig 2 and the ssiv sampling frequency is not high enough to capture the velocity front figs 4 and 5 also suggest that there is a lower limit for which ssiv can measure flow velocity in this case around 0 1 m s 1 this threshold is linked to the absence of visible patterns on the water surface for low velocities and water depths since no tracers are used the low visibility of surface patterns is accentuated by water transparency as explained in the experiments description section 3 2 in table 6 the results of the statistical analysis show that the mean error between ssiv and reference measurements is lower than 20 which can be qualified as good the standard deviation of the errors is negligible for the three experiments 4 1 2 night artificial light conditions visible and infrared light as can be seen in fig 6 ssiv was not always able to generate velocity estimates during the night especially for experiments e4 e6 and e7 in all cases the measurement gaps usually occur when the flow velocity is much higher or lower than 0 5 m s 1 the measurement gaps that occur during lower flow velocities may be due to the limited visibility of surface structure at low flow regimes similarly to what was observed for the daytime experiments but aggravated by poor lighting and image quality of the night time footage on the other hand the measurement gaps that occur during higher velocities in experiment e7 are probably due to insufficient video framerate indeed the cameras used in this study automatically reduced their frame rate when recording in infrared mode the adjusted frame rate is encoded in the video metadata and was found to be a constant 13 fps over the duration of experiments e6 and e7 it is therefore possible that the peak in flow velocity of around 0 75 m s 1 results in a displacement that is too large to be detected with ssiv a way to overcome this difficulty would be to adjust the size of the interrogation windows based on video frame rate however as described in section 2 this was not the case in this study nevertheless when ssiv is able to produce a signal the values are usually in agreement with the reference measurements for both visible and infrared light from the scatterplots in fig 7 ssiv appears to slightly underestimate flow velocity both with visible and infrared light this could be linked to the poor documentation of the frame rate by the camera although further experiments are needed for confirmation fig 7 also suggests a lower limit around 0 4 m s 1 below which ssiv provides only few and often wrong measurements in the case of visible light this limit combined with the fact that the actual velocity was often around 0 5 m s 1 causes the scatterplots to look artificially clustered the statistical analysis presented in table 7 confirms that when ssiv is able to generate a velocity estimate the agreement with reference measurements is fair and the mean of the residuals is below 10 the mean and standard deviation for experiment e6 are particularly good and suggest that infrared light 850 nm wavelenght conditions could be a promising means of obtaining good results at night in conclusion light conditions have a significant impact on ssiv performance as could be expected daytime light conditions are most favourable although the specific type of light still impacts results at night ssiv works surprisingly well given the poor lighting and image quality of the experiments in particular infrared lighting shows promise for future applications 4 2 influence of video frame rate to isolate the possible effect of low frame rate observed in the night time footage in the previous section footage from camera cam1 in experiment e1 was downgraded via video processing as explained in section 3 1 and appendix a1 as can be seen in fig 8 decreasing the frame rate is indeed detrimental to ssiv performance in fact the measurements obtained with frame rates of 15 and 10 fps would not be usable in practice since ssiv fails to process large portions of the time series ssiv only succeeds for six data points at 10 fps this failure was also observed for night time experiments e4 and e6 and is probably due to strong visual differences and lack of correspondence between frames another impact of lowering the frame rate is that the level of noise in the ssiv measurement appears to increase as is especially evident between 25 and 20 fps the statistical analysis results presented in table 8 should be taken in perspective despite the small and similar mean error values obtained for the 10 fps video when compared to the values of the other videos the analysis is not significant in this specific case because only six points with ssiv velocity were available in conclusion videos with frame rates as low as 20 fps can still provide complete and meaningful flow velocity information although a slight noise increase can be expected 4 3 influence of camera perspective from experiment e1 in fig 9 the change in camera perspective appears to change ssiv performance completely while the signal appears to coincide with the reference measurement at the very beginning the correlation rapidly disintegrates and the rest of the ssiv signal appears random additionally the noise level is much higher than for previous measurements as reflected in the high relative standard deviation of the residuals in table 9 the situation in experiment e4 however is more moderate there is little difference between the results of camera cam1 and cam2 according to previous studies camera tilt angle is one factor determining the accuracy of piv based flow velocity measurements for example kim et al 2008 recommend a minimum limit of 10 degrees however since the tilting angle of camera cam2 is far above this limit we assume that the tilting angle in itself does not play a significant role in the experiment unfortunately the data obtained during the experiments do not include videos with cameras at the same or a very similar locations but with different tilting angles so it is not possible to make a definite conclusion in this respect another difference between the two camera positioning is their distance from the flow camera cam1 is 3 2 m away from the flow location whereas camera cam2 is 9 7 m away this difference translates directly to differences in the effective ground sampling distance a factor that is explored in section 4 4 as mentioned above experiment e4 shows that location itself does not fully determine ssiv measurement quality this discrepancy is also visible in the statistical analysis presented in table 9 and again suggests that light conditions could be the major driving factor for ssiv success 4 4 influence of video resolution as discussed earlier in section 3 1 artificially downgrading the video resolution can be related to the distance between the camera and the flow plane see appendix a2 which consequently can be translated into changing image ground sampling distance this means that the results described here for the video resolution can also be discussed in terms of ground sampling distance see table a1 in appendix 2 for the correspondence as can be seen in the plots of fig 10 a and b a progressive decrease of video resolution down to 256 144 pixels hardly affects the ssiv flow velocity measurements for the video resolution of 160 90 pixels the signal becomes much noisier and the correlation is less strong at 120 68 pixels the ssiv measurement is practically meaningless for a video resolution of 160 90 pixels distances around 38 m see appendix a2 ssiv still seems to produce meaningful results the mean error is less than 0 1 m s 1 however the mean error is already around 10 times higher than the one obtained using the original video for 120 68 pixels i e a camera located at approximately 51 m from the flow plane see appendix a2 the mean error increased significantly to almost 0 4 m s 1 this less accurate velocity measurements can be explained by a smaller number of interrogation windows used in this study the size of the interrogation windows remained unchanged 32 64 pixel for all experiments another factor which was also not considered in the present study is the dimensions of visible structures on the flow surface when these structures are large they are also more visible from afar and should therefore have a positive impact on the ssiv measurements based on these results it seems to be possible to achieve meaningful ssiv flow velocity measurements with hd cameras minimum of 1280 720 pixels by definition located at a maximum of 25 m from the flow plane of course other factors discussed in the previous sections such as light conditions and video frame rate also seem to influence the quality of ssiv measurements table 10 4 5 influence of water depth assumptions as mentioned in section 2 when transforming the velocity from pixel frame 1 to m s 1 it is necessary to define the horizontal plane of the velocity which depends on the water level in order to evaluate the error committed by assuming a fixed water depth footage for experiment e1 from camera cam1 was processed three times with a fixed water depth of 2 5 and 10 cm in fig 11 the three time series are plotted alongside the ssiv measurement obtained with real time varying water depth and the reference measurement the fixed water depth assumption adds a bias to measurement depending on whether the assumed value is above or below the true mean water depth of 2 9 cm from this set of ssiv runs it can be concluded that as expected water depth has limited impact on flow velocity measurements from the statistical analysis of residuals table 11 it can be concluded that the error mean and standard deviation of the errors between ssiv and reference flow velocity measurements is approximately constant this conclusion is valid and can be explained by the small ration between the flow depth and the distance between the camera and the flow surface in the case of shallow water flow 5 conclusions the findings obtained suggest that with ssiv even consumer grade surveillance cameras can provide reliable velocity measurements for shallow urban overland runoff with such an approach we could circumvent the need for installing dedicated flow sensors and possibly make use of existing surveillance infrastructure to gather data in a cost efficient and highly scalable manner this new source of data would not only bring much needed information for drainage model development but also provide rare insights into the phenomenon of shallow overland flow it is important to note that ssiv in absence of water level information provides flow velocity and not discharge such water level information can be obtained from a dedicated sensor or via image analysis though the task is non trivial in complex urban environments the findings also exposed some critical features of surveillance camera based flow velocity measurement which must be taken into consideration when applying ssiv in practice overall the visibility of structure on the water surface is the most influential factor determining ssiv accuracy we found that structure visibility depends not only on lighting conditions but also on the relative position of the camera to the flow and the presence of objects that affect light reflection on the water therefore the use of artificial light sources such as the ones tested in our experiments should be considered a means of obtaining consistent results in practice frame rate is another parameter critical to ssiv success we found that below 20 frames per second measurements became intermittent in terms of measurement range ssiv was not capable of reliably measuring velocities lower than 0 1 m s 1 during the day and 0 5 m s 1 at night in our experiments which was partially due to the high transparency of the water used nevertheless ssiv provides robust measurements for images with a resolution as low as 256 144 pixels the cameras used in this study used a lossy compression standard that reduces video quality to optimize file size but which can negatively impact the ssiv velocity measurements while the effect of video compression was not evaluated in this study this potential issue is easily resolved by using cameras that encode footage with a lossless video format it is worth noting that the flow regimes of the seven flood experiments were always near critical froude numbers in average slightly below one because of this the challenges created by strong sub critical not enough surface patterns or super critical standing waves flows were not present and therefore not investigated in this study this work demonstrates not only the potential of ssiv for measuring urban runoff but also the substantial influence of environmental factors on ssiv performance in a next step the positive results obtained in this study should be validated with videos captured by surveillance cameras installed in real urban environments i e in city locations where flooding has occurred future studies should also investigate how factors such as rainfall disturbances from moving vehicles and complex surface geometries affect ssiv performance acknowledgements this work was supported by the swiss national science foundation snf grant number 169630 calibration of coupled urban flood models with experimental surface runoff data calico appendix a video processing and camera distance analysis a1 video processing the sensitivity of ssiv to image resolution and video frame rate was assessed by evaluating ssiv performance using modified video the ffmpeg software ffmpeg 2017 was used to perform the pre processing in this study we took videos with 26 fps and downgraded them to 25 20 15 and 10 fps using the following ffmpeg command that simply removes video frames from the original video to achieve the defined downgraded video frame rate hence not creating artificial frames by for example image interpolation ffmpeg y i original video filename r 25 s output frame rate c v libx264 b v 3 m strict 2 movflags faststart output video

the video loss is controlled by the crf scale 0 51 where 0 is lossless and 51 is low quality to downgrade the video resolution in this study the crf value used was 17 which is considered to achieve visually lossless quality ffmpeg i original video filename c v libx264 preset slow crf 17 scale output video resolution 1 c a copy output video filename a2 analysis of distance between camera and flow surface the video resolution range applied to camera cam1 simulates a variation of the distance d between the camera and the flow surface of up to 51 m table a1 the virtual distance d between the camera and the flow surface plane was calculated using eq a 2 under the assumption that the video resolution r was constant and equal to 1280 720 pixels while varying the ground sampling distance the ground sampling distance for each video resolution gsd was calculated in a previous step using eq a 1 varying the video resolution while maintaining the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane d constant and equal to 4 8 m the virtual distances in table a1 are approximate values which are only accurate for the centre of the flow plane from which the distance d is measured a1 g s d d w f r where f is the camera focal length equal to 8 mm w is the camera sensor width equal to 8 4667 mm r is the downgraded video resolution d is the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane a2 d d r r where d is the virtual distance between the camera and the flow surface plane d is the distance between the camera and the flow surface plane and r and r are the real and downgraded video resolutions respectively based on the figures of table a1 and the theoretical limits of ssiv 1 pixel frame 1 it can be concluded that for velocities of 0 5 m s 1 and 25 fps video the minimum video resolution to produce meaningful ssiv results is around 256 144 pixels this result was confirmed in the analyses presented in this study 
7043,the aqueous geochemistry of the st peter sandstone a major aquifer in the illinois basin an intracratonic sedimentary basin is extremely complex there are multiple sources of water including in situ remnant brines leakage from overlying and underlying units and recharge during both the pleistocene and holocene epochs in our study region recharge to the st peter sandstone has come from multiple locations and structural features primarily the lasalle anticlinal belt but also possibly the sandwich fault zone are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow in the northern part of the study region holocene recharge has displaced most of the pleistocene recharge but in the rest of the study region considerable amounts of pleistocene recharge still exist the ion chemistry in the st peter sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of pleistocene recharge and in situ brines and the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry is leakage of fluids from overlying formations via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances the water chemistry in the western region of our study area is clearly different from the central and eastern regions having a more pronounced signature of pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge the large concentrations of so4 2 and relatively high δ34s values in the western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and or gypsum possibly from mississippian evaporite deposits in iowa keywords st peter sandstone illinois basin pleistocene recharge brines 1 introduction intracratonic sedimentary basins which are found on every continent have long been of interest because they can contain economic deposits of petroleum coal and metal ores and also major aquifer systems glaciation during the pleistocene epoch profoundly affected the near surface geology and hydrogeology in the northern latitudes of the world including many intracratonic basins in north america and europe continental ice sheets reached thicknesses of a kilometer or more compressing underlying rock units and altering groundwater flow directions recharge to underlying formations occurred via subglacial meltwater as well as during glacial retreats when large amounts of meltwater were available to recharge sedimentary units to great depths mcintosh and walter 2005 siegel and mandle 1984 van geldern et al 2014 lemieux and sudicky 2010 calculated that subglacial meltwater recharge during the wisconsin glacial episode 85 000 11 000 years bp may have reached depths of up to 3 km in addition to recharging units at natural recharge zones e g where permeable units outcrop or subcrop there is evidence that meltwater was forced through less permeable units as well e g mcintosh et al 2002 as meteoric waters recharged the paleozoic strata during the pleistocene they often encountered in situ fossil brines the illinois basin located in the midwestern u s is an elliptical shaped structurally controlled basin with its long axis trending north south fig 1 filled with paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks several units within the basin primarily sandstones of cambrian ordovician age are important aquifers in northern illinois where their recharge zones are at or near land surface depths of these sandstone units increase towards the center of the illinois basin located in southern illinois the sandstone units also become thicker and their groundwater salinity increases substantially from north to south larson and herzog 2010 however the uppermost sandstone the ordovician st peter formation remains a potable aquifer well into the central part of the state and many communities rely upon it as their drinking water source understanding recharge into and flow within the aquifer is important to developing protecting and managing it in previous studies of formations in the illinois basin researchers have observed evidence of complex interactions among various water sources as a result of continental glaciation mcintosh et al 2002 suggested that meteoric water invaded the devonian new albany shale in the eastern part of the illinois basin through fractures that may have provided recharge pathways stueber and walter 1991 came to a similar conclusion for silurian devonian shale units elsewhere in the illinois basin siegel and begor 1990 reported evidence that pleistocene meltwater recharged through the ordovician maquoketa shale in southern wisconsin not all units were necessarily recharged to the same extent with pleistocene meltwater mcintosh et al 2002 for example determined that fluids in mississippian units were considerably more saline than the underlying silurian devonian aquifers in their study area as meltwater encountered the in situ brines one would expect that a number of different physicochemical processes would have ensued including simple mixing density gradients affecting flow and enhanced water rock interactions as glaciers advanced and retreated across the landscape for 1 8 million years during the pleistocene there were numerous changes in hydraulic gradients recharge locations and rates and aqueous geochemistry the current geochemical conditions within the illinois basin are the product of these complex interactions in this investigation our objective was to reconstruct paleo hydrogeological conditions in the st peter sandstone in the central part of illinois using a geochemical dataset specific objectives included determining how far pleistocene recharge penetrated into the st peter formation what the source s of remnant salinity is and how structural features have controlled recharge and flow there have been no systematic hydrogeological studies of the st peter formation and surrounding units in this region and as a result the influence of structural features on groundwater flow in the paleozoic strata in this region is poorly known 2 study area this study is focused on the st peter sandstone in north central illinois covering 12 counties bureau fulton henry knox lasalle livingston marshall mclean peoria putnam stark woodford an area of approximately 20 000 km2 fig 1 the geology of the illinois basin has been summarized by collinson et al 1988 and kolata and nelson 2010 the illinois basin occupies most of the state of illinois as well as parts of the surrounding states of indiana kentucky and tennessee the basin is filled with cambrian through pennsylvanian marine sedimentary rocks lying atop precambrian crystalline basement rock fig 2 cambrian and ordovician age rocks are predominantly sandstones silurian through mississippian age rocks are predominantly carbonates and pennsylvanian age rocks are shales sandstones and coal measures the basin is at least 6400 m deep at its deepest point in western kentucky hickman 2013 siegel 1989 summarized the hydrogeological setting of the northern midwestern u s including the illinois basin the ordovician st peter and the cambrian ironton galesville sandstones are important aquifers in the northern part of illinois and also in parts of wisconsin iowa and minnesota wilson 2011 units on the southern side of the paleozoic aged sandwich fault zone are uplifted relative to the northern side and the st peter sandstone is at or near the land surface in lasalle county and is hydrostatically connected to the illinois river figs 1 and 2 siegel 1989 suggested that water discharged from the st peter sandstone in northern lasalle county during the wisconsin glacial episode during glacial advances but became a recharge zone when glaciers retreated the lasalle anticlinal belt is a dominant structural feature in the central part of the illinois basin figs 1 and 2 it is a complex structure of en echelon folds asymmetrical anticlines domes monoclines and synclines stretching from near the wisconsin border in northwestern illinois through lawrence county in southeastern illinois near vincennes in a distance of over 400 km nelson 1995 there are faults associated with the structure and hamburger and rupp 1988 concluded that slippage along the fault s of the anticlinorium was the cause of an earthquake in southeastern illinois in july 1987 in the study area the major structural feature within the lasalle anticlinal belt is the peru monocline which has displaced units younger than the upper pennsylvanian including the st peter sandstone with strata present at much deeper depths along the western flank relative to the eastern area kay and bailey 2016 nelson 1995 in the central and southern parts of the illinois basin groundwater in paleozoic strata is highly saline and thus groundwater producing units are not used as aquifers silurian and devonian aged brines have been characterized as seawater evaporated short of the precipitation of halite kesler et al 1995 stueber et al 1987 stueber and walter 1991 stueber and walter 1994 stueber et al 1993 walter et al 1990 salinity of ordovician brines probably resulted from evaporation of seawater to a point slightly below halite precipitation stueber and walter 1994 cambrian brines of the mount simon formation constitute a fossil brine whose chemical composition has changed little since deposition of the formation labotka et al 2016 however groundwater within the overlying sandstones of the cambrian ironton galesville formation showed evidence of mixing with freshwater recharge and brines within the overlying strata panno et al 2013 in general groundwater flows toward the center of the illinois basin becoming more sluggish and mineralized as it deepens and discharges as upward leakage across confining units cartwright 1970 panno et al 1994 siegel 1989 there is evidence of upward movement of groundwater and gas along fractures associated with geologic structures in the basin including the lasalle anticlinal belt cartwright 1970 peterson et al 2015 parts of illinois were covered by continental glaciers multiple times during the pleistocene epoch curry et al 2010 hansel and mckay 2010 during the final episode of the pleistocene the wisconsin glacial episode about half of our study area was covered at the maximum extent of glaciation piskin and bergstrom 1975 fig 1 prior to pleistocene glaciation groundwater presumably flowed south toward the center of the illinois basin cartwright 1970 siegel 1989 and perhaps for some units to the basin s southern margins panno et al 2018 during glacial maximums hydraulic gradients were flattened out by the isostatic pressure resulting from the glaciers potentially altering groundwater flow paths person et al 2007 during glacial retreats there would have been abundant meltwater to recharge the subsurface and it is likely there were major recharge periods following both the illinois and wisconsin glacial episodes for example glacial lakes released reoccurring torrential floods about 19 000 years b p with subsequent phases continuing to 13 000 years b p curry et al 2014 siegel and mandle 1984 and siegel 1989 used water chemistry data including the stable isotopes of water to suggest that the flow direction in ordovician aquifers in iowa was perpendicular to the present gradient relatively dilute fresh water would have entered the paleozoic strata displacing and mixing with the in situ water previous studies and sampling indicate elevated levels of total dissolved solids tds in most of the paleozoic units so it is likely that there are at least two end members to consider pleistocene recharge and in situ formation waters with high tds values other potential sources of water are leakage from overlying stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 or underlying units panno et al 2018 glaciers retreated at the end of the pleistocene epoch approximately 11 000 years ago and presumably any direct effects of glacial meltwaters on groundwater flow paths were eliminated the predevelopment potentiometric surface within our study area indicates flow direction from the north and northwest with local discharge in central lasalle county along the illinois river where the st peter sandstone is at the surface siegel 1989 abrams et al 2015 the current major flow path in the illinois basin in illinois is in a southerly southeasterly direction however large withdrawals in the chicago region from the st peter ironton galesville and mt simon sandstones over the past 150 years have changed flow directions in northeastern illinois groundwater within the eastern part of the study area now flows northwest towards the large cone of depression centered north of the sandwich fault zone abrams et al 2015 3 sampling and analysis sampling was designed to help understand sources of recharge and flow into and through the st peter formation the primary function for inorganic chemical analyses were to use ion ratios and trace elements to help determine sources of in situ brines as well as recharge stable isotopes of water were analyzed to help determine the penetration of cold pleistocene waters into the formation the stable isotopes of s were used to help determine sources of sulfate so4 2 and the extent of so4 2 reduction and sr isotopes were used to help determine sources of salinity a total of 32 samples were collected from wells finished in the st peter sandstone fig 3 many of the wells are open to other units above and below the st peter sandstone but the st peter sandstone is considered to be the most transmissive unit in this region thirty one samples came from existing wells and included 26 community supply wells three industrial wells one state park well and one domestic well a drill stem water sample from the st peter sandstone was collected by researchers at the illinois state geological survey isgs in september 2015 from a well drilled for the industrial carbon capture and sequestration iccs demonstration project near decatur well 33 we expanded our data set by using data previously collected from wells open to the st peter sandstone these included 1 major ion fluoride iron manganese ammonium and strontium data from 44 samples

significance was determined at the p 0 05 level 4 results 4 1 sample grouping there were significant spatial differences in aqueous geochemistry for the sampled wells table 1 the criteria for grouping the different wells will be discussed below but to assist the reader the groups are listed here fig 3 1 modern recharge region in northern lasalle county wells 26 27 28 and 32 plus 18 iepa samples 2 western region wells 11 12 13 14 18 19 20 22 23 and 31 plus 11 iepa samples 3 central region wells 1 2 3 5 6 15 16 17 24 and 25 plus 10 iepa samples 4 eastern region wells 7 8 9 10 29 and 30 plus 5 iepa samples two samples were geochemically distinct and did not fit into any of the above groups well 4 which was the only sampled well open to silurian units overlying the st peter sandstone and the iccs drill stem sample well 33 south of the study area 4 2 tds and major ions tds values were lowest in wells in the recharge region of northern lasalle county median 378 mg l significantly lower compared to the other groups western wells generally had the highest tds values median 1583 mg l the median value for the eastern wells was 1180 mg l the median tds values for the central wells was 979 mg l significantly lower than the western wells the central wells can be further subdivided based on location with tds values lower in the seven northernmost wells median 749 mg l compared to the 13 southernmost wells median 1215 mg l we did not observe north south differences in the other groups the highest tds value was in well 33 the iccs sample 4854 mg l the major ion character in the recharge well samples was markedly different from the other groups table 1 fig 4 here the waters were ca mg hco3 type with three of the wells having 20 40 so4 2 of the total anions for the other three groups the cations were dominated by na between 50 and 90 there is a linear trend line for the cations with na k replacing ca and mg in the more saline waters there were no major differences in the cation distribution among the western central and eastern wells although the western wells generally had higher na k than the central or eastern wells the median ca mg molar ratio for the recharge western and central well samples was approximately 1 5 suggesting calcite was the primary source for ca the calcite saturation index for most of the western and central samples was within 0 2 of saturation most of the recharge well samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite for the eastern wells the median ca mg molar ratio was approximately 1 1 suggesting dolomite dissolution as the primary source for these ions the anions were more complex most of the wells apart from the recharge region were dominated by cl but most wells had a large amount of sulfate especially the western wells which seemed to be following a different trend from the other two groups chloride concentrations were by far the lowest in recharge region wells median 4 0 mg l the highest cl concentrations were in eastern wells median 435 mg l and were lower in central median 281 mg l and western wells median 279 mg l sulfate concentrations were by far the highest in western wells median 372 mg l significantly greater compared to the other regions as with tds there was a difference in so4 2 concentrations between north and south in the central region with northernmost wells having lower so4 2 median 119 mg l compared to the southernmost wells median 188 mg l panno et al 2013 used various ion weight ratios cl br na br k cl and cl concentrations to discriminate among the ages of different brines in the illinois basin there is evidence that cl br ratios of brines reflect the ratios of the original seawater present during deposition of the formations e g labotka et al 2016 and post depositional water rock interactions as such ratios of these ions have been used to identify the age of the formation from which brines originate and thus can be used to identify intrusion of brines into the st peter sandstone from formations of different ages for the most part the samples in the western central and eastern wells had ion ratios in excess of ordovician age brines most of the samples had cl br ratios greater than the average ordovician age brine ratio 2 5 7 reported in panno et al 2013 original data from stueber and walter 1994 with three of the western wells having values greater than the largest cl br ratio they reported most na br and k cl ratios were also higher than reported for ordovician brines all of our samples had na br ratios greater than 220 which is greater than the highest value 2 0 2 reported by panno et al 2013 the western wells had the highest na br ratios with a median of 530 ordovician brines have k cl values of 0 012 and most of our samples had k cl 0 020 well 4 open to the silurian had the lowest k cl value of 0 008 similar to the value reported for silurian devonian brines 0 010 original data from keller 1983 wells 19 and 20 also had the lowest k cl values 0 014 and 0 020 these are the two southernmost wells in the western region 4 3 minor ions doc and gases for wells in the western central and eastern regions several minor ions had concentrations higher than typically found in illinois groundwater these included strontium fluoride bromide boron barium and lithium tables 1 and 2 lithium was significantly higher in the western wells 0 14 0 31 mg l than the other regions but well below the concentration in the iccs drill stem sample well 33 0 87 mg l chapelle et al 2009 developed a method to determine the dominant redox processes in a water sample using concentrations of major redox sensitive species o2 no3 mn2 fe2 so4 2 and h2s based on their criteria fe iii and to a lesser extent mn iv reduction dominated in the recharge wells while mixed fe iii and so4 2 reduction dominated in almost all the wells in the other regions the presence of ch4 in all samples further indicated the existence of mixed redox conditions while mixed redox conditions are possible over small distances the long open intervals for the wells sampled in this study may also allow for mixing of waters with distinct redox signatures redox conditions were different in the eastern wells compared to the other regions with so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis dominating over fe iii reduction five of the 10 wells that had detectable h2s were in the eastern region and they had the five highest concentrations 1 5 8 5 mg l methane concentrations also tended to be highest in the eastern wells median 0 135 mg l doc concentrations were very low in samples from the western central and eastern wells in most cases below detection 0 31 mg l doc in modern recharge well samples ranged from 0 42 to 1 55 mg l 4 4 stable isotopes all of the samples plotted along the global mean water line gmwl indicating little to no evaporation or other fractionation processes associated with long term water rock reactions fig 5 almost all the samples had δ18o and δ2h values that were low compared to modern recharge the highest values i e closest to modern recharge were found in the modern recharge wells and the western wells had the lowest values of δ18o and δ2h fig 6 these low values indicate much cooler temperatures of recharge than present day the values for the eastern wells were slightly lower than the modern recharge well values while values for the central wells fell between the eastern and western values for the sulfate isotopes the modern recharge wells were again distinctly different from the other groups they had by far the lowest values median δ34s 3 57 median δ18oso4 0 07 the samples from the western central and eastern wells had δ34s values ranging from 15 9 to 37 7 with the highest values in the eastern wells median 26 62 the δ18oso4 values were similar for the western central and eastern wells with median values between 13 26 and 14 94 87sr 86sr values ranged between 0 70928 and 0 71058 these values are all greater than what would be expected from ordovician seawater values which were 0 7090 burke et al 1982 veizer 1989 our values for the most part plot in the upper range of values reported by stueber and walter 1994 for samples collected from the ordovician galena carbonate formation south of our study area 5 discussion 5 1 pleistocene recharge as glaciers ebbed and flowed during the pleistocene epoch hydrogeological conditions in the illinois basin changed drastically the pressure exerted by the overlying ice varied and the amount of available water for recharge fluctuated altering groundwater flow directions when glaciers retreated at the end of the pleistocene epoch about 11 000 years ago large volumes of fresh meltwater would have been produced as the isostatic pressure was being released much of this water was recharged to the st peter sandstone and other bedrock units in the illinois basin siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 1994 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 this relatively dilute recharge would have displaced or mixed with the in situ water because the in situ water would have had high tds values it is also possible that there would have been density controlled flow with the pleistocene recharge perched on top because almost all of the wells sampled in this study were open to the entire st peter sandstone and in some cases other units samples represent a mixture of the entire water column and thus any density stratification that might still remain would have been obscured we might expect such density gradients to persist for a long time isotopically depleted δ18o and δ2h values that are indicative of a component of colder water i e pleistocene recharge e g siegel and mandle 1984 mcintosh and walter 2006 were found in the st peter sandstone throughout our study area figs 5 and 6 even the iccs sample well 33 in the extreme southern part of our study area had depleted δ18o and δ2h values the fact that all sample data plot very close to the gmwl fig 5 indicates that little or no evaporation occurred prior to recharge which would be expected in a cool climate and also that subsequent rock water interactions have not appreciably altered δ18o or δ2h values the very low values in the western wells are indicative of the coldest water in the study area the higher values in the eastern and northern component of the central wells figs 5 and 6 suggest either less pleistocene recharge compared to the western and southern central wells or more likely more recent recharge passing through the st peter sandstone and displacing much of the altered pleistocene recharge the recharge well samples have a distinct water chemistry signature compared to the other wells indicating much younger waters and shorter flowpaths the relatively high δ18o and δ2h values close to modern values indicate that most of the pleistocene recharge has already passed through and been replaced by modern recharge in addition low concentrations of tds na cl and many minor constituents and the relatively high concentrations of doc ca and mg the presence of nitrate in one of the samples and undersaturation with respect to calcite all suggest a shorter residence time within the aquifer than the other samples the st peter sandstone subcrops at the bedrock surface in northern lasalle county where it is directly overlain by glacial deposits in central lasalle county it is exposed along the illinois river figs 1 and 2 at present day groundwater in the st peter sandstone flows from northern lasalle county and discharges to the illinois river where it is hydraulically connected and thus provides for shorter flowpaths and residence times in comparison to the western central and eastern wells kelly et al 2016 one notable difference between the western region compared to the central and eastern regions is that the western region was for the most part not covered by glaciers during the wisconsin glacial episode fig 1 thus the geologic formations in the western region would not have been subjected to the flexural stresses imposed by overlying ice during the wisconsin episode whereas the central and eastern regions were more likely to have been impacted 5 2 in situ brines sources and mixing in order to shed light on the sources and mixing between in situ brines and pleistocene recharge we assessed trends for a number of ions ion ratios and stable isotopic data the in situ brines in the illinois basin have markedly different water chemistries compared to pleistocene recharge including extremely high tds values for example samples of st peter formation brines collected by meents et al 1952 south of our study area deeper into the illinois basin had cl concentrations as high as 94 000 mg l with a median value of approximately 49 000 mg l n 10 the water isotopes of the in situ brines also differ from pleistocene meltwater clayton et al 1966 and stueber and walter 1991 reported δ2h and δ18o values in samples from illinois basin brines including ordovician formation waters galena formation in the southern part of the illinois basin that deviate from the gmwl stueber and walter 1994 interpreted this deviation as being due to subaerial evaporation of seawater the fact that our samples do not deviate from the gmwl suggests that the pleistocene meltwater dominates volumetrically in the st peter formation in our study area the ion data however do indicate a brine component in the st peter sandstone because solute concentrations are so much greater in the basin brines even a small volume of brine would have a major impact on solute concentrations and ion ratios in the aquifer chloride and br which are highly elevated in the in situ brines with respect to pleistocene meltwater are conservative ions that can be used to estimate the amount of mixing between in situ water and pleistocene recharge pleistocene meltwater and basin brines within the st peter sandstone can be considered as two end members pleistocene meltwater would have had very low cl and br concentrations similar to that of pristine inland rainwater 0 5 mg l cl and 0 006 mg l br nadp 2018 with a cl br ratio of about 50 panno et al 2006 ordovician basin brines have very high concentrations of cl tens of thousands of mg l and br 25 to 400 mg l with an average cl br ratio of approximately 250 keller 1983 stueber and walter 1994 in order to estimate the percentage of pleistocene meltwater in our samples we used the following equation adapted from mcintosh and walter 2005 p l e i s t o c e n e w a t e r 100 br sample br brine e n d m e m b e r 100 we used 10 mg l as the concentration of the brine end member the approximate value for the iccs sample 33 using a brine end member of 100 mg l results in all of the samples being at least 98 pleistocene even if we use the iccs sample 33 as the end member 10 mg l pleistocene water is still calculated to be at least 80 in all samples if mixing between these two end members is the dominant mechanism controlling the present day water chemistry a positive correlation between δ18o values and cl and br concentrations might be expected assuming that the lower the δ18o value the greater the fraction of pleistocene recharge stueber and walter 1994 reported a positive correlation between δ18o and cl for ordovician galena formation samples in the southwestern part of the illinois basin in our samples from western wells positive relationships were observed between δ18o and both br fig 7 and cl however there was no obvious relationship for the eastern wells and the central wells seem to have a negative relationship the opposite of what would be expected if this was simple mixing there thus appear to be processes other than simple mixing between pleistocene recharge and in situ brines that are affecting the geochemistry in the central and eastern regions there may be additional sources of water such as leakage from overlying and or underlying units previous studies in the illinois basin have indicated pleistocene flow through overlying silurian and devonian units albeit to a lesser extent than what is seen in the st peter sandstone stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 in at least one part of our study area in the vicinity of the illinois river evidence has been reported for discharge of saline groundwater from deeper cambrian units into the st peter sandstone panno et al 2018 ion ratios cl br na br and k cl as weight weight have been used to distinguish among different aged brines in sedimentary basins including the illinois basin panno et al 2013 the median cl br in samples from the western central and eastern wells was 312 within the range 148 366 of ordovician brine samples galena fm reported by stueber and walter 1994 however most of our samples had values greater than the average 2 5 7 and three of the western wells had ratios greater than the maximum value reported by stueber and walter 1994 suggesting a source s of water with higher cl br ratios than found in the in situ brines fig 8 the median na br and k cl ratios for the western central and eastern wells 289 and 0 040 respectively were appreciably higher than values published by stueber and walter 1994 and keller 1983 again suggesting input of water with higher na br and k cl values than in illinois basin brines cl br and na br ratios in general decrease with increasing depth in the illinois basin i e younger units have higher ratios with the highest values in pennsylvanian clastic rocks panno et al 2013 walter et al 1990 most of the wells in the central and eastern regions had na br ratios that fall within the range of values reported for the pennsylvanian however all but two of the western wells exceeded the maximum value found in the pennsylvanian rocks on the other hand k cl ratios generally increase with depth in the illinois basin with highest values in cambrian strata 0 014 0 017 panno et al 2013 almost all our samples had k cl 0 020 based on comparison with published data it is clear that the water in the st peter sandstone has not maintained its in situ brine signatures for cl br na br and k cl ratios following the influx of pleistocene recharge pleistocene meltwater would have had very low ion concentrations so mixing with brines would have had little effect on ion ratios because in situ brines cannot fully account for the ion chemistry it appears that ions are primarily being introduced into the st peter sandstone by other mechanisms concentrations of some minor ions such as sr li f and b are commonly elevated in brines concentrations of these ions in our samples were elevated and similar to what siegel 1989 reported for pleistocene affected groundwater in iowa and northern missouri the western wells in general had the highest concentrations of these ions especially for li tables 1 and 2 the presence of very low isotopic values in the western region suggests the presence of a substantial amount of pleistocene recharge while the high concentrations of li and other ions suggests the signature of in situ paleozoic brines however the major ion and stable isotope data suggest simple mixing cannot fully account for the water chemistry siegel 1989 reached a similar conclusion observing that chemical processes other than mixing must control the distribution of these minor ions the relatively lower concentrations of these minor ions in the central and eastern wells corroborates the hypothesis of more recent recharge passing through the st peter sandstone and displacing much of the altered pleistocene recharge the 87sr 86sr values indicate the samples were more radiogenic than coeval seawater 0 7090 in agreement with other studies in the illinois basin stueber and walter 1991 stueber and walter 1994 stueber et al 1993 these elevated values indicate some of the dissolved sr has come from detrital source material probably shales stueber and walter 1991 the ordovician maquoketa shale which overlies the st peter sandstone may be the source of radiogenic sr to the st peter stueber et al 1987 there is a weak negative relationship between 1 sr and 87sr 86sr for the western and central wells fig 9 this negative relationship suggests that pleistocene meltwater is bringing in sr that is less radiogenic relative to sr from the in situ brines the source of the less radiogenic sr is perhaps overlying ordovician silurian marine carbonates the eastern wells had the highest 87sr 86sr values which may indicate additional inputs of water through formations containing more radiogenic material compared to carbonates this could include glacial till which in illinois can contain shale and crystalline fragments labotka et al 2015 reported much higher 87sr 86sr values 0 7107 0 7116 for cambrian brines in the illinois basin mt simon formation which they attributed to discharge from crystalline basement these high values suggest that leakage from deeper units is not appreciably affecting the st peter sandstone the introduction of pleistocene recharge into the st peter sandstone in our study area appears to have almost completely displaced in situ brines that were emplaced during the ordovician the stable isotopes of water and ion ratios suggest that there have not been large volumes of downward or especially upward migration of brines into the st peter sandstone one potential source of dissolved ions is water rock reactions within the st peter sandstone which could include desorption ion exchange and or mineral dissolution the influx of relatively dilute pleistocene discharge displacing highly saline water would likely have favored all of these processes however the st peter sandstone is an exceptionally pure quartz sand with almost no clay carbonates or heavy minerals willman et al 1975 thus it is highly unlikely that water rock interactions within the st peter sandstone could account for the observed salinity areas of recharge are closer to the central and eastern wells than to the western wells and there are no evaporite sources up gradient in the central and eastern regions we thus argue that a more likely source of elevated ion concentrations in the central and eastern regions is recharge through fractures in overlying formations although the relatively positive water isotope values in the single sample we collected from a well open to the silurian well 4 suggested that pleistocene meltwater did not significantly intrude into the silurian it is possible that a large amount of recharge could have passed through fractures during glacial advances especially in the central and eastern regions of our study area which at times were overlain by glaciers during the wisconsin glacial episode downward displacement of water from overlying layers in the illinois basin was postulated by other researchers siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 neuzil 2012 determined that fluid pressures within low permeability formations may have increased and decreased repeatedly during pleistocene glaciation during periods when flexural loading opened fractures and increased permeabilities it is possible that considerable amounts of recharge passed through overlying units and into the st peter sandstone the aqueous chemistry of this recharge water would have been a complex mixture of pleistocene meltwater and brines from ordovician to glacial till units this recharge from overlying units would have mixed with pleistocene meltwater that recharged directly into the st peter sandstone at up gradient locations were the st peter sandstone outcrops or subcrops 5 3 geological and structural controls on paleo hydrogeology while all four regions show evidence of recharge by pleistocene meltwater the differences in aqueous chemistry among the regions reflect differences in recharge zones and flowpaths the aqueous chemistry of the modern recharge region samples clearly indicates a relatively shallow system and rapid movement of water during modern times the connection of the st peter sandstone with the illinois river has provided a discharge zone for the aquifer that may not have existed during parts of the pleistocene while a pleistocene signal is still detectable in the recharge region it is small and has mainly been displaced by holocene recharge in the regions deeper in the illinois basin the distinct geochemical signatures among them suggests differences in recharge to and flow in the st peter sandstone the low isotopic values of western wells suggest a higher proportion of pleistocene recharge still present in that part of the basin siegel 1989 1991 using a model of flow in the wisconsin glacial episode suggested that meltwater recharge entering western illinois was coming from the des moines lobe in central iowa northwest of our study area this would likely mean much older water in the western region than if recharge originated in illinois because glaciers did not cover the western region during the wisconsin glacial episode and the st peter does not outcrop nearby groundwater in this region may have originated as meltwater from early in the wisconsin episode or an even earlier glacial episode such as the illinoian 190 000 to 130 000 years b p when almost the entirety of illinois was covered in glaciers the fact that these samples still maintain a pleistocene signature is suggestive of large volumes of meltwater that recharged the paleozoic units perhaps during major glacial lake flood events curry et al 2014 siegel and mandle 1984 stated that δ18o values of pleistocene meltwater must have been lower than 17 clayton et al 1966 and stueber and walter 1991 observed that the isotopic composition of illinois basin brines trended back to the meteoric water line around the isotopic composition of modern recharge which supports the notion that the in situ brines had δ18o values similar to present day 6 2 to 7 5 using this assumption the groundwater with the lowest isotopic signature samples 14 12 68 and 31 12 98 is at least half pleistocene meltwater to our knowledge these are two of the lowest isotopic values ever measured in illinois groundwater perry et al 1982 reported a δ18o value of 12 0 in a st peter sandstone well about 50 km directly south of wells 14 and 31 the relatively higher isotopic values in the central and eastern wells figs 5 and 6 suggest a different flowpath or flowpaths compared to the western region we suggest that flowpaths in these regions may be controlled to some degree by the lasalle anticlinal belt with faulting and fracturing channeling flow in a northwest to southeast direction generally parallel to the structure panno et al 2018 used cl data to suggest there was preferential horizontal flow along the lasalle anticlinal belt as well as zones of enhanced recharge particularly in the cambrian through mississippian strata the st peter sandstone was likely recharged in northern lasalle county where it is at or near land surface tds values increase and stable isotope values decrease towards the south in the central region indicating younger warmer water in the north and older and colder to the south if groundwater in this region ever reached δ18o values of 12 0 or less as observed in the western wells that water has passed through this region and been replaced by more recent recharge in the eastern region where the isotope values are higher than both the western and central regions there was either more rapid movement of pleistocene meltwater through this region or this region is closer to recharge zones the differences in geochemistry between the eastern and central regions suggest some degree of isolation between these two regions the eastern wells are east of the lasalle anticlinal belt which may thus be preventing flow to the west and forcing flow in a roughly northwest southeast direction parallel to the structure recent flow modeling by abrams et al 2015 suggests a predevelopment north south flow direction in this region previous investigators of flow in the illinois basin during the pleistocene siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 have surmised that downward movement of meltwater could have started a series of downward displacements of water from layer to layer however siegel 1989 concluded that downward leakage from younger paleozoic rocks into the st peter sandstone probably did not produce the dilute plume of groundwater found in central iowa well 4 from our sampling was the only well open to overlying silurian carbonate units and the water was considerably more saline than the other samples with a tds value 3571 mg l 50 higher than the next highest value excluding the iccs sample well 33 the δ18o value was 8 80 0 4 1 1 higher than in nearby wells that were not open to the silurian this suggests that the silurian groundwater in this region did not have a particularly negative isotopic signature and that pleistocene meltwater did not fully penetrate the silurian units as it did in the st peter sandstone the north south cross section in fig 2 b b shows that the silurian units are not connected to the land surface as the st peter sandstone is and recharge is cut off by thick overlying pennsylvanian mississippian strata if flow into the western region is primarily coming from the northwest as siegel 1989 1991 suggested where is the st peter sandstone being recharged ordovician units including the st peter sandstone are at the bedrock surface in northeastern iowa more than 200 km to the northwest of our study area idnr 1998 in addition there are places where the mississippi river incises into the maquoketa shale the main confining unit for ordovician aquifers in the region abrams et al 2015 while pleistocene recharge may have entered the st peter sandstone in these areas and migrated southeasterly into the illinois basin so4 2 data suggest a more complex story sulfate concentrations were significantly higher in the western region than the other regions a strong negative relationship between δ18o and so4 2 values for all wells r2 0 793 fig 10 suggests that pleistocene recharge introduced so4 2 into the system especially in the western region the so4 2 concentrations in most of the western wells were greater than in the iccs sample well 33 294 mg l suggesting that the in situ brines were not the sole source of so4 2 in this region more evidence that simple mixing is not controlling the water chemistry on the other hand generally positive relationships between so4 2 and f b and li suggest a brine source for at least some of the so4 2 sulfate isotopic results suggest several different sources of so4 2 and active so4 2 reduction in some regions recharge region wells had very low δ34s values 1 1 to 11 2 suggesting sulfide mineral pyrite oxidation as the source of so4 2 in modern recharge zones for wells in the western central and eastern regions δ34s values were enriched between 15 9 and 37 7 with most values clustering around 20 fig 11 these values are too high to be accounted for by pyrite oxidation and rather suggest evaporite gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution as the primary source of so4 2 anhydrite and gypsum are found in mississippian rocks in illinois but well south of our study area saxby and lamar 1957 however anhydrite and gypsum are found in mississippian and devonian deposits in iowa including in southeastern iowa up gradient of our study area anhydrite and gypsum samples collected by richardson and hansen 1991 in this region had δ34s values between 15 5 and 21 3 and δ18o so4 values between 10 0 and 16 8 these solid phase values are similar to the values in our samples that had not undergone significant sulfate reduction all water samples were undersaturated with respect to anhydrite and gypsum anhydrite and gypsum may also be sources of b and li hem 1989 gilkeson et al 1981 perry et al 1982 and siegel 1990 reported similar δ34s values for so4 2 in cambrian ordovician aquifers including the st peter sandstone in northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin i e most values clustered around 20 siegel 1990 concluded that the source of the so4 2 was from dissolution of evaporites from the michigan basin to the east recharged to the west when pleistocene glaciation altered regional flow directions it seems unlikely that so4 2 with sources in the michigan basin could reach as far south as our study area in the st peter sandstone especially in the western wells because of structural barriers such as the lasalle anticlinal belt the sandwich fault zone and the kankakee arch in northeastern illinois the sandwich fault zone which stretches over 120 km in northern illinois fig 1 is a lateral barrier to flow in the st peter sandstone abrams et al 2015 while anhydrite and or gypsum dissolution and not in situ brines appear to be the source of so4 2 in the western region the source of so4 2 in the central and eastern wells is less certain as there are no sources of sulfate minerals up gradient in these regions in situ brines may be the main source of so4 2 the two samples with the strongest brine signatures were the iccs sample 33 and a well open to the silurian 4 these two samples had by far the highest tds values 4854 and 3571 mg l respectively table 1 the δ34s values for these two samples were approximately 30 table 2 suggesting evaporite sources and so4 2 reduction thus the primary source of so4 2 in the central and eastern regions is likely in situ brines gilkeson et al 1981 perry et al 1982 and siegel 1990 observed a positive correlation between ca and so4 2 as might be expected from congruent dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite for our samples ca and so4 2 were positively correlated in the western and eastern wells although the correlation was very weak r2 0 1 and not at all in the central wells this implies that these ions were further modified by reactions occurring down gradient of the evaporite dissolution possibly including so4 2 reduction and in the case of ca cation exchange and or adsorption concentrations of redox sensitive species in the western central and eastern regions suggest active so4 2 reduction chapelle et al 2009 in these regions in some western and eastern wells very high δ34s values and the fact that the lowest so4 2 concentrations had the highest δ34s values indicate considerable reduction of the so4 2 fig 11 in both of these regions the highest values were found in the southernmost wells suggesting longer travel times and progressive loss of sulfate 6 conclusions the paleo hydrogeology of the sedimentary strata within the illinois basin is extremely complex in the st peter sandstone there are multiple sources of water including in situ remnant brines leakage from overlying and underlying units and recharge during both the pleistocene and holocene pleistocene glaciation played a substantial role in altering hydrogeological and geochemical conditions of paleozoic aquifers throughout the upper midwest in the u s contributing large amounts of cold dilute recharge that displaced in situ brines our investigation of the ordovician st peter sandstone in central illinois indicates that recharge during the pleistocene and holocene has come from multiple locations and that structural features primarily the lasalle anticlinal belt but also possibly the sandwich fault zone are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow in the st peter sandstone based on ion ratios simple mixing between pleistocene recharge and in situ remnant brines cannot account for the current geochemical conditions and pleistocene recharge has in large part displaced the in situ brines in the modern recharge region there has been sufficient time for holocene recharge to displace the pleistocene recharge in the central and especially eastern regions of our study area holocene recharge has displaced much of the pleistocene recharge the major and minor ion chemistry in the st peter sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of pleistocene recharge and in situ brines and the release of ions due to water rock interactions in such a pure sandstone as the st peter sandstone seems unlikely the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry leakage of fluids from overlying formations is via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances the water chemistry in the western region of our study area is clearly different from the central and eastern regions having a more pronounced signature of pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge the large concentrations of so4 2 and relatively high δ34s values in the western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and or gypsum possibly from devonian evaporite deposits in iowa acknowledgements we thank all the

7043,the aqueous geochemistry of the st peter sandstone a major aquifer in the illinois basin an intracratonic sedimentary basin is extremely complex there are multiple sources of water including in situ remnant brines leakage from overlying and underlying units and recharge during both the pleistocene and holocene epochs in our study region recharge to the st peter sandstone has come from multiple locations and structural features primarily the lasalle anticlinal belt but also possibly the sandwich fault zone are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow in the northern part of the study region holocene recharge has displaced most of the pleistocene recharge but in the rest of the study region considerable amounts of pleistocene recharge still exist the ion chemistry in the st peter sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of pleistocene recharge and in situ brines and the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry is leakage of fluids from overlying formations via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances the water chemistry in the western region of our study area is clearly different from the central and eastern regions having a more pronounced signature of pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge the large concentrations of so4 2 and relatively high δ34s values in the western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and or gypsum possibly from mississippian evaporite deposits in iowa keywords st peter sandstone illinois basin pleistocene recharge brines 1 introduction intracratonic sedimentary basins which are found on every continent have long been of interest because they can contain economic deposits of petroleum coal and metal ores and also major aquifer systems glaciation during the pleistocene epoch profoundly affected the near surface geology and hydrogeology in the northern latitudes of the world including many intracratonic basins in north america and europe continental ice sheets reached thicknesses of a kilometer or more compressing underlying rock units and altering groundwater flow directions recharge to underlying formations occurred via subglacial meltwater as well as during glacial retreats when large amounts of meltwater were available to recharge sedimentary units to great depths mcintosh and walter 2005 siegel and mandle 1984 van geldern et al 2014 lemieux and sudicky 2010 calculated that subglacial meltwater recharge during the wisconsin glacial episode 85 000 11 000 years bp may have reached depths of up to 3 km in addition to recharging units at natural recharge zones e g where permeable units outcrop or subcrop there is evidence that meltwater was forced through less permeable units as well e g mcintosh et al 2002 as meteoric waters recharged the paleozoic strata during the pleistocene they often encountered in situ fossil brines the illinois basin located in the midwestern u s is an elliptical shaped structurally controlled basin with its long axis trending north south fig 1 filled with paleozoic marine sedimentary rocks several units within the basin primarily sandstones of cambrian ordovician age are important aquifers in northern illinois where their recharge zones are at or near land surface depths of these sandstone units increase towards the center of the illinois basin located in southern illinois the sandstone units also become thicker and their groundwater salinity increases substantially from north to south larson and herzog 2010 however the uppermost sandstone the ordovician st peter formation remains a potable aquifer well into the central part of the state and many communities rely upon it as their drinking water source understanding recharge into and flow within the aquifer is important to developing protecting and managing it in previous studies of formations in the illinois basin researchers have observed evidence of complex interactions among various water sources as a result of continental glaciation mcintosh et al 2002 suggested that meteoric water invaded the devonian new albany shale in the eastern part of the illinois basin through fractures that may have provided recharge pathways stueber and walter 1991 came to a similar conclusion for silurian devonian shale units elsewhere in the illinois basin siegel and begor 1990 reported evidence that pleistocene meltwater recharged through the ordovician maquoketa shale in southern wisconsin not all units were necessarily recharged to the same extent with pleistocene meltwater mcintosh et al 2002 for example determined that fluids in mississippian units were considerably more saline than the underlying silurian devonian aquifers in their study area as meltwater encountered the in situ brines one would expect that a number of different physicochemical processes would have ensued including simple mixing density gradients affecting flow and enhanced water rock interactions as glaciers advanced and retreated across the landscape for 1 8 million years during the pleistocene there were numerous changes in hydraulic gradients recharge locations and rates and aqueous geochemistry the current geochemical conditions within the illinois basin are the product of these complex interactions in this investigation our objective was to reconstruct paleo hydrogeological conditions in the st peter sandstone in the central part of illinois using a geochemical dataset specific objectives included determining how far pleistocene recharge penetrated into the st peter formation what the source s of remnant salinity is and how structural features have controlled recharge and flow there have been no systematic hydrogeological studies of the st peter formation and surrounding units in this region and as a result the influence of structural features on groundwater flow in the paleozoic strata in this region is poorly known 2 study area this study is focused on the st peter sandstone in north central illinois covering 12 counties bureau fulton henry knox lasalle livingston marshall mclean peoria putnam stark woodford an area of approximately 20 000 km2 fig 1 the geology of the illinois basin has been summarized by collinson et al 1988 and kolata and nelson 2010 the illinois basin occupies most of the state of illinois as well as parts of the surrounding states of indiana kentucky and tennessee the basin is filled with cambrian through pennsylvanian marine sedimentary rocks lying atop precambrian crystalline basement rock fig 2 cambrian and ordovician age rocks are predominantly sandstones silurian through mississippian age rocks are predominantly carbonates and pennsylvanian age rocks are shales sandstones and coal measures the basin is at least 6400 m deep at its deepest point in western kentucky hickman 2013 siegel 1989 summarized the hydrogeological setting of the northern midwestern u s including the illinois basin the ordovician st peter and the cambrian ironton galesville sandstones are important aquifers in the northern part of illinois and also in parts of wisconsin iowa and minnesota wilson 2011 units on the southern side of the paleozoic aged sandwich fault zone are uplifted relative to the northern side and the st peter sandstone is at or near the land surface in lasalle county and is hydrostatically connected to the illinois river figs 1 and 2 siegel 1989 suggested that water discharged from the st peter sandstone in northern lasalle county during the wisconsin glacial episode during glacial advances but became a recharge zone when glaciers retreated the lasalle anticlinal belt is a dominant structural feature in the central part of the illinois basin figs 1 and 2 it is a complex structure of en echelon folds asymmetrical anticlines domes monoclines and synclines stretching from near the wisconsin border in northwestern illinois through lawrence county in southeastern illinois near vincennes in a distance of over 400 km nelson 1995 there are faults associated with the structure and hamburger and rupp 1988 concluded that slippage along the fault s of the anticlinorium was the cause of an earthquake in southeastern illinois in july 1987 in the study area the major structural feature within the lasalle anticlinal belt is the peru monocline which has displaced units younger than the upper pennsylvanian including the st peter sandstone with strata present at much deeper depths along the western flank relative to the eastern area kay and bailey 2016 nelson 1995 in the central and southern parts of the illinois basin groundwater in paleozoic strata is highly saline and thus groundwater producing units are not used as aquifers silurian and devonian aged brines have been characterized as seawater evaporated short of the precipitation of halite kesler et al 1995 stueber et al 1987 stueber and walter 1991 stueber and walter 1994 stueber et al 1993 walter et al 1990 salinity of ordovician brines probably resulted from evaporation of seawater to a point slightly below halite precipitation stueber and walter 1994 cambrian brines of the mount simon formation constitute a fossil brine whose chemical composition has changed little since deposition of the formation labotka et al 2016 however groundwater within the overlying sandstones of the cambrian ironton galesville formation showed evidence of mixing with freshwater recharge and brines within the overlying strata panno et al 2013 in general groundwater flows toward the center of the illinois basin becoming more sluggish and mineralized as it deepens and discharges as upward leakage across confining units cartwright 1970 panno et al 1994 siegel 1989 there is evidence of upward movement of groundwater and gas along fractures associated with geologic structures in the basin including the lasalle anticlinal belt cartwright 1970 peterson et al 2015 parts of illinois were covered by continental glaciers multiple times during the pleistocene epoch curry et al 2010 hansel and mckay 2010 during the final episode of the pleistocene the wisconsin glacial episode about half of our study area was covered at the maximum extent of glaciation piskin and bergstrom 1975 fig 1 prior to pleistocene glaciation groundwater presumably flowed south toward the center of the illinois basin cartwright 1970 siegel 1989 and perhaps for some units to the basin s southern margins panno et al 2018 during glacial maximums hydraulic gradients were flattened out by the isostatic pressure resulting from the glaciers potentially altering groundwater flow paths person et al 2007 during glacial retreats there would have been abundant meltwater to recharge the subsurface and it is likely there were major recharge periods following both the illinois and wisconsin glacial episodes for example glacial lakes released reoccurring torrential floods about 19 000 years b p with subsequent phases continuing to 13 000 years b p curry et al 2014 siegel and mandle 1984 and siegel 1989 used water chemistry data including the stable isotopes of water to suggest that the flow direction in ordovician aquifers in iowa was perpendicular to the present gradient relatively dilute fresh water would have entered the paleozoic strata displacing and mixing with the in situ water previous studies and sampling indicate elevated levels of total dissolved solids tds in most of the paleozoic units so it is likely that there are at least two end members to consider pleistocene recharge and in situ formation waters with high tds values other potential sources of water are leakage from overlying stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 or underlying units panno et al 2018 glaciers retreated at the end of the pleistocene epoch approximately 11 000 years ago and presumably any direct effects of glacial meltwaters on groundwater flow paths were eliminated the predevelopment potentiometric surface within our study area indicates flow direction from the north and northwest with local discharge in central lasalle county along the illinois river where the st peter sandstone is at the surface siegel 1989 abrams et al 2015 the current major flow path in the illinois basin in illinois is in a southerly southeasterly direction however large withdrawals in the chicago region from the st peter ironton galesville and mt simon sandstones over the past 150 years have changed flow directions in northeastern illinois groundwater within the eastern part of the study area now flows northwest towards the large cone of depression centered north of the sandwich fault zone abrams et al 2015 3 sampling and analysis sampling was designed to help understand sources of recharge and flow into and through the st peter formation the primary function for inorganic chemical analyses were to use ion ratios and trace elements to help determine sources of in situ brines as well as recharge stable isotopes of water were analyzed to help determine the penetration of cold pleistocene waters into the formation the stable isotopes of s were used to help determine sources of sulfate so4 2 and the extent of so4 2 reduction and sr isotopes were used to help determine sources of salinity a total of 32 samples were collected from wells finished in the st peter sandstone fig 3 many of the wells are open to other units above and below the st peter sandstone but the st peter sandstone is considered to be the most transmissive unit in this region thirty one samples came from existing wells and included 26 community supply wells three industrial wells one state park well and one domestic well a drill stem water sample from the st peter sandstone was collected by researchers at the illinois state geological survey isgs in september 2015 from a well drilled for the industrial carbon capture and sequestration iccs demonstration project near decatur well 33 we expanded our data set by using data previously collected from wells open to the st peter sandstone these included 1 major ion fluoride iron manganese ammonium and strontium data from 44 samples collected from public supply wells within the study area by the illinois environmental protection agency iepa between 1990 and 2012 and 2 stable isotope data δ18o δ2h from five samples collected by the usgs from wells in counties adjacent to our study area fig 3 the iepa and usgs sample data are included in supplemental material the 31 existing wells were sampled between june and august 2015 all

dissolved gases from the water samples collected in isoflasks were determined by using the head space equilibration method as described in molofsky et al 2016 at isotech laboratories champaign il a gas chromatograph gc was used to detect and quantify the concentrations of hydrocarbons in the headspace of the dissolved gas sample the concentration of the gas dissolved in the water methane ethane and propane is then calculated using henry s law stable isotope analyses except for sr were prepared at the isgs isotope laboratory champaign il and analyzed at isotech laboratories champaign il samples for δ18o and δ2h values were measured by cavity ring down spectroscopy on a picarro l2130 i isotopic water analyzer long term analytical precision for δ18o is 0 2 and δ2h is 1 with values reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the δ34s and δ18o of dissolved so4 2 were determined by initially precipitating the dissolved so4 2 as barium sulfate baso4 following the methods of carmody et al 1998 the δ34s of the baso4 was determined by combustion to sulfur dioxide so2 gas using an elementar vario el elemental analyzer then passed through a conflo ii interfaced to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer irms where it was compared against a reference gas the δ18o of the so4 2 was determined using a thermo tc ea interfaced with an irms the oxygen of the baso4 sample was thermally converted to carbon monoxide co gas then introduced into the irms through a conflo ii interface sample isotopic compositions were referenced against international standards to determine the final δ34s and δ18o values the δ34s results for dissolved so4 2 are reported versus the vienna canyon diablo triolite vcdt and the δ18o results for dissolved so4 2 are reported versus the vienna standard mean ocean water vsmow strontium isotopes were analyzed using a nu plasma hr multicollector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer located in the department of geology at the university

significance was determined at the p 0 05 level 4 results 4 1 sample grouping there were significant spatial differences in aqueous geochemistry for the sampled wells table 1 the criteria for grouping the different wells will be discussed below but to assist the reader the groups are listed here fig 3 1 modern recharge region in northern lasalle county wells 26 27 28 and 32 plus 18 iepa samples 2 western region wells 11 12 13 14 18 19 20 22 23 and 31 plus 11 iepa samples 3 central region wells 1 2 3 5 6 15 16 17 24 and 25 plus 10 iepa samples 4 eastern region wells 7 8 9 10 29 and 30 plus 5 iepa samples two samples were geochemically distinct and did not fit into any of the above groups well 4 which was the only sampled well open to silurian units overlying the st peter sandstone and the iccs drill stem sample well 33 south of the study area 4 2 tds and major ions tds values were lowest in wells in the recharge region of northern lasalle county median 378 mg l significantly lower compared to the other groups western wells generally had the highest tds values median 1583 mg l the median value for the eastern wells was 1180 mg l the median tds values for the central wells was 979 mg l significantly lower than the western wells the central wells can be further subdivided based on location with tds values lower in the seven northernmost wells median 749 mg l compared to the 13 southernmost wells median 1215 mg l we did not observe north south differences in the other groups the highest tds value was in well 33 the iccs sample 4854 mg l the major ion character in the recharge well samples was markedly different from the other groups table 1 fig 4 here the waters were ca mg hco3 type with three of the wells having 20 40 so4 2 of the total anions for the other three groups the cations were dominated by na between 50 and 90 there is a linear trend line for the cations with na k replacing ca and mg in the more saline waters there were no major differences in the cation distribution among the western central and eastern wells although the western wells generally had higher na k than the central or eastern wells the median ca mg molar ratio for the recharge western and central well samples was approximately 1 5 suggesting calcite was the primary source for ca the calcite saturation index for most of the western and central samples was within 0 2 of saturation most of the recharge well samples were undersaturated with respect to calcite for the eastern wells the median ca mg molar ratio was approximately 1 1 suggesting dolomite dissolution as the primary source for these ions the anions were more complex most of the wells apart from the recharge region were dominated by cl but most wells had a large amount of sulfate especially the western wells which seemed to be following a different trend from the other two groups chloride concentrations were by far the lowest in recharge region wells median 4 0 mg l the highest cl concentrations were in eastern wells median 435 mg l and were lower in central median 281 mg l and western wells median 279 mg l sulfate concentrations were by far the highest in western wells median 372 mg l significantly greater compared to the other regions as with tds there was a difference in so4 2 concentrations between north and south in the central region with northernmost wells having lower so4 2 median 119 mg l compared to the southernmost wells median 188 mg l panno et al 2013 used various ion weight ratios cl br na br k cl and cl concentrations to discriminate among the ages of different brines in the illinois basin there is evidence that cl br ratios of brines reflect the ratios of the original seawater present during deposition of the formations e g labotka et al 2016 and post depositional water rock interactions as such ratios of these ions have been used to identify the age of the formation from which brines originate and thus can be used to identify intrusion of brines into the st peter sandstone from formations of different ages for the most part the samples in the western central and eastern wells had ion ratios in excess of ordovician age brines most of the samples had cl br ratios greater than the average ordovician age brine ratio 2 5 7 reported in panno et al 2013 original data from stueber and walter 1994 with three of the western wells having values greater than the largest cl br ratio they reported most na br and k cl ratios were also higher than reported for ordovician brines all of our samples had na br ratios greater than 220 which is greater than the highest value 2 0 2 reported by panno et al 2013 the western wells had the highest na br ratios with a median of 530 ordovician brines have k cl values of 0 012 and most of our samples had k cl 0 020 well 4 open to the silurian had the lowest k cl value of 0 008 similar to the value reported for silurian devonian brines 0 010 original data from keller 1983 wells 19 and 20 also had the lowest k cl values 0 014 and 0 020 these are the two southernmost wells in the western region 4 3 minor ions doc and gases for wells in the western central and eastern regions several minor ions had concentrations higher than typically found in illinois groundwater these included strontium fluoride bromide boron barium and lithium tables 1 and 2 lithium was significantly higher in the western wells 0 14 0 31 mg l than the other regions but well below the concentration in the iccs drill stem sample well 33 0 87 mg l chapelle et al 2009 developed a method to determine the dominant redox processes in a water sample using concentrations of major redox sensitive species o2 no3 mn2 fe2 so4 2 and h2s based on their criteria fe iii and to a lesser extent mn iv reduction dominated in the recharge wells while mixed fe iii and so4 2 reduction dominated in almost all the wells in the other regions the presence of ch4 in all samples further indicated the existence of mixed redox conditions while mixed redox conditions are possible over small distances the long open intervals for the wells sampled in this study may also allow for mixing of waters with distinct redox signatures redox conditions were different in the eastern wells compared to the other regions with so4 2 reduction and methanogenesis dominating over fe iii reduction five of the 10 wells that had detectable h2s were in the eastern region and they had the five highest concentrations 1 5 8 5 mg l methane concentrations also tended to be highest in the eastern wells median 0 135 mg l doc concentrations were very low in samples from the western central and eastern wells in most cases below detection 0 31 mg l doc in modern recharge well samples ranged from 0 42 to 1 55 mg l 4 4 stable isotopes all of the samples plotted along the global mean water line gmwl indicating little to no evaporation or other fractionation processes associated with long term water rock reactions fig 5 almost all the samples had δ18o and δ2h values that were low compared to modern recharge the highest values i e closest to modern recharge were found in the modern recharge wells and the western wells had the lowest values of δ18o and δ2h fig 6 these low values indicate much cooler temperatures of recharge than present day the values for the eastern wells were slightly lower than the modern recharge well values while values for the central wells fell between the eastern and western values for the sulfate isotopes the modern recharge wells were again distinctly different from the other groups they had by far the lowest values median δ34s 3 57 median δ18oso4 0 07 the samples from the western central and eastern wells had δ34s values ranging from 15 9 to 37 7 with the highest values in the eastern wells median 26 62 the δ18oso4 values were similar for the western central and eastern wells with median values between 13 26 and 14 94 87sr 86sr values ranged between 0 70928 and 0 71058 these values are all greater than what would be expected from ordovician seawater values which were 0 7090 burke et al 1982 veizer 1989 our values for the most part plot in the upper range of values reported by stueber and walter 1994 for samples collected from the ordovician galena carbonate formation south of our study area 5 discussion 5 1 pleistocene recharge as glaciers ebbed and flowed during the pleistocene epoch hydrogeological conditions in the illinois basin changed drastically the pressure exerted by the overlying ice varied and the amount of available water for recharge fluctuated altering groundwater flow directions when glaciers retreated at the end of the pleistocene epoch about 11 000 years ago large volumes of fresh meltwater would have been produced as the isostatic pressure was being released much of this water was recharged to the st peter sandstone and other bedrock units in the illinois basin siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 1994 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 this relatively dilute recharge would have displaced or mixed with the in situ water because the in situ water would have had high tds values it is also possible that there would have been density controlled flow with the pleistocene recharge perched on top because almost all of the wells sampled in this study were open to the entire st peter sandstone and in some cases other units samples represent a mixture of the entire water column and thus any density stratification that might still remain would have been obscured we might expect such density gradients to persist for a long time isotopically depleted δ18o and δ2h values that are indicative of a component of colder water i e pleistocene recharge e g siegel and mandle 1984 mcintosh and walter 2006 were found in the st peter sandstone throughout our study area figs 5 and 6 even the iccs sample well 33 in the extreme southern part of our study area had depleted δ18o and δ2h values the fact that all sample data plot very close to the gmwl fig 5 indicates that little or no evaporation occurred prior to recharge which would be expected in a cool climate and also that subsequent rock water interactions have not appreciably altered δ18o or δ2h values the very low values in the western wells are indicative of the coldest water in the study area the higher values in the eastern and northern component of the central wells figs 5 and 6 suggest either less pleistocene recharge compared to the western and southern central wells or more likely more recent recharge passing through the st peter sandstone and displacing much of the altered pleistocene recharge the recharge well samples have a distinct water chemistry signature compared to the other wells indicating much younger waters and shorter flowpaths the relatively high δ18o and δ2h values close to modern values indicate that most of the pleistocene recharge has already passed through and been replaced by modern recharge in addition low concentrations of tds na cl and many minor constituents and the relatively high concentrations of doc ca and mg the presence of nitrate in one of the samples and undersaturation with respect to calcite all suggest a shorter residence time within the aquifer than the other samples the st peter sandstone subcrops at the bedrock surface in northern lasalle county where it is directly overlain by glacial deposits in central lasalle county it is exposed along the illinois river figs 1 and 2 at present day groundwater in the st peter sandstone flows from northern lasalle county and discharges to the illinois river where it is hydraulically connected and thus provides for shorter flowpaths and residence times in comparison to the western central and eastern wells kelly et al 2016 one notable difference between the western region compared to the central and eastern regions is that the western region was for the most part not covered by glaciers during the wisconsin glacial episode fig 1 thus the geologic formations in the western region would not have been subjected to the flexural stresses imposed by overlying ice during the wisconsin episode whereas the central and eastern regions were more likely to have been impacted 5 2 in situ brines sources and mixing in order to shed light on the sources and mixing between in situ brines and pleistocene recharge we assessed trends for a number of ions ion ratios and stable isotopic data the in situ brines in the illinois basin have markedly different water chemistries compared to pleistocene recharge including extremely high tds values for example samples of st peter formation brines collected by meents et al 1952 south of our study area deeper into the illinois basin had cl concentrations as high as 94 000 mg l with a median value of approximately 49 000 mg l n 10 the water isotopes of the in situ brines also differ from pleistocene meltwater clayton et al 1966 and stueber and walter 1991 reported δ2h and δ18o values in samples from illinois basin brines including ordovician formation waters galena formation in the southern part of the illinois basin that deviate from the gmwl stueber and walter 1994 interpreted this deviation as being due to subaerial evaporation of seawater the fact that our samples do not deviate from the gmwl suggests that the pleistocene meltwater dominates volumetrically in the st peter formation in our study area the ion data however do indicate a brine component in the st peter sandstone because solute concentrations are so much greater in the basin brines even a small volume of brine would have a major impact on solute concentrations and ion ratios in the aquifer chloride and br which are highly elevated in the in situ brines with respect to pleistocene meltwater are conservative ions that can be used to estimate the amount of mixing between in situ water and pleistocene recharge pleistocene meltwater and basin brines within the st peter sandstone can be considered as two end members pleistocene meltwater would have had very low cl and br concentrations similar to that of pristine inland rainwater 0 5 mg l cl and 0 006 mg l br nadp 2018 with a cl br ratio of about 50 panno et al 2006 ordovician basin brines have very high concentrations of cl tens of thousands of mg l and br 25 to 400 mg l with an average cl br ratio of approximately 250 keller 1983 stueber and walter 1994 in order to estimate the percentage of pleistocene meltwater in our samples we used the following equation adapted from mcintosh and walter 2005 p l e i s t o c e n e w a t e r 100 br sample br brine e n d m e m b e r 100 we used 10 mg l as the concentration of the brine end member the approximate value for the iccs sample 33 using a brine end member of 100 mg l results in all of the samples being at least 98 pleistocene even if we use the iccs sample 33 as the end member 10 mg l pleistocene water is still calculated to be at least 80 in all samples if mixing between these two end members is the dominant mechanism controlling the present day water chemistry a positive correlation between δ18o values and cl and br concentrations might be expected assuming that the lower the δ18o value the greater the fraction of pleistocene recharge stueber and walter 1994 reported a positive correlation between δ18o and cl for ordovician galena formation samples in the southwestern part of the illinois basin in our samples from western wells positive relationships were observed between δ18o and both br fig 7 and cl however there was no obvious relationship for the eastern wells and the central wells seem to have a negative relationship the opposite of what would be expected if this was simple mixing there thus appear to be processes other than simple mixing between pleistocene recharge and in situ brines that are affecting the geochemistry in the central and eastern regions there may be additional sources of water such as leakage from overlying and or underlying units previous studies in the illinois basin have indicated pleistocene flow through overlying silurian and devonian units albeit to a lesser extent than what is seen in the st peter sandstone stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 mcintosh and walter 2005 in at least one part of our study area in the vicinity of the illinois river evidence has been reported for discharge of saline groundwater from deeper cambrian units into the st peter sandstone panno et al 2018 ion ratios cl br na br and k cl as weight weight have been used to distinguish among different aged brines in sedimentary basins including the illinois basin panno et al 2013 the median cl br in samples from the western central and eastern wells was 312 within the range 148 366 of ordovician brine samples galena fm reported by stueber and walter 1994 however most of our samples had values greater than the average 2 5 7 and three of the western wells had ratios greater than the maximum value reported by stueber and walter 1994 suggesting a source s of water with higher cl br ratios than found in the in situ brines fig 8 the median na br and k cl ratios for the western central and eastern wells 289 and 0 040 respectively were appreciably higher than values published by stueber and walter 1994 and keller 1983 again suggesting input of water with higher na br and k cl values than in illinois basin brines cl br and na br ratios in general decrease with increasing depth in the illinois basin i e younger units have higher ratios with the highest values in pennsylvanian clastic rocks panno et al 2013 walter et al 1990 most of the wells in the central and eastern regions had na br ratios that fall within the range of values reported for the pennsylvanian however all but two of the western wells exceeded the maximum value found in the pennsylvanian rocks on the other hand k cl ratios generally increase with depth in the illinois basin with highest values in cambrian strata 0 014 0 017 panno et al 2013 almost all our samples had k cl 0 020 based on comparison with published data it is clear that the water in the st peter sandstone has not maintained its in situ brine signatures for cl br na br and k cl ratios following the influx of pleistocene recharge pleistocene meltwater would have had very low ion concentrations so mixing with brines would have had little effect on ion ratios because in situ brines cannot fully account for the ion chemistry it appears that ions are primarily being introduced into the st peter sandstone by other mechanisms concentrations of some minor ions such as sr li f and b are commonly elevated in brines concentrations of these ions in our samples were elevated and similar to what siegel 1989 reported for pleistocene affected groundwater in iowa and northern missouri the western wells in general had the highest concentrations of these ions especially for li tables 1 and 2 the presence of very low isotopic values in the western region suggests the presence of a substantial amount of pleistocene recharge while the high concentrations of li and other ions suggests the signature of in situ paleozoic brines however the major ion and stable isotope data suggest simple mixing cannot fully account for the water chemistry siegel 1989 reached a similar conclusion observing that chemical processes other than mixing must control the distribution of these minor ions the relatively lower concentrations of these minor ions in the central and eastern wells corroborates the hypothesis of more recent recharge passing through the st peter sandstone and displacing much of the altered pleistocene recharge the 87sr 86sr values indicate the samples were more radiogenic than coeval seawater 0 7090 in agreement with other studies in the illinois basin stueber and walter 1991 stueber and walter 1994 stueber et al 1993 these elevated values indicate some of the dissolved sr has come from detrital source material probably shales stueber and walter 1991 the ordovician maquoketa shale which overlies the st peter sandstone may be the source of radiogenic sr to the st peter stueber et al 1987 there is a weak negative relationship between 1 sr and 87sr 86sr for the western and central wells fig 9 this negative relationship suggests that pleistocene meltwater is bringing in sr that is less radiogenic relative to sr from the in situ brines the source of the less radiogenic sr is perhaps overlying ordovician silurian marine carbonates the eastern wells had the highest 87sr 86sr values which may indicate additional inputs of water through formations containing more radiogenic material compared to carbonates this could include glacial till which in illinois can contain shale and crystalline fragments labotka et al 2015 reported much higher 87sr 86sr values 0 7107 0 7116 for cambrian brines in the illinois basin mt simon formation which they attributed to discharge from crystalline basement these high values suggest that leakage from deeper units is not appreciably affecting the st peter sandstone the introduction of pleistocene recharge into the st peter sandstone in our study area appears to have almost completely displaced in situ brines that were emplaced during the ordovician the stable isotopes of water and ion ratios suggest that there have not been large volumes of downward or especially upward migration of brines into the st peter sandstone one potential source of dissolved ions is water rock reactions within the st peter sandstone which could include desorption ion exchange and or mineral dissolution the influx of relatively dilute pleistocene discharge displacing highly saline water would likely have favored all of these processes however the st peter sandstone is an exceptionally pure quartz sand with almost no clay carbonates or heavy minerals willman et al 1975 thus it is highly unlikely that water rock interactions within the st peter sandstone could account for the observed salinity areas of recharge are closer to the central and eastern wells than to the western wells and there are no evaporite sources up gradient in the central and eastern regions we thus argue that a more likely source of elevated ion concentrations in the central and eastern regions is recharge through fractures in overlying formations although the relatively positive water isotope values in the single sample we collected from a well open to the silurian well 4 suggested that pleistocene meltwater did not significantly intrude into the silurian it is possible that a large amount of recharge could have passed through fractures during glacial advances especially in the central and eastern regions of our study area which at times were overlain by glaciers during the wisconsin glacial episode downward displacement of water from overlying layers in the illinois basin was postulated by other researchers siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 neuzil 2012 determined that fluid pressures within low permeability formations may have increased and decreased repeatedly during pleistocene glaciation during periods when flexural loading opened fractures and increased permeabilities it is possible that considerable amounts of recharge passed through overlying units and into the st peter sandstone the aqueous chemistry of this recharge water would have been a complex mixture of pleistocene meltwater and brines from ordovician to glacial till units this recharge from overlying units would have mixed with pleistocene meltwater that recharged directly into the st peter sandstone at up gradient locations were the st peter sandstone outcrops or subcrops 5 3 geological and structural controls on paleo hydrogeology while all four regions show evidence of recharge by pleistocene meltwater the differences in aqueous chemistry among the regions reflect differences in recharge zones and flowpaths the aqueous chemistry of the modern recharge region samples clearly indicates a relatively shallow system and rapid movement of water during modern times the connection of the st peter sandstone with the illinois river has provided a discharge zone for the aquifer that may not have existed during parts of the pleistocene while a pleistocene signal is still detectable in the recharge region it is small and has mainly been displaced by holocene recharge in the regions deeper in the illinois basin the distinct geochemical signatures among them suggests differences in recharge to and flow in the st peter sandstone the low isotopic values of western wells suggest a higher proportion of pleistocene recharge still present in that part of the basin siegel 1989 1991 using a model of flow in the wisconsin glacial episode suggested that meltwater recharge entering western illinois was coming from the des moines lobe in central iowa northwest of our study area this would likely mean much older water in the western region than if recharge originated in illinois because glaciers did not cover the western region during the wisconsin glacial episode and the st peter does not outcrop nearby groundwater in this region may have originated as meltwater from early in the wisconsin episode or an even earlier glacial episode such as the illinoian 190 000 to 130 000 years b p when almost the entirety of illinois was covered in glaciers the fact that these samples still maintain a pleistocene signature is suggestive of large volumes of meltwater that recharged the paleozoic units perhaps during major glacial lake flood events curry et al 2014 siegel and mandle 1984 stated that δ18o values of pleistocene meltwater must have been lower than 17 clayton et al 1966 and stueber and walter 1991 observed that the isotopic composition of illinois basin brines trended back to the meteoric water line around the isotopic composition of modern recharge which supports the notion that the in situ brines had δ18o values similar to present day 6 2 to 7 5 using this assumption the groundwater with the lowest isotopic signature samples 14 12 68 and 31 12 98 is at least half pleistocene meltwater to our knowledge these are two of the lowest isotopic values ever measured in illinois groundwater perry et al 1982 reported a δ18o value of 12 0 in a st peter sandstone well about 50 km directly south of wells 14 and 31 the relatively higher isotopic values in the central and eastern wells figs 5 and 6 suggest a different flowpath or flowpaths compared to the western region we suggest that flowpaths in these regions may be controlled to some degree by the lasalle anticlinal belt with faulting and fracturing channeling flow in a northwest to southeast direction generally parallel to the structure panno et al 2018 used cl data to suggest there was preferential horizontal flow along the lasalle anticlinal belt as well as zones of enhanced recharge particularly in the cambrian through mississippian strata the st peter sandstone was likely recharged in northern lasalle county where it is at or near land surface tds values increase and stable isotope values decrease towards the south in the central region indicating younger warmer water in the north and older and colder to the south if groundwater in this region ever reached δ18o values of 12 0 or less as observed in the western wells that water has passed through this region and been replaced by more recent recharge in the eastern region where the isotope values are higher than both the western and central regions there was either more rapid movement of pleistocene meltwater through this region or this region is closer to recharge zones the differences in geochemistry between the eastern and central regions suggest some degree of isolation between these two regions the eastern wells are east of the lasalle anticlinal belt which may thus be preventing flow to the west and forcing flow in a roughly northwest southeast direction parallel to the structure recent flow modeling by abrams et al 2015 suggests a predevelopment north south flow direction in this region previous investigators of flow in the illinois basin during the pleistocene siegel 1989 stueber and walter 1991 mcintosh et al 2002 have surmised that downward movement of meltwater could have started a series of downward displacements of water from layer to layer however siegel 1989 concluded that downward leakage from younger paleozoic rocks into the st peter sandstone probably did not produce the dilute plume of groundwater found in central iowa well 4 from our sampling was the only well open to overlying silurian carbonate units and the water was considerably more saline than the other samples with a tds value 3571 mg l 50 higher than the next highest value excluding the iccs sample well 33 the δ18o value was 8 80 0 4 1 1 higher than in nearby wells that were not open to the silurian this suggests that the silurian groundwater in this region did not have a particularly negative isotopic signature and that pleistocene meltwater did not fully penetrate the silurian units as it did in the st peter sandstone the north south cross section in fig 2 b b shows that the silurian units are not connected to the land surface as the st peter sandstone is and recharge is cut off by thick overlying pennsylvanian mississippian strata if flow into the western region is primarily coming from the northwest as siegel 1989 1991 suggested where is the st peter sandstone being recharged ordovician units including the st peter sandstone are at the bedrock surface in northeastern iowa more than 200 km to the northwest of our study area idnr 1998 in addition there are places where the mississippi river incises into the maquoketa shale the main confining unit for ordovician aquifers in the region abrams et al 2015 while pleistocene recharge may have entered the st peter sandstone in these areas and migrated southeasterly into the illinois basin so4 2 data suggest a more complex story sulfate concentrations were significantly higher in the western region than the other regions a strong negative relationship between δ18o and so4 2 values for all wells r2 0 793 fig 10 suggests that pleistocene recharge introduced so4 2 into the system especially in the western region the so4 2 concentrations in most of the western wells were greater than in the iccs sample well 33 294 mg l suggesting that the in situ brines were not the sole source of so4 2 in this region more evidence that simple mixing is not controlling the water chemistry on the other hand generally positive relationships between so4 2 and f b and li suggest a brine source for at least some of the so4 2 sulfate isotopic results suggest several different sources of so4 2 and active so4 2 reduction in some regions recharge region wells had very low δ34s values 1 1 to 11 2 suggesting sulfide mineral pyrite oxidation as the source of so4 2 in modern recharge zones for wells in the western central and eastern regions δ34s values were enriched between 15 9 and 37 7 with most values clustering around 20 fig 11 these values are too high to be accounted for by pyrite oxidation and rather suggest evaporite gypsum and or anhydrite dissolution as the primary source of so4 2 anhydrite and gypsum are found in mississippian rocks in illinois but well south of our study area saxby and lamar 1957 however anhydrite and gypsum are found in mississippian and devonian deposits in iowa including in southeastern iowa up gradient of our study area anhydrite and gypsum samples collected by richardson and hansen 1991 in this region had δ34s values between 15 5 and 21 3 and δ18o so4 values between 10 0 and 16 8 these solid phase values are similar to the values in our samples that had not undergone significant sulfate reduction all water samples were undersaturated with respect to anhydrite and gypsum anhydrite and gypsum may also be sources of b and li hem 1989 gilkeson et al 1981 perry et al 1982 and siegel 1990 reported similar δ34s values for so4 2 in cambrian ordovician aquifers including the st peter sandstone in northern illinois and southeastern wisconsin i e most values clustered around 20 siegel 1990 concluded that the source of the so4 2 was from dissolution of evaporites from the michigan basin to the east recharged to the west when pleistocene glaciation altered regional flow directions it seems unlikely that so4 2 with sources in the michigan basin could reach as far south as our study area in the st peter sandstone especially in the western wells because of structural barriers such as the lasalle anticlinal belt the sandwich fault zone and the kankakee arch in northeastern illinois the sandwich fault zone which stretches over 120 km in northern illinois fig 1 is a lateral barrier to flow in the st peter sandstone abrams et al 2015 while anhydrite and or gypsum dissolution and not in situ brines appear to be the source of so4 2 in the western region the source of so4 2 in the central and eastern wells is less certain as there are no sources of sulfate minerals up gradient in these regions in situ brines may be the main source of so4 2 the two samples with the strongest brine signatures were the iccs sample 33 and a well open to the silurian 4 these two samples had by far the highest tds values 4854 and 3571 mg l respectively table 1 the δ34s values for these two samples were approximately 30 table 2 suggesting evaporite sources and so4 2 reduction thus the primary source of so4 2 in the central and eastern regions is likely in situ brines gilkeson et al 1981 perry et al 1982 and siegel 1990 observed a positive correlation between ca and so4 2 as might be expected from congruent dissolution of gypsum or anhydrite for our samples ca and so4 2 were positively correlated in the western and eastern wells although the correlation was very weak r2 0 1 and not at all in the central wells this implies that these ions were further modified by reactions occurring down gradient of the evaporite dissolution possibly including so4 2 reduction and in the case of ca cation exchange and or adsorption concentrations of redox sensitive species in the western central and eastern regions suggest active so4 2 reduction chapelle et al 2009 in these regions in some western and eastern wells very high δ34s values and the fact that the lowest so4 2 concentrations had the highest δ34s values indicate considerable reduction of the so4 2 fig 11 in both of these regions the highest values were found in the southernmost wells suggesting longer travel times and progressive loss of sulfate 6 conclusions the paleo hydrogeology of the sedimentary strata within the illinois basin is extremely complex in the st peter sandstone there are multiple sources of water including in situ remnant brines leakage from overlying and underlying units and recharge during both the pleistocene and holocene pleistocene glaciation played a substantial role in altering hydrogeological and geochemical conditions of paleozoic aquifers throughout the upper midwest in the u s contributing large amounts of cold dilute recharge that displaced in situ brines our investigation of the ordovician st peter sandstone in central illinois indicates that recharge during the pleistocene and holocene has come from multiple locations and that structural features primarily the lasalle anticlinal belt but also possibly the sandwich fault zone are a major control on recharge and groundwater flow in the st peter sandstone based on ion ratios simple mixing between pleistocene recharge and in situ remnant brines cannot account for the current geochemical conditions and pleistocene recharge has in large part displaced the in situ brines in the modern recharge region there has been sufficient time for holocene recharge to displace the pleistocene recharge in the central and especially eastern regions of our study area holocene recharge has displaced much of the pleistocene recharge the major and minor ion chemistry in the st peter sandstone cannot be accounted for by simple mixing of pleistocene recharge and in situ brines and the release of ions due to water rock interactions in such a pure sandstone as the st peter sandstone seems unlikely the most likely mechanism that could account for the aqueous chemistry leakage of fluids from overlying formations is via fractures opened by flexural loading during glacial advances the water chemistry in the western region of our study area is clearly different from the central and eastern regions having a more pronounced signature of pleistocene water and suggesting different flow paths and sources of recharge the large concentrations of so4 2 and relatively high δ34s values in the western wells suggest an up gradient source of anhydrite and or gypsum possibly from devonian evaporite deposits in iowa acknowledgements we thank all the

7044,the need for a method of estimating streamflow with both high quality and high spatial resolution particularly for ungauged sites is critical under current circumstances intensifying competition over water resources and limited streamgages a source of accurate and timely computations of streamflow particularly at high spatial resolutions has been the national hydrograph dataset nhd a comprehensive geographic information system gis dataset of vector based surface water features such as streams lakes and streamgages in fine detail utilizing the nhd with streamflow data from the u s geological survey and usage records of local water utilities this paper proposes a simple streamflow estimation method that computes streamflow at any point on river reaches of the nhd with valid hydrograph data and tests the method in a local 613 square mile watershed the method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream hydrographs leads to retracing upstream lateral inflows that have eventually arrived at a user selected site between the upstream and downstream gauge stations of the hydrographs at any given time in a common period of record between the two hydrographs subsequently the lateral inflows are added up to become the streamflow for a given site at a given time nhd river networks and arcgis tools identify the locations of lateral inflows and the necessary parameters of the method this paper assesses the results of the method by comparing them to measured streamflows through recommended evaluation statistics and visual inspection the method has yielded promising results including values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency within 0 83 and 0 99 for daily streamflow estimates over seven years it also credibly reconstructs missing daily streamflow over a considerable number of years keywords streamflow estimation high spatial resolution ungauged river site missing discharge data national hydrograph dataset nhd arcgis 1 introduction as short and long term droughts in most u s regions intensify wuebbles et al 2017 the likelihood of water shortages exacerbated by population and economic growth increases in these regions drivers such as climate change place additional stress on water resources u s army corps of engineers 2015 as competition over water resources is more than likely to intensify in the united states streamflow estimated at high spatial resolutions has become critical information for the reliable and equitable management of water resources unfortunately in situ streamgage networks are relatively sparse even in some populated regions of the united states as a result the hydrologic community has developed various methods of estimating discharge at ungauged sites of streams and catchments the most commonly used practice and perhaps oldest method of estimating daily streamflow at ungauged sites is to correlate known streamflows at gauged sites with the unknowns at ungauged sites simply based on drainage area ratios such a method called the drainage area ratio ar method stedinger et al 1993 assumes that both gauged and ungauged sites share the same hydrological and physiographical features except for drainage areas shu and ouarda 2012 more recent studies proposed flow duration curve fdc based methods that achieve the same goal as the ar method but with added sophistication to initially reconstruct or extend missing streamflow data hughes and smakhtin 1996 developed a simple method that spatially interpolates streamflow at target sites from known streamflow data at nearby source sites based on the fundamental assumption that both target and source sites share an equivalent exceedance probability for their streamflows occurring simultaneously smakhtin 1999 further improved the method so that it generates daily streamflow time series even at an ungauged site with a fdc tuned for the site to build the fdc the author adjusted the discharge data available at the nearest gauge by a correction factor that is the ratio of the mean annual runoff or mean daily flow of the ungauged site to that of the gauged site after ranking the adjusted data into a set of ordered discharges smakhtin 1999 then constructed the fdc by plotting each ordered discharge versus the corresponding exceedance probability instead of correlating the fdcs of gauged sites with those of ungauged sites simply based on the constant correction factor shu and ouarda 2012 used multiple linear regression models to reconstruct the fdcs of ungauged sites enhancing the estimation of daily streamflow at the sites the regression models take as independent variables physiographic or climatic features such as the basin area or annual mean total precipitation which they considered the most influential in correctly determining the values of measured discharge at source sites fennessey and vogel 1990 leboutillier and waylen 1993 yu and yang 2000 singh et al 2001 and claps et al 2005 fitted common probability distributions to the plots of ranked discharge versus the exceedance probability at gauged sites and converted them into fdcs at ungauged sites where using regression models with physiographical and climatic features as independent variables these studies identified the distribution parameters of the fdcs alternatively quimpo et al 1983 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 franchini and suppo 1996 yu et al 2002 and mohamoud 2008 used mathematical functions such as polynomial equations to fit fdcs the common limitation of the methods presented above is that the timing of estimated streamflow at an ungauged site is completely dependent on the timings of streamflow data at referenced gauges archfield and vogel 2010 even though geostatistical approaches such as ordinary kriging or its variants can statistically identify the correlation between streamflows at an ungauged site and at a potential reference site as demonstrated in the previous studies related to streamflow estimation archfield and vogel 2010 chokmani and ouarda 2004 sauquet 2006 sauquet et al 2008 skøien and blöschl 2007 2006 villeneuve et al 1979 they do not always select the reference gauges most correlated with streamflow at an ungauged site furthermore even if they select among potential candidates streamflow data that are indeed highly correlated with streamflow at an ungauged site the quality of computed timings of estimated streamflow at the site entirely depends on the level of the correlation to overcome the shortage of in situ discharge data especially in scarcely populated areas and the developing world at the global scale recent studies have implemented space based data along with limited ground based discharge measurements primarily for model calibration to estimate discharge time series for ungauged rivers to spatially interpolate discharge in ungauged sites smith et al 1995 1996 smith 1997 and smith and pavelsky 2008 used remotely sensed river width data to construct reach averaged width discharge rating curves in the form of fitted power functions kouraev et al 2004 used satellite altimetry data to develop empirical rating curves between altimeter water level and in situ discharge measurement to estimate river discharge from the satellite water level data bjerklie et al 2005 2003 first attempted to calculate river discharge entirely based on remotely sensed data such as the width level and slope of water surface and water velocity birkinshaw et al 2014 using remote sensing data developed a method of estimating daily discharge at an ungauged river site with the satellite estimates of both channel data such as the width and slope and river hydraulic data such as the stage and surface width of a river and fed the estimates into an empirical equation bjerklie et al 2003 that calculates river discharge entirely based on the remotely sensed data the equation is fundamentally built upon uniform and steady flow the parameters of which are calibrated using multiple regression analysis of sample data sets of discharge and hydraulic conditions measured from a wide range of selected rivers across the world as the empirical equations however are limited to the sample data that is typical fluvial features of the selected rivers in this case the use of the equation for rivers and streams other than those selected may not produce as accurate results as it does for the selected rivers bjerklie et al 2003 also showed that the equation attained greater precision for larger discharges in other words it is less suited for small rivers and streams or for the low flow regimes of major rivers gleason and smith 2014 and gleason et al 2014 developed a method of transforming satellite observed river widths into reach averaged discharges at any site by power laws the parameters of which they sought via heuristic algorithms for minimizing the difference between the discharges of cross sections the studies however cautioned that the method should not be used for river reaches with nearby lateral inflows or hydraulic controls flow variations of several orders of magnitude or river widths narrower than 100 m liu et al 2015 integrated swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 and xsect moyer and bennett 2007 models into a genetic algorithm framework to estimate river discharge and depth for ungauged sites on river reaches and tributaries the approach used only remotely sensed data such as water levels and water extents to calibrate parameters significantly extending its use for estimating discharge to ungauged sites where any ground based measurements are typically scarce however liu et al 2015 showed that discharge estimates for tributaries were not as accurate as for main river reaches primarily because satellite measurement errors in water levels and water surface areas used for model calibration generally increase as the sizes of channels decrease the first attempt at delivering observed data of changes in surface water storage and its fluxes at a global scale is the surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission to be launched in late 2020 biancamaria et al 2015 to explore the potential of all information provided by swot recent studies proposed various discharge estimation methods specifically designed for potential swot data garambois and monnier 2015 proposed a method of inverting bathymetry roughness and thus discharge based on the 1d saint venant equations from synthetic swot data durand et al 2014 investigated the potential of a method that inverts the bathymetry and roughness coefficients from the forthcoming swot data of the elevation and slope of water surface and then derives river discharge based on manning s equation alternatively yoon et al 2013 and paiva et al 2015 used optimal spatiotemporal interpolation methods based on statistical methods e g kriging to estimate discharge unknown in both space and time with given synthetic swot data paiva et al 2015 developed a kriging based statistical model that estimates continuous discharge values across a river network including ungauged sites based on synthetic radar altimeter data from swot that are not continuous in both space and time the authors analytically derived a spatiotemporal correlation function in the model that statistically relates discharges at two different locations and times along a river network based on a linearized diffusive wave model with the constant parameters of celerity and diffusivity yoon et al 2013 also developed a local spatiotemporal ordinary kriging with swot altimetry data to interpolate water elevation at unobserved times that are in between every repeat cycle of the swot mission instead of using these optimal spatiotemporal interpolation methods biancamaria et al 2011 durand et al 2008 yoon et al 2012 pedinotti et al 2014 and oubanas et al 2018 used data assimilation methods that improved the calibration of hydraulic hydrologic models with assimilated swot data for delivering a more accurate estimate of discharge despite the growing potential of using satellite data the swot data in particular for solving the issue of lacking discharge measurements at the global scale alsdorf et al 2007 argued that satellite based discharge estimation will never achieve precision on par with that of in situ discharge measurements and thus should not be considered a replacement for measured data furthermore pavelsky et al 2014 argued that the extent of swot observability is limited to rivers wider than 50 100 m biancamaria et al 2015 pavelsky et al 2014 also assumed that for river basins smaller than 10 000 km2 in the united states swot will observe only a fraction of rivers and no rivers when its observability threshold is 50 and 100 m respectively above all biancamaria et al 2015 clearly stated that in most cases in situ gauges are far more accurate in estimating discharge at associated locations than any remotely sensed data including swot they also argued that for the purpose of managing water resources gauged discharge data should be used instead of remote sensing discharge estimates because managing water inherently or legally requires highly precise information the need for the timely calculation of streamflow in such spatial detail has prompted the recent application of gis based river networks e g the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus mckay et al 2012 with a number of streamflow estimation models e g river routing methods in regions of the continental united states david et al 2011 used the nhdplus with the routing application for parallel computation discharge rapid model to compute 15 minute streamflows in individual 5 175 nhdplus river reaches for the san antonio and guadalupe basins the computed nhdplus river reaches were an average of 3 km long with catchment areas of an average of 5 11 km2 they used the traditional muskingum method cunge 1969 of the rapid to route runoffs on and below the land surface which were provided by the noah mp land surface model niu et al 2007 with a 900 m grid cell size the rapid adopts a matrix formulation for the muskingum method that enables the computation of streamflows at many thousands of reaches by a linear system solver as the rapid model calculates streamflow at the level of individual nhdplus river reaches associating each streamflow estimate with one exact geographic location particularly ungauged sites is simple enabling the estimation of streamflow at almost any precise location along a river lin et al 2018 together with the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 to feed its resulting runoff to the rapid as lateral inflow tavakoly et al 2017 also used the nhdplus to estimate streamflow for 1 2 million nhdplus river reaches at intervals of 30 min during a ten year period in the past with an average length of reaches of 1 93 km and an average drainage area for each reach of 2 7 km2 the national flood interoperability experiment nfie is a demonstration version of a near real time flood data modeling forecasting and inundation mapping system for the continental united states at high spatial resolutions maidment 2017 the nfie also used the nhdplus based on which the rapid routed runoffs the average nhdplus reach length for the routing is 2 km and average area of the reach catchments is 3 km2 the nfie provides high resolution streamflow information of 2 7 million nhdplus stream reaches used for real time flood inundation mapping this information in turn assists local emergency response communities with planning proper flood response actions the developments of such high spatial resolution streamflow models david et al 2011 lin et al 2018 maidment 2017 tavakoly et al 2017 are primarily attributed to advancements in geographic information system gis technologies moore and dewald 2016 gis based river networks are generally represented by two basic types of datasets raster and vector datasets tavakoly et al 2017 raster datasets define space as arrays of equally sized grid cells and vector datasets represent geographic features such as streams or lakes as points lines or polygons models using raster datasets to calculate river flow through the grid cells of river networks generally require running gis tools that create a digital elevation model dem without erroneous sinks flow directions resulting accumulated flows and the delineation of related catchments in sequence the model delineates catchments in relatively coarse resolution and associating geospatial datasets such as vector based stream gauge layers with common raster based river networks can lead to a loss of physical details because of their low resolutions tavakoly et al 2017 on the other hand vector based river networks built on topographic maps have been increasingly available at both continental and global scales in the form of gis datasets one example is the national hydrography dataset nhd a comprehensive gis geospatial dataset of vector based surface water features such as rivers and lakes in the contiguous united states at a medium resolution of 1 100 000 scale u s geological survey 2018 the nhd contains a flow direction network that traces the movement of water along channels either downstream or upstream in addition a reach addressing system in the nhd allows the vector layers such as gauging stations to easily link to specific geographic locations along river networks without compromising any physical details of the vector datasets moore and dewald 2016 the links also integrate multiple attributes related to the vector layers into a type of object oriented relational database that substantially facilitates the interaction between common and added data layers lehner and grill 2013 furthermore using vector based instead of raster based river networks in river routing can significantly lower the required computational costs after all for example the modeling with a large raster based lake feature composed of thousands of grid cells requires that each cell object be processed however the modeling with a vector based feature of the same lake requires that only a single object such as a polygon be treated lehner and grill 2013 another gis dataset nhdplus is an integrated suite of readily applicable gis geospatial datasets built upon combining vector information from the nhd and the watershed boundary dataset wbd with land surface elevation represented by the national elevation dataset ned mckay et al 2012 to reap the full benefit of the vector based gis geospatial dataset this paper presents a simple method of estimating streamflow at any location including ungauged sites or gauged sites with missing data based on the high resolution surface water data of the nhd as well as the usgs streamgage data this method however can be applied to only parts of rivers those in which hydrograph information at both the upstream and downstream ends is available furthermore the method is limited to a common period of record between the two hydrographs section 2 of the paper begins by explaining the assumptions and the theoretical background of the new streamflow estimation method and section 3 presents the selected drainage basin with various input data to the method section 4 discusses the results of the application and assesses the performance of the method and section 5 the limitations and uncertainties of the method finally section 6 summarizes and discusses future work 2 methods 2 1 model assumptions the proposed method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of upstream peak or bottom base flows to those of corresponding downstream flows leads to identifying tributary or water utility inflows that have eventually become the parts of streamflow at a given time for any location between the upstream and downstream to identify the timings of flows this paper defines bottom base flow as the smallest flow in a falling limb of a hydrograph and peak flow as the largest flow in a ring limb displayed in fig 1 in practice bottom base flow is identified at the time immediately after consecutive zero or negative slopes and immediately before a significant positive slope along the curve of a hydrograph the significance of positive slopes is measured by a proposed threshold parameter further explained in section 2 2 subsequently peak flow occurs as the largest flow between the two most adjacent bottom base flows in time such identified peak bottom base flow in an upstream hydrograph is paired with similarly identified peak bottom base flow from a downstream hydrograph based on temporal proximities between the same type of flows described in fig 1 of course the upstream peak flow always occurs before it appears in the downstream likewise bottom base flow occurs in the upstream before in the downstream the timings of the matched peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream are connected by linear functions over a time space domain shown in fig 2 the space axis represents the distance along a river channel measured from an upstream hydrograph station to any point downstream before a downstream hydrograph station as a result the average speeds of water movement between the two stations are derived from the slopes of the linear functions thus lateral inflows that enter a river channel at different locations and times travel along a channel with different but constant speeds throughout its journey finally this method estimates streamflow at a user selected time and site by adding up individual upstream tributary and water utility inflows that have arrived at a given site and time after traveling at their own guided speeds as river flow response is generally unsteady and non uniform the above assumptions intrinsically render the method limited in estimating actual streamflow for example the assumption of constant speeds only valid for one dimensional uniform and steady flow without any backwater effects caused by channel constrictions bridges dams and tributary inflows can lead to significant estimation errors in addition the method allows no loss of water during the travel of lateral inflows along a river channel however such loss in reality does occur for example through seepage in channel beds or banks or water retention on floodplains similarly although the method allows for no water gain during travel such gain in reality can take place for example via groundwater discharge however such limitations of the method can either positively or negatively impact the results depending on various factors including longitudinal and cross sectional channel geometries river bed and bank material types backwater effects at various confluences and connectivity between a channel and a floodplain their impact depends primarily on the extent of the individual influences of these factors another factor affecting the performance of the method is the accuracy of flow data from tributaries and water utilities one approach to alleviating these constraints is gauge based adjustment which applies the differences between the estimated and observed flows at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to estimated stream flows at tested sites using linear interpolations in space more details are provided in section 2 3 2 2 pairing peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream the proposed method consists of two sub methods one pairs upstream peak or bottom base flows with the same type of flows in the downstream and the other calculates time averaged streamflows at user selected sites and times by combining related lateral inflows occurred in the upstream lateral inflow includes tributary inflow or water withdrawn negative or returned positive from utilities that enters a river channel as an addition to upstream flow of a river in the first sub method bottom base flows from an upstream hydrograph are first paired with those from a downstream hydrograph based on the conditions that 1 an upstream bottom base flow always takes place before or at the same time as a downstream bottom base flow and 2 the pairing is a one to one relationship that prioritizes a match with the shortest temporal distance between upstream and downstream bottom base flows among possible matches under the same conditions an upstream peak flow within each time set of two bottom base flows in a row such as t i ub t i 1 ub in fig 1 is then paired with a downstream peak flow within a time set such as t i db t i 1 db of downstream bottom base flows that have been paired with their respective counterparts in the upstream when paired peak flows do not meet the first condition the method searches for the next largest flow primarily from the upstream hydrograph until it satisfies the condition note that despite the possibility of multiple peak flows between the timings of two consecutive bottom base flows the method seeks only a single peak flow ultimately the timings of these paired flows but not their flow values are used for retracing relevant lateral inflows for estimating streamflow by the second sub method which will be further explained in section 2 3 before the pairing takes place the first sub method scales down each usgs streamflow time series data at an upstream or downstream end of a river reach by dividing all the data by the largest amount of streamflow of each ever recorded so the transformed data sit on a scale of zero to unity this transformation is helpful in singling out flows to be paired bottom base flow in particular for the following two reasons one is that even though base flows theoretically occur in the smooth receding limbs of a hydrograph upticks along the receding curves usually take place causing difficulty for a computer to detect whether flow is truly declining the transformation easily converts the small increases into those that are sufficiently small and insignificant and whose values are defined and thus detected by installing a threshold parameter of a tiny positive decimal digit number as a result the small increases are easily filtered out preventing a computer from mistaking them for ones on any rising limbs the other reason is that hydrographs generally have different rates of rising or falling discharge in this case although a typical range of small positive changes of streamflow to one hydrograph can be treated as an insignificant increase such changes could be too large for another hydrograph therefore it is quite difficult to apply a single value of the threshold parameter to all hydrographs to consistently screen out any misleading positive upticks in their falling curves in summary the scale down treatment above tones down the impact of the raw positive rises it facilitates the detection of deceptive increases consistently across hydrographs under the same scale with a single value of the parameter in practice estimation of the value of the parameter starts with a large initial value such as 0 1 and incrementally reduces the value until a visual inspection of the paired flows confirms that the matching conditions are all met fig 1 conceptually shows a series of timings connected by dashed and dot dash lines for paired peak and paired bottom base flows between upstream and downstream hydrographs the small hump after the first upstream peak flow in the figure is apparently treated as an insignificant rise in the streamflow for the sake of simplicity distances from the upstream hydrograph station to lateral inflows i e confluences of tributaries or water utilities with a main river to streamgages or to sites of interest are calculated along river channels based on the nhd river network i e positive in the flow direction and negative in the opposite direction and are then divided by the total distance such calculated between the two hydrograph stations hence as described in fig 2 such a transformed distance at the upstream station takes a value of zero and at the downstream station a value of one in addition while transformed distances for lateral inflows located before the distance of zero take negative values of y w j those located after the distance of zero take positive values of y w j 2 3 estimating streamflow at user selected times and locations in the second sub method an average streamflow over the computational time step k k 1 at a given distance yon the transformed space is computed by 1 u k y 0 5 q k y q k 1 y i 1 1 δ t 1 q k i δ t y δ t 1 where δt is a time interval smaller than unity that divides the time step k k 1 into 1 δ t uniform subintervals the value of can take any value between 0 and 1 so the streamflow at any site on a river reach between the chosen upstream and downstream hydrograph stations can be estimated by this method q k i δ t y is the calculated discharge at distance and at time k i δ t for i 1 1 δ t 1 q k y is the discharge when i 0 and q k 1 y when i 1 δ t u k y is a time weighted sum of nonlinear functions q k i δ t y evaluated at uniformly divided partition points within the time span k k 1 the numerator is the value of area under function q t y on a close interval k k 1 approximated based on the trapezoid rule by adding up the areas of all trapezoids standing on their respective subintervals k i δ t k i 1 δ t for i 0 1 δ t 1 the denominator shows the combined temporal lengths of the subintervals in fig 2 q k i δ t y is computed by adding up the estimated discharges of upstream lateral inflows that meet with line f k i δ t y t and that entered a river channel at separate times before k i δ t but that all have eventually arrived at k i δ t and at y since the values of lateral inflows are approximated by linear interpolations from known values as described in eq 3 the values of q k i δ t y rapidly converge as δt decreases the process of selecting individual lateral inflows and estimating their values which eventually become part of q k i δ t y is explained as follows it begins by drawing a so called linear retrace function that identifies lateral inflows standing on the linear path of the function at their respective timings and locations for example lateral inflow w k i δ t y t y w j in fig 2 on the linear path of retrace function f k i δ t y t for the identified lateral inflows the retrace function retraces past times when the individual inflows were added to a main river at their confluences subsequently the traced times determine how much water the lateral inflows contributed to a river at their own entries based on eq 3 the added amounts are assumed not to change during their entire course of travel and they become part of q k i δ t y along their journeys since the retraced times typically do not coincide with data recorded times the values of the lateral inflows at such traced timings are subsequently estimated by interpolating the values of lateral inflows at recorded times immediately before and immediately after the traced timings the values at the recorded times here can be amounts that are either measured or estimated by other means this second sub method implements three steps for computing the values of lateral inflows at the traced timings above as the first step the sub method formulates linear retrace functions first as in the following example for any given k i δ t and y in fig 2 it builds retrace function f k i δ t y t by a slope interpolated between slopes m s and m s 1 of two linear lines on both sides of the function and data point k i δ t y the condition of selecting the two linear lines is that they connect the timings of the paired peak and the paired bottom base flows labeled by t i up t i dp and t i ub t i db as in fig 2 while passing location y either immediately before or immediately after k i δ t in fig 3 t i 1 y and t i 2 y represent the times immediately before and after k i δ t respectively the slope of the retrace function is then computed by 2 m k i δ t y t i 2 y k i δ t t i 2 y t i 1 y m s k i δ t t i 1 y t i 2 y t i 1 y m s 1 eq 2 means the resulting slope is a linearly weighted average between slopes m s and m s 1 with weights being inversely proportional to the respective temporal distances of the two lines to k i δ t at y fig 2 shows that as i increases k i δ t could become k l δ t whose retrace function no longer depends on the two slopes m s and m s 1 but needs to move on to a new couple e g m s 1 and m s 2 to build a new function f k l δ t y t the value of m k i δ t y physically represents a constant speed of lateral inflows that are all identified by the linear path of f k i δ t y t at their confluence points in the upstream of at this speed the identified lateral flows are expected to arrive at k i δ t and even though their travel times differ because they entered a river at different times after building the linear retrace function in the first step the sub method retraces the timings when the identified lateral inflows entered as the second step and then estimates the added amounts at the confluence points as the third step shown in the following example when the retrace function from the first step identifies a lateral inflow w k i δ t y t y w j at its confluence of distance y w j and at some time before k i δ t then the timing is retraced by the inverse of f k i δ t y t with a value of y w j denoted by t k i δ t y y w j in fig 3 since the timing usually falls within a time step of the flow record seemingly between k 1 and k in this example the third step estimates the value of w k i δ t y t y w j with t t k i δ t y y w j by interpolating two known data recorded immediately before and immediately after the traced timing for the interpolation as described in fig 4 it uses the values of the lateral inflow records w j k p w j and w j k p 1 w j at their recorded times k p w j and k p 1 w j in the equation below with t t k i δ t y y w j 3 w k i δ t y t y w j k p 1 w j t w j k p w j t k p w j w j k p 1 w j eq 3 also shows that the temporal distances from the recorded times to the timings identified by the retrace function affect the value of w k i δ t y t y w j in an inversely proportional way this value becomes a part of the amount of q k i δ t y in eq 1 after it has traveled along a river channel from time t k i δ t y y w j to k i δ t the sub method applies the three steps to every lateral inflow met on the linear path of the retrace function in order to compute their added values to a river which are eventually carried over into the value of q k i δ t y after the three steps are complete the value of streamflow at k i δ t and is computed by 4 q k i δ t y j n tr j m n tr j w k i δ t y t t k i δ t y y w j y w j where n tr j m is the number of lateral inflows in the upstream of of zero and n tr j is the number of lateral inflows from of zero to downstream immediately before instead of using lateral inflows upstream of of zero the sub method could use only one discharge value on the upstream hydrograph picked at the time when the retrace function passes through with of zero hence instead it would add the discharge value to the right hand side of eq 4 and take the value of n tr j m zero however as the single discharge value is primarily limited to reflect all individual impacts of the lateral inflows taking the lateral inflows over the single discharge from the upstream hydrograph generally leads to a more accurate prediction of u k y if the length of a river above of zero however were much longer or if any hydrologic feature of the portion of a river significantly differed from the remaining portion the sub method would have to use the upstream hydrograph because applying the retrace function too far beyond its own boundary would simply invite the intrinsic curse of extrapolation the results of eq 4 for different i s are fed into the right hand side of eq 1 to produce the value of u k y up to this point the upstream and downstream hydrographs are used only to guide the slope of f k i δ t y t now the sub method takes the differences between the estimated and measured streamflows at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to further improve the estimate of streamflow of user selected sites between the stations l y 0 k and l y 1 k are the known estimation errors at the upstream and the downstream stations respectively and are calculated by 5 l y 0 k q u k u k y 0 l y 1 k q d k u k y 1 where q u k and q d k are the upstream and downstream discharges measured at time k respectively and u k y 0 and u k y 1 are the respective counterparts estimated by eq 1 with of zero and one next the error in estimating streamflow at k and l k y is approximated using retrace function f k y t which in this case linearly traces the timings of presumably the most related estimation errors at both the upstream and downstream stations to l k y the traced timing of the upstream is labeled t k y y 0 and that of the downstream t k y y 1 t k i δ t y y w j in fig 4 changes to these timings when y w j becomes of zero or one and when f k i δ t y t becomes f k y t similar to eq 3 when t k y y 0 falls between streamflow measured times k p 0 and k p 1 0 the corresponding estimation error is linearly interpolated in time in an inversely proportional way 6 l k y t y 0 k p 1 0 t l y 0 k p 0 t k p 0 l y 0 k p 1 0 where t takes the value of t k y y 0 in this case the superscript 0 in k p 0 indicates the streamflow of the upstream hydrograph when t k y y 1 falls between k p 1 and k p 1 1 the related estimation error at the downstream station l k y t y 1 is also estimated by eq 6 after all zeros of are replaced by ones and the superscript of k p 0 or k p 1 0 is replaced by superscript 1 using these calculated estimation errors the value of l k y is then spatially interpolated by 7 l k y y l k y t k y y 1 y 1 1 y l k y t k y y 0 y 0 the estimation error occurring spatially close to y has more influence on l k y than the error occurring farther away from it finally l k y is added to the computed values of u k y in eq 8 producing improved values 8 u k y u k y l k y it is worthwhile noting that l k y based solely on f k y t does not represent an average value over time step k k 1 as u k y in eq 1 does after all to ensure that the value of u k y with being 0 or 1 is equal to that of q u k or q d k respectively l k y must be equal to l y 0 k when is 0 or l y 1 k when y is 1 it is only possible when i is zero for f k i δ t y t fig 5 presents a concise summary of the entire procedure of the two sub methods 2 4 model evaluation guidelines to assess the method by how close its results are to measured streamflows this paper proposes using a combination of graphical techniques and four evaluation statistics it also implements a descriptive performance rating that has been used by other studies including moriasi et al 2007 for evaluating several streamflow estimation models including swat the soil and water assessment tool and hspf hydrological simulation program fortran graphical techniques include the hydrographs of estimated and measured streamflows as well as graphs showing the estimation errors in timing peak flow the four evaluation statistics are 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 the nse using log transformed flows oudin et al 2006 3 the root mean square error rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 and 4 the percent bias pbias all of these evaluation methods are recommended by moriasi et al 2007 for their merit of the four nse is the best statistic for evaluating the overall fit of a hydrograph servat and dezetter 1991 and it focuses more on high extreme flows nse is given as 9 nse 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q mean 2 where q i obs and q i sim are the i th observed and simulated streamflows respectively q mean is the mean of the observed streamflow and n is the total number of observations on the other hand nse computed with log transformed streamflows shifts the focus more on the performance of low flow than high flow oudin et al 2006 nse ranges from to 1 0 with 1 0 being a perfect match of model estimates to measured data and with 0 0 indicating that model estimates are as accurate as the mean of the measured data rmse is a commonly used error index statistics method singh et al 2004 and the rsr is calculated as the ratio of rmse to the standard deviation of the measured data moriasi et al 2007 10 rsr i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q mean 2 since rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between estimated unbiased and measured values rsr is also the ratio of the sample standard deviation of the residuals i e the difference to the sample standard deviation of the measured values as the lower value of rsr represents the lower rmse it results in more accurate model performance pbias shows the average tendency of simulated values to be either larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 the lower value of pbias indicates more accurate simulation with 0 0 being the perfect value while its positive values point to underestimation bias its negative values indicate overestimation bias the equation is given by 11 pbias i 1 n q i obs q i sim 100 i 1 n q i obs lastly table 1 lists the descriptive meanings of individual numeric ranges of the selected evaluation statistics for estimates of monthly time steps generally less strict implementation of the descriptive performance rating is warranted for estimates of daily time steps moriasi et al 2007 3 data 3 1 selected drainage basin and usgs streamflow gauges this study selected a drainage basin of 613 square miles through which the etowah river runs located in northwestern georgia the main reasons for choosing this basin are that 1 a selected 54 mile stretch of the etowah river contains five usgs streamgage stations each with different periods of record but a well overlapped period between the farthest upstream and farthest downstream stations listed in table 2 2 the stations at the two ends therefore provide the hydrographs for paring peak or bottom base flows and the remaining three stations either with or without missing data provide records whose estimated flows at their sites can be compared 3 well maintained usage data from various types of water utilities are available across the state of georgia including this basin and 4 an additional usgs streamgage with minimum human impact is available at a sub basin in the upper region of the river basin in the study thus the gauge can be used as a reference gauge for estimating the inflow amounts from other tributaries based on their respective drainage area ratios although more sophisticated rainfall runoff models could be implemented for a closer estimation of sub basin runoffs and thus tributary inflows the drainage area ratio method is more commonly used because of its simplicity and acceptable reliability emerson et al 2005 therefore this study not only shows the compatibility of the drainage area ratio method with the streamflow estimation method of this paper but also leaves the door open for further improvement of this method by adopting rainfall runoff models that represent elaborate hydrologic features and the impact of local weather and terrestrial characteristics in greater detail 3 2 national hydrography dataset nhd as shown in fig 6 this study examined a 54 mile stretch of the etowah river from ga136 to canton on the map and computed the streamflow at the sites of the five streamgages the proposed method can be used for any other sites of interest along the stretch but the selected sites provide measured values that can be compared in practice the site is equal to any point on the vector based river reaches of the nhd the study used the recorded hydrographs at ga136 and canton for constructing retrace functions and thus estimating streamflows within the stretch and set the usgs amicalola creek streamgage marked by the black pushpin as a reference gauge based on which inflows of all tributary networks in the studied river basin were estimated by multiplying its streamflow per unit area by the drainage area of each tributary network in this study a tributary network refers to a group of connected tributaries that work as one to drain its surrounding sub basins into a shared outlet along the etowah river at each point where a tributary network joins the river from the headwater upstream above ga136 to canton the study used the drainage area ratio method to estimate the amount of the lateral inflow if any water utilities have used water from any tributary network their water usage data were added to the inflow estimates of the network when the utilities have used water directly from the river however the study considered the water usage data separately at their own entry points along the river a series of tributary networks and water utilities were identified by applying the arcmap utility network analyst toolbar with its function of trace upstream to the nhd stream networks using the usgs streamstats u s geological survey 2012 the drainage area of each tributary network was then computed the river stretch in this study has 75 tributary networks 25 of which are located above ga136 and the rest below fig 7 depicts drainage area and the river distance that is the distance measured along a river channel of every network as well as the usgs stations an arcmap statistics tool measured the river distance using the values of lengthkm attributed to related nhd stream reaches lengthkm measures the length of each reach of the nhdflowline in kilometers both the arcmap utility network analyst toolbar and the arcmap statistics tool involve the simple tasks of tracing the functioning geometric networks of the nhdflowline or simply adding up associated lengthkms and they run only a single time before the method begins to run thus the numerical cost of running these tools even for larger basins should be insignificant 3 3 time period of the study among the available periods of record of the six usgs gauges and water utilities a common period beginning on november 1 2007 and ending on december 30 2014 was selected this study delivered the estimation of daily discharges at the sites of ga136 through canton which were then compared with their measured counterparts even though the estimation at both ga136 and canton became perfect after accounting for the errors from eq 8 note that the study used measured data at only ga136 and canton to calibrate the method and left untouched the data from the remaining stations until it used them to assess the model performance over each available period of record at the stations 4 results 4 1 results of the first sub method fig 8 illustrates three series of paired peak and paired bottom base flows resulting from running the first sub method with the threshold parameter of 0 005 found after several trials with incremental decreases from initially 0 1 each trial was followed by a visual inspection of the paired flows primarily to check if the matching conditions in the sub method were met as shown in fig 8 the identified upstream flows always took place before or at the same time as their downstream counterparts and the one to one relationships in the pairing were thoroughly maintained furthermore the single largest flow was chosen over a window between the timings of two consecutive bottom base flows even if multiple peaks existed 4 2 results of the second sub method 4 2 1 before gauge based adjustment across tested sites first of all to determine the proper size of δt for the second sub method the value of δt was iteratively decreased by a factor of 2 with an initial value of 0 5 as a result the rmses between the estimated canton streamflows of the current iteration and the previous iteration were 16 71 3 33 0 86 0 25 0 07 and 0 03 as the iteration proceeded seven times because of the rapid convergence toward the end of the iteration this study chose a value of 0 01 for δt as demonstrated in fig 9 estimated streamflows across the stations matched their measured counterparts overall even before accounting for the estimation errors of the ga136 and canton stations to be redistributed to the entire stations along the river this claim is statistically supported by the nse values ranging from 0 58 to 0 88 in the second row of table 3 these values fall within satisfactory good and very good performance ratings according to table 1 even with the daily computational time steps while nse is more susceptible to errors in high flow nse with log transformed flows is more susceptible to errors in low flow the values of nse with log transformed flows ranging from 0 75 to 0 93 in table 3 clearly shows that the method more closely estimated low flow than high flow in addition the negative values of pbias across the stations indicate that the method tends to overestimate rather than underestimate the rsr values ranging from 0 34 to 0 65 demonstrate that the spread of the estimated streamflows from the measured streamflows is about 34 65 of the corresponding standard deviations of their respective measured values as is evident across the values of all the statistics in the second row of table 3 the performance of the method generally deteriorates as the applied location moves downstream two explanations are posited for this finding one is the simple assumptions of the method including constant speeds of lateral inflows and the inability to account for the loss or the gain of lateral inflow in travel along a river channel and the other is its use of a single reference streamgage for estimating the daily lateral inflow of every tributary network in the studied river basin archfield and vogel 2010 found that a reference streamgage selected based on a correlation between daily streamflow time series rather than the distance between sites leads to significantly more accurate estimates of daily streamflow at ungauged sites hence after taking the logarithms of daily streamflows of all the stations to further linearize the relationships between pairs of streamgages this study computed the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r between the streamgage on amicalola creek and the streamgages of the stations in the etowah river the results were 0 98 0 97 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 for the pairs of amicalola creek with either ga136 ga9 kelly bridge i575 or canton respectively although the correlation values decrease almost negligibly toward the downstream such a finding could nevertheless evoke the use of another reference streamgage for estimating the inflows of tributary networks near the i575 and canton stations furthermore smakhtin 1999 recommended using several nearby reference streamgages rather than single one to more accurately identify the timing of streamflow at ungauged sites evidently the gray dots in fig 11 show that while the timings of peak flow estimated at stations both closer to and more correlated with the reference streamgage more closely match the measured timings those estimated at the i575 and canton stations both of which are farther from and less correlated to the reference gauge are almost a day earlier than the measured timings if the timings of the tributary inflows had been gradually delayed as they moved downstream the estimated timings of peak flows would have been more accurate particularly at the downstream stations therefore the underperforming statistics downstream can be enhanced by either integrating other nearby reference gauges or running sophisticated rainfall runoff models in this study however the former was not possible because there were no nearby reference gauges and the latter is beyond the scope of this study future work could investigate these approaches 4 2 2 after gauge based adjustment across tested sites after the gauge based adjustments were redistributed by eqs 5 8 the performance ratings of all of the statistics across the stations except for pbias at the kelly bridge u2 were very good shown in the last row of table 3 if more measured data had been available the pbias value for the station may also have rated very good one positive aspect of the results for this station however is that the reconstructed streamflows over such a long missing period six out of seven years could fill the missing gap based on both the good to very good ratings across the statistics and the comparable hydrographs in fig 10 at the station over the period of record the last one year measured data over a longer period would further support this claim as the exact differences between the measured and estimated streamflows are known the adjusted streamflows at both the ga136 and canton stations are obviously identical to their measured counterparts nevertheless it is important to note that the gauge based adjustment enhanced all the statistics significantly of the stations between the two locations except for the aforementioned kelly bridge u2 where a slight overestimation led to a significant underestimation according to the pbias values and ga9 u1 where the nse of the log transformed flows dropped by 0 05 one interpretation of these results is that the method of approximating estimation errors at any given time and location using eqs 5 7 cannot appease different flow regimes such as low and high flows at the same time the increased nse values throughout the stations indicate that the adjustment enhanced the estimation of their high flows the mixed results of the nse of the log transformed data however suggest that it did not improve the estimation of their low flows to the same extent indeed the results of another evaluation measure the timing of peak flow show that the method worked well particularly for high flows as shown in fig 11 the timings of estimated peak flows at the middle stations i e ga9 kelly bridge and i575 after the adjustment mostly shifted a day later than those before the adjustment aligning with the timings of the measured counterparts if the streamflow estimation before the gauge based adjustment had not such deteriorated into the downstream but instead had remained at a same level of accuracy from upstream to downstream eqs 5 7 might have generated the values of estimation error l k y comparable across the stations which in turn would have led to a steady improvement of streamflow estimation throughout the stations by not favoring one location over the others or one flow regime over another after all the equations are based on the assumption that estimation errors along the linear path of f k y t to the downstream linearly increase or decrease that is abrupt changes of the estimation errors along the path never occur as displayed in table 3 however errors in estimating streamflow increase overall from ga136 to ga9 decrease from ga9 to kelly bridge increase from kelly bridge to i575 and finally decrease again from i575 to canton this nonlinear pattern undermines the effectiveness of the method of approximating l k y that to the contrary depends on linear patterns therefore as argued in section 4 2 1 the expanded use of nearby or more strongly correlated reference gauges or advanced rainfall runoff models would further improve the performance of the method 5 discussion because of the hydrograph data required at both the upstream and downstream ends of river reaches the computational time step of the method is tied to that of the hydrographs and its computation is limited to an overlapping period between the two hydrographs this limitation indicates that the method can be used only for hindcasting not forecasting furthermore the ability of the model to describe natural river flows is limited primarily by the assumption of a constant speed of any lateral inflow during its movement throughout a river channel this constant speed is made valid only for uniform and steady flow but the natural response of rivers is generally non uniform and unsteady therefore under the current assumption errors in estimating streamflow would be significant especially under hydraulic or hydrologic conditions that change drastically between the upstream and downstream ends such conditions include the channel slope the width material types confluence characteristics and connectivity between a channel and a floodplain another such condition is the local weather local heavy rainfall for example could result in flash floods concentrated at local sites in the middle of a river reach of interest which in turn might cause significant backwater at related confluences in addition human controls such as channel constrictions bridges and dams could rapidly change flow regimes the method assumes that lateral inflow changes linearly as time changes within a time step of the flow record as shown in eq 3 which is generally not true particularly when the time step is considerably long e g a day or a week or when rainfall runoff responses of catchments are volatile therefore this assumption can result in an additional error in estimating streamflow the error however could be minimized if lateral inflow records at smaller temporal scales e g by hour or minute were available and used for the linear interpolations of eq 3 at much finer time intervals of course it would in turn require a more thorough search for the proper value of δt as the values of q k i δ t y become more sensitive to the change of δt this study showed that the method is capable of reconstructing reliable streamflow even during significantly long periods of missing data previous studies have devoted efforts to filling in lengthy missing river data yang et al 2010 stressed the need for longer periods of measured data for better reconstructing missing discharge values with regression methods to reconstruct missing daily streamflow data tencaliec et al 2015 applied a combination of linear regression models that deduce linear relationships between target and control gauges and autoregressive integrated moving average models arima naill and momani 2009 that adjust the residuals from the regression models the combined approach however entails an iteration process that involves choosing the most suitable orders and number of lags of related functions and models tencaliec et al 2015 also acknowledged that the choice of a model strongly depends on the location of a target station so it is impossible to have a general form of a model across all target stations calibrating the model of this paper however requires no optimization significantly reducing the computational cost note that this study has applied the method to an extremely small basin so it does not explicitly demonstrate its potential use on significantly large basins without overwhelming numerical costs this simple streamflow estimation method fills in missing values not based on any statistical or optimization procedure that generally entails lengthy periods of record as demonstrated in the above mentioned studies but instead based on the easily available nhd information of tributaries and rivers and the most timely relevant instantaneous data therefore for reconstructing missing data the method is not limited to the available length of measured data 6 conclusion this paper proposed a high spatial resolution streamflow estimation method using the nhd river networks and usgs streamflow data the method can be applied to any point including ungauged sites on the river reaches of the nhd as long as relevant hydrograph data at both the upstream and downstream ends of the river reaches are available and hydrological or channel conditions do not change significantly within the reaches it can also reconstruct missing streamflow data even in the significant lengths of missing data periods the computational time steps of the method coincide with those of recorded hydrograph data an overlapping time period between upstream and downstream hydrographs becomes a simulation period for the method the method first identifies peak or bottom base flows from both upstream and downstream hydrographs and pairs the same type of flows between upstream and downstream hydrographs according to the conditions that 1 an upstream flow always occurs before or at the same time as a downstream counterpart and 2 the pairing is a one to one relationship that prefers a match with the shortest temporal distance between upstream and downstream flows over other matches secondly the method uses the timings of the paired flows to construct linear retrace functions that identify which upstream lateral inflows have eventually become part of the streamflow at a user selected site downstream at a specific time lastly it uses estimation errors at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to adjust streamflow estimates of test sites located between the two hydrograph stations by redistributing the errors to each test site based on linear interpolations in space the method assumes that the speeds of lateral inflows along a river channel are constant and that no loss or gain of the inflows during travel occurs applying the method to the small river basin in the state of georgia this study estimated daily streamflow at the five sites of usgs streamgage stations within the selected river reaches where measured streamflows either with or without missing data were available the results of the application of the four evaluation statistics before the gauge based adjustment exhibited a good overall rating across the stations results after the adjustment showed further improvements with very good ratings for almost all of the statistics across the stations in addition they also demonstrated that the method is capable of reconstructing credible streamflow over missing data periods despite their significant lengths the overall very good rating of the evaluation statistics over the period of record affirmed the quality of the reconstruction assessing and comparing rates of improvement to the statistics at each site both before and after the gauge based adjustment revealed that using several nearby reference streamgages instead of a single one or using advanced rainfall runoff models that more accurately estimate lateral inflow would result in evenly enhanced evaluation statistics for all of the stations in summary this simple method can run at any point within the nhd river reaches as long as they have available hydrographs at both the upper and lower ends with common periods of record equally important is that hydrological physiographical or channel features within the reaches must not abruptly change otherwise the method is simply unusable the proposed method runs basically for hindcasting not for forecasting in forecasting it computes the changes of predicted or measured upstream inflows as they move through a river channel a future study based on a paper by kim and georgakakos 2014 will demonstrate a river routing method that uses the results of this paper as its initial values and then devise a method of routing upstream flows to downstream points without the help of downstream hydrograph data funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors 
7044,the need for a method of estimating streamflow with both high quality and high spatial resolution particularly for ungauged sites is critical under current circumstances intensifying competition over water resources and limited streamgages a source of accurate and timely computations of streamflow particularly at high spatial resolutions has been the national hydrograph dataset nhd a comprehensive geographic information system gis dataset of vector based surface water features such as streams lakes and streamgages in fine detail utilizing the nhd with streamflow data from the u s geological survey and usage records of local water utilities this paper proposes a simple streamflow estimation method that computes streamflow at any point on river reaches of the nhd with valid hydrograph data and tests the method in a local 613 square mile watershed the method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream hydrographs leads to retracing upstream lateral inflows that have eventually arrived at a user selected site between the upstream and downstream gauge stations of the hydrographs at any given time in a common period of record between the two hydrographs subsequently the lateral inflows are added up to become the streamflow for a given site at a given time nhd river networks and arcgis tools identify the locations of lateral inflows and the necessary parameters of the method this paper assesses the results of the method by comparing them to measured streamflows through recommended evaluation statistics and visual inspection the method has yielded promising results including values of the nash sutcliffe efficiency within 0 83 and 0 99 for daily streamflow estimates over seven years it also credibly reconstructs missing daily streamflow over a considerable number of years keywords streamflow estimation high spatial resolution ungauged river site missing discharge data national hydrograph dataset nhd arcgis 1 introduction as short and long term droughts in most u s regions intensify wuebbles et al 2017 the likelihood of water shortages exacerbated by population and economic growth increases in these regions drivers such as climate change place additional stress on water resources u s army corps of engineers 2015 as competition over water resources is more than likely to intensify in the united states streamflow estimated at high spatial resolutions has become critical information for the reliable and equitable management of water resources unfortunately in situ streamgage networks are relatively sparse even in some populated regions of the united states as a result the hydrologic community has developed various methods of estimating discharge at ungauged sites of streams and catchments the most commonly used practice and perhaps oldest method of estimating daily streamflow at ungauged sites is to correlate known streamflows at gauged sites with the unknowns at ungauged sites simply based on drainage area ratios such a method called the drainage area ratio ar method stedinger et al 1993 assumes that both gauged and ungauged sites share the same hydrological and physiographical features except for drainage areas shu and ouarda 2012 more recent studies proposed flow duration curve fdc based methods that achieve the same goal as the ar method but with added sophistication to initially reconstruct or extend missing streamflow data hughes and smakhtin 1996 developed a simple method that spatially interpolates streamflow at target sites from known streamflow data at nearby source sites based on the fundamental assumption that both target and source sites share an equivalent exceedance probability for their streamflows occurring simultaneously smakhtin 1999 further improved the method so that it generates daily streamflow time series even at an ungauged site with a fdc tuned for the site to build the fdc the author adjusted the discharge data available at the nearest gauge by a correction factor that is the ratio of the mean annual runoff or mean daily flow of the ungauged site to that of the gauged site after ranking the adjusted data into a set of ordered discharges smakhtin 1999 then constructed the fdc by plotting each ordered discharge versus the corresponding exceedance probability instead of correlating the fdcs of gauged sites with those of ungauged sites simply based on the constant correction factor shu and ouarda 2012 used multiple linear regression models to reconstruct the fdcs of ungauged sites enhancing the estimation of daily streamflow at the sites the regression models take as independent variables physiographic or climatic features such as the basin area or annual mean total precipitation which they considered the most influential in correctly determining the values of measured discharge at source sites fennessey and vogel 1990 leboutillier and waylen 1993 yu and yang 2000 singh et al 2001 and claps et al 2005 fitted common probability distributions to the plots of ranked discharge versus the exceedance probability at gauged sites and converted them into fdcs at ungauged sites where using regression models with physiographical and climatic features as independent variables these studies identified the distribution parameters of the fdcs alternatively quimpo et al 1983 mimikou and kaemaki 1985 franchini and suppo 1996 yu et al 2002 and mohamoud 2008 used mathematical functions such as polynomial equations to fit fdcs the common limitation of the methods presented above is that the timing of estimated streamflow at an ungauged site is completely dependent on the timings of streamflow data at referenced gauges archfield and vogel 2010 even though geostatistical approaches such as ordinary kriging or its variants can statistically identify the correlation between streamflows at an ungauged site and at a potential reference site as demonstrated in the previous studies related to streamflow estimation archfield and vogel 2010 chokmani and ouarda 2004 sauquet 2006 sauquet et al 2008 skøien and blöschl 2007 2006 villeneuve et al 1979 they do not always select the reference gauges most correlated with streamflow at an ungauged site furthermore even if they select among potential candidates streamflow data that are indeed highly correlated with streamflow at an ungauged site the quality of computed timings of estimated streamflow at the site entirely depends on the level of the correlation to overcome the shortage of in situ discharge data especially in scarcely populated areas and the developing world at the global scale recent studies have implemented space based data along with limited ground based discharge measurements primarily for model calibration to estimate discharge time series for ungauged rivers to spatially interpolate discharge in ungauged sites smith et al 1995 1996 smith 1997 and smith and pavelsky 2008 used remotely sensed river width data to construct reach averaged width discharge rating curves in the form of fitted power functions kouraev et al 2004 used satellite altimetry data to develop empirical rating curves between altimeter water level and in situ discharge measurement to estimate river discharge from the satellite water level data bjerklie et al 2005 2003 first attempted to calculate river discharge entirely based on remotely sensed data such as the width level and slope of water surface and water velocity birkinshaw et al 2014 using remote sensing data developed a method of estimating daily discharge at an ungauged river site with the satellite estimates of both channel data such as the width and slope and river hydraulic data such as the stage and surface width of a river and fed the estimates into an empirical equation bjerklie et al 2003 that calculates river discharge entirely based on the remotely sensed data the equation is fundamentally built upon uniform and steady flow the parameters of which are calibrated using multiple regression analysis of sample data sets of discharge and hydraulic conditions measured from a wide range of selected rivers across the world as the empirical equations however are limited to the sample data that is typical fluvial features of the selected rivers in this case the use of the equation for rivers and streams other than those selected may not produce as accurate results as it does for the selected rivers bjerklie et al 2003 also showed that the equation attained greater precision for larger discharges in other words it is less suited for small rivers and streams or for the low flow regimes of major rivers gleason and smith 2014 and gleason et al 2014 developed a method of transforming satellite observed river widths into reach averaged discharges at any site by power laws the parameters of which they sought via heuristic algorithms for minimizing the difference between the discharges of cross sections the studies however cautioned that the method should not be used for river reaches with nearby lateral inflows or hydraulic controls flow variations of several orders of magnitude or river widths narrower than 100 m liu et al 2015 integrated swat soil and water assessment tool arnold et al 1998 srinivasan et al 1998 and xsect moyer and bennett 2007 models into a genetic algorithm framework to estimate river discharge and depth for ungauged sites on river reaches and tributaries the approach used only remotely sensed data such as water levels and water extents to calibrate parameters significantly extending its use for estimating discharge to ungauged sites where any ground based measurements are typically scarce however liu et al 2015 showed that discharge estimates for tributaries were not as accurate as for main river reaches primarily because satellite measurement errors in water levels and water surface areas used for model calibration generally increase as the sizes of channels decrease the first attempt at delivering observed data of changes in surface water storage and its fluxes at a global scale is the surface water and ocean topography swot satellite mission to be launched in late 2020 biancamaria et al 2015 to explore the potential of all information provided by swot recent studies proposed various discharge estimation methods specifically designed for potential swot data garambois and monnier 2015 proposed a method of inverting bathymetry roughness and thus discharge based on the 1d saint venant equations from synthetic swot data durand et al 2014 investigated the potential of a method that inverts the bathymetry and roughness coefficients from the forthcoming swot data of the elevation and slope of water surface and then derives river discharge based on manning s equation alternatively yoon et al 2013 and paiva et al 2015 used optimal spatiotemporal interpolation methods based on statistical methods e g kriging to estimate discharge unknown in both space and time with given synthetic swot data paiva et al 2015 developed a kriging based statistical model that estimates continuous discharge values across a river network including ungauged sites based on synthetic radar altimeter data from swot that are not continuous in both space and time the authors analytically derived a spatiotemporal correlation function in the model that statistically relates discharges at two different locations and times along a river network based on a linearized diffusive wave model with the constant parameters of celerity and diffusivity yoon et al 2013 also developed a local spatiotemporal ordinary kriging with swot altimetry data to interpolate water elevation at unobserved times that are in between every repeat cycle of the swot mission instead of using these optimal spatiotemporal interpolation methods biancamaria et al 2011 durand et al 2008 yoon et al 2012 pedinotti et al 2014 and oubanas et al 2018 used data assimilation methods that improved the calibration of hydraulic hydrologic models with assimilated swot data for delivering a more accurate estimate of discharge despite the growing potential of using satellite data the swot data in particular for solving the issue of lacking discharge measurements at the global scale alsdorf et al 2007 argued that satellite based discharge estimation will never achieve precision on par with that of in situ discharge measurements and thus should not be considered a replacement for measured data furthermore pavelsky et al 2014 argued that the extent of swot observability is limited to rivers wider than 50 100 m biancamaria et al 2015 pavelsky et al 2014 also assumed that for river basins smaller than 10 000 km2 in the united states swot will observe only a fraction of rivers and no rivers when its observability threshold is 50 and 100 m respectively above all biancamaria et al 2015 clearly stated that in most cases in situ gauges are far more accurate in estimating discharge at associated locations than any remotely sensed data including swot they also argued that for the purpose of managing water resources gauged discharge data should be used instead of remote sensing discharge estimates because managing water inherently or legally requires highly precise information the need for the timely calculation of streamflow in such spatial detail has prompted the recent application of gis based river networks e g the national hydrography dataset plus nhdplus mckay et al 2012 with a number of streamflow estimation models e g river routing methods in regions of the continental united states david et al 2011 used the nhdplus with the routing application for parallel computation discharge rapid model to compute 15 minute streamflows in individual 5 175 nhdplus river reaches for the san antonio and guadalupe basins the computed nhdplus river reaches were an average of 3 km long with catchment areas of an average of 5 11 km2 they used the traditional muskingum method cunge 1969 of the rapid to route runoffs on and below the land surface which were provided by the noah mp land surface model niu et al 2007 with a 900 m grid cell size the rapid adopts a matrix formulation for the muskingum method that enables the computation of streamflows at many thousands of reaches by a linear system solver as the rapid model calculates streamflow at the level of individual nhdplus river reaches associating each streamflow estimate with one exact geographic location particularly ungauged sites is simple enabling the estimation of streamflow at almost any precise location along a river lin et al 2018 together with the variable infiltration capacity vic model liang et al 1994 to feed its resulting runoff to the rapid as lateral inflow tavakoly et al 2017 also used the nhdplus to estimate streamflow for 1 2 million nhdplus river reaches at intervals of 30 min during a ten year period in the past with an average length of reaches of 1 93 km and an average drainage area for each reach of 2 7 km2 the national flood interoperability experiment nfie is a demonstration version of a near real time flood data modeling forecasting and inundation mapping system for the continental united states at high spatial resolutions maidment 2017 the nfie also used the nhdplus based on which the rapid routed runoffs the average nhdplus reach length for the routing is 2 km and average area of the reach catchments is 3 km2 the nfie provides high resolution streamflow information of 2 7 million nhdplus stream reaches used for real time flood inundation mapping this information in turn assists local emergency response communities with planning proper flood response actions the developments of such high spatial resolution streamflow models david et al 2011 lin et al 2018 maidment 2017 tavakoly et al 2017 are primarily attributed to advancements in geographic information system gis technologies moore and dewald 2016 gis based river networks are generally represented by two basic types of datasets raster and vector datasets tavakoly et al 2017 raster datasets define space as arrays of equally sized grid cells and vector datasets represent geographic features such as streams or lakes as points lines or polygons models using raster datasets to calculate river flow through the grid cells of river networks generally require running gis tools that create a digital elevation model dem without erroneous sinks flow directions resulting accumulated flows and the delineation of related catchments in sequence the model delineates catchments in relatively coarse resolution and associating geospatial datasets such as vector based stream gauge layers with common raster based river networks can lead to a loss of physical details because of their low resolutions tavakoly et al 2017 on the other hand vector based river networks built on topographic maps have been increasingly available at both continental and global scales in the form of gis datasets one example is the national hydrography dataset nhd a comprehensive gis geospatial dataset of vector based surface water features such as rivers and lakes in the contiguous united states at a medium resolution of 1 100 000 scale u s geological survey 2018 the nhd contains a flow direction network that traces the movement of water along channels either downstream or upstream in addition a reach addressing system in the nhd allows the vector layers such as gauging stations to easily link to specific geographic locations along river networks without compromising any physical details of the vector datasets moore and dewald 2016 the links also integrate multiple attributes related to the vector layers into a type of object oriented relational database that substantially facilitates the interaction between common and added data layers lehner and grill 2013 furthermore using vector based instead of raster based river networks in river routing can significantly lower the required computational costs after all for example the modeling with a large raster based lake feature composed of thousands of grid cells requires that each cell object be processed however the modeling with a vector based feature of the same lake requires that only a single object such as a polygon be treated lehner and grill 2013 another gis dataset nhdplus is an integrated suite of readily applicable gis geospatial datasets built upon combining vector information from the nhd and the watershed boundary dataset wbd with land surface elevation represented by the national elevation dataset ned mckay et al 2012 to reap the full benefit of the vector based gis geospatial dataset this paper presents a simple method of estimating streamflow at any location including ungauged sites or gauged sites with missing data based on the high resolution surface water data of the nhd as well as the usgs streamgage data this method however can be applied to only parts of rivers those in which hydrograph information at both the upstream and downstream ends is available furthermore the method is limited to a common period of record between the two hydrographs section 2 of the paper begins by explaining the assumptions and the theoretical background of the new streamflow estimation method and section 3 presents the selected drainage basin with various input data to the method section 4 discusses the results of the application and assesses the performance of the method and section 5 the limitations and uncertainties of the method finally section 6 summarizes and discusses future work 2 methods 2 1 model assumptions the proposed method assumes that linearly connecting the timings of upstream peak or bottom base flows to those of corresponding downstream flows leads to identifying tributary or water utility inflows that have eventually become the parts of streamflow at a given time for any location between the upstream and downstream to identify the timings of flows this paper defines bottom base flow as the smallest flow in a falling limb of a hydrograph and peak flow as the largest flow in a ring limb displayed in fig 1 in practice bottom base flow is identified at the time immediately after consecutive zero or negative slopes and immediately before a significant positive slope along the curve of a hydrograph the significance of positive slopes is measured by a proposed threshold parameter further explained in section 2 2 subsequently peak flow occurs as the largest flow between the two most adjacent bottom base flows in time such identified peak bottom base flow in an upstream hydrograph is paired with similarly identified peak bottom base flow from a downstream hydrograph based on temporal proximities between the same type of flows described in fig 1 of course the upstream peak flow always occurs before it appears in the downstream likewise bottom base flow occurs in the upstream before in the downstream the timings of the matched peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream are connected by linear functions over a time space domain shown in fig 2 the space axis represents the distance along a river channel measured from an upstream hydrograph station to any point downstream before a downstream hydrograph station as a result the average speeds of water movement between the two stations are derived from the slopes of the linear functions thus lateral inflows that enter a river channel at different locations and times travel along a channel with different but constant speeds throughout its journey finally this method estimates streamflow at a user selected time and site by adding up individual upstream tributary and water utility inflows that have arrived at a given site and time after traveling at their own guided speeds as river flow response is generally unsteady and non uniform the above assumptions intrinsically render the method limited in estimating actual streamflow for example the assumption of constant speeds only valid for one dimensional uniform and steady flow without any backwater effects caused by channel constrictions bridges dams and tributary inflows can lead to significant estimation errors in addition the method allows no loss of water during the travel of lateral inflows along a river channel however such loss in reality does occur for example through seepage in channel beds or banks or water retention on floodplains similarly although the method allows for no water gain during travel such gain in reality can take place for example via groundwater discharge however such limitations of the method can either positively or negatively impact the results depending on various factors including longitudinal and cross sectional channel geometries river bed and bank material types backwater effects at various confluences and connectivity between a channel and a floodplain their impact depends primarily on the extent of the individual influences of these factors another factor affecting the performance of the method is the accuracy of flow data from tributaries and water utilities one approach to alleviating these constraints is gauge based adjustment which applies the differences between the estimated and observed flows at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to estimated stream flows at tested sites using linear interpolations in space more details are provided in section 2 3 2 2 pairing peak or bottom base flows from upstream to downstream the proposed method consists of two sub methods one pairs upstream peak or bottom base flows with the same type of flows in the downstream and the other calculates time averaged streamflows at user selected sites and times by combining related lateral inflows occurred in the upstream lateral inflow includes tributary inflow or water withdrawn negative or returned positive from utilities that enters a river channel as an addition to upstream flow of a river in the first sub method bottom base flows from an upstream hydrograph are first paired with those from a downstream hydrograph based on the conditions that 1 an upstream bottom base flow always takes place before or at the same time as a downstream bottom base flow and 2 the pairing is a one to one relationship that prioritizes a match with the shortest temporal distance between upstream and downstream bottom base flows among possible matches under the same conditions an upstream peak flow within each time set of two bottom base flows in a row such as t i ub t i 1 ub in fig 1 is then paired with a downstream peak flow within a time set such as t i db t i 1 db of downstream bottom base flows that have been paired with their respective counterparts in the upstream when paired peak flows do not meet the first condition the method searches for the next largest flow primarily from the upstream hydrograph until it satisfies the condition note that despite the possibility of multiple peak flows between the timings of two consecutive bottom base flows the method seeks only a single peak flow ultimately the timings of these paired flows but not their flow values are used for retracing relevant lateral inflows for estimating streamflow by the second sub method which will be further explained in section 2 3 before the pairing takes place the first sub method scales down each usgs streamflow time series data at an upstream or downstream end of a river reach by dividing all the data by the largest amount of streamflow of each ever recorded so the transformed data sit on a scale of zero to unity this transformation is helpful in singling out flows to be paired bottom base flow in particular for the following two reasons one is that even though base flows theoretically occur in the smooth receding limbs of a hydrograph upticks along the receding curves usually take place causing difficulty for a computer to detect whether flow is truly declining the transformation easily converts the small increases into those that are sufficiently small and insignificant and whose values are defined and thus detected by installing a threshold parameter of a tiny positive decimal digit number as a result the small increases are easily filtered out preventing a computer from mistaking them for ones on any rising limbs the other reason is that hydrographs generally have different rates of rising or falling discharge in this case although a typical range of small positive changes of streamflow to one hydrograph can be treated as an insignificant increase such changes could be too large for another hydrograph therefore it is quite difficult to apply a single value of the threshold parameter to all hydrographs to consistently screen out any misleading positive upticks in their falling curves in summary the scale down treatment above tones down the impact of the raw positive rises it facilitates the detection of deceptive increases consistently across hydrographs under the same scale with a single value of the parameter in practice estimation of the value of the parameter starts with a large initial value such as 0 1 and incrementally reduces the value until a visual inspection of the paired flows confirms that the matching conditions are all met fig 1 conceptually shows a series of timings connected by dashed and dot dash lines for paired peak and paired bottom base flows between upstream and downstream hydrographs the small hump after the first upstream peak flow in the figure is apparently treated as an insignificant rise in the streamflow for the sake of simplicity distances from the upstream hydrograph station to lateral inflows i e confluences of tributaries or water utilities with a main river to streamgages or to sites of interest are calculated along river channels based on the nhd river network i e positive in the flow direction and negative in the opposite direction and are then divided by the total distance such calculated between the two hydrograph stations hence as described in fig 2 such a transformed distance at the upstream station takes a value of zero and at the downstream station a value of one in addition while transformed distances for lateral inflows located before the distance of zero take negative values of y w j those located after the distance of zero take positive values of y w j 2 3 estimating streamflow at user selected times and locations in the second sub method an average streamflow over the computational time step k k 1 at a given distance yon the transformed space is computed by 1 u k y 0 5 q k y q k 1 y i 1 1 δ t 1 q k i δ t y δ t 1 where δt is a time interval smaller than unity that divides the time step k k 1 into 1 δ t uniform subintervals the value of can take any value between 0 and 1 so the streamflow at any site on a river reach between the chosen upstream and downstream hydrograph stations can be estimated by this method q k i δ t y is the calculated discharge at distance and at time k i δ t for i 1 1 δ t 1 q k y is the discharge when i 0 and q k 1 y when i 1 δ t u k y is a time weighted sum of nonlinear functions q k i δ t y evaluated at uniformly divided partition points within the time span k k 1 the numerator is the value of area under function q t y on a close interval k k 1 approximated based on the trapezoid rule by adding up the areas of all trapezoids standing on their respective subintervals k i δ t k i 1 δ t for i 0 1 δ t 1 the denominator shows the combined temporal lengths of the subintervals in fig 2 q k i δ t y is computed by adding up the estimated discharges of upstream lateral inflows that meet with line f k i δ t y t and that entered a river channel at separate times before k i δ t but that all have eventually arrived at k i δ t and at y since the values of lateral inflows are approximated by linear interpolations from known values as described in eq 3 the values of q k i δ t y rapidly converge as δt decreases the process of selecting individual lateral inflows and estimating their values which eventually become part of q k i δ t y is explained as follows it begins by drawing a so called linear retrace function that identifies lateral inflows standing on the linear path of the function at their respective timings and locations for example lateral inflow w k i δ t y t y w j in fig 2 on the linear path of retrace function f k i δ t y t for the identified lateral inflows the retrace function retraces past times when the individual inflows were added to a main river at their confluences subsequently the traced times determine how much water the lateral inflows contributed to a river at their own entries based on eq 3 the added amounts are assumed not to change during their entire course of travel and they become part of q k i δ t y along their journeys since the retraced times typically do not coincide with data recorded times the values of the lateral inflows at such traced timings are subsequently estimated by interpolating the values of lateral inflows at recorded times immediately before and immediately after the traced timings the values at the recorded times here can be amounts that are either measured or estimated by other means this second sub method implements three steps for computing the values of lateral inflows at the traced timings above as the first step the sub method formulates linear retrace functions first as in the following example for any given k i δ t and y in fig 2 it builds retrace function f k i δ t y t by a slope interpolated between slopes m s and m s 1 of two linear lines on both sides of the function and data point k i δ t y the condition of selecting the two linear lines is that they connect the timings of the paired peak and the paired bottom base flows labeled by t i up t i dp and t i ub t i db as in fig 2 while passing location y either immediately before or immediately after k i δ t in fig 3 t i 1 y and t i 2 y represent the times immediately before and after k i δ t respectively the slope of the retrace function is then computed by 2 m k i δ t y t i 2 y k i δ t t i 2 y t i 1 y m s k i δ t t i 1 y t i 2 y t i 1 y m s 1 eq 2 means the resulting slope is a linearly weighted average between slopes m s and m s 1 with weights being inversely proportional to the respective temporal distances of the two lines to k i δ t at y fig 2 shows that as i increases k i δ t could become k l δ t whose retrace function no longer depends on the two slopes m s and m s 1 but needs to move on to a new couple e g m s 1 and m s 2 to build a new function f k l δ t y t the value of m k i δ t y physically represents a constant speed of lateral inflows that are all identified by the linear path of f k i δ t y t at their confluence points in the upstream of at this speed the identified lateral flows are expected to arrive at k i δ t and even though their travel times differ because they entered a river at different times after building the linear retrace function in the first step the sub method retraces the timings when the identified lateral inflows entered as the second step and then estimates the added amounts at the confluence points as the third step shown in the following example when the retrace function from the first step identifies a lateral inflow w k i δ t y t y w j at its confluence of distance y w j and at some time before k i δ t then the timing is retraced by the inverse of f k i δ t y t with a value of y w j denoted by t k i δ t y y w j in fig 3 since the timing usually falls within a time step of the flow record seemingly between k 1 and k in this example the third step estimates the value of w k i δ t y t y w j with t t k i δ t y y w j by interpolating two known data recorded immediately before and immediately after the traced timing for the interpolation as described in fig 4 it uses the values of the lateral inflow records w j k p w j and w j k p 1 w j at their recorded times k p w j and k p 1 w j in the equation below with t t k i δ t y y w j 3 w k i δ t y t y w j k p 1 w j t w j k p w j t k p w j w j k p 1 w j eq 3 also shows that the temporal distances from the recorded times to the timings identified by the retrace function affect the value of w k i δ t y t y w j in an inversely proportional way this value becomes a part of the amount of q k i δ t y in eq 1 after it has traveled along a river channel from time t k i δ t y y w j to k i δ t the sub method applies the three steps to every lateral inflow met on the linear path of the retrace function in order to compute their added values to a river which are eventually carried over into the value of q k i δ t y after the three steps are complete the value of streamflow at k i δ t and is computed by 4 q k i δ t y j n tr j m n tr j w k i δ t y t t k i δ t y y w j y w j where n tr j m is the number of lateral inflows in the upstream of of zero and n tr j is the number of lateral inflows from of zero to downstream immediately before instead of using lateral inflows upstream of of zero the sub method could use only one discharge value on the upstream hydrograph picked at the time when the retrace function passes through with of zero hence instead it would add the discharge value to the right hand side of eq 4 and take the value of n tr j m zero however as the single discharge value is primarily limited to reflect all individual impacts of the lateral inflows taking the lateral inflows over the single discharge from the upstream hydrograph generally leads to a more accurate prediction of u k y if the length of a river above of zero however were much longer or if any hydrologic feature of the portion of a river significantly differed from the remaining portion the sub method would have to use the upstream hydrograph because applying the retrace function too far beyond its own boundary would simply invite the intrinsic curse of extrapolation the results of eq 4 for different i s are fed into the right hand side of eq 1 to produce the value of u k y up to this point the upstream and downstream hydrographs are used only to guide the slope of f k i δ t y t now the sub method takes the differences between the estimated and measured streamflows at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to further improve the estimate of streamflow of user selected sites between the stations l y 0 k and l y 1 k are the known estimation errors at the upstream and the downstream stations respectively and are calculated by 5 l y 0 k q u k u k y 0 l y 1 k q d k u k y 1 where q u k and q d k are the upstream and downstream discharges measured at time k respectively and u k y 0 and u k y 1 are the respective counterparts estimated by eq 1 with of zero and one next the error in estimating streamflow at k and l k y is approximated using retrace function f k y t which in this case linearly traces the timings of presumably the most related estimation errors at both the upstream and downstream stations to l k y the traced timing of the upstream is labeled t k y y 0 and that of the downstream t k y y 1 t k i δ t y y w j in fig 4 changes to these timings when y w j becomes of zero or one and when f k i δ t y t becomes f k y t similar to eq 3 when t k y y 0 falls between streamflow measured times k p 0 and k p 1 0 the corresponding estimation error is linearly interpolated in time in an inversely proportional way 6 l k y t y 0 k p 1 0 t l y 0 k p 0 t k p 0 l y 0 k p 1 0 where t takes the value of t k y y 0 in this case the superscript 0 in k p 0 indicates the streamflow of the upstream hydrograph when t k y y 1 falls between k p 1 and k p 1 1 the related estimation error at the downstream station l k y t y 1 is also estimated by eq 6 after all zeros of are replaced by ones and the superscript of k p 0 or k p 1 0 is replaced by superscript 1 using these calculated estimation errors the value of l k y is then spatially interpolated by 7 l k y y l k y t k y y 1 y 1 1 y l k y t k y y 0 y 0 the estimation error occurring spatially close to y has more influence on l k y than the error occurring farther away from it finally l k y is added to the computed values of u k y in eq 8 producing improved values 8 u k y u k y l k y it is worthwhile noting that l k y based solely on f k y t does not represent an average value over time step k k 1 as u k y in eq 1 does after all to ensure that the value of u k y with being 0 or 1 is equal to that of q u k or q d k respectively l k y must be equal to l y 0 k when is 0 or l y 1 k when y is 1 it is only possible when i is zero for f k i δ t y t fig 5 presents a concise summary of the entire procedure of the two sub methods 2 4 model evaluation guidelines to assess the method by how close its results are to measured streamflows this paper proposes using a combination of graphical techniques and four evaluation statistics it also implements a descriptive performance rating that has been used by other studies including moriasi et al 2007 for evaluating several streamflow estimation models including swat the soil and water assessment tool and hspf hydrological simulation program fortran graphical techniques include the hydrographs of estimated and measured streamflows as well as graphs showing the estimation errors in timing peak flow the four evaluation statistics are 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 2 the nse using log transformed flows oudin et al 2006 3 the root mean square error rmse observation standard deviation ratio rsr moriasi et al 2007 and 4 the percent bias pbias all of these evaluation methods are recommended by moriasi et al 2007 for their merit of the four nse is the best statistic for evaluating the overall fit of a hydrograph servat and dezetter 1991 and it focuses more on high extreme flows nse is given as 9 nse 1 i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q mean 2 where q i obs and q i sim are the i th observed and simulated streamflows respectively q mean is the mean of the observed streamflow and n is the total number of observations on the other hand nse computed with log transformed streamflows shifts the focus more on the performance of low flow than high flow oudin et al 2006 nse ranges from to 1 0 with 1 0 being a perfect match of model estimates to measured data and with 0 0 indicating that model estimates are as accurate as the mean of the measured data rmse is a commonly used error index statistics method singh et al 2004 and the rsr is calculated as the ratio of rmse to the standard deviation of the measured data moriasi et al 2007 10 rsr i 1 n q i obs q i sim 2 i 1 n q i obs q mean 2 since rmse represents the sample standard deviation of the differences between estimated unbiased and measured values rsr is also the ratio of the sample standard deviation of the residuals i e the difference to the sample standard deviation of the measured values as the lower value of rsr represents the lower rmse it results in more accurate model performance pbias shows the average tendency of simulated values to be either larger or smaller than their observed counterparts gupta et al 1999 the lower value of pbias indicates more accurate simulation with 0 0 being the perfect value while its positive values point to underestimation bias its negative values indicate overestimation bias the equation is given by 11 pbias i 1 n q i obs q i sim 100 i 1 n q i obs lastly table 1 lists the descriptive meanings of individual numeric ranges of the selected evaluation statistics for estimates of monthly time steps generally less strict implementation of the descriptive performance rating is warranted for estimates of daily time steps moriasi et al 2007 3 data 3 1 selected drainage basin and usgs streamflow gauges this study selected a drainage basin of 613 square miles through which the etowah river runs located in northwestern georgia the main reasons for choosing this basin are that 1 a selected 54 mile stretch of the etowah river contains five usgs streamgage stations each with different periods of record but a well overlapped period between the farthest upstream and farthest downstream stations listed in table 2 2 the stations at the two ends therefore provide the hydrographs for paring peak or bottom base flows and the remaining three stations either with or without missing data provide records whose estimated flows at their sites can be compared 3 well maintained usage data from various types of water utilities are available across the state of georgia including this basin and 4 an additional usgs streamgage with minimum human impact is available at a sub basin in the upper region of the river basin in the study thus the gauge can be used as a reference gauge for estimating the inflow amounts from other tributaries based on their respective drainage area ratios although more sophisticated rainfall runoff models could be implemented for a closer estimation of sub basin runoffs and thus tributary inflows the drainage area ratio method is more commonly used because of its simplicity and acceptable reliability emerson et al 2005 therefore this study not only shows the compatibility of the drainage area ratio method with the streamflow estimation method of this paper but also leaves the door open for further improvement of this method by adopting rainfall runoff models that represent elaborate hydrologic features and the impact of local weather and terrestrial characteristics in greater detail 3 2 national hydrography dataset nhd as shown in fig 6 this study examined a 54 mile stretch of the etowah river from ga136 to canton on the map and computed the streamflow at the sites of the five streamgages the proposed method can be used for any other sites of interest along the stretch but the selected sites provide measured values that can be compared in practice the site is equal to any point on the vector based river reaches of the nhd the study used the recorded hydrographs at ga136 and canton for constructing retrace functions and thus estimating streamflows within the stretch and set the usgs amicalola creek streamgage marked by the black pushpin as a reference gauge based on which inflows of all tributary networks in the studied river basin were estimated by multiplying its streamflow per unit area by the drainage area of each tributary network in this study a tributary network refers to a group of connected tributaries that work as one to drain its surrounding sub basins into a shared outlet along the etowah river at each point where a tributary network joins the river from the headwater upstream above ga136 to canton the study used the drainage area ratio method to estimate the amount of the lateral inflow if any water utilities have used water from any tributary network their water usage data were added to the inflow estimates of the network when the utilities have used water directly from the river however the study considered the water usage data separately at their own entry points along the river a series of tributary networks and water utilities were identified by applying the arcmap utility network analyst toolbar with its function of trace upstream to the nhd stream networks using the usgs streamstats u s geological survey 2012 the drainage area of each tributary network was then computed the river stretch in this study has 75 tributary networks 25 of which are located above ga136 and the rest below fig 7 depicts drainage area and the river distance that is the distance measured along a river channel of every network as well as the usgs stations an arcmap statistics tool measured the river distance using the values of lengthkm attributed to related nhd stream reaches lengthkm measures the length of each reach of the nhdflowline in kilometers both the arcmap utility network analyst toolbar and the arcmap statistics tool involve the simple tasks of tracing the functioning geometric networks of the nhdflowline or simply adding up associated lengthkms and they run only a single time before the method begins to run thus the numerical cost of running these tools even for larger basins should be insignificant 3 3 time period of the study among the available periods of record of the six usgs gauges and water utilities a common period beginning on november 1 2007 and ending on december 30 2014 was selected this study delivered the estimation of daily discharges at the sites of ga136 through canton which were then compared with their measured counterparts even though the estimation at both ga136 and canton became perfect after accounting for the errors from eq 8 note that the study used measured data at only ga136 and canton to calibrate the method and left untouched the data from the remaining stations until it used them to assess the model performance over each available period of record at the stations 4 results 4 1 results of the first sub method fig 8 illustrates three series of paired peak and paired bottom base flows resulting from running the first sub method with the threshold parameter of 0 005 found after several trials with incremental decreases from initially 0 1 each trial was followed by a visual inspection of the paired flows primarily to check if the matching conditions in the sub method were met as shown in fig 8 the identified upstream flows always took place before or at the same time as their downstream counterparts and the one to one relationships in the pairing were thoroughly maintained furthermore the single largest flow was chosen over a window between the timings of two consecutive bottom base flows even if multiple peaks existed 4 2 results of the second sub method 4 2 1 before gauge based adjustment across tested sites first of all to determine the proper size of δt for the second sub method the value of δt was iteratively decreased by a factor of 2 with an initial value of 0 5 as a result the rmses between the estimated canton streamflows of the current iteration and the previous iteration were 16 71 3 33 0 86 0 25 0 07 and 0 03 as the iteration proceeded seven times because of the rapid convergence toward the end of the iteration this study chose a value of 0 01 for δt as demonstrated in fig 9 estimated streamflows across the stations matched their measured counterparts overall even before accounting for the estimation errors of the ga136 and canton stations to be redistributed to the entire stations along the river this claim is statistically supported by the nse values ranging from 0 58 to 0 88 in the second row of table 3 these values fall within satisfactory good and very good performance ratings according to table 1 even with the daily computational time steps while nse is more susceptible to errors in high flow nse with log transformed flows is more susceptible to errors in low flow the values of nse with log transformed flows ranging from 0 75 to 0 93 in table 3 clearly shows that the method more closely estimated low flow than high flow in addition the negative values of pbias across the stations indicate that the method tends to overestimate rather than underestimate the rsr values ranging from 0 34 to 0 65 demonstrate that the spread of the estimated streamflows from the measured streamflows is about 34 65 of the corresponding standard deviations of their respective measured values as is evident across the values of all the statistics in the second row of table 3 the performance of the method generally deteriorates as the applied location moves downstream two explanations are posited for this finding one is the simple assumptions of the method including constant speeds of lateral inflows and the inability to account for the loss or the gain of lateral inflow in travel along a river channel and the other is its use of a single reference streamgage for estimating the daily lateral inflow of every tributary network in the studied river basin archfield and vogel 2010 found that a reference streamgage selected based on a correlation between daily streamflow time series rather than the distance between sites leads to significantly more accurate estimates of daily streamflow at ungauged sites hence after taking the logarithms of daily streamflows of all the stations to further linearize the relationships between pairs of streamgages this study computed the pearson product moment correlation coefficient r between the streamgage on amicalola creek and the streamgages of the stations in the etowah river the results were 0 98 0 97 0 98 0 96 and 0 96 for the pairs of amicalola creek with either ga136 ga9 kelly bridge i575 or canton respectively although the correlation values decrease almost negligibly toward the downstream such a finding could nevertheless evoke the use of another reference streamgage for estimating the inflows of tributary networks near the i575 and canton stations furthermore smakhtin 1999 recommended using several nearby reference streamgages rather than single one to more accurately identify the timing of streamflow at ungauged sites evidently the gray dots in fig 11 show that while the timings of peak flow estimated at stations both closer to and more correlated with the reference streamgage more closely match the measured timings those estimated at the i575 and canton stations both of which are farther from and less correlated to the reference gauge are almost a day earlier than the measured timings if the timings of the tributary inflows had been gradually delayed as they moved downstream the estimated timings of peak flows would have been more accurate particularly at the downstream stations therefore the underperforming statistics downstream can be enhanced by either integrating other nearby reference gauges or running sophisticated rainfall runoff models in this study however the former was not possible because there were no nearby reference gauges and the latter is beyond the scope of this study future work could investigate these approaches 4 2 2 after gauge based adjustment across tested sites after the gauge based adjustments were redistributed by eqs 5 8 the performance ratings of all of the statistics across the stations except for pbias at the kelly bridge u2 were very good shown in the last row of table 3 if more measured data had been available the pbias value for the station may also have rated very good one positive aspect of the results for this station however is that the reconstructed streamflows over such a long missing period six out of seven years could fill the missing gap based on both the good to very good ratings across the statistics and the comparable hydrographs in fig 10 at the station over the period of record the last one year measured data over a longer period would further support this claim as the exact differences between the measured and estimated streamflows are known the adjusted streamflows at both the ga136 and canton stations are obviously identical to their measured counterparts nevertheless it is important to note that the gauge based adjustment enhanced all the statistics significantly of the stations between the two locations except for the aforementioned kelly bridge u2 where a slight overestimation led to a significant underestimation according to the pbias values and ga9 u1 where the nse of the log transformed flows dropped by 0 05 one interpretation of these results is that the method of approximating estimation errors at any given time and location using eqs 5 7 cannot appease different flow regimes such as low and high flows at the same time the increased nse values throughout the stations indicate that the adjustment enhanced the estimation of their high flows the mixed results of the nse of the log transformed data however suggest that it did not improve the estimation of their low flows to the same extent indeed the results of another evaluation measure the timing of peak flow show that the method worked well particularly for high flows as shown in fig 11 the timings of estimated peak flows at the middle stations i e ga9 kelly bridge and i575 after the adjustment mostly shifted a day later than those before the adjustment aligning with the timings of the measured counterparts if the streamflow estimation before the gauge based adjustment had not such deteriorated into the downstream but instead had remained at a same level of accuracy from upstream to downstream eqs 5 7 might have generated the values of estimation error l k y comparable across the stations which in turn would have led to a steady improvement of streamflow estimation throughout the stations by not favoring one location over the others or one flow regime over another after all the equations are based on the assumption that estimation errors along the linear path of f k y t to the downstream linearly increase or decrease that is abrupt changes of the estimation errors along the path never occur as displayed in table 3 however errors in estimating streamflow increase overall from ga136 to ga9 decrease from ga9 to kelly bridge increase from kelly bridge to i575 and finally decrease again from i575 to canton this nonlinear pattern undermines the effectiveness of the method of approximating l k y that to the contrary depends on linear patterns therefore as argued in section 4 2 1 the expanded use of nearby or more strongly correlated reference gauges or advanced rainfall runoff models would further improve the performance of the method 5 discussion because of the hydrograph data required at both the upstream and downstream ends of river reaches the computational time step of the method is tied to that of the hydrographs and its computation is limited to an overlapping period between the two hydrographs this limitation indicates that the method can be used only for hindcasting not forecasting furthermore the ability of the model to describe natural river flows is limited primarily by the assumption of a constant speed of any lateral inflow during its movement throughout a river channel this constant speed is made valid only for uniform and steady flow but the natural response of rivers is generally non uniform and unsteady therefore under the current assumption errors in estimating streamflow would be significant especially under hydraulic or hydrologic conditions that change drastically between the upstream and downstream ends such conditions include the channel slope the width material types confluence characteristics and connectivity between a channel and a floodplain another such condition is the local weather local heavy rainfall for example could result in flash floods concentrated at local sites in the middle of a river reach of interest which in turn might cause significant backwater at related confluences in addition human controls such as channel constrictions bridges and dams could rapidly change flow regimes the method assumes that lateral inflow changes linearly as time changes within a time step of the flow record as shown in eq 3 which is generally not true particularly when the time step is considerably long e g a day or a week or when rainfall runoff responses of catchments are volatile therefore this assumption can result in an additional error in estimating streamflow the error however could be minimized if lateral inflow records at smaller temporal scales e g by hour or minute were available and used for the linear interpolations of eq 3 at much finer time intervals of course it would in turn require a more thorough search for the proper value of δt as the values of q k i δ t y become more sensitive to the change of δt this study showed that the method is capable of reconstructing reliable streamflow even during significantly long periods of missing data previous studies have devoted efforts to filling in lengthy missing river data yang et al 2010 stressed the need for longer periods of measured data for better reconstructing missing discharge values with regression methods to reconstruct missing daily streamflow data tencaliec et al 2015 applied a combination of linear regression models that deduce linear relationships between target and control gauges and autoregressive integrated moving average models arima naill and momani 2009 that adjust the residuals from the regression models the combined approach however entails an iteration process that involves choosing the most suitable orders and number of lags of related functions and models tencaliec et al 2015 also acknowledged that the choice of a model strongly depends on the location of a target station so it is impossible to have a general form of a model across all target stations calibrating the model of this paper however requires no optimization significantly reducing the computational cost note that this study has applied the method to an extremely small basin so it does not explicitly demonstrate its potential use on significantly large basins without overwhelming numerical costs this simple streamflow estimation method fills in missing values not based on any statistical or optimization procedure that generally entails lengthy periods of record as demonstrated in the above mentioned studies but instead based on the easily available nhd information of tributaries and rivers and the most timely relevant instantaneous data therefore for reconstructing missing data the method is not limited to the available length of measured data 6 conclusion this paper proposed a high spatial resolution streamflow estimation method using the nhd river networks and usgs streamflow data the method can be applied to any point including ungauged sites on the river reaches of the nhd as long as relevant hydrograph data at both the upstream and downstream ends of the river reaches are available and hydrological or channel conditions do not change significantly within the reaches it can also reconstruct missing streamflow data even in the significant lengths of missing data periods the computational time steps of the method coincide with those of recorded hydrograph data an overlapping time period between upstream and downstream hydrographs becomes a simulation period for the method the method first identifies peak or bottom base flows from both upstream and downstream hydrographs and pairs the same type of flows between upstream and downstream hydrographs according to the conditions that 1 an upstream flow always occurs before or at the same time as a downstream counterpart and 2 the pairing is a one to one relationship that prefers a match with the shortest temporal distance between upstream and downstream flows over other matches secondly the method uses the timings of the paired flows to construct linear retrace functions that identify which upstream lateral inflows have eventually become part of the streamflow at a user selected site downstream at a specific time lastly it uses estimation errors at both the upstream and downstream hydrograph stations to adjust streamflow estimates of test sites located between the two hydrograph stations by redistributing the errors to each test site based on linear interpolations in space the method assumes that the speeds of lateral inflows along a river channel are constant and that no loss or gain of the inflows during travel occurs applying the method to the small river basin in the state of georgia this study estimated daily streamflow at the five sites of usgs streamgage stations within the selected river reaches where measured streamflows either with or without missing data were available the results of the application of the four evaluation statistics before the gauge based adjustment exhibited a good overall rating across the stations results after the adjustment showed further improvements with very good ratings for almost all of the statistics across the stations in addition they also demonstrated that the method is capable of reconstructing credible streamflow over missing data periods despite their significant lengths the overall very good rating of the evaluation statistics over the period of record affirmed the quality of the reconstruction assessing and comparing rates of improvement to the statistics at each site both before and after the gauge based adjustment revealed that using several nearby reference streamgages instead of a single one or using advanced rainfall runoff models that more accurately estimate lateral inflow would result in evenly enhanced evaluation statistics for all of the stations in summary this simple method can run at any point within the nhd river reaches as long as they have available hydrographs at both the upper and lower ends with common periods of record equally important is that hydrological physiographical or channel features within the reaches must not abruptly change otherwise the method is simply unusable the proposed method runs basically for hindcasting not for forecasting in forecasting it computes the changes of predicted or measured upstream inflows as they move through a river channel a future study based on a paper by kim and georgakakos 2014 will demonstrate a river routing method that uses the results of this paper as its initial values and then devise a method of routing upstream flows to downstream points without the help of downstream hydrograph data funding this research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public commercial or not for profit sectors
